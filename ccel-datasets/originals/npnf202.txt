   Prefatory Note.

   ------------------------

   The basis of the present edition of Socrates' Ecclesiastical History is
   the translation in Bagster's series mentioned in the Introduction, Part
   IV. The changes introduced, however, are numerous. The translation was
   found unnecessarily free; so far as the needs of the English idiom
   require freedom no fault could, of course, have been found with the
   translation; but the divergences from the original in multitudes of
   cases were not warranted by any such need; they were more probably
   induced by the prevailing style of rhetoric common in the days when the
   translation was made. The change which has gradually come about in this
   respect called for modifications in the present edition. Many more
   might have been introduced without damage to the work. But it was felt
   that the scope and purpose of the edition only called for the most
   necessary of these changes.

   In the preparation of the notes the editions of Hussey and Reading,
   containing Valesius' and Reading's annotations, were freely used.
   Whenever a note was taken bodily from these, it has been quoted and
   duly credited. It was thought best, however, usually to condense and
   reduce the number and bulk of these notes and introduce sparingly such
   new notes as were suggested by more recent study in ecclesiastical
   history.

   The Introduction is almost altogether dependent on the literature
   quoted in Part I. The writer claims no original discovery respecting
   Socrates or his work. The facts had been diligently collected by his
   predecessors; he has simply rearranged them and put them into
   expression such as, to his mind, suits the requirements of the plan of
   the series.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] All works marked with a star in Chevalier's list were used in the
   present edition, and all but two or three of those added to the list of
   Chevalier.

   [2] Nolte's article is on the textual emendations needed in the edition
   of Socrates. The text of our historian has not been as thoroughly and
   completely examined and corrected as other writings. Valesius' edition
   (Hussey) gives an account of a few mss. examined by himself; nothing
   further has been done of any importance. It is to be hoped that
   Gebhardt and Harnack may find it convenient to incorporate a new
   collation and revision in their Texte und Untersuchungen.

   [3] All works marked with a star in Chevalier's list were used in the
   present edition, and all but two or three of those added to the list of
   Chevalier.

   [4] E. Walford, A.M., appears as the translator of Sozomen, not of
   Socrates. See IV. of Introduction, note 6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   II. Life of Socrates.

   We cannot but regret the fact that the age in which Socrates lived
   cared little, if at all, about recording the lives of its literary men.
   The only sources of information in this respect are the writings
   themselves of these literary men and the public records, in case they
   held the double character of literary men and political or
   ecclesiastical officials. As Socrates did not participate in the public
   affairs of his day, our information respecting him is confined to the
   scanty and incidental items we may gather from his history. As he was
   not very fond of speaking of himself, these data are few and often of
   doubtful significance. In fact, the reconstruction of his biography
   from these scattered items is a matter of difficult critical
   investigation.

   All that these inadequate materials yield of his biography may be
   summed up as follows:

   He was born in Constantinople. [5] He nowhere mentions his parents or
   ancestry, and no information has reached us on this point from any
   other source. The year of his birth is inferred from what he says of
   his education at the hands of the grammarians Helladius and Ammonias.
   [6] These grammarians were originally Egyptian priests living in
   Alexandria--the former of Jupiter, and the latter of Pithecus (Simius);
   they fled from their native city in consequence of the disturbances
   which followed the cleansing of the Mithreum and destruction of the
   Serapeum by the bishop Theophilus. It appears that at that time an open
   conflict took place between the pagans and Christians, and many of the
   pagans having taken part in the tumult, laid themselves open to
   criminal prosecution, and to avoid this, took refuge in other
   cities,--a large number of them naturally in Constantinople.
   TheChronicon of Marcellinus puts this event in the consulship of
   Timasius and Promotus, i.e. 389 a.d. Now, as Socrates was very young
   [7] when he came to these grammarians, and it was the custom to send
   children to the schools at the age of ten, Valesius has reasoned that
   Socrates must have been born in 379; others have named 380 [8] as a
   more probable date for this event. Other data for ascertaining the
   exact date of Socrates' birth are of very doubtful significance. He
   speaks, for instance, of Auxanon, [9] a Novatian presbyter, from whom
   he had received certain information; but as Auxanon lived till after
   the accession of Theodosius the Younger in 408 a.d., it is impossible
   to draw any conclusion from this fact. So again Socrates mentions the
   patriarchate of Chrysostom in Constantinople (398-403) as if he had
   received his information at second hand, [10] and thus implies that he
   was perhaps too young to be an interested eye-witness of the events of
   that period. But how young he was we cannot infer from this fact; and
   so cannot take the patriarchate of Chrysostom as a starting-point for
   our chronology of Socrates' life. Still another item that might have
   served as a datum in the case, had it been definitely associated with a
   known event in Socrates' career, is his mention of a dispute between
   the Eunomians and Macedonians which took place in Constantinople in
   394. [11] If he were an eye-witness of this quarrel, he must have been
   old enough to take an interest in it, hence about fourteen or fifteen
   years of age. But this conclusion, even though it coincides exactly
   with the date found previously (379), is not at all certain, as he does
   not state that he was an eye-witness; and if the reasoning is correct,
   then he was not too young to be interested in the events of
   Chrysostom's patriarchate which occurred a little later. Thus, on the
   whole, while it is extremely probable that Valesius is right in setting
   the date of Socrates' birth in 379, this event may have taken place
   several years later.

   Nothing further is known of Socrates' early life and education except
   that he studied under Ammonius and Helladius, as already noted.
   Valesius has conjectured from the mention of Troïlus, the famous
   rhetorician, [12] that Socrates must have received instruction from
   this teacher also, but with no sufficient foundation. [13]

   Socrates always remained a resident of Constantinople, and was
   evidently proud of his native city, and fond of alluding to its history
   as well as its actual condition. He relates how the Emperor Constantine
   enlarged it and gave it its present name in place of the former heathen
   name it bore (Byzantium). [14] He speaks of its populousness, and at
   the same time of its ability to support its many inhabitants from its
   abundant resources. [15] He looks on its public structures very much as
   the ancient Israelite did on the towers and battlements' of Jerusalem.
   He mentions especially the walls built by Theodosius the Younger, the
   Forums of Constantine and Theodosius, the Amphitheatre, the Hippodrome
   with its Delphic tripods, the baths, especially that called Zeuxippus,
   [16] the churches of which he names at different times as many as five;
   viz.: the church of the Apostles, erected by Constantine especially for
   the burying of the emperors and priests; [17] the church of St. Sophia,
   which he calls the great church'; the church of St. Irene, [18] located
   in the same enclosure as that of St. Sophia; the church of St. Acacius,
   together with its appendages; [19] and the chapel of St. John, built
   seven miles outside the city. [20] Besides these he also mentions
   circumstantially the porch and shambles and porphyry column near which
   Arius was attacked with his sudden and fatal illness, [21] the region
   called Sycæ, and the tomb of Alexander the Paphlagonian, who was
   tortured and died in prison during the temporary supremacy of the
   Arians. [22]

   Although there is no distinct mention of his ever having left the great
   city, [23] it is improbable that, like his great Athenian namesake, he
   was averse to traveling. In fact, his frequent mention of the customs
   of Paphlagonians, Thessalians, Cyprians, and others with minuteness of
   detail, rather gives the impression that he had visited these places.

   According to the preponderance of evidence Socrates was trained as a
   pleader or advocate, and practiced this profession for a time. Hence
   his cognomen of Scholasticus. [24] At the instance of a certain
   Theodorus he undertook to write a continuation of the Ecclesiastical
   History of Eusebius, bringing it down to the seventeenth consulate of
   the Emperor Theodosius the Younger (439 a.d.). [25]

   This year is the last definitely mentioned in his work. He must have
   lived, however, until some time after that date, as he speaks of a
   revision of the first two books of the History. [26] How much later it
   is impossible to tell: it was not certainly till after the end of
   Theodosius' reign; for then he would have brought down his history to
   that event, and thus completed his seventh book according to the plan,
   which is evident in his whole work, of assigning one complete book to
   each one of the emperors comprised in his period.

   Of the character of Socrates as a man we know as little as of the
   events of his life. Evidently he was a lover of peace, as he constantly
   speaks with abhorrence of the atrocities of war, and deprecates even
   differences in theological standpoint on account of the strife and
   ill-feeling which they engender.

   Socrates' knowledge of Latin has been inferred from his use of Rufinus,
   [27] but Dodwell [28] conjectures that Socrates read Rufinus in a Greek
   translation, and that such translation had been made by Gelasius.

   Inasmuch as he lived in, and wrote of, an age of controversies, and his
   testimony must be weighed according to his theological standpoint, this
   standpoint has been made the subject of careful study. There is no
   doubt left by his explicit declarations about his agreement in the main
   with the position of the orthodox or catholic church of his age, as far
   as these are distinguished from those of Arians, Macedonians,
   Eunomians, and other heretics. But as to his attitude towards
   Novatianism there has been considerable difference of opinion. That he
   was a member of the Novatian sect has been held after Nicephorus
   Callisti [29] by Baronius, Labbæus, and others, and argued from various
   considerations drawn from his work. Some of these are: that he gives
   the succession of the Novatian bishops of Constantinople; [30] that he
   knows and mentions Novatian bishops of other places, e.g. of Rome, [31]
   of Scythia, [32] of Nicæa; [33] that he mentions Novatian churches as
   existing in Phrygia and Paphlagonia, [34] in Lydia, [35] in Cyzicum,
   [36] in Nicæa, [37] in Nicomedia and Cotyæum, [38] and in Alexandria;
   [39] that he knows and describes their church edifices; [40] that he
   knows their internal troubles and trials, [41] especially their
   position on the Paschal controversy; [42] that he gives vent to
   expressions of a sympathetic nature with the rigor practiced by the
   Novatian church; [43] that he records the criticisms of Novatians on
   Chrysostom and the opinion that his deposition was a just retribution
   for his persecution of the Novatians; [44] that he attributes miracles
   to Paul, Novatian bishop of Constantinople, [45] takes the testimony of
   Novatian witnesses, [46] rejects current charges against them, [47] and
   finally speaks of the death of Novatian as a martyrdom. [48]

   On the other hand, Valesius, followed by most of the more recent
   writers on Socrates, claims that all these facts are due to the extreme
   impartiality of the historian, his sense of the justice due to a sect
   whose good he appreciated, together with his lack of interest in the
   differences between their standpoint and that of the Catholics.
   Socrates treats other heretical sects with the same generous
   consideration, e.g. the Arian Goths, whose death he records as a
   martyrdom; [49] and yet he has never been suspected of inclining
   towards Arianism. At the same time he mentions the Novatians as
   distinct from the Catholic Church, [50] and everywhere implies that the
   Church for him is the latter.

   To account for the apparently different conclusions to which these two
   series of considerations point, some have assumed that Socrates had
   been a Novatian, but before the writing of his history had either
   gradually drifted into the Catholic Church, or for reasons of prudence
   had severed his connection with the lesser body and entered the state
   church, retaining, however, throughout his whole course a strong
   sympathy for the communion of his earlier days. [51] Others attribute
   his favorable attitude towards Novatianism to his general indifference
   for theological refinements, others to mere intellectual sympathy for
   their tenets. In the absence of any definite utterance of his own on
   the subject, a combination of the last two motives comes nearest to
   sufficiently explaining the position of Socrates, although his rather
   unappreciative estimate of Chrysostom [52] and his severe censure of
   Cyril of Alexandria [53] are both more easily accounted for on the
   ground of a more intimate relation between the historian and the
   Novatians, as both of the above-named eminent men were declared enemies
   of Novatianism.

   In other respects it cannot be doubted that the creed of Socrates was
   very simple and primitive. The one essential article in it was the
   doctrine of the Trinity; all others were subordinate. Even as to the
   Trinity, he would have accepted a much less rigid definition than the
   one propounded at Nicæa. As, however, the latter had been generally
   adopted by the church, he finds himself defending it against Arianism
   as well as against all sorts of compromise. He believed in the
   inspiration of the great synods as well as in that of the Scriptures,
   and was satisfied to receive without questioning the decisions of the
   former as he did the teachings of the latter. He was not, however,
   particular about the logical consequences of his theological positions,
   but ready to break off upon sufficient extra-theological reasons. His
   warm defense of Origen and arraignment of Methodius, Eustathius,
   Apollinaris, and Theophilus, [54] for attempting to belittle the great
   Alexandrian, shows how his admiration of a genius came into and
   modified his estimates. He considered all disputes on dogmatic
   statements as unnecessary and injurious, due to misunderstanding; and
   this chiefly because the parties in the dispute did not take pains to
   understand one another, and perhaps did not desire to do so because of
   personal jealousies or previous and private hatreds. [55] He is willing
   to refer such lawful questions on doctrinal points as may come before
   him to the clergy for decision, and is never backward about confessing
   his ignorance and incompetency to deal with theological refinements.

   He makes a cogent defense of the use of pagan writings by Christians,
   [56] alleging that some of the pagan writers were not far from the
   knowledge of the true God; that Paul himself had read and used their
   works; that the neglect or refusal to use them could only lead to
   ignorance and inability to meet pagans in debate; that St. Paul's prove
   all things, hold fast that which is good,' [57] and Jesus Christ's be
   ye approved bankers' [58] gave distinct support to the study of the
   whole field of knowledge; and that whatever is worth studying in
   non-Christian literature is capable of being separated from the rest
   and known as the truth. Socrates himself was acquainted more or less
   extensively with the works of Sophocles, Euripides, Plato, Xenophon,
   from among the classic writers, besides those of Porphyry, Libanius,
   Julian, and Themistius of a later period, and perhaps with those of
   many others.

   One more characteristic of Socrates must be mentioned; viz., his
   respect for the church and its institutions. He had a high regard for
   clergymen in virtue of their ordination. And although, as already
   shown, he took occasion to express himself critically of the highest
   dignitaries, such as Chrysostom and Cyril of Alexandria, yet the person
   of a bishop or presbyter is in a certain sense surrounded by sacredness
   to him. Monks are models of piety. In his eulogy of Theodosius the
   Younger, [59] he compares the emperor's devoutness to that of the
   monks, making the latter, of course, the high-water mark in that
   respect. But even as respects the ordinances of the church, his regard
   for them was not slavish or superstitious. He advocates extremely broad
   views in regard to the observance of Easter, considering a very precise
   determination of it too formalistic to be consistent with the liberty
   of the New Dispensation. So, likewise, in regard to many other of the
   ceremonies of the church, he takes pains to show by a description of
   the various ways in which they were performed in different quarters
   that they were not essential, but of subordinate importance. [60]

   [8] Valesius' reasoning is based on the assumption that Socrates was
   sent to the grammarians as soon as they arrived at Constantinople. If,
   however, an interval of several years elapsed before his going to them,
   the date of his birth must be put correspondingly later. The only
   certainty reached through this datum is that he was born nor earlier
   than 379.

   native of Side in Pamphilia, and mentions Eusebius and Silvanus and
   Alabius (both the latter bishops) as distinguished pupils of Troilus,
   and finally adds that Anthemius, who during the minority of Theodosius
   acted as regent, was dependent on the influence of Troilus; in which
   connection he further adds that Troilus was not inferior to Anthemius
   in political sagacity.

   [13] Professor Milligan, in Smith & Wace's Dictionary of Biography,
   even says that Socrates assisted Troilus, but adduces no proof for the
   statement.

   [24] The various meanings of this word may be found in Du Cange's
   Glossarium Mediæ et Infimæ Græcitates and in Sophocles' Greek Lexicon
   of the Roman and Byzantine Periods. From its primary meaning of
   student' it came to be applied to any one who had passed through study
   to the professions, of which the advocate's was one. From the absence
   of the cognomen in Photius' account of Socrates, Bibliotheca Cod. 28,
   as well as in that of Nicephorus Callisti, H. E. I. 1, Hamburger, as
   quoted by Fabricius, Bibl. Græc. VII. p. 423, note g, and Ceillier,
   Auteurs Sacrés, XIII. p. 669, doubt whether the title was rightly
   applied to him. Valesius argues from internal grounds that Socrates was
   a layman and a lawyer. Harnack, on the other hand, denies that there is
   any evidence of juristic knowledge in Socrates' History, even in such
   passages as I. 30, 31, and V. 18.

   III. Socrates' Ecclesiastical History.

   Until the beginning of the fourth century historiography remained a
   pagan science. With the exception of the Acts of the Apostles and its
   apocryphal imitations, no sort of attempt had been made to record even
   the annals of the Christian Church. At the opening of the fourth
   century Eusebius conceived the idea of writing a history which should
   include a complete account of the Church's life to his own days. Hence
   he has correctly been called the Father of Church History. His work was
   done so satisfactorily to his contemporaries and immediate successors
   that none of them undertook to go over the same field again. [61] They
   estimated the thoroughness and accuracy of his work much higher than
   later ages have done. But this respect, which enhanced the magnitude of
   his work in their eyes, at the same time inspired many of them with a
   desire to imitate him.

   Thus a school of church historians arose, and a number of continuations
   of Eusebius' History were undertaken. Of these, six are known to have
   seen the light: three of these again are either in part or wholly lost;
   viz., those of Philippus Sidetes, of Philastorgius, and of Hesychius.
   The first because of internal characteristics which made it difficult
   to use; the second because its author was a heretic (an Arian), and
   with the wane of the sect to which he belonged, his work lost favor and
   was gradually ostracized by the orthodox, and thus was lost, with the
   exception of an abstract preserved by Photius; and the third, for
   reasons unknown and undiscoverable, met with the same fate, not leaving
   even as much as an abstract behind. The remaining three are the
   histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret. That of Theodoret begins
   with the rise of Arianism, and ends with Theodore of Mopsuestia (429
   a.d.). That of Sozomen was begun with the purpose of including the
   history of the years between 323 (date of the overthrow of Licinius by
   Constantine) and 439 (the seventeenth consulship of Theodosius the
   Younger), but for some reason was closed with the death of the Emperor
   Honorius (423), and so covers just one hundred years. The work of
   Socrates, being evidently older than either of the other two, is more
   directly a continuation of the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius. The
   motives which actuated him to continue the narratives of Eusebius may
   be gathered from the work to be his love for history, [62] especially
   that of his own times, [63] his respect for Eusebius, and the
   exhortation of Theodorus, to whom the work is dedicated. [64] The
   author opens with a statement of his purpose to take up the account
   where Eusebius had left it off, and to review such matters as,
   according to his judgment, had not been adequately treated by his
   predecessor. Accordingly he begins with the accession of Constantine
   (306 a.d.), when the persecution begun by Diocletian came to an end,
   and stops with the year 439. He mentions the number of years included
   in his work as 140. As a matter of fact, only 133 years are recorded;
   but the number given by the author is doubtless not meant to be rather
   a round than a precise number. The close of his history is the
   seventeenth consulship of Theodosius the Younger--the same as the
   proposed end of Sozomen's work. Why Socrates did not continue his
   history later is not known, except perhaps because, as he alleges,
   peace and prosperity seemed to be assured to the church, and history is
   made not in time of peace, but in the turmoils and disturbances of war
   and debate. The period covered by the work is very eventful. It is
   during this period that three of the most important councils of the
   church were held: those of Nicæa (325), of Constantinople (381), and
   the first council of Ephesus (431), besides the second of Ephesus,
   called the "Robbers' Council" (lestrike), and that of Chalcedon, which
   were held not much later. It is this period which saw the church coming
   to the ascendant. Instead of its being persecuted, or even merely
   tolerated, it then becomes dominant. With its day of peace from without
   comes the day of its internal strife, and so various sects and heresies
   spring up and claim attention in church history. Socrates appreciated
   the importance which these contentions gave to his work. [65]

   Geographically Socrates' work is limited to the East. The western
   branch of the church is mentioned in it only as it enters into
   relations with the eastern. The division of the history into seven
   books is made on the basis of the succession in the eastern branch of
   the Roman Empire. The seven books cover the reigns of eight eastern
   emperors. Two of these reigns--that of Julian (361-363) and that of
   Jovian (363-364)--were so brief that they are combined and put into one
   book, but otherwise the books are each devoted to the reign of one
   emperor. The first book treats of the church under Constantine the
   Great (306-337); the second, of the period under Constantius II.
   (337-360); the third, of that under Julian and Jovian taken together
   (360-364); the fourth, of the church under Valens (364-378); the fifth,
   of Theodosius the Great (379-395); the sixth, of Arcadius (395-408);
   and the seventh, to those years of Theodosius the Younger (408-439)
   which came within the period of Socrates' work.

   As the title of the work ('Ekklesiastike Istoria) indicates, the
   subject is chiefly the vicissitudes and experiences of the Christian
   Church; but the author finds various reasons for interweaving with the
   account of ecclesiastical affairs some record also of the affairs of
   the state. His statement [66] of these reasons puts first among them
   the relief his readers would experience by passing from the accounts of
   the perpetual wranglings of bishops to something of a different
   character; second, the information which all ought to have on secular
   as well as ecclesiastical matters; and third, the interlacing of these
   two lines, on account of which the understanding of the one cannot be
   full without some knowledge of the other. By a sort of sympathy,' says
   he, the church takes part in the disturbances of the state,' and since
   the emperors became Christians, the affairs of the church have become
   dependent on them, and the greatest synods have been held and are held
   at their bidding.' It cannot be said, however, that Socrates either
   thoroughly realized or attempted any systematic treatment of his
   subject from the point of view of the true relations of church and
   state; he simply had the consciousness that the two spheres were not as
   much dissociated as one might assume.

   On the general character of Socrates' History it may be said that,
   compared with those produced by his contemporaries, it is a work of
   real merit, surpassing in some respects even that of his great
   predecessor, Eusebius. The latter has confused his account by adopting,
   under the influence of his latest informant, differing versions of
   facts already narrated, without erasing the previous versions or
   attempting to harmonize or unify them. Compare with this feature
   Socrates' careful and complete revision of his first two books on
   obtaining new and more trustworthy information. [67]

   In the collection of his facts Socrates everywhere tried to reach
   primary sources. A great portion of his work is drawn from oral
   tradition, the accounts given by friends and countrymen, the common,
   but not wild, rumors of the capital, and the transient literature of
   the day. Whenever he depends on such information, Socrates attempts to
   reach as far as possible the accounts of eye-witnesses, [68] and
   appends any doubts he may have as to the truth of the statements they
   make. Of written works he has used for the period where his work and
   that of Eusebius overlap the latter's Ecclesiastical History and Life
   of Constantine; [69] for other events he follows Rufinus, [70]
   abandoning him, however, in his second edition, whenever he conflicts
   with more trustworthy authorities. He has also made use of Archelaus'
   Acts, [71] of Sabinus' Collection of the Acts of the Synods, which he
   criticises for unfairness, [72] Epiphanius' Ancoratus, [73] George of
   Laodicea, [74] Athanasius' Apolog., [75] de Syn., [76] and de Decr.
   Nic., [77] Evagrius, [78] Palladius, [79] Nestorius, [80] and Origen.
   [81] Christian writers before Origen are known to him and mentioned by
   him, such as Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria, Apollinaris the Elder,
   Serapion, and others; but he does not seem to have used their works as
   sources, probably because they threw no light on the subject at hand,
   his period being entirely different from that in which they flourished.
   Besides these writers, Socrates has also used public documents,
   pastoral and episcopal letters, decrees, acts, and other documents not
   previously incorporated in written works. Some of these the author has
   used, but does not quote in extenso, on account of their length. [82]
   Of the sources that he might have used, but has not, may be mentioned
   Dexippus, Eunapius (chronike historia), Olympiodorus (logoi
   historikoi), and especially Zosimus, his contemporary (historia nea).
   Whether these were unknown to him, or whether he deemed it unnecessary
   to make use of the information given by them, or considered them
   untrustworthy, it cannot be ascertained. It is sufficient to say that
   for the period he covers, and the geographical limitation he has put on
   his work, his array of facts is sufficiently large and to the purpose.
   The use he makes of these facts also shows sufficiently the historian
   as thorough as he could be considering the time and environment in
   which he flourished. There is an evident attempt throughout his work at
   precision. He marks the succession of bishops, the years in which each
   event took place by the consulships and Olympiads of Roman and Greek
   history. He has made painstaking investigations on various topics, such
   as the different usages in various localities, respecting the
   observance of Easter, the performance of the rites of baptism and
   marriage, the manner of fasting, of church assemblies, and other
   ecclesiastical usages. [83] His accuracy has been questioned from the
   time of Photius [84] to our own days. It cannot be denied that there
   are a number of errors in the History. He confused Maximian and
   Maximin. [85] He ascribes three Creeds' to the first Council of
   Sirmium, whereas these belonged to other councils. In general he is
   confused on the individuals to whom he ascribes the authorship of the
   Sirmian creeds. [86] Similar confusion and lack of trustworthiness is
   noticed in his version of the sufferings of Paul of Constantinople and
   the vicissitudes of the life of Athanasius. He has wrongly given the
   number of those who dissented from the decision of the Council of Nicæa
   as five. The letter of the Council only mentions two,--Theonas and
   Secundus. The exile of Eusebius and Theognis is ascribed to a later
   period and a different cause by Jerome and Philostorgius, and it is
   generally conceded that Socrates' information was erroneous on this
   subject also. He is incorrect on several particulars in the lives of
   Basil and Gregory of Nazianzus, as also in assigning the attack at
   night on the church of St. Theonas to the usurpation of Gregory, the
   Arian bishop of Alexandria. [87]

   The chronology of Socrates is generally accurate to about the beginning
   of the sixth book, or the year 398. A number of errors are found in it
   after that. But even before the date named, the dates of the Council of
   Sardica (347) and of the death of Athanasius (373, for which Socrates
   gives 371) are given wrong. St. Polycarp's martyrdom is also put out of
   its proper place by about one hundred years. [88] Valens' stay at
   Antioch and persecution of the orthodox is put too early. [89] The
   Olympiads are given wrong. [90]

   Socrates is generally ignorant of the affairs of the Western Church. He
   gives a cursory account of Ambrose, but says nothing of the great
   Augustine, or even of the Donatist controversy, in spite of all its
   significance and also of the extreme probability that he knew of it; as
   Pelagius and Celestius, who traveled in the East about this time, could
   not but have made the Eastern Church acquainted with its details. In
   speaking of the Arian council of Antioch in 341, he seems to think that
   the Roman bishop had a sort of veto-power over the decisions of
   Occidental councils. The only legitimate inference, however, from the
   language of the bishop's claim is that he thought he had a right to be
   invited to attend in common with the other bishops of Italy. [91] So,
   again, on the duration of the fast preceding Easter among the western
   churches, he makes the mistaken statement that it was three weeks, and
   that Saturdays and Sundays were excepted.

   Finally, the credence which Socrates gives to stories of miracles and
   portents must be noted as a blemish in his history. On the other hand,
   he was certainly not more credulous than his contemporaries in this
   respect; many of them, if we are to judge from Sozomen as an
   illustration, were much more so. The age was not accustomed to sifting
   accounts critically with a view to the elimination of the untrue.
   Socrates shows in this respect the historical instinct in the matter of
   distinguishing between various degrees of probability and credibility,
   but does not seem to exercise this instinct in dealing with accounts of
   the prodigious.

   To offset these faults we must take account, on the other hand, of the
   persistent and successful attempt of our historian at impartiality. Of
   all the Christian writers of his day he is the fairest towards those
   who differed from the creed of his church. No one else has done justice
   to Julian, [92] or to the various heretical sects of the day, as
   Socrates has. To avoid even the appearance of partiality, he makes a
   rule for himself not to speak in terms of praise of any living person;
   [93] and it must be said that he faithfully observes this rule, making
   but one exception in favor of the emperor Theodosius the Younger. [94]
   Of this prince he gives a eulogistic picture, altogether different from
   the representations universally found in the other historians of the
   age. [95] His independence of judgment is more signally manifested in
   his estimates of ecclesiastics, especially the more prominent ones,
   [96] bordering at times on unjust severity. In short,' says Harnack,
   summing up his estimate of Socrates, the rule to be applied to Socrates
   is that his learning and knowledge can be trusted only a little, but
   his good will and straightforwardness a great deal. Considering the
   circumstances under which he wrote and the miseries of the times, it
   can only be matter for congratulation that such a man should have been
   our informant and that his work has been preserved to us.' [97]

   Socrates' style is characterized by simplicity and perspicuity. From
   the very start he informs us that he is about to make a new departure
   in this respect. [98] Eusebius' language was not entirely satisfactory
   to him, nor that of older writers. [99] Hence his own attempt
   everywhere at plain, unadorned expression. The criticism of Photius,
   [100] that Socrates' style had nothing remarkable about it,' although
   made in the spirit of censure, is true, and according to Socrates'
   standard (which is also that of modern times) amounts to a
   commendation. Socrates, however, was not lacking in good humor and
   satire, [101] as well as in appreciation of short and pithy utterances;
   he often quotes proverbs and epigrammatic sayings, [102] and knows the
   influence of the anecdote and reminiscence in interesting the reader.

   The value of Socrates' History cannot be overestimated. It will always
   remain a source of primary importance. Though, as already noted, its
   ideal as a history is below that set up by Thucydides, Tacitus, and
   others of an earlier age,--below even that of Eusebius,--yet as a
   collection of facts and documents in regard to some of the most
   important events of the church's life it is invaluable. Its account of
   the great Arian controversy, its details of the Councils of Nicæa,
   Chalcedon, Constantinople, and Ephesus, besides those of the lesser,
   local conventions, its biographical items relative to the lives of the
   emperors, the bishops, and monks--some of whom are of pivotal
   importance in the movements of the times, its sketches of Ulphilas and
   Hypatia, its record of the manner and time of the conversion of the
   Saracens, the Goths, the Burgundians, the Iberians, and the Persians,
   as well as of the persecution of the Jews, the paschal controversy, not
   to mention a vast number of other details of minor importance, will
   always be read and used with the deepest interest by lovers of
   ecclesiastical history.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [61] That this was not due to a general conviction that one history of
   a period rendered another of the same period unnecessary is evident
   from the fact that the period immediately succeeding is treated of by
   three successive historians, and that the second of these, at least,
   knows and uses the work of his predecessor.

   [62] Harnack, however, successfully proves that Socrates' ideal of
   history, in spite of his love for it, was far from being the scientific
   idea which existed among pagan writers even of the age preceding his
   own. Cf. Herzog-Plitt, Real-Encyk. Vol. 14, p. 413 sq.

   IV. History of Socrates' Work.

   A. Uses made before the First Printed Edition of the Greek Text.

   Socrates' Ecclesiastical History was used, according to the best
   authorities, by Sozomen in the composition of his parallel history.
   [103] It was certainly used by Liberatus, the Carthaginian deacon, in
   his Breviarium caussæ Nestorianorum et Eutychianorum, and by Theodorus
   Anagnostes (Lector) in his Ecclesiastical History. [104] It was also
   quoted in the second Council of Nicæa, under the name of Rufinus, and
   also under its author's name. [105]

   Epiphanius, surnamed Scholasticus, translated the history of Socrates,
   together with those of Sozomen and Theodoret, under the auspices of
   Cassiodorus, about the beginning of the sixth century. This
   translation, under the name of Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ Tripartitæ,
   consists of twelve books, and was printed at Paris, without date, by
   Regnault in 8vo; afterwards also at Bâle in 1523, 1528, 1533, 1539, and
   1568. It was revised by Beatus Rhenanus, and published in Frankfort on
   the Main in 1588, together with the history of Eusebius, which was
   translated and continued by Rufinus. It is also found in the new
   edition of Cassiodorus printed at Rouen by Jo. Garetius in 1679 and in
   Venice, 1729. It served as a basis for a French translation by Ægidius
   Gourlinus (Gille Gourlin), published in Paris in 1538 (cited by
   Cyaneus), and of a German translation by Caspar Hedio at Strasburg,
   1545.

   B. Editions.

   There are two independent editions of Socrates' Ecclesiastical History,
   each of which has served as a basis for reprints, secondary editions,
   and translations. These are:

   I. Eusebii Pamphili: Hist. EccI. LL. X.; ejd. de Vita Constantini LL.
   V.; Socratis Hist. Eccl. LL. VII.; Theodoreti Episc. Cyrensis Hist.
   EccI. LL. V.; Collectaneum ex hist. eccl. Theodori Lectoris LL. II.;
   Hermiæ Sozomeni Hist. EccI. LL. IX.; Evagrii Hist. Eccl. LL. VI. Lut.
   Paris, ex off. Rob. Stephani 1544 pridie Cal. Jul.

   a. Upon this edition is based a Latin translation by Wolfgang Musculus,
   Bâle 1544, 1549, 1557, 1594, and one by J. J. Christophorson, bishop of
   Chichester, Paris 1571, Cologne 1581, Bâle 1570; with notes by Grynæus
   and by Henricus Petri 1611; incorporated into the Bibliotheca Patrum,
   ed. Cologne 1618 as Vol. V. and ed. Lyons 1677 as Vol. VII.

   b. The Greek text of Stephens and the Latin translation of
   Christophorson were published together in Geneva, 1612.

   c. An English translation of Socrates' Ecclesiastical History was made
   by Meredith Hanmer, [106] and is contained in his Ancient
   Ecclesiastical Histories of the first six hundred years after Christ,
   written in the Greek tongue by three learned Historiographers,
   Eusebius, Socrates and Evagrius. London 1577. [This work also contains
   Dorotheus' Lives of the Prophets, Apostles, and Seventy Disciples
   reprinted in 1585 and 1650.]

   2. The second independent edition of Socrates is that which has been
   received as standard and served as a basis for all subsequent uses,
   viz.:

   Historia Ecclesiastica Socratis, Scholastici, Hermiæ, Sozomeni, &c.,
   ed. Henricus Valesius. Paris 1668. Valesius ostensibly revised the text
   of Stephens, but as a matter of fact he made a new collation of the ms.
   used by Stephens, and compared this with mss. in the Vatican, so that
   his edition amounts to an entirely new work. He also made a new Latin
   translation and appended numerous notes. This edition was reprinted in
   Mayence in 1677. Its Latin portion was reprinted in Paris also in 1677.
   The reprint of Mayence was reproduced under a new title, as if in
   Amsterdam in 1675.

   a. Gul. Reading appended additional notes, and together with the Latin
   translation of Valesius, published the work in Cambridge in three vols.
   1720. Reading's edition was reprinted at Turin in 1746. Valesius'
   original edition was again reprinted in Oxford by Parker in 1844 and
   Cura Buckley in London, also in 1844. It was revised and published in
   Oxford in 3 vols. by R. Hussey in 1853, and again in 1860 and in 1879.
   Again it was incorporated into Migne's Patrologia Græca as Vol. LXVII.
   (Petit Montrouge) in 1859, and finally the Greek text alone was revised
   and published in a single volume by William Bright in Oxford 1878.

   b. The translations based on Valesius' edition exclusive of those in
   Latin mentioned above are as follows:

   In French by L. Cousin: Histoire de l'Eglise écrite par Eusèbe,
   Socrate, Sozomène, Theodoret, &c. 4 vols. Paris 1675, and 6 vols.
   Amsterdam 1686. [Containing also Photius' abstract of Philostorgius.]

   In English by Shorting: [107] The History of the Church as written in
   Greek by Eusebius, Socrates, and Evagrius [contains also the four books
   of the Life of Constantine, Constantine's Oration to the Convention of
   the Saints, and Eusebius' speech in praise of Constantine], translated
   from the edition of Valesius, with a translation also of Valesius'
   notes and his account of the lives and writings of those historians.
   Cambridge 1683, 1692, 1709.

   By S. Parker: The Ecclesiastical Histories of Eusebius, Socrates,
   Sozomen, and Theodoret....abridged from the originals. London 1707, 3rd
   ed. 1729.

   of the first six centuries of the Christian Era in 6 vols. [Socrates
   Scholasticus' History forms Vol. III. of this series]. London, Samuel
   Bagster and Sons, 1843-46. This translation was reprinted in Bohn's
   Ecclesiastical Library, 4 vols., 1851 and 1888, and by Bagster in 1868.

   [108] The volume containing Sozomen in this series bears the name of

   ascribed to Walford also. This cannot be a matter of inference from the
   appearance of the two historians in the same series, as Eusebius, also
   in the same series, is translated by Crusè. Those who attribute the
   translation to Walford give no reason for doing so.

   The

   ECCLESIASTICAL HistorY,

   BY

   SOCRATES SCHOLASTICUS.

   ------------------------

   Book I.

   Chapter I.--Introduction to the Work.

   Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, [109] writing the History of the Church
   [110] in ten books, closed it with that period of the emperor
   Constantine, when the persecution which Diocletian had begun against
   the Christians came to an end. Also in writing the life of Constantine,
   this same author has but slightly treated of matters regarding Arius,
   being more intent on the rhetorical finish of his composition and the
   praises of the emperor, than on an accurate statement of facts. Now, as
   we propose to write the details of what has taken place in the churches
   since his time to our own day, we begin with the narration of the
   particulars which he has left out, and we shall not be solicitous to
   display a parade of words, but to lay before the reader what we have
   been able to collect from documents, and what we have heard from those
   who were familiar with the facts as they told them. And since it has an
   important bearing on the matter in hand, it will be proper to enter
   into a brief account of Constantine's conversion to Christianity,
   making a beginning with this event.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [109] Eusebius seems to have adopted this name as a token of friendship
   and respect for Pamphilus, bishop of Cæsarea. See McGiffert,
   Prolegomena in Vol. I., Second Series of Post-Nicene Fathers.

   [110] Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History ends with the death of Licinius
   in 323. His Life of Constantine is in a sense a continuation of the
   History, and yet as it is very well characterized by Socrates, it is a
   eulogy and therefore its style and selection of facts are affected by
   its purpose, rendering it too inadequate as a continuation of the
   Ecclesiastical History; hence Socrates' constraint to review some of
   the events which naturally fall in Eusebius' period.

   Chapter II.--By what Means the Emperor Constantine became a Christian.

   When Diocletian and Maximian, [111] surnamed Herculius, had by mutual
   consent laid aside the imperial dignity, and retired into private life,
   Maximian, surnamed Galerius, who had been a sharer with them in the
   government, came into Italy and appointed two Cæsars, Maximin in the
   eastern division of the empire, and Severus in the Italian. In Britain,
   however, Constantine was proclaimed emperor, instead of his father
   Constantius, who died in the first year of the two hundred and
   seventy-first [112] Olympiad, on the 25th of July. And at Rome
   Maxentius, the son of Maximian Herculius, was raised by the prætorian
   soldiers to be a tyrant rather than an emperor. In this state of things
   Herculius, impelled by a desire to regain the sovereignty, attempted to
   destroy his son Maxentius; but this he was prevented by the soldiery
   from effecting, and he soon afterwards died at Tarsus in Cilicia. At
   the same time Severus Cæsar being sent to Rome by Galerius Maximian, in
   order to seize Maxentius, was slain, his own soldiers having betrayed
   him. At length Galerius Maximian, who had exercised the chief
   authority, [113] also died, having previously appointed as his
   successor, his old friend and companion in arms, Licinius, a Dacian by
   birth. Meanwhile, Maxentius sorely oppressed the Roman people, treating
   them as a tyrant rather than as a king, shamelessly violating the wives
   of the nobles, putting many innocent persons to death, and perpetrating
   other similar atrocities. The emperor Constantine being informed of
   this, exerted himself to free the Romans from the slavery under him
   (i.e. Maxentius), and began immediately to consider by what means he
   might overthrow the tyrant. Now while his mind was occupied with this
   great subject, he debated as to what divinity's aid he should invoke in
   the conduct of the war. He began to realize that Diocletian's party had
   not profited at all by the pagan deities, whom they had sought to
   propitiate; but that his own father Constantius, who had renounced the
   various religions of the Greeks, had passed through life far more
   prosperously. In this state of uncertainty, as he was marching at the
   head of his troops, a preternatural vision, which transcends all
   description, appeared to him. In fact, about that part of the day when
   the sun after posing the meridian begins to decline towards the west,
   he saw a pillar of light in the heavens, in the form of a cross, on
   which were inscribed these words, By This Conquer. [114] The appearance
   of this sign struck the emperor with amazement and scarcely believing
   his own eyes, he asked those around him if they beheld the same
   spectacle; and as they unanimously declared that they did, the
   emperor's mind was strengthened by this divine and marvelous
   apparition. On the following night in his slumbers he saw Christ who
   directed him to prepare a standard according to the pattern of that
   which had been seen; and to use it against his enemies as an assured
   trophy of victory. In obedience to this divine oracle, he caused a
   standard in the form of a cross to be prepared, which is preserved in
   the palace even to the present time: and proceeding in his measures
   with greater earnestness, he attacked the enemy and vanquished him
   before the gates of Rome, near the Mulvian bridge, Maxentius himself
   being drowned in the river. This victory was achieved in the seventh
   year of the conqueror's reign. [115] After this, while Licinius, who
   shared the government with him, and was his brother-in-law, having
   married his sister Constantia, was residing in the East, the emperor
   Constantine, in view of the great blessing he had received, offered
   grateful thanksgivings to God as his benefactor; these consisted in his
   relieving the Christians from persecution, recalling those who were in
   exile, liberating such as were imprisoned, and causing the confiscated
   property of the prescribed to be restored to them; he moreover rebuilt
   the churches, and performed all these things with the greatest ardor.
   About this time Diocletian, who had abdicated the imperial authority,
   died at Salona in Dalmatia. [116]

   Chapter III.--While Constantine favors the Christians, Licinius, his
   Colleague, persecutes them.

   Now Constantine, the emperor, having thus embraced Christianity,
   conducted himself as a Christian of his profession, rebuilding the
   churches, and enriching them with splendid offerings: he also either
   closed or destroyed the temples of the pagans, [117] and exposed the
   images which were in them to popular contempt. But his colleague
   Licinius, holding his pagan tenets, hated Christians; and although from
   fear of the emperor Constantine he avoided exciting open persecution,
   yet he managed to plot against them covertly, and at length proceeded
   to harass them without disguise. This persecution, however, was local,
   extending only to those districts where Licinius himself was: but as
   these and other public outrages did not long remain concealed from
   Constantine, finding out that the latter was indignant at his conduct,
   Licinius had recourse to an apology. Having thus propitiated him, he
   entered into a feigned league of friendship, pledging himself by many
   oaths not to act again tyrannically. But no sooner did he pledge
   himself than he committed perjury; for he neither changed his
   tyrannical mood nor ceased persecuting Christians. Indeed, he even
   prohibited the bishops by law from visiting the uncoverted pagans, lest
   it should be made a pretext for proselyting them to the Christian
   faith. And the persecution was thus at the same time well known and
   secret. It was conceded in name but manifest in fact; for those who
   were exposed to his persecution suffered most severely both in their
   persons and property.

   Chapter IV.--War arises between Constantine and Licinius on Account of
   the Christians.

   By this course he drew upon himself the emperor Constantine's heaviest
   displeasure; and they became enemies, the pretended treaty of
   friendship between them having been violated. Not long afterwards they
   took up arms against each other as declared enemies. And after several
   engagements both by sea and land, Licinius was at last utterly defeated
   near Chrysopolis in Bithynia, a port of the Chalcedonians, and
   surrendered himself to Constantine. Accordingly he having taken him
   alive, treated him with the utmost humanity, and would by no means put
   him to death, but ordered him to take up his abode and live in
   tranquillity at Thessalonica. He having, however, remained quiet a
   short time, managed afterwards to collect some barbarian mercenaries
   and made an effort to repair his late disaster by a fresh appeal to
   arms. The emperor being made acquainted with his proceedings, directed
   that he should be slain, which was carried into effect. Constantine
   thus became possessed of the sole dominion, and was accordingly
   proclaimed sovereign Autocrat, [118] and again sought to promote the
   welfare of Christians. This he did in a variety of ways, and
   Christianity enjoyed unbroken peace by reason of his efforts. But an
   internal dissension soon succeeded this state of repose, the nature and
   origin of which I shall now endeavor to describe.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [118] After a victory the soldiers greeted their prince with
   acclamations of Emperor!' Augustus!' So also did the citizens on his
   triumphal entry into the city. So it appears Constantine was formally
   greeted on assuming the sole control of affairs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter V.--The Dispute of Arius with Alexander, his Bishop.

   After Peter, bishop of Alexandria, had suffered martyrdom under
   Diocletian, Achillas was installed in the episcopal office, whom
   Alexander succeeded, during the period of peace above referred to. He,
   in the fearless exercise of his functions for the instruction and
   government of the Church, attempted one day in the presence of the
   presbytery and the rest of his clergy, to explain, with perhaps too
   philosophical minuteness, that great theological mystery--the Unity of
   the Holy Trinity. A certain one of the presbyters under his
   jurisdiction, whose name was Arius, possessed of no inconsiderable
   logical acumen, imagining that the bishop was subtly teaching the same
   view of this subject as Sabellius the Libyan, [119] from love of
   controversy took the opposite opinion to that of the Libyan, and as he
   thought vigorously responded to what was said by the bishop. If,' said
   he, the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of
   existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the
   Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows, that he had his
   substance [120] from nothing.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [119] Though Sabellius was the originator of one of the earliest and
   most plausible attempts at explanation of the mystery of the Trinity
   (for which see life of Sabellius in Smith and Wace, Dict. of Christian
   Biog., and Hodge, System. Theol. Vol. I. p. 452, 459), nothing is known
   of him, not even why he is called a Libyan here (also by other ancient
   writers, e.g. Philastrius, de Hæres. 26, and Asterius, quoted by Phot.
   Biblioth. Cod. 27). Some say that he was a native and resident of
   Libya, others that he was an ecclesiastic appointed to some position
   there; nor is it known whether the Libya meant is the Libyan Pentapolis
   or the Pentapolitan Ptolemais.

   [120] hupostasin. Through the Arian controversy this word is used in
   its metaphysical sense of real nature of a thing as underlying and
   supporting its outward form and properties'; hence it is equivalent to
   the Latin substantia, Eng. essence and Greek ousia. Cf. below III. 7.
   Later it was applied to the special or characteristic nature of a
   thing,' and so became the very opposite of ousia (the general nature);
   hence equivalent to person.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter VI.--Division begins in the Church from this Controversy; and
   Alexander Bishop of Alexandria excommunicates Arius and his Adherents.

   Having drawn this inference from his novel train of reasoning, he
   excited many to a consideration of the question; and thus from a little
   spark a large fire was kindled: for the evil which began in the Church
   at Alexandria, ran throughout all Egypt, Libya, and the upper Thebes,
   and at length diffused itself over the rest of the provinces and
   cities. Many others also adopted the opinion of Arius; but Eusebius in
   particular was a zealous defender of it: not he of Cæsarea, but the one
   who had before been bishop of the church at Berytus, and was then
   somehow in possession of the bishopric of Nicomedia in Bithynia. When
   Alexander became conscious of these things, both from his own
   observation and from report, being exasperated to the highest degree,
   he convened a council of many prelates; and excommunicated Arius and
   the abettors of his heresy; at the same time he wrote as follows to the
   bishops constituted in the several cities:--

   The Epistle of Alexander Bishop of Alexandria.

   To our beloved and most honored fellow-Ministers of the Catholic Church
   everywhere, Alexander sends greeting in the Lord.

   Inasmuch as the Catholic Church is one body, and we are commanded in
   the holy Scriptures to maintain the bond of unity and peace,' [121] it
   becomes us to write, and mutually acquaint one another with the
   condition of things among each of us, in order that if one member
   suffers or rejoices, we may either sympathize with each other, or
   rejoice together.' [122] Know therefore that there have recently arisen
   in our diocese lawless and anti-christian men, teaching apostasy such
   as one may justly consider and denominate the forerunner of Antichrist.
   I wished indeed to consign this disorder to silence, that if possible
   the evil might be confined to the apostates alone, and not go forth
   into other districts and contaminate the ears of some of the simple.
   But since Eusebius, now in Nicomedia, thinks that the affairs of the
   Church are under his control because, forsooth, he deserted his charge
   at Berytus and assumed authority over the Church at Nicomedia with
   impunity, and has put himself at the head of these apostates, daring
   even to send commendatory letters in all directions concerning them, if
   by any means he might inveigle some of the ignorant into this most
   impious and anti-christian heresy, I felt imperatively called on to be
   silent no longer, knowing what is written in the law, but to inform you
   of all of these things, that ye might understand both who the apostates
   are, and also the contemptible character of their heresy, and pay no
   attention to anything that Eusebius should write to you. For now
   wishing to renew his former malevolence, which seemed to have been
   buried in oblivion by time, he affects to write in their behalf; while
   the fact itself plainly shows that he does this for the promotion of
   his own purposes. These then are those who have become apostates:
   Arius, Achillas, Aithales, and Carpones, another Arius, Sarmates,
   Euzoïus, Lucius, Julian, Menas, Helladis, and Gaius; with these also
   must be reckoned Secundus and Theonas, who once were called bishops.
   The dogmas they have invented and assert, contrary to the Scriptures,
   are these: That God was not always the Father, but that there was a
   period when he was not the Father; that the Word of God was not from
   eternity, but was made out of nothing; [123] for that the ever-existing
   God (the I AM'--the eternal One) made him who did not previously exist,
   out of nothing; wherefore there was a time when he did not exist,
   inasmuch as the Son is a creature and a work. That he is neither like
   the Father as it regards his essence, nor is by nature either the
   Father's true Word, or true Wisdom, but indeed one of his works and
   creatures, being erroneously called Word and Wisdom, since he was
   himself made of God's own Word and the Wisdom which is in God, whereby
   God both made all things and him also. Wherefore he is as to his nature
   mutable and susceptible of change, as all other rational creatures are:
   hence the Word is alien to and other than the essence of God; and the
   Father is inexplicable by the Son, and invisible to him, for neither
   does the Word perfectly and accurately know the Father, neither can he
   distinctly see him. The Son knows not the nature of his own essence:
   for he was made on our account, in order that God might create us by
   him, as by an instrument; nor would he ever have existed, unless God
   had wished to create us.

   Some one accordingly asked them whether the Word of God could be
   changed, as the devil has been? and they feared not to say, Yes, he
   could; for being begotten, he is susceptible of change.' We then, with
   the bishops of Egypt and Libya, being assembled together to the number
   of nearly a hundred, have anathematized Arius for his shameless avowal
   of these heresies, together with all such as have countenanced them.
   Yet the partisans of Eusebius have received them; endeavoring to blend
   falsehood with truth, and that which is impious with what is sacred.
   But they shall not prevail, for the truth must triumph; and light has
   no fellowship with darkness, nor has Christ any concord with Belial.'
   [124] Who ever heard such blasphemies? or what man of any piety is
   there now hearing them that is not horror-struck, and stops his ears,
   lest the filth of these expressions should pollute his sense of
   hearing? Who that hears John saying, In the beginning was the Word,'
   [125] does not condemn those that say, There was a period when the Word
   was not'? or who, hearing in the Gospel of the only-begotten Son,' and
   that all things were made by him,' will not abhor those that pronounce
   the Son to be one of the things made? How can he be one of the things
   which were made by himself? Or how can he be the only-begotten, if he
   is reckoned among created things? And how could he have had his
   existence from nonentities, since the Father has said, My heart has
   indited a good matter'; [126] and I begat thee out of my bosom before
   the dawn'? [127] Or how is he unlike the Father's essence, who is his
   perfect image,' [128] and the brightness of his glory' [129] and says:
   He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father'? Again how if the Son is
   the Word and Wisdom of God, was there a period when he did not exist?
   for that is equivalent to their saying that God was once destitute both
   of Word and Wisdom. How can he be mutable and susceptible of change,
   who says of himself, I am in the Father, and the Father in me'; [130]
   and I and the Father are one'; [131] and again by the Prophet, [132]
   Behold me because I am, and have not changed'? But if any one may also
   apply the expression to the Father himself, yet would it now be even
   more fitly said of the Word; because he was not changed by having
   become man, but as the Apostle says, [133] Jesus Christ, the same
   yesterday, to-day, and forever.' But what could persuade them to say
   that he was made on our account, when Paul has expressly declared [134]
   that all things are for him, and by him'? One need not wonder indeed at
   their blasphemous assertion that the Son does not perfectly know the
   Father; for having once determined to fight against Christ, they reject
   even the words of the Lord himself, when he says, [135] As the Father
   knows me, even so know I the Father.' If therefore the Father but
   partially knows the Son, it is manifest that the Son also knows the
   Father but in part. But if it would be improper to affirm this, and it
   be admitted that the Father perfectly knows the Son, it is evident that
   as the Father knows his own Word, so also does the Word know his own
   Father, whose Word he is. And we, by stating these things, and
   unfolding the divine Scriptures, have often confuted them: but again as
   chameleons they were changed, striving to apply to themselves that
   which is written, When the ungodly has reached the depths of iniquity,
   he becomes contemptuous.' [136] Many heresies have arisen before these,
   which exceeding all bounds in daring, have lapsed into complete
   infatuation: but these persons, by attempting in all their discourses
   to subvert the Divinity of The Word, as having made a nearer approach
   to Antichrist, have comparatively lessened the odium of former ones.
   Wherefore they have been publicly repudiated by the Church, and
   anathematized. We are indeed grieved on account of the perdition of
   these persons, and especially so because, after having been previously
   instructed in the doctrines of the Church, they have now apostatized
   from them. Nevertheless we are not greatly surprised at this, for
   Hymenæus and Philetus [137] fell in like manner; and before them Judas,
   who had been a follower of the Saviour, but afterwards deserted him and
   became his betrayer. Nor were we without forewarning respecting these
   very persons: for the Lord himself said: Take heed that no man deceive
   you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall
   many deceive many'; [138] and the time is at hand; Go ye not therefore
   after them.' [139] And Paul, having learned these things from the
   Saviour, wrote, That in the latter times some should apostatize from
   the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and doctrines of devils,'
   [140] who pervert the truth. Seeing then that our Lord and Saviour
   Jesus Christ has himself enjoined this, and has also by the apostle
   given us intimation respecting such men, we having ourselves heard
   their impiety have in consequence anathematized them, as we before
   said, and declared them to be alienated from the Catholic Church and
   faith. Moreover we have intimated this to your piety, beloved and most
   honored fellow-ministers, in order that ye might neither receive any of
   them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put
   confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them.
   For it is incumbent on us who are Christians, to turn away from all
   those who speak or entertain a thought against Christ, as from those
   who are resisting God, and are destroyers of the souls of men: neither
   does it become us even to salute such men,' [141] as the blessed John
   has prohibited, lest we should at any time be made partakers of their
   sins.' Greet the brethren which are with you; those who are with me
   salute you.

   Upon Alexander's thus addressing the bishops in every city, the evil
   only became worse, inasmuch as those to whom he made this communication
   were thereby excited to contention. And some indeed fully concurred in
   and subscribed to the sentiments expressed in this letter, while others
   did the reverse. But Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, was beyond all
   others moved to controversy, inasmuch as Alexander in his letter had
   made a personal and censorious allusion to him. Now at this juncture
   Eusebius possessed great influence, because the emperor resided at
   Nicomedia. For in fact Diocletian had a short time previously built a
   palace there. On this account therefore many of the bishops paid their
   court to Eusebius. And he repeatedly wrote both to Alexander, that he
   might set aside the discussion which had been excited, and again
   receive Arius and his adherents into communion; and also to the bishops
   in each city, that they might not concur in the proceedings of
   Alexander. By these means confusion everywhere prevailed: for one saw
   not only the prelates of the churches engaged in disputing, but the
   people also divided, some siding with one party, and some with the
   other. To so disgraceful an extent was this affair carried, that
   Christianity became a subject of popular ridicule, even in the very
   theatres. Those who were at Alexandria sharply disputed about the
   highest points of doctrine, and sent deputations to the bishops of the
   several dioceses; while those who were of the opposite faction created
   a similar disturbance.

   With the Arians the Melitians mingled themselves, who a little while
   before had been separated from the Church: but who these [Melitians]
   are must now be stated.

   By Peter, bishop of Alexandria, who in the reign of Diocletian suffered
   martyrdom, a certain Melitius, bishop of one of the cities in Egypt, in
   consequence of many other charges, and more especially because during
   the persecution he had denied the faith and sacrificed, was deposed.
   This person, being stripped of his dignity, and having nevertheless
   many followers, became the leader of the heresy of those who are to
   this day called from him Melitians throughout Egypt. And as he had no
   rational excuse for his separation from the Church, he pretended that
   he had simply been wronged and loaded Peter with calumnious reproaches.
   Now Peter died the death of a martyr during the persecution, and so
   Melitius transferred his abuse first to Achillas, who succeeded Peter
   in the bishopric, and afterwards again to Alexander, the successor of
   Achillas. In this state of things among them, the discussion in
   relation to Arius arose; and Melitius with his adherents took part with
   Arius, [142] entering into a conspiracy with him against the bishop.
   But as many as regarded the opinion of Arius as untenable, justified
   Alexander's decision against him, and thought that those who favored
   his views were justly condemned. Meanwhile Eusebius of Nicomedia and
   his partisans, with such as favored the sentiments of Arius, demanded
   by letter that the sentence of excommunication which had been
   pronounced against him should be rescinded; and that those who had been
   excluded should be readmitted into the Church, as they held no unsound
   doctrine. Thus letters from the opposite parties were sent to the
   bishop of Alexandria; and Arius made a collection of those which were
   favorable to himself while Alexander did the same with those which were
   adverse. This therefore afforded a plausible opportunity of defense to
   the sects, which are now prevalent, of the Arians, Eunomians, and such
   as receive their name from Macedonius; for these severally make use of
   these epistles in vindication of their heresies.

   [142] Valesius makes the assertion that Socrates is mistaken here, that
   the Melitians joined themselves to the Arians after the council of
   Nicæa, and were induced by Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, to cast
   slanderous aspersion upon Athanasius, as he himself testifies in his
   second apology against the Arians. It appears unlikely that the Fathers
   of the Nicene Council would have treated the Melitians as leniently as
   they did had they sided with Arius before the council.

   Chapter VII.--The Emperor Constantine being grieved at the Disturbance
   of the Churches, sends Hosius the Spaniard to Alexandria, exhorting the
   Bishop and Arius to Reconciliation and Unity.

   When the emperor was made acquainted with these disorders, he was very
   deeply grieved; and regarding the matter as a personal misfortune,
   immediately exerted himself to extinguish the conflagration which had
   been kindled, and sent a letter to Alexander and Arius by a trustworthy
   person named Hosius, who was bishop of Cordova, in Spain. The emperor
   greatly loved this man and held him in the highest estimation. It will
   not be out of place to introduce here a portion of this letter, the
   whole of which is given in the life of Constantine by Eusebius. [143]

   Victor Constantine Maximum Augustus to Alexander and Arius.

   I am informed that your present controversy originated thus. When you,
   Alexander, inquired of your presbyters what each thought on a certain
   inexplicable passage of the written Word, rather on a subject improper
   for discussion; and you, Arius, rashly gave expression to a view of the
   matter such as ought either never to have been conceived, or when
   suggested to your mind, it became you to bury it in silence. This
   dispute having thus been excited among you, communion [144] has been
   denied; and the most holy people being rent into two factions, have
   departed from the harmony of the common body. Wherefore let each one of
   you, showing consideration for the other, listen to the impartial
   exhortation of your fellow-servant. And what counsel does he offer? It
   was neither prudent at first to agitate such a question, nor to reply
   to such a question when proposed: for the claim of no law demands the
   investigation of such subjects, but the idle useless talk of leisure
   occasions them. And even if they should exist for the sake of
   exercising our natural faculties, yet we ought to confine them to our
   own consideration, and not incautiously bring them forth in public
   assemblies, nor thoughtlessly confide them to the ears of everybody.
   Indeed how few are capable either of adequately expounding, or even
   accurately understanding the import of matters so vast and profound!

   And even if any one should be considered able to satisfactorily
   accomplish this, how large a portion of the people would he succeed in
   convincing? Or who can grapple with the subtilties of such
   investigations without danger of lapsing into error? It becomes us
   therefore on such topics to check loquacity, lest either on account of
   the weakness of our nature we should be incompetent to explain the
   subject proposed; or the dull understanding of the audience should make
   them unable to apprehend clearly what is attempted to be taught: and in
   the case of one or the other of these failures, the people must be
   necessarily involved either in blasphemy or schism. Wherefore let an
   unguarded question, and an inconsiderate answer, on the part of each of
   you, procure equal forgiveness from one another. No cause of difference
   has been started by you bearing on any important precept contained in
   the Law; nor has any new heresy been introduced by you in connection
   with the worship of God; but ye both hold one and the same judgment on
   these points, which is the Creed. [145] Moreover, while you thus
   pertinaciously contend with one another about matters of small or
   scarcely the least importance, it is unsuitable for you to have charge
   of so many people of God, because you are divided in opinion: [146] and
   not only is it unbecoming, but it is also believed to be altogether
   unlawful.

   In order to remind you of your duty by an example of an inferior kind,
   I may say: you are well aware that even the philosophers themselves are
   united under one sect. Yet they often differ from each other on some
   parts of their theories: but although they may differ on the very
   highest branches of science, in order to maintain the unity of their
   body, they still agree to coalesce. Now, if this is done amongst them,
   how much more equitable will it be for you, who have been constituted
   ministers of the Most High God, to become unanimous with one another in
   such a religious profession. But let us examine with closer
   consideration, and deeper attention, what has been already stated. Is
   it right on account of insignificant and vain contentions between you
   about words, that brethren should be set in opposition against
   brethren; and that the honorable communion should be distracted by
   unhallowed dissension, through our striving with one another respecting
   things so unimportant, and by no means essential? These quarrels are
   vulgar and rather consistent with puerile thoughtlessness, than
   suitable to the intelligence of priests and prudent men. We should
   spontaneously turn aside from the temptations of the devil. The great
   God and Saviour of us all has extended to all the common light. Under
   his providence, allow me, his servant, to bring this effort of mine to
   a successful issue; that by my exhortation, ministry, and earnest
   admonition, I may lead you, his people, back to unity of communion.
   [147] For since, as I have said, there is but one faith among you, and
   one sentiment respecting religion, [148] and since the precept of the
   law, [149] in all its parts, combines all in one purpose of soul, let
   not this diversity of opinion, which has excited dissension among you,
   by any means cause discord and schism, inasmuch as it does not affect
   the force of the law as a whole. Now, I say these things, not as
   compelling you all to see exactly alike on this very insignificant
   subject of controversy, whatever it may be; since the dignity [150] of
   the communion may be preserved unaffected, and the same fellowship with
   all be retained, even though there should exist among you some
   dissimilarity of sentiment on unimportant matters. For, of course, we
   do not all desire the same thing in every respect; nor is there one
   unvarying nature, or standard of judgment in us. Therefore, in regard
   to divine providence, let there be one faith, one sentiment, and one
   covenant of the Godhead: [151] but those minute investigations which ye
   enter into among yourselves with so much nicety, even if ye should not
   concur in one judgment in regard to them, should remain within the
   sphere of your own reflection, kept in the secret recesses of the mind.
   Let then an ineffable and select bond of general friendship, with faith
   in the truth, reverence for God, and a devout observance of his law,
   remain unshaken among you. Resume mutual friendship and grace; restore
   to the whole people their accustomed familiar embraces; and do ye
   yourselves, on the strength of having purified your own souls, again
   recognize one another. For friendship often becomes sweeter after the
   removal of animosity. Thus restore to me tranquil days, and nights free
   from care; that to me also some pleasure in the pure light may be
   preserved, and a cheerful serenity during the rest of my life:
   otherwise, I must necessarily groan, and be wholly suffused with tears;
   neither will the remaining period of my earthly existence be peacefully
   sustained. For while the people of God (I speak of my fellow-servants)
   are severed from one another by so unworthy and injurious a contest,
   how is it possible for me to maintain my usual equanimity? But in order
   that you may have some idea of my excessive grief on account of this
   unhappy difference, listen to what I am about to state. On my recent
   arrival at the city of Nicomedia, it was my intention immediately after
   to proceed into the East: but while I was hastening toward you, and had
   advanced a considerable distance on my way, intelligence of this affair
   altogether reversed my purpose, lest I should be obliged to see with my
   own eyes a condition of things such as I could scarcely bear the report
   of. Open to me therefore by your reconciliation henceforth, the way
   into the East, which ye have obstructed by your contentions against one
   another: and permit me speedily to behold both you and all the rest of
   the people rejoicing together; and to express my due thanks to the
   Divine Being, because of the general harmony and liberty of all
   parties, accompanied by the cordial utterance of your praise. [152]

   [152] Socrates' lack of theological training can be inferred from his
   admiration for this rather superficial letter of Constantine's; so also
   the rudimentary character of Constantine's views of Gospel truth and
   his want of appreciation for the vital nature of the question in the
   Arian controversy. It may be noted, however, that the statesmanship
   shown in the tone and recommendations of the letter is just as
   farsighted as the theology of it is superficial. Constantine had sought
   to unite the empire through the church, and now that very church
   threatened to disrupt the empire; and this, at the very time, when by
   his final victory over Licinius and the foundation of his new capital,
   he seemed to have realized the ideal of a reunited empire.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter VIII.--Of the Synod which was held at Nicæa in Bithynia, and
   the Creed there [153] put forth.

   Such admirable and wise counsel did the emperor's letter contain. But
   the evil had become too strong both for the exhortations of the
   emperor, and the authority of him who was the bearer of his letter: for
   neither was Alexander nor Arius softened by this appeal; and moreover
   there was incessant strife and tumult among the people. Moreover
   another local source of disquietude had pre-existed there, which served
   to trouble the churches,--the dispute namely in regard to the Passover,
   which was carried on in the regions of the East only. [154] This arose
   from some desiring to keep the Feast more in accordance with the custom
   of the Jews; while others preferred its mode of celebration by
   Christians in general throughout the world. This difference, however,
   did not interfere with their communion, although their mutual joy was
   necessarily hindered. When, therefore, the emperor beheld the Church
   agitated on account of both of these causes, he convoked a General
   Council, [155] summoning all the bishops by letter to meet him at Nicæa
   in Bithynia. Accordingly the bishops assembled out of the various
   provinces and cities; respecting whom Eusebius Pamphilus thus writes,
   word for word, in his third book of the life of Constantine: [156]

   Wherefore the most eminent of the ministers of God in all the churches
   which have filled Europe, Africa, and Asia, were convened. And one
   sacred edifice, dilated as it were by God, contained within it on the
   same occasion both Syrians and Cilicians, Phoenicians, Arabs and
   Palestinians, and in addition to these, Egyptians, Thebans, Libyans,
   and those who came from Mesopotamia. At this synod a Persian bishop was
   also present, neither was the Scythian absent from this assemblage.
   Pontus also and Galatia, Pamphylia, Cappadocia, Asia and Phrygia,
   supplied those who were most distinguished among them. Besides, there
   met there Thracians and Macedonians, Achaians and Epirots, and even
   those who dwelt still further away than these, and the most celebrated
   of the Spaniards himself [157] took his seat among the rest. The
   prelate [158] of the imperial city was absent on account of age; but
   some of his presbyters were present and filled his place. Such a crown,
   composed as a bond of peace, the emperor Constantine alone has ever
   dedicated to Christ his Saviour, as a thank-offering worthy of God for
   victory over his enemies, having appointed this convocation among us in
   imitation of the Apostolic Assembly. [159] For among them it is said
   were convened "devout men of every nation under heaven; Parthians,
   Medes and Elamites, and those who dwelt in Mesopotamia, Judæa and
   Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the part
   of Libya which is toward Cyrene, strangers from Rome also, both Jews
   and proselytes with Cretans and Arabs." That congregation, however, was
   inferior in this respect, that all present were not ministers of God:
   whereas in this assembly the number of bishops exceeded three hundred;
   [160] while the number of the presbyters, deacons, and acolyths [161]
   and others who attended them was almost incalculable. Some of these
   ministers of God were eminent for their wisdom, some for the strictness
   of their life, and patient endurance [of persecution], and others
   united in themselves all these distinguished characteristics: some were
   venerable from their advanced age, others were conspicuous for their
   youth and vigor of mind, and others had but recently entered on their
   ministerial career. [162] For all these the emperor appointed an
   abundant supply of daily food to be provided.'

   Such is Eusebius' account of those who met on this occasion. The
   emperor having completed the festal solemnization of this triumph over
   Licinius, came also in person to Nice.

   There were among the bishops two of extraordinary celebrity,
   Paphnutius, bishop of Upper Thebes, and Spyridon, bishop of Cyprus: why
   I have so particular referred to these two individuals, I shall state
   hereafter. Many of the laity were also present, who were practiced in
   the art of reasoning, [163] and each eager to advocate the cause of his
   own party. Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, as was before said, supported
   the opinion of Arius, together with Theognis and Maris; of these the
   former was bishop of Nicæa, and Maris of Chalcedon in Bithynia. These
   were powerfully opposed by Athanasius, a deacon of the Alexandrian
   church, who was highly esteemed by Alexander his bishop, and on that
   account was much envied, as will be seen hereafter. Now a short time
   previous to the general assembling of the bishops, the disputants
   engaged in preparatory logical contests before the multitudes; and when
   many were attracted by the interest of their discourse, one of the
   laity, a confessor [164] , who was a man of unsophisticated
   understanding, reproved these reasoners, telling them that Christ and
   his apostles did not teach us dialectics, art, nor vain subtilties, but
   simple-mindedness, which is preserved by faith and good works. As he
   said this, all present admired the speaker and assented to the justice
   of his remarks; and the disputants themselves, after hearing his plain
   statement of the truth, exercised a greater degree of moderation: thus
   then was the disturbance caused by these logical debates suppressed at
   this time.

   On the following day all the bishops were assembled together in one
   place; the emperor arrived soon after and on his entrance stood in
   their midst, and would not take his place, until the bishops by bowing
   intimated their desire that he should be seated: such was the respect
   and reverence which the emperor entertained for these men. When a
   silence suitable to the occasion had been observed, the emperor from
   his seat began to address them words of exhortation to harmony and
   unity, and entreated each to lay aside all private pique. For several
   of them had brought accusations against one another and many had even
   presented petitions to the emperor the day before. But he, directing
   their attention to the matter before them, and on account of which they
   were assembled, ordered these petitions to be burnt; merely observing
   that Christ enjoins him who is anxious to obtain forgiveness, to
   forgive his brother.' When therefore he had strongly insisted on the
   maintenance of harmony and peace, he sanctioned again their purpose of
   more closely investigating the questions at issue. But it may be well
   to hear what Eusebius says on this subject, in his third book of the
   Life of Constantine. [165] His words are these:

   A variety of topics having been introduced by each party and much
   controversy being excited from the very commencement, the emperor
   listened to all with patient attention, deliberately and impartially
   considering whatever was advanced. He in part supported the statements
   which were made on either side, and gradually softened the asperity of
   those who contentiously opposed each other, conciliating each by his
   mildness and affability. And as he addressed them in the Greek
   language, for he was not unacquainted with it, he was at once
   interesting and persuasive, and wrought conviction on the minds of
   some, and prevailed on others by entreaty, those who spoke well he
   applauded. And inciting all to unanimity at length he succeeded in
   bringing them into similarity of judgment, and conformity of opinion on
   all the controverted points: so that there was not only unity in the
   confession of faith, but also a general agreement as to the time for
   the celebration of the feast of Salvation. [166] Moreover the doctrines
   which had thus the common consent, were confirmed by the signature of
   each individual.'

   Such in his own words is the testimony respecting these things which
   Eusebius has left us in writing; and we not unfitly have used it, but
   treating what he has said as an authority, have introduced it here for
   the fidelity of this history. With this end also in view, that if any
   one should condemn as erroneous the faith professed at this council of
   Nicæa, we might be unaffected by it, and put no confidence in Sabinus
   the Macedonian, [167] who calls all those who were convened there
   ignoramuses and simpletons. For this Sabinus, who was bishop of the
   Macedonians at Heraclea in Thrace, having made a collection of the
   decrees published by various Synods of bishops, has treated those who
   composed the Nicene Council in particular with contempt and derision;
   not perceiving that he thereby charges Eusebius himself with ignorance,
   who made a like confession after the closest scrutiny. And in fact some
   things he has willfully passed over, others he has perverted, and on
   all he has put a construction favorable to his own views. Yet he
   commends Eusebius Pamphilus as a trustworthy witness, and praises the
   emperor as capable in stating Christian doctrines: but he still brands
   the faith which was declared at Nicæa, as having been set forth by
   ignorant persons, and such as had no intelligence in the matter. And
   thus he voluntarily contemns the words of a man whom he himself
   pronounces a wise and true witness: for Eusebius declares, that of the
   ministers of God who were present at the Nicene Synod, some were
   eminent for the word of wisdom, others for the strictness of their
   life; and that the emperor himself being present, leading all into
   unanimity, established unity of judgment, and agreement of opinion
   among them. Of Sabinus, however, we shall make further mention as
   occasion may require. But the agreement of faith, assented to with loud
   acclamation at the great council of Nicæa is this:

   We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible
   and invisible:--and in one [168] Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the
   only-begotten of the Father, that is of the substance of the Father;
   God of God and Light of light; true God of true God; begotten, not
   made, consubstantial [169] with the Father: by whom all things were
   made, both which are in heaven and on earth: who for the sake of us
   men, and on account of our salvation, descended, became incarnate, and
   was made man; suffered, arose again the third day, and ascended into
   the heavens, and will come again to judge the living and the dead. [We]
   also [believe] in the Holy Spirit. But the holy Catholic and Apostolic
   church anathematizes those who say "There was a time when he was not,"
   and "He was not before he was begotten" and "He was made from that
   which did not exist," and those who assert that he is of other
   substance or essence than the Father, or that he was created, or is
   susceptible of change.' [170]

   This creed was recognized and acquiesced in by three hundred and
   eighteen [bishops]; and being, as Eusebius says, unanimous is
   expression and sentiment, they subscribed it. Five only would not
   receive it, objecting to the term homoousios, of the same essence,' or
   consubstantial: these were Eusebius bishop of Nicomedia, Theognis of
   Nice, Maris of Chalcedon, Theonas of Marmarica, and Secundus of
   Ptolemaïs. For,' said they since that is consubstantial which is from
   another either by partition, derivation or germination; by germination,
   as a shoot from the roots; by derivation, as children from their
   parents; by division, as two or three vessels of gold from a mass, and
   the Son is from the Father by none of these modes: therefore they
   declared themselves unable to assent to this creed.' Thus having
   scoffed at the word consubstantial, they would not subscribe to the
   deposition of Arius. Upon this the Synod anathematized Arius, and all
   who adhered to his opinions, prohibiting him at the same time from
   entering into Alexandria. At the same time an edict of the emperor sent
   Arius himself into exile, together with Eusebius and Theognis and their
   followers; Eusebius and Theognis, however, a short time after their
   banishment, tendered a written declaration of their change of
   sentiment, and concurrence in the faith of the consubstantiality of the
   Son with the Father, as we shall show as we proceed.

   At this time during the session of the Synod, Eusebius, surnamed
   Pamphilus, bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine, who had held aloof for a
   short time, after mature consideration whether he ought to receive this
   definition of the faith, at length acquiesced in it, and subscribed it
   with all the rest: he also sent to the people under his charge a copy
   of the Creed, with an explanation of the word homoousios, that no one
   might impugn his motives on account of his previous hesitation. Now
   what was written by Eusebius was as follows in his own words:

   'You have probably had some intimation, beloved, of the transactions of
   the great council convened at Nicæa, in relation to the faith of the
   Church, inasmuch as rumor generally outruns true account of that which
   has really taken place. But lest from such report alone you might form
   an incorrect estimate of the matter, we have deemed it necessary to
   submit to you, in the first place, an exposition of the faith proposed
   by us in written form; and then a second which has been promulgated,
   consisting of ours with certain additions to its expression. The
   declaration of faith set forth by us, which when read in the presence
   of our most pious emperor, seemed to meet with universal approbation,
   was thus expressed:

   "According as we received from the bishops who preceded us, both in our
   instruction [171] [in the knowledge of the truth], and when we were
   baptized; as also we have ourselves learned from the sacred Scriptures:
   and in accordance with what we have both believed and taught while
   discharging the duties of presbyter and the episcopal office itself, so
   now we believe and present to you the distinct avowal of our faith. It
   is this:

   "We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things
   visible and invisible:--and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Word of God,
   God of God, Light of light, Life of life, the only-begotten Son, born
   before all creation, [172] begotten of God the Father, before all ages,
   by whom also all things were made; who on account of our salvation
   became incarnate, and lived among men; and who suffered and rose again
   on the third day, and ascended to the Father, and shall come again in
   glory to judge the living and the dead. We believe also in one Holy
   Spirit. We believe in the existence and subsistence of each of these
   [persons]: that the Father is truly Father, the Son truly Son, and the
   Holy Spirit truly Holy Spirit; even as our Lord also, when he sent
   forth his disciples to preach the Gospel, said, [173] Go and teach all
   nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
   of the Holy Spirit.' Concerning these doctrines we steadfastly maintain
   their truth, and avow our full confidence in them; such also have been
   our sentiments hitherto, and such we shall continue to hold until death
   and in an unshaken adherence to this faith, we anathematize every
   impious heresy. In the presence of God Almighty, and of our Lord Jesus
   Christ we testify, that thus we have believed and thought from our
   heart and soul, since we have possessed a right estimate of ourselves;
   and that we now think and speak what is perfectly in accordance with
   the truth. We are moreover prepared to prove to you by undeniable
   evidences, and to convince you that in time past we have thus believed,
   and so preached."

   When these articles of faith were proposed, there seemed to be no
   ground of opposition: nay, our most pious emperor himself was the first
   to admit that they were perfectly correct, and that he himself had
   entertained the sentiments contained in them; exhorting all present to
   give them their assent, and subscribe to these very articles, thus
   agreeing in a unanimous profession of them, with the insertion,
   however, of that single word "homoousios" (consubstantial), an
   expression which the emperor himself explained, as not indicating
   corporeal affections or properties; and consequently that the Son did
   not subsist from the Father either by division or abscission: for said
   he, a nature which is immaterial and incorporeal cannot possibly be
   subject to any corporeal affection; hence our conception of such things
   can only be in divine and mysterious terms. Such was the philosophical
   view of the subject taken by our most wise and pious sovereign; and the
   bishops on account of the word homoousious, drew up this formula of
   faith.

   The Creed. [174]

   "We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things
   visible and invisible:--and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
   the only-begotten of the Father, that is of the substance of the
   Father; God of God, Light of light, true God of true God; begotten not
   made, consubstantial with the Father; by [175] whom all things were
   made both which are in heaven and on earth; who for the sake of us men,
   and on account of our salvation, descended, became incarnate, was made
   man, suffered and rose again on the third day; he ascended into the
   heavens, and will come to judge the living and the dead. [We believe]
   also in the Holy Spirit. But those who say There was a time when he was
   not,' or He did not exist before he was begotten,' or He was made of
   nothing' or assert that He is of other substance or essence than the
   Father,' or that the Son of God is created, or mutable, or susceptible
   of change, the Catholic and apostolic Church of God anathematizes."

   Now this declaration of faith being propounded by them, we did not
   neglect to investigate the distinct sense of the expressions "of the
   substance of the Father, and consubstantial with the Father." Whereupon
   questions were put forth and answers, and the meaning of these terms
   was clearly defined; when it was generally admitted that ousias (of the
   essence or substance) simply implied that the Son is of the Father
   indeed, but does not subsist as a part of the Father. To this
   interpretation of the sacred doctrine which declares that the Son is of
   the Father, but is not a part of his substance, it seemed right to us
   to assent. We ourselves therefore concurred in this exposition; nor do
   we cavil at the word "homoousios" having regard to peace, and fearing
   to lose a right understanding of the matter. On the same grounds we
   admitted also the expression "begotten, not made": "for made," said
   they, "is a term applicable in common to all the creatures which were
   made by the Son, to whom the Son has no resemblance. Consequently he is
   no creature like those which were made by him, but is of a substance
   far excelling any creature; which substance the Divine Oracles teach
   was begotten of the Father by such a mode of generation as cannot be
   explained nor even conceived by any creature." Thus also the
   declaration that "the Son is consubstantial with the Father" having
   been discussed, it was agreed that this must not be understood in a
   corporeal sense, or in any way analogous to mortal creatures; inasmuch
   as it is neither by division of substance, nor by abscission nor by any
   change of the Father's substance and power, since the underived nature
   of the Father is inconsistent with all these things. That he is
   consubstantial with the Father then simply implies, that the Son of God
   has no resemblance to created things, but is in every respect like the
   Father only who begat him; and that he is of no other substance or
   essence but of the Father. To which doctrine, explained in this way, it
   appeared right to assent, especially since we knew that some eminent
   bishops and learned writers among the ancients have used the term
   "homoousios" in their theological discourses concerning the nature of
   the Father and the Son. Such is what I have to state to you in
   reference to the articles of faith which have been promulgated; and in
   which we have all concurred, not without due examination, but according
   to the senses assigned, which were investigated in the presence of our
   most highly favored emperor, and for the reasons mentioned approved. We
   have also considered the anathema pronounced by them after the
   declaration of faith inoffensive; because it prohibits the use of
   illegitimate [176] terms, from which almost all the distraction and
   commotion of the churches have arisen. Accordingly, since no divinely
   inspired Scripture contains the expressions, "of things which do not
   exist," and "there was a time when he was not," and such other phrases
   as are therein subjoined, it seemed unwarrantable to utter and teach
   them: and moreover this decision received our sanction the rather from
   the consideration that we have never heretofore been accustomed to
   employ these terms. We deemed it incumbent on us, beloved, to acquaint
   you with the caution which has characterized both our examination of
   and concurrence in these things: and that on justifiable grounds we
   resisted to the last moment the introduction of certain objectionable
   expressions as long as these were not acceptable; and received them
   without dispute, when on mature deliberation as we examined the sense
   of the words, they appeared to agree with what we had originally
   proposed as a sound confession of faith.'

   Such was the letter addressed by Eusebius Pamphilus to the Christians
   at Cæsarea in Palestine. At the same time the Synod itself also, with
   one accord, wrote the following epistle to the church of the
   Alexandrians, and to believers in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis.

   Chapter IX.--The Letter of the Synod, relative to its Decisions: and
   the Condemnation of Arius and those who agreed with him.

   To the holy, by the grace of God, and great church of the Alexandrians,
   and to our beloved brethren throughout Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis,
   the bishops assembled at Nicæa, constituting the great and holy Synod,
   send greeting in the Lord.

   Since, by the grace of God, a great and holy Synod has been convened at
   Nicæa, our most pious sovereign Constantine having summoned us out of
   various cities and provinces for that purpose, it appeared to us
   indispensably necessary that a letter should be written to you on the
   part of the sacred Synod; in order that ye may know what subjects were
   brought under consideration and examined, and what was eventually
   determined on and decreed.

   In the first place, then, the impiety and guilt of Arius and his
   adherents were examined into, in the presence of our most religious
   emperor Constantine: and it was unanimously decided that his impious
   opinion should be anathematized, with all the blasphemous expressions
   he has uttered, in affirming that the Son of God sprang from nothing,'
   and that there was a time when he was not'; saying moreover that the
   Son of God, because possessed of free will, was capable either of vice
   or virtue; and calling him a creature and a work. All these sentiments
   the holy Synod has anathematized, having scarcely patience to endure
   the hearing of such an impious opinion, or, rather, madness, and such
   blasphemous words. But the conclusion of our proceedings against him
   you must either have been informed of already or will soon learn; for
   we would not seem to trample on a man who has received the chastisement
   which his crime deserved. Yet so contagious has his pestilential error
   proved, as to drag into perdition Theonas, bishop of Marmarica, and
   Secundus of Ptolemaïs; for they have suffered the same condemnation as
   himself. But when the grace of God delivered us from those execrable
   dogmas, with all their impiety and blasphemy, and from those persons,
   who had dared to cause discord and division among a people previously
   at peace, there still remained the contumacy of Melitius [to be dealt
   with] and those who had been ordained by him; and we now state to you,
   beloved brethren, what resolution the Synod came to on this point. It
   was decreed, the Synod being moved to great clemency towards Melitius,
   although strictly speaking he was wholly undeserving of favor, that he
   remain in his own city but exercise no authority either to ordain or
   nominate for ordination; and that he appear in no other district or
   city on this pretense, but simply retain a nominal dignity. That those
   who had received appointments from him, after having been confirmed by
   a more legitimate ordination, should be admitted to communion on these
   conditions: that they should continue to hold their rank and ministry,
   but regard themselves as inferior in every respect to all those who
   have been ordained and established in each place and church by our
   most-honored fellow-minister, Alexander, so that they shall have no
   authority to propose or nominate whom they please, or to do anything at
   all without the concurrence of some bishop of the Catholic Church who
   is one of Alexander's suffragans. On the other hand, such as by the
   grace of God and your prayers have been found in no schism, but have
   continued in the Catholic Church blameless, shall have authority to
   nominate and ordain those who are worthy of the sacred office, [177]
   and to act in all things according to ecclesiastical law and usage.
   When it may happen that any of those holding preferments in the church
   die, then let these who have been thus recently admitted be advanced to
   the dignity of the deceased, provided that they should appear worthy,
   and that the people should elect them, the bishop of Alexandria also
   ratifying their choice. This privilege is conceded to all the others
   indeed, but to Melitius personally we by no means grant the same
   license, on account of his former disorderly conduct, and because of
   the rashness and levity of his character, in order that no authority or
   jurisdiction should be given him as a man liable again to create
   similar disturbances. These are the things which specially affect
   Egypt, and the most holy church of the Alexandrians: and if any other
   canon or ordinance has been established, our Lord and most-honored
   fellow-minister and brother Alexander being present with us, will on
   his return to you enter into more minute details, inasmuch as he has
   been a participator in whatever is transacted, and has had the
   principal direction of it. We have also gratifying intelligence to
   communicate to you relative to unity of judgment on the subject of the
   most holy feast of Easter: for this point also has been happily settled
   through your prayers; so that all the brethren in the East who have
   heretofore kept this festival when the Jews did, will henceforth
   conform to the Romans and to us, and to all who from the earliest time
   have observed our period of celebrating Easter. Rejoicing therefore in
   these conclusions and in the general unanimity and peace, as well as in
   the extirpation of all heresy, receive with the greater honor and more
   abundant love our fellow-minister and your bishop Alexander, who has
   greatly delighted us by his presence, and even at his advanced age has
   undergone extraordinary exertions in order that peace might be
   re-established among you. Pray on behalf of us all, that the things
   decided as just may be inviolably maintained through Almighty God, and
   our Lord Jesus Christ, together with the Holy Spirit; to whom be glory
   for ever. Amen.

   This epistle of the Synod makes it plain that they not only
   anathematized Arius and his adherents, but the very expressions of his
   tenets; and that having agreed among themselves respecting the
   celebration of Easter, they readmitted the heresiarch Melitius into
   communion, suffering him to retain his episcopal rank, but divesting
   him of all authority to act as a bishop. It is for this reason I
   suppose that even at the present time the Melitians in Egypt are
   separated from the church, because the Synod deprived Melitius of all
   power. It should be observed moreover that Arius had written a treatise
   on his own opinion which he entitled Thalia; but the character of the
   book is loose and dissolute, similar in its style and metres to the
   songs of Sotades. [178] This production also the Synod condemned at the
   same time. Nor was it the Synod alone that took the trouble to write
   letters to the churches announcing the restoration of peace, but the
   emperor Constantine himself also wrote personally and sent the
   following address to the church of the Alexandrians.

   The Emperor's Letter.

   Constantine Augustus, to the Catholic church of the Alexandrians.
   Beloved brethren, hail! We have received from Divine Providence the
   inestimable blessing of being relieved from all error, and united in
   the acknowledgment of one and the same faith. The devil will no longer
   have any power against us, since all that which he had malignantly
   devised for our destruction has been entirely overthrown from the
   foundations. The splendor of truth has dissipated at the command of God
   those dissensions, schisms, tumults, and so to speak, deadly poisons of
   discord. Wherefore we all worship one true God, and believe that he is.
   But in order that this might be done, by divine admonition I assembled
   at the city of Nicæa most of the bishops; with whom I myself also, who
   am but one of you, and who rejoice exceedingly in being your
   fellow-servant, undertook the investigation of the truth. Accordingly,
   all points which seemed in consequence of ambiguity to furnish any
   pretext for dissension, have been discussed and accurately examined.
   And may the Divine Majesty pardon the fearful enormity of the
   blasphemies which some were shamelessly uttering concerning the mighty
   Saviour, our life and hope; declaring and confessing that they believe
   things contrary to the divinely inspired Scriptures. While more than
   three hundred bishops remarkable for their moderation and intellectual
   keenness, were unanimous in their confirmation of one and the same
   faith, which according to the truth and legitimate construction of the
   law of God can only be the faith; Arius alone beguiled by the subtlety
   of the devil, was discovered to be the sole disseminator of this
   mischief, first among you, and afterwards with unhallowed purposes
   among others also. Let us therefore embrace that doctrine which the
   Almighty has presented to us: let us return to our beloved brethren
   from whom an irreverent servant of the devil has separated us: let us
   go with all speed to the common body and our own natural members. For
   this is becoming your penetration, faith and sanctity; that since the
   error has been proved to be due to him who is an enemy to the truth, ye
   should return to the divine favor. For that which has commended itself
   to the judgment of three hundred bishops cannot be other than the
   doctrine of God; seeing that the Holy Spirit dwelling in the minds of
   so many dignified persons has effectually enlightened them respecting
   the Divine will. Wherefore let no one vacillate or linger, but let all
   with alacrity return to the undoubted path of duty; that when I shall
   arrive among you, which will be as soon as possible, I may with you
   return due thanks to God, the inspector of all things, for having
   revealed the pure faith, and restored to you that love for which ye
   have prayed. May God protect you, beloved brethren.

   Thus wrote the emperor to the Christians of Alexandria, assuring them
   that the exposition of the faith was neither made rashly nor at random,
   but that it was dictated with much research, and after strict
   investigation: and not that some things were spoken of, while others
   were suppressed in silence; but that whatever could be fittingly
   advanced in support of any opinion was fully stated. That nothing
   indeed was precipitately determined, but all was previously discussed
   with minute accuracy; so that every point which seemed to furnish a
   pretext for ambiguity of meaning, or difference of opinion, was
   thoroughly sifted, and its difficulties removed. In short he terms the
   thought of all those who were assembled there the thought of God, and
   does not doubt that the unanimity of so many eminent bishops was
   effected by the Holy Spirit. Sabinus, however, the chief of the heresy
   of the Macedonians, willfully rejects these authorities, and calls
   those who were convened there ignorant and illiterate persons; nay, he
   almost accuses Eusebius of Cæsarea himself of ignorance: nor does he
   reflect, that even if those who constituted that synod had been laymen,
   yet as being illuminated by God, and the grace of the Holy Spirit, they
   were utterly unable to err from the truth. [179] Nevertheless, hear
   farther what the emperor decreed in another circular both against Arius
   and those who held his opinions, sending it in all directions to the
   bishops and people.

   Another Epistle of Constantine.

   Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to the bishops and people.--Since
   Arius has imitated wicked and impious persons, it is just that he
   should undergo the like ignominy. Wherefore as Porphyry, [180] that
   enemy of piety, for having composed licentious treatises against
   religion, found a suitable recompense, and such as thenceforth branded
   him with infamy, overwhelming him with deserved reproach, his impious
   writings also having been destroyed; so now it seems fit both that
   Arius and such as hold his sentiments should be denominated
   Porphyrians, that they may take their appellation from those whose
   conduct they have imitated. And in addition to this, if any treatise
   composed by Arius should be discovered, let it be consigned to the
   flames, in order that not only his depraved doctrine may be suppressed,
   but also that no memorial of him may be by any means left. This
   therefore I decree, that if any one shall be detected in concealing a
   book compiled by Arius, and shall not instantly bring it forward and
   burn it, the penalty for this offense shall be death; for immediately
   after conviction the criminal shall suffer capital punishment. May God
   preserve you!

   Another Epistle. [181]

   Constantine Augustus, to the Churches.

   Having experienced from the flourishing condition of public affairs,
   how great has been the grace of divine power, I judged this to be an
   object above all things claiming my care, that one faith, with sincere
   love, and uniform piety toward Almighty God should be maintained
   amongst the most blessed assemblies of the Catholic Church. But
   inasmuch as I perceived that this could not be firmly and permanently
   established, unless all, or at least the greatest part of the bishops
   could be convened in the same place, and every point of our most holy
   religion should be discussed by them in council; therefore as many as
   possible were assembled, and I myself also as one of you was present;
   for I will not deny what I especially rejoice in, that I am your
   fellow-servant. All points were then minutely investigated, until a
   decision acceptable to Him who is the inspector of all things, was
   published for the promotion of uniformity of judgment and practice; so
   that nothing might be henceforth left for dissension or controversy in
   matters of faith. There also the question having been considered
   relative to the most holy day of Easter, it was determined by common
   consent that it should be proper that all should celebrate it on one
   and the same day everywhere. For what can be more appropriate, or what
   more solemn, than that this feast from which we have received the hope
   of immortality, should be invariably kept in one order, and for an
   obvious reason among all? And in the first place, it seemed very
   unworthy of this most sacred feast, that we should keep it following
   the custom of the Jews; a people who having imbrued their hands in a
   most heinous outrage, have thus polluted their souls, and are
   deservedly blind. Having then cast aside their usage, we are free to
   see to it that the celebration of this observance should occur in
   future in the more correct order which we have kept from the first day
   of the Passion until the present time. Therefore have nothing in common
   with that most hostile people the Jews. We have received from the
   Saviour another way; for there is set before us both a legitimate and
   accurate course in our holy religion: unanimously pursuing this, let
   us, most honored brethren, withdraw ourselves from that detestable
   association. For it is truly absurd for them to boast that we are
   incapable of rightly observing these things without their instruction.
   For on what subject will they be competent to form a correct judgment,
   who after that murder of their Lord, having been bereft of their
   senses, are led not by any rational motive, but by an ungovernable
   impulse, wherever their innate fury may drive them? Thence it is
   therefore, that even in this particular they do not perceive the truth,
   so that they constantly erring in the utmost degree, instead of making
   a suitable correction, celebrate the Feast of Passover a second time in
   the same year. [182] Why then should we follow the example of those who
   are acknowledged to be infected with grievous error? Surely we should
   never suffer Easter to be kept twice in one and the same year! But even
   if these considerations were not laid before you, it became your
   prudence at all times to take heed, both by diligence and prayer, that
   the purity of your soul should in nothing have communion, or seem to do
   so with the customs of men so utterly depraved. Moreover this should
   also be considered, that in a matter so important and of such religious
   significance, the slightest disagreement is most irreverent. For our
   Saviour left us but one day to be observed in commemoration of our
   deliverance, that is the day of his most holy Passion: he also wished
   his Catholic Church to be one; the members of which, however much they
   may be scattered in various places, are notwithstanding cherished by
   one Spirit, that is by the will of God. Let the prudence consistent
   with your sacred character consider how grievous and indecorous it is,
   that on the same days some should be observing fasts, while others are
   celebrating feasts; and after the days of Easter some should indulge in
   festivities and enjoyments, and others submit to appointed fastings. On
   this account therefore Divine Providence directed that an appropriate
   correction should be effected, and uniformity of practice established,
   as I suppose you are all aware.

   Since then it was desirable that this should be so amended that we
   should have nothing in common with that nation of parricides, and of
   those who slew their Lord; and since the order is a becoming one which
   is observed by all the churches of the western, southern, and northern
   parts, and by some also in the eastern; from these considerations for
   the present all thought it to be proper, and I pledged myself that it
   would be satisfactory to your prudent penetration, that what is
   observed with such general unanimity of sentiment in the city of Rome,
   throughout Italy, Africa, all Egypt, Spain, France, Britain, Libya, the
   whole of Greece, and the dioceses of Asia, Pontus, and Cilicia, your
   intelligence also would cheerfully accept; reflecting too that not only
   is there a greater number of churches in the places before mentioned,
   but also that this in particular is a most sacred obligation, that all
   should in common desire whatever strict reason seems to demand, and
   what has no communion with the perjury of the Jews. But to sum up
   matters briefly, it was determined by common consent that the most holy
   festival of Easter should be solemnized on one and the same day; for it
   is not even seemly that there should be in such a hallowed solemnity
   any difference: and it is more commendable to adopt that opinion in
   which there will be no intermixture of strange error, or deviation from
   what is right. These things therefore being thus consistent, do you
   gladly receive this heavenly and truly divine command: for whatever is
   done in the sacred assemblies of the bishops is referable to the Divine
   will. Wherefore, when ye have indicated the things which have been
   prescribed to all our beloved brethren, it behooves you to publish the
   above written statements and to accept the reasoning which has been
   adduced, and to establish this observance of the most holy day: that
   when I arrive at the long and earnestly desired view of your order, I
   may be able to celebrate the sacred festival with you on one and the
   same day; and may rejoice with you for all things, in seeing Satanic
   cruelty frustrated by divine power through our efforts, while your
   faith, peace and concord are everywhere flourishing. May God preserve
   you, beloved brethren.

   Another Epistle to Eusebius. [183]

   Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to Eusebius.

   Since an impious purpose and tyranny have even to the present time
   persecuted the servants of God our Saviour, I have been credibly
   informed and am fully persuaded, most beloved brother, that all our
   sacred edifices have either by neglect gone to decay, or from dread of
   impending danger have not been adorned with becoming dignity. But now
   that liberty has been restored, and that persecuting dragon Licinius
   has by the providence of the Most High God, and our instrumentality,
   been removed from the administration of public affairs, I imagine that
   the divine power has been made manifest to all, and at the same time
   that those who either through fear or unbelief fell into any sins,
   having acknowledged the living God, will come to the true and right
   course of life. Wherefore enjoin the churches over which you yourself
   preside, as well as the other bishops presiding in various places,
   together with the presbyters and deacons whom you know, to be diligent
   about the sacred edifices, either by repairing those which remain
   standing, or enlarging them, or by erecting new ones wherever it may be
   requisite. And do you yourself ask, and the rest through you, the
   necessary supplies both from the governors of the provinces, and the
   officers of the prætorian prefecture: for directions have been given to
   them to execute with all diligence the orders of your holiness. May God
   preserve you, beloved brother.

   These instructions, concerning the building of churches were sent by
   the emperor to the bishops in every province: but what he wrote to
   Eusebius of Palestine respecting the preparation of some copies of the
   Scriptures, we may ascertain from the letters themselves: [184]

   Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to Eusebius of Cæsarea.

   In the city which derives its name from us, a very great multitude of
   persons, through the assisting providence of our Saviour God, have
   united themselves to the most holy Church, so that it has received much
   increase there. It is therefore requisite that more churches should be
   furnished in that place: wherefore do you most cordially enter into the
   purpose which I have conceived. I have thought fit to intimate this to
   your prudence, that you should order to be transcribed on well-prepared
   parchment, by competent writers accurately acquainted with their art,
   fifty copies of the Sacred Scriptures, both legibly described, and of a
   portable size, the provision and use of which you know to be needful
   for the instruction of the Church. Letters have also been despatched
   from our clemency, to the financial agent [185] of the diocese that he
   be careful to provide all things necessary for the preparation of them.
   That these copies may be got ready as quickly as possible, let it be a
   task for your diligence: and you are authorized, on the warrant of this
   our letter, to use two of the public carriages for their conveyance;
   for thus the copies which are most satisfactorily transcribed, may be
   easily conveyed for our inspection, one of the deacons of your church
   fulfilling this commission; who when he has reached us shall experience
   our bounty. May God preserve you, beloved brother.

   Another Epistle to Macarius. [186]

   Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to Macarius of Jerusalem.--Such is
   the grace of our Saviour, that no supply of words seems to be adequate
   to the expression of its present manifestation. For that the monument
   [187] of his most holy passion, long since hidden under the earth,
   should have lain concealed for a period of so many years, until,
   through the destruction of the common enemy of all, [188] it should
   shine forth to his own servants after their having regained their
   freedom, exceeds all admiration. For if all those who throughout the
   whole habitable earth are accounted wise, should be convened in one and
   the same place, desiring to say something worthy of the event, they
   would fall infinitely short of the least part of it; for the
   apprehension of this wonder as far transcends every nature capable of
   human reasoning, as heavenly things are mightier than human. Hence
   therefore this is always my especial aim, that as the credibility of
   the truth daily demonstrates itself by fresh miracles, so the souls of
   us all should become more diligent respecting the holy law, with
   modesty and unanimous eagerness. But I desire that you should be fully
   aware of what I conceive is pretty generally known, that it is now my
   chief care, that we should adorn with magnificent structures that
   hallowed spot, which by God's appointment I have disencumbered of a
   most disgraceful addition [189] of an idol, as of some grievous burden;
   which was consecrated indeed from the beginning in the purpose of God,
   but has been more manifestly sanctified since he has brought to light
   the evidence of the Saviour's passion. Wherefore it is becoming your
   prudence to make such arrangements, and provision of everything
   necessary, that not only a church [190] should be built in itself
   superior to any elsewhere, but that the rest of its parts also may be
   such that all the most splendid edifices in every city may be excelled
   by this. With regard to the workmanship and chaste execution of the
   walls, know that we have entrusted the care of these things to our
   friend Dracilian, deputy to the most illustrious prefects of the
   prætorium, and to the governor of the province: for my piety has
   ordered that artificers and workmen, and whatever other things they may
   be informed from your sagacity to be necessary for the structure, shall
   through their care be immediately sent. Respecting the columns or the
   marbles, whatever you may judge to be more precious and useful, do you
   yourself after having inspected the plan take care to write to us; that
   when we shall understand from your letter how many things and of what
   kind there may be need of, these may be conveyed to you from all
   quarters: for it is but just that the most wonderful place in the
   world, should be adorned in accordance with its dignity. But I wish to
   know from you, whether you consider that the vault of the basilica
   should be fretted, or constructed on some other plan: for if it is to
   be fretted, it can also be decorated with gold. It remains that your
   holiness should inform the officers before mentioned as soon as
   possible, how many workmen and artificers, and what money for expenses
   you will want. Be careful at the same time to report to me speedily,
   not only concerning the marbles and columns, but also concerning the
   fretted vault, if indeed you should decide this to be the more
   beautiful. May God preserve you, beloved brother.

   The emperor having also written other letters of a more oratorical
   character against Arius and his adherents, caused them to be everywhere
   published throughout the cities, exposing him to ridicule, and taunting
   him with irony. Moreover, writing to the Nicomedians against Eusebius
   and Theognis, he censures the misconduct of Eusebius, not only on
   account of his Arianism, but because also having formerly been
   well-affected to the ruler, he had traitorously conspired against his
   affairs. He then exhorts them to elect another bishop instead of him.
   But I thought it would be superfluous to insert here the letters
   respecting these things, because of their length: those who wish to do
   so may find them elsewhere and give them a perusal. This is sufficient
   notice of these transactions.

   Chapter X.--The Emperor also summons to the Synod Acesius, Bishop of
   the Novatians.

   The emperor's diligence induces me to mention another circumstance
   expressive of his mind, and serving to show how much he desired peace.
   For aiming at ecclesiastical harmony, he summoned to the council
   Acesius also, a bishop of the sect of Novatians. Now, when the
   declaration of faith had been written out and subscribed by the Synod,
   the emperor asked Acesius whether he would also agree to this creed to
   the settlement of the day on which Easter should be observed. He
   replied, The Synod has determined nothing new, my prince: for thus
   heretofore, even from the beginning, from the times of the apostles, I
   traditionally received the definition of the faith, and the time of the
   celebration of Easter.' When, therefore, the emperor further asked him,
   For what reason then do you separate yourself from communion with the
   rest of the Church?' he related what had taken place during the
   persecution under Decius; and referred to the rigidness of that austere
   canon which declares, that it is not right persons who after baptism
   have committed a sin, which the sacred Scriptures denominate a sin unto
   death' [191] to be considered worthy of participation in the
   sacraments: [192] that they should indeed be exhorted to repentance,
   but were not to expect remission from the priest, but from God, who is
   able and has authority to forgive sins. [193] When Acesius had thus
   spoken, the emperor said to him, Place a ladder, Acesius, and climb
   alone into heaven.' [194] Neither Eusebius Pamphilus nor any other has
   ever mentioned these things: but I heard them from a man by no means
   prone to falsehood, who was very old, and simply stated what had taken
   place in the council in the course of a narrative. From which I
   conjecture that those who have passed by this occurrence in silence,
   were actuated by motives which have influenced many other historians:
   for they frequently suppress important facts, either from prejudice
   against some, or partiality towards others.

   Chapter XI.--Of the Bishop Paphnutius.

   As we have promised above [195] to make some mention of Paphnutius and
   Spyridon, it is time to speak of them here. Paphnutius then was bishop
   of one of the cities in Upper Thebes: he was a man so favored divinely
   that extraordinary miracles were done by him. In the time of the
   persecution he had been deprived of one of his eyes. The emperor
   honored this man exceedingly, and often sent for him to the palace, and
   kissed the part where the eye had been torn out. So great devoutness
   characterized the emperor Constantine. Let this single fact respecting
   Paphnutius suffice: I shall now explain another thing which came to
   pass in consequence of his advice, both for the good of the Church and
   the honor of the clergy. It seemed fit to the bishops to introduce a
   new law into the Church, that those who were in holy orders, I speak of
   bishops, presbyters, and deacons, should have no conjugal intercourse
   with the wives whom they had married while still laymen. [196] Now when
   discussion on this matter was impending, Paphnutius having arisen in
   the midst of the assembly of bishops, earnestly entreated them not to
   impose so heavy a yoke on the ministers of religion: asserting that
   marriage itself is honorable, and the bed undefiled'; [197] urging
   before God that they ought not to injure the Church by too stringent
   restrictions. For all men,' said he, cannot bear the practice of rigid
   continence; neither perhaps would the chastity of the wife of each be
   preserved': and he termed the intercourse of a man with his lawful wife
   chastity. It would be sufficient, he thought, that such as had
   previously entered on their sacred calling should abjure matrimony,
   according to the ancient tradition of the Church: but that none should
   be separated from her to whom, while yet unordained, he had been
   united. And these sentiments he expressed, although himself without
   experience of marriage, and, to speak plainly, without ever having
   known a woman: for from a boy he had been brought up in a monastery,
   [198] and was specially renowned above all men for his chastity. The
   whole assembly of the clergy assented to the reasoning of Paphnutius:
   wherefore they silenced all further debate on this point, leaving it to
   the discretion of those who were husbands to exercise abstinence if
   they so wished in reference to their wives. Thus much concerning
   Paphnutius.

   Chapter XII.--Of Spyridon, Bishop of the Cypriots.

   With respect to Spyridon, so great was his sanctity while a shepherd,
   that he was thought worthy of being made a Pastor of men: and having
   been assigned the bishopric of one of the cities in Cyprus named
   Trimithus, on account of his extreme humility he continued to feed his
   sheep during his incumbency of the bishopric. Many extraordinary things
   are related of him: I shall however record but one or two, lest I
   should seem to wander from my subject. Once about midnight, thieves
   having clandestinely entered his sheepfold attempted to carry off some
   of the sheep. But God who protected the shepherd preserved his sheep
   also; for the thieves were by an invisible power bound to the folds. At
   daybreak, when he came to the sheep and found the men with their hands
   tied behind them, he understood what was done: and after having prayed
   he liberated the thieves, earnestly admonishing and exhorting them to
   support themselves by honest labor, and not to take anything unjustly.
   He then gave them a ram, and sent them away, humorously adding, that ye
   may not appear to have watched all night in vain.' This is one of the
   miracles in connection with Spyridon. Another was of this kind. He had
   a virgin daughter named Irene, who was a partaker of her father's
   piety. An acquaintance entrusted to her keeping an ornament of
   considerable value: she, to guard it more securely, hid what had been
   deposited with her in the ground, and not long afterwards died.
   Subsequently the owner of the property came to claim it; and not
   finding the virgin, he began an excited conversation with the father,
   at times accusing him of an attempt to defraud him, and then again
   beseeching him to restore the deposit. The old man, regarding this
   person's loss as his own misfortune, went to the tomb of his daughter,
   and called upon God to show him before its proper season the promised
   resurrection. Nor was he disappointed in his hope: for the virgin again
   reviving appeared to her father, and having pointed out to him the spot
   where she had hidden the ornament, she once more departed. Such
   characters as these adorned the churches in the time of the emperor
   Constantine. These details I obtained from many inhabitants of Cyprus.
   I have also found a treatise composed in Latin by the presbyter
   Rufinus, from which I have collected these and some other things which
   will be hereafter adduced. [199]

   Chapter XIII.--Of Eutychian the Monk.

   I have heard moreover concerning Eutychian, a devout person who
   flourished about the same time; who also belonged to the Novatian
   church, yet was venerated for the performance of similar miracles. I
   shall unequivocally state my authority for this narrative, nor will I
   attempt to conceal it, even though I give offense to some parties. It
   was Auxanon, a very aged presbyter of the Novatian church; who when
   quite a youth accompanied Acesius to the Synod at Nicæa, and related to
   me what I have said concerning him. His life extended from that period
   to the reign of Theodosius the Younger; and when I was a mere youth he
   recounted to me the acts of Eutychian, enlarging much on the divine
   grace which was manifested in him: but one circumstance he alluded to,
   which occurred in the reign of Constantine, peculiarly worthy of
   mention. One of those military attendants, whom the emperor calls his
   domestic [or body] guards having been suspected of treasonable
   practices, sought his safety in flight. The indignant monarch ordered
   that he should be put to death, wherever he might be found: who, having
   been arrested on the Bithynian Olympus, was bound with heavy and
   painful chains and kept imprisoned near those parts of Olympus where
   Eutychian was leading a solitary life, and healing both the bodies and
   souls of many. The aged Auxanon being then very young was with him, and
   was being trained by him in the discipline of the monastic life. Many
   persons came to this Eutychian, entreating him to procure the release
   of the prisoner by interceding for him with the emperor. For the fame
   of the miracles done by Eutychian had reached the ears of the emperor.
   He readily promised to go to the sovereign; but as the chains inflicted
   intolerable suffering, those who interested themselves on his behalf
   declared that death caused by the effect of his chains would anticipate
   both the emperor's vengeance and any intercession that might be made
   for the prisoner. Accordingly Eutychian sent to the jailers requesting
   them to relieve the man; but they having answered that they should
   bring themselves into danger by relieving a criminal, he went himself
   to the prison, attended by Auxanon; and as they refused to open the
   jail, the grace which rested on Eutychian was rendered more
   conspicuous: for the gates of the prison opened of their own accord,
   while the jailers had the keys in their custody. As soon as Eutychian,
   together with Auxanon, had entered the prison, to the great
   astonishment of all then present the fetters spontaneously fell from
   the prisoner's limbs. He then proceeded with Auxanon to the city which
   was anciently called Byzantium but afterwards Constantinople, where
   having been admitted into the imperial palace, he saved the man from
   death; for the emperor, entertaining great veneration for Eutychian,
   readily granted his request. This indeed occurred some time after [the
   period to which this part of our history refers].

   The bishops who were convened at the council of Nicæa, after having
   drawn up and enrolled certain other ecclesiastical regulations which
   they are accustomed to term canons, again departed to their respective
   cities: and as I conceive it will be appreciated by lovers of learning,
   I shall here subjoin the names of such as were present, as far as I
   have been able to ascertain them, with the province and city over which
   they severally presided, and likewise the date at which this assembly
   took place. Hosius, who was I believe bishop of Cordova in Spain, as I
   have before stated. Vito and Vicentius, presbyters of Rome, Alexander,
   bishop of Egypt, Eustathius of Antiochia Magna, Macarius of Jerusalem,
   and Harpocration of Cynopolis: the names of the rest are fully reported
   in The Synodicon [200] of Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria. This Synod
   was convened (as we have discovered from the notation of the date
   prefixed to the record of the Synod) in the consulate of Paulinus and
   Julian, on the 20th day of May, and in the 636th year from the reign of
   Alexander the Macedonian. [201] Accordingly the work of the council was
   accomplished. It should be noted that after the council the emperor
   went into the western parts of the empire.

   Chapter XIV.--Eusebius Bishop of Nicomedia, and Theognis Bishop of
   Nicæa, who had been banished for agreeing in Opinion with Arius, having
   published their Recantation, and assented to the Creed, are reinstated
   in their Sees.

   Eusebius [202] and Theognis having sent a penitential confession to the
   principal bishops, were by an imperial edict recalled from exile and
   restored to their own churches, displacing those who had been ordained
   in their places; Eusebius [displacing] Amphion, and Theognis Chrestus.
   This is a copy of their written retraction:

   We having been sometime since condemned by your piety, without a formal
   trial, ought to bear in silence the decisions of your sacred
   adjudication. But since it is unreasonable that we by silence should
   countenance caluminators against ourselves, we on this account declare
   that we entirely concur with you in the faith; and also that, after
   having closely considered the import of the term consubstantial, we
   have been wholly studious of peace, having never followed the heresy.
   After suggesting whatever entered our thought for the security of the
   churches, and fully assuring those under our influence, we subscribed
   the declaration of faith; we did not subscribe the anathematizing; not
   as objecting to the creed, but as disbelieving the party accused to be
   such as was represented, having been satisfied on this point, both from
   his own letters to us, and from personal conversations. But if your
   holy council was convinced, we not opposing but concurring in your
   decisions, by this statement give them our full assent and
   confirmation: and this we do not as wearied with our exile, but to
   shake off the suspicion of heresy. If therefore ye should now think fit
   to restore us to your presence, ye will have us on all points
   conformable, and acquiescent in your decrees: especially since it has
   seemed good to your piety to deal tenderly with and recall even him who
   was primarily accused. It would be absurd for us to be silent, and thus
   give presumptive evidence against ourselves, when the one who seemed
   responsible has been permitted to clear himself from the charges
   brought against him. Vouchsafe then, as is consistent with that
   Christ-loving piety of yours, to remind our most religious emperor, to
   present our petitions, and to determine speedily concerning us in a way
   becoming yourselves.'

   Such was the language of the recantation of Eusebius and Theognis; from
   which I infer that they had subscribed the articles of faith which had
   been set forth, but would not become parties to the condemnation of
   Arius. It appears also that Arius was recalled before them; but,
   although this may be true, yet he had been forbidden to enter
   Alexandria. This is evident from the fact that he afterwards devised a
   way of return for himself, both into the church and into Alexandria, by
   having made a fictitious repentance, as we shall show in its proper
   place.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [202] This is not in its place according to chronological order,
   inasmuch as it occurred in 328 a.d. It appears also from the accounts
   of the other historians of this period that Socrates does not give the

   Theodoret, H. E. I. 20; also Sozom. I. 21.

   Chapter XV.--After the Synod, on the Death of Alexander, Athanasius is
   constituted Bishop of Alexandria.

   A little after this, Alexander bishop of Alexandria having died, [203]
   Athanasius was set over that church. Rufinus relates, that this
   [Athanasius] when quite a boy, played with others of his own age at a
   sacred game: this was an imitation of the priesthood and the order of
   consecrated persons. In this game therefore Athanasius was allotted the
   episcopal chair, and each of the other lads personated either a
   presbyter or a deacon. The children engaged in this sport on the day in
   which the memory of the martyr and bishop Peter was celebrated. Now at
   that time Alexander bishop of Alexandria happening to pass by, observed
   the play in which they were engaged, and having sent for the children,
   enquired from them the part each had been assigned in the game,
   conceiving that something might be portended by that which had been
   done. He then gave directions that the children should be taken to the
   church, and instructed in learning, but especially Athanasius; and
   having afterwards ordained him deacon on his becoming of adult age, he
   brought him to Nicæa to assist him in the disputations there when the
   Synod was convened. This account of Athanasius Rufinus has given in his
   own writings; nor is it improbable that it took place, for many
   transactions of this kind have often occurred. Concerning this matter
   it will suffice to have said the above. [204]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [203] Socrates and Sozomen are both mistaken in putting the death of
   Alexander and ordination of Athanasius after the return of Eusebius and
   Theognis from exile. According to Theodoret (H. E. I. 26), Alexander
   died a few months after the Council of Nicæa, hence in 325 a.d., and
   Athanasius succeeded him at the end of the same year, or at the
   beginning of the next.

   Socrates, Rufinus, H. E. I. 14.

   Chapter XVI.--The Emperor Constantine having enlarged the Ancient
   Byzantium, calls it Constantinople.

   After the Synod the emperor spent some time in recreation, and after
   the public celebration of his twentieth anniversary of his accession,
   [205] he immediately devoted himself to the reparation of the churches.
   This he carried into effect in other cities as well as in the city
   named after him, which being previously called Byzantium, he enlarged,
   surrounded with massive walls, [206] and adorned with various edifices;
   and having rendered it equal to imperial Rome, he named it
   Constantinople, establishing by law that it should be designated New
   Rome. This law was engraven on a pillar of stone erected in public view
   in the Strategium, [207] near the emperor's equestrian statue. [208] He
   built also in the same city two churches, one of which he named Irene,
   and the other The Apostles. [209] Nor did he only improve the affairs
   of the Christians, as I have said, but he also destroyed the
   superstition of the heathens; for he brought forth their images into
   public view to ornament the city of Constantinople, and set up the
   Delphic tripods publicly in the Hippodrome. It may indeed seem now
   superfluous to mention these things, since they are seen before they
   are heard of. But at that time the Christian cause received its
   greatest augmentation; for Divine Providence preserved very many other
   things during the times of the emperor Constantine. [210] Eusebius
   Pamphilus has in magnificent terms recorded the praises of the emperor;
   [211] and I considered it would not be ill-timed to advert thus to them
   as concisely as possible.

   Chapter XVII.--The Emperor's Mother Helena having come to Jerusalem,
   searches for and finds the Cross of Christ, and builds a Church.

   Helena, the emperor's mother (from whose name having made Drepanum,
   once a village, a city, the emperor called it Helenopolis), being
   divinely directed by dreams went to Jerusalem. Finding that which was
   once Jerusalem, desolate as a Preserve for autumnal fruits,' [212]
   according to the prophet, she sought carefully the sepulchre of Christ,
   from which he arose after his burial; and after much difficulty, by
   God's help she discovered it. What the cause of the difficulty was I
   will explain in a few words. Those who embraced the Christian faith,
   after the period of his passion, greatly venerated this tomb; but those
   who hated Christianity, having covered the spot with a mound of earth,
   erected on it a temple to Venus, and set up her image there, not caring
   for the memory of the place. [213] This succeeded for a long time; and
   it became known to the emperor's mother. Accordingly she having caused
   the statue [214] to be thrown down, the earth to be removed, and the
   ground entirely cleared, found three crosses in the sepulchre: one of
   these was that blessed cross on which Christ had hung, the other two
   were those on which the two thieves that were crucified with him had
   died. With these was also found the tablet [215] of Pilate, on which he
   had inscribed in various characters, that the Christ who was crucified
   was king of the Jews. Since, however, it was doubtful which was the
   cross they were in search of, the emperor's mother was not a little
   distressed; but from this trouble the bishop of Jerusalem, Macarius,
   shortly relieved her. And he solved the doubt by faith, for he sought a
   sign from God and obtained it. The sign was this: a certain woman of
   the neighborhood, who had been long afflicted with disease, was now
   just at the point of death; the bishop therefore arranged it so that
   each of the crosses should be brought to the dying woman, believing
   that she would be healed on touching the precious cross. Nor was he
   disappointed in his expectation: for the two crosses having been
   applied which were not the Lord's, the woman still continued in a dying
   state; but when the third, which was the true cross, touched her, she
   was immediately healed, and recovered her former strength. In this
   manner then was the genuine cross discovered. The emperor's mother
   erected over the place of the sepulchre a magnificent church, [216] and
   named it New Jerusalem, having built it facing that old and deserted
   city. There she left a portion of the cross, enclosed in a silver case,
   as a memorial to those who might wish to see it: the other part she
   sent to the emperor, who being persuaded that the city would be
   perfectly secure where that relic should be preserved, privately
   enclosed it in his own statue, which stands on a large column of
   porphyry in the forum called Constantine's at Constantinople. I have
   written this from report indeed; but almost all the inhabitants of
   Constantinople affirm that it is true. Moreover the nails with which
   Christ's hands were fastened to the cross (for his mother having found
   these also in the sepulchre had sent them) Constantine took and had
   made into bridle-bits and a helmet, which he used in his military
   expeditions. The emperor supplied all materials for the construction of
   the churches, and wrote to Macarius the bishop to expedite these
   edifices. When the emperor's mother had completed the New Jerusalem,
   she reared another church not at all inferior, over the cave at
   Bethlehem where Christ was born according to the flesh: nor did she
   stop here, but built a third on the mount of his Ascension. So devoutly
   was she affected in these matters, that she would pray in the company
   of women; and inviting the virgins enrolled in the register [217] of
   the churches to a repast, serving them herself, she brought the dishes
   to table. She was also very munificent to the churches and to the poor;
   and having lived a life of piety, she died when about eighty years old.
   Her remains were conveyed to New Rome, the capital, and deposited in
   the imperial sepulchres.

   Chapter XVIII.--The Emperor Constantine abolishes Paganism and erects
   many Churches in Different Places.

   After this the emperor became increasingly attentive to the interests
   of the Christians, and abandoned the heathen superstitions. He
   abolished the combats of the gladiators, and set up his own statues in
   the temples. And as the heathens affirmed that it was Serapis who
   brought up the Nile for the purpose of irrigating Egypt, because a
   cubit was usually carried into his temple, he directed Alexander to
   transfer the cubit to the church. And although they predicted that the
   Nile would not overflow because of the displeasure of Serapis,
   nevertheless there was an inundation in the following year and
   afterwards, taking place regularly: thus it was proved by fact that the
   rising of the Nile was not in consequence of their superstition, but by
   reason of the decrees of Providence. About the same time those
   barbarians the Sarmatians and Goths made incursions on the Roman
   territory; yet the emperor's earnestness respecting the churches was by
   no means abated, but he made suitable provision for both these matters.
   Placing his confidence in the Christian banner, [218] he completely
   vanquished his enemies, so as even to cast off the tribute of gold
   which preceding emperors were accustomed to pay the barbarians: while
   they themselves, being terror-struck at the unexpectedness of their
   defeat, then for the first time embraced the Christian religion, by
   means of which Constantine had been protected. Again he built other
   churches, one of which was erected near the Oak of Mamre, under which
   the Sacred Oracles declare that Abraham entertained angels. For the
   emperor having been informed that altars had been reared under that
   oak, and that pagan sacrifices were offered upon them, censured by
   letter Eusebius bishop of Cæsarea, and ordered that the altars should
   be demolished, and a house of prayer erected beside the oak. He also
   directed that another church should be constructed in Heliopolis in
   Phoenicia, for this reason. Who originally legislated for the
   inhabitants of Heliopolis I am unable to state, but his character and
   morals may be judged of from the [practice of that] city; for the laws
   of the country ordered the women among them to be common, and therefore
   the children born there were of doubtful descent, so that there was no
   distinction of fathers and their offspring. Their virgins also were
   presented for prostitution to the strangers who resorted thither. The
   emperor hastened to correct this evil which had long prevailed among
   them. And passing a solemn law of chastity, he removed the shameful
   evil and provided for the mutual recognition of families. And having
   built churches there, he took care that a bishop and sacred clergy
   should be ordained. Thus he reformed the corrupt manners of the people
   of Heliopolis. He likewise demolished the temple of Venus at Aphaca on
   Mount Libanus, and abolished the infamous deeds which were there
   celebrated. Why need I describe his expulsion of the Pythonic demon
   from Cilicia, by commanding the mansion in which he was lurking to be
   razed from its foundations? So great indeed was the emperor's devotion
   to Christianity, that when he was about to enter on a war with Persia,
   he prepared a tabernacle formed of embroidered linen on the model of a
   church, just as Moses had done in the wilderness; [219] and this so
   constructed as to be adapted to conveyance from place to place, in
   order that he might have a house of prayer even in the most desert
   regions. But the war was not at that time carried on, being prevented
   through dread of the emperor. It would, I conceive, be out of place
   here to describe the emperor's diligence in rebuilding cities and
   converting many villages into cities; as for example Drepanum, to which
   he gave his mother's name, and Constantia in Palestine, so called from
   his sister. For my task is not to enumerate of the emperor's actions,
   but simply such as are connected with Christianity, and especially
   those which relate to the churches. Wherefore I leave to others more
   competent to detail such matters, the emperor's glorious achievements,
   inasmuch as they belong to a different subject, and require a distinct
   treatise. But I myself should have been silent, if the Church had
   remained undisturbed by divisions: for where the subject does not
   supply matter for relation, there is no necessity for a narrator. Since
   however subtle and vain disputation has confused and at the same time
   scattered the apostolic faith of Christianity, I thought it desirable
   to record these things, in order that the transactions of the churches
   might not be lost in obscurity. For accurate information on these
   points procures celebrity among the many, and at the same time renders
   him who is acquainted with them more secure from error, and instructs
   him not to be carried away by any empty sound of sophistical
   argumentation which he may chance to hear.

   Chapter XIX. [220] --In what Manner the Nations in the Interior of
   India were Christianized in the Times of Constantine.

   We must now mention in what manner Christianity was spread in this
   emperor's reign: for it was in his time that the nations both of the
   Indians in the interior, and of the Iberians first embraced the
   Christian faith. But I shall briefly explain why I have used the
   appended expression in the interior. When the apostles went forth by
   lot among the nations, Thomas received the apostleship of the
   Parthians; Matthew was allotted Ethiopia; and Bartholomew the part of
   India contiguous to that country: but the interior India, in which many
   barbarous nations using different languages lived, was not enlightened
   by Christian doctrine before the times of Constantine. I now come to
   speak of the cause which led them to become converts to Christianity. A
   certain philosopher, Meropius, a Tyrian by race, determined to acquaint
   himself with the country of the Indians, being stimulated to this by
   the example of the philosopher Metrodorus, who had previously traveled
   through the region of India. Having taken with him therefore two youths
   to whom he was related, who were by no means ignorant of the Greek
   language, Meropius reached the country by ship; and when he had
   inspected whatever he wished, he touched at a certain place which had a
   safe harbor, for the purpose of procuring some necessaries. It so
   happened that a little before that time the treaty between the Romans
   and Indians had been violated. The Indians, therefore, having seized
   the philosopher and those who sailed with him, killed them all except
   his two youthful kinsmen; but sparing them from compassion for their
   tender age, they sent them as a gift to the king of the Indians. He
   being pleased with the personal appearance of the youths, constituted
   one of them, whose name was Edesius, cup-bearer at his table; the
   other, named Frumentius, he entrusted with the care of the royal
   records. The king dying soon after, left them free, the government
   devolving on his wife and infant son. Now the queen seeing her son thus
   left in his minority, begged the young men to undertake the charge of
   him, until he should become of adult age. Accordingly, the youths
   accepted the task, and entered on the administration of the kingdom.
   Thus Frumentius controlled all things and made it a task to enquire
   whether among the Roman merchants trafficking with that country, there
   were any Christians to be found: and having discovered some, he
   informed them who he was, and exhorted them to select and occupy some
   appropriate places for the celebration of Christian worship. In the
   course of a little while he built a house of prayer; and having
   instructed some of the Indians in the principles of Christianity, they
   fitted them for participation in the worship. On the young king's
   reaching maturity, Frumentius and his associates resigned to him the
   administration of public affairs, in the management of which they had
   honorably acquitted themselves, and besought permission to return to
   their own country. Both the king and his mother entreated them to
   remain; but being desirous of revisiting their native place, they could
   not be prevailed on, and consequently departed. Edesius for his part
   hastened to Tyre to see his parents and kindred; but Frumentius
   arriving at Alexandria, reported the affair to Athanasius the bishop,
   who had but recently been invested with that dignity; and acquainting
   him both with the particulars of his wanderings and the hopes Indians
   had of receiving Christianity. [221] He also begged him to send a
   bishop and clergy there, and by no means to neglect those who might
   thus be brought to salvation. Athanasius having considered how this
   could be most profitably effected, requested Frumentius himself to
   accept the bishopric, declaring that he could appoint no one more
   suitable than he was. Accordingly this was done; Frumentius invested
   with episcopal authority, returned to India and became there a preacher
   of the Gospel, and built several churches, being aided also by divine
   grace, he performed various miracles, healing with the souls also the
   bodily diseases of many. Rufinus assures us that he heard these facts
   from Edesius, who was afterwards ordained to the priesthood at Tyre.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [220] In this chapter Socrates has translated Rufinus (H. E. I. 9)
   almost word for word; and calls those topous idiazontas , which Rufinus
   has termed conventicula. Now conventicula are properly private places
   wherein collects or short prayers are made; and from these places
   churches are distinguished, which belong to the right of the public,
   and are not in the power of any private person. It is to be observed
   that there are reasons for thinking that this conversion of the Indians
   by Frumentius happened in the reign of Constantius and not of
   Constantine' (Valesius). See also Euseb. H. E. V. 10, attributing an
   earlier work to the apostles Matthew and Bartholomew; and Cave, Lives
   of the Apostles. The Indians mentioned in this chapter are no other
   than the Abyssinians. The name India is used as an equivalent of
   Ethiopia. The christianization of Ethiopia is attributed by the
   Ethiopians in their own records to Fremonatos and Sydracos. See Ludolf
   Hist. Eth. III. 2.

   [221] Christianity here must mean Christian instruction.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XX.--In what Manner the Iberians were converted to
   Christianity.

   It is now proper to relate how the Iberians [223] about the same time
   became proselytes to the faith. A certain woman leading a devout and
   chaste life, was, in the providential ordering of God, taken captive by
   the Iberians. Now these Iberians dwell near the Euxine Sea, and are a
   colony of the Iberians of Spain. Accordingly the woman in her captivity
   exercised [224] herself among the barbarians in the practice of virtue:
   for she not only maintained the most rigid continence, but spent much
   time in fastings and prayers. The barbarians observing this were
   astonished at the strangeness of her conduct. It happened then that the
   king's son, then a mere babe, was attacked with disease; the queen,
   according to the custom of the country, sent the child to other women
   to be cured, in the hope that their experience would supply a remedy.
   After the infant had been carried around by its nurse without obtaining
   relief from any of the women, he was at length brought to this captive.
   She had no knowledge of the medical art, and applied no material
   remedy; but taking the child and laying it on her bed which was made of
   horsecloth, in the presence of other females, she simply said, Christ,
   who healed many, will heal this child also'; then having prayed in
   addition to this expression of faith, and called upon God, the boy was
   immediately restored, and continued well from that period. The report
   of this miracle spread itself far and wide among the barbarian women,
   and soon reached the queen, so that the captive became very celebrated.
   Not long afterwards the queen herself having fallen sick sent for the
   captive woman. Inasmuch as she being a person of modest and retiring
   manners excused herself from going, the queen was conveyed to her. The
   captive did the same to her as she had done to her son before; and
   immediately the disease was removed. And the queen thanked the
   stranger; but she replied, this work is not mine, but Christ's, who is
   the Son of God that made the world'; she therefore exhorted her to call
   upon him, and acknowledge the true God. Amazed at his wife's sudden
   restoration to health, the king of the Iberians wished to requite with
   gifts her whom he had understood to be the means of effecting these
   cures; she however said that she needed not riches, inasmuch as she
   possessed as riches the consolations of religion; but that she would
   regard as the greatest present he could offer her, his recognition of
   the God whom she worshiped and declared. With this she sent back the
   gifts. This answer the king treasured up in his mind, and going forth
   to the chase the next day, the following circumstance occurred: a mist
   and thick darkness covered the mountain tops and forests where he was
   hunting, so that their sport was embarrassed, and their path became
   inextricable. In this perplexity the prince earnestly invoked the gods
   whom he worshiped; and as it availed nothing, he at last determined to
   implore the assistance of the captive's God; when scarcely had he begun
   to pray, ere the darkness arising from the mist was completely
   dissipated. Wondering at that which was done, he returned to his palace
   rejoicing, and related to his wife what had happened; he also
   immediately sent for the captive stranger, and begged her to inform him
   who that God was whom she adored. The woman on her arrival caused the
   king of the Iberians to become a preacher of Christ: for having
   believed in Christ through this devoted woman, he convened all the
   Iberians who were under his authority; and when he had declared to them
   what had taken place in reference to the cure of his wife and child not
   only, but also the circumstances connected with the chase, he exhorted
   them to worship the God of the captive. Thus, therefore, both the king
   and the queen were made preachers of Christ, the one addressing their
   male, and the other their female subjects. Moreover, the king having
   ascertained from his prisoner the plan on which churches were
   constructed among the Romans, ordered a church to be built, and
   immediately provided all things necessary for its erection; and the
   edifice was accordingly commenced. But when they came to set up the
   pillars, Divine Providence interposed for the confirmation of the
   inhabitants in the faith; for one of the columns remained immovable,
   and no means were found capable of moving it; but their ropes broke and
   their machinery fell to pieces; at length the workmen gave up all
   further effort and departed. Then was proved the reality of the
   captive's faith in the following manner: going to the place at night
   without the knowledge of any one, she spent the whole time in prayer;
   and by the power of God the pillar was raised, and stood erect in the
   air above its base, yet so as not to touch it. At daybreak the king,
   who was an intelligent person, came himself to inspect the work, and
   seeing the pillar suspended in this position without support, both he
   and his attendants were amazed. Shortly after, in fact before their
   very eyes, the pillar descended on its own pedestal, and there remained
   fixed. Upon this the people shouted, attesting the truth of the king's
   faith, and hymning the praise of the God of the captive. They believed
   thenceforth, and with eagerness raised the rest of the columns, and the
   whole building was soon completed. An embassy was afterwards sent to
   the Emperor Constantine, requesting that henceforth they might be in
   alliance with the Romans, and receive from them a bishop and
   consecrated clergy, since they sincerely believed in Christ. Rufinus
   says that he learned these facts from Bacurius, [225] who was formerly
   one of the petty princes [226] of the Iberians, but subsequently went
   over to the Romans, and was made a captain of the military force in
   Palestine; being at length entrusted with the supreme command in the
   war against the tyrant Maximus, he assisted the Emperor Theodosius. In
   this way then, during the days of Constantine, were the Iberians also
   converted to Christianity.

   [223] These Iberians dwelt on the east shore of the Black Sea in the

   was, or why both the peoples had the same name it is not possible to

   a similar identity of name in peoples living widely apart, compare the
   Gauls of Europe and the Galatæ of Asia.

   Chapter XXI.--Of Anthony the Monk.

   What sort of a man the monk Anthony was, who lived in the same age, in
   the Egyptian desert, and how he openly contended with devils, clearly
   detecting their devices and wily modes of warfare, and how he performed
   many miracles, it would be superfluous for us to say; for Athanasius,
   bishop of Alexandria, has anticipated us, having devoted an entire book
   to his biography. [227] Of such good men there was a large number at
   one time during the years of the Emperor Constantine.

   Chapter XXII.--Manes, the Founder of the Manichæan Heresy, and on his
   Origin.

   But amidst the good wheat, tares are accustomed to spring up; for envy
   loves to plot insidiously against the good. Hence it was that a little
   while before the time of Constantine, a species of heathenish
   Christianity made its appearance together with that which was real;
   just as false prophets sprang up among the true, and false apostles
   among the true apostles. For at that time a dogma of Empedocles, the
   heathen philosopher, by means of Manichæus, assumed the form of
   Christian doctrine. Eusebius Pamphilus has indeed mentioned this person
   in the seventh book of his Ecclesiastical History, [228] but has not
   entered into minute details concerning him. Wherefore, I deem it
   incumbent on me to supply some particulars which he has left unnoticed:
   thus it will be known who this Manichæus was, whence he came, and what
   was the nature of his presumptuous daring.

   A Saracen named Scythian married a captive from the Upper Thebes. On
   her account he dwelt in Egypt, and having versed himself in the
   learning of the Egyptians, he subtly introduced the theory of
   Empedocles and Pythagoras among the doctrines of the Christian faith.
   Asserting that there were two natures, a good and an evil one, he
   termed, as Empedocles had done, the latter Discord, and the former
   Friendship. Of this Scythian, Buddas, who had been previously called
   Terebinthus, became a disciple; and he having proceeded to Babylon,
   which the Persians inhabit, made many extravagant statements respecting
   himself, declaring that he was born of a virgin, and brought up in the
   mountains. The same man afterwards composed four books, one he entitled
   The Mysteries, another The Gospel, a third The Treasure, and the fourth
   Heads [Summaries]; but pretending to perform some mystic rites, he was
   hurled down a precipice by a spirit, [229] and so perished. A certain
   woman at whose house he had lodged buried him, and taking possession of
   his property, bought a boy about seven years old whose name was
   Cubricus: this lad she enfranchised, and having given him a liberal
   education, she soon after died, leaving him all that belonged to
   Terebinthus, including the books he had written on the principles
   inculcated by Scythian. Cubricus, the freedman, taking these things
   with him and having withdrawn into the regions of Persia, changed his
   name, calling himself Manes; and disseminated the books of Buddas or
   Terebinthus among his deluded followers as his own. Now the contents of
   these treatises apparently agree with Christianity in expression, but
   are pagan in sentiment: for Manichæus being an atheist, incited his
   disciples to acknowledge a plurality of gods, and taught them to
   worship the sun. He also introduced the doctrine of Fate, denying human
   free-will; and affirmed a transmutation [230] of bodies, clearly
   following the opinions of Empedocles, Pythagoras, and the Egyptians. He
   denied that Christ existed in the flesh, asserting that he was an
   apparition; and rejected moreover the law and the prophets, calling
   himself the Comforter,'--all of which dogmas are totally at variance
   with the orthodox faith of the church. In his epistles he even dared to
   call himself an apostle; but for a pretension so unfounded he brought
   upon himself merited retribution in the following manner. The son of
   the Persian monarch having been attacked with disease, his father
   became anxious for his recovery, and left no means untried in order to
   effect it; and as he had heard of the wonder-working of Manichæus, and
   thinking that these miracles were real, he sent for him as an apostle,
   trusting that through him his son might be restored. He accordingly
   presented himself at court, and with his assumed manner undertook the
   treatment of the young prince. But the king seeing that the child died
   in his hands shut up the deceiver in prison, with the intention of
   putting him to death. However, he contrived to escape, and fled into
   Mesopotamia; but the king of Persia having discovered that he was
   dwelling there, caused him to be brought thence by force, and after
   having flayed him alive, he stuffed his skin with chaff, and suspended
   it in front of the gate of the city. These things we state not having
   manufactured them ourselves, but collected from a book entitled The
   disputation of Archelaus bishop of Caschara (one of the cities of
   Mesopotamia). [231] For Archelaus himself states that he disputed with
   Manichæus face to face, and mentions the circumstances connected with
   his life to which we have now alluded. Envy thus delights, as we before
   remarked, to be insidiously at work in the midst of a prosperous
   condition of affairs. But for what reason the goodness of God permits
   this to be done, whether he wishes thereby to bring into activity the
   excellence of the principles of the church, and to utterly break down
   the self-importance which is wont to unite itself with faith; or for
   what other cause, is, at the same time, a difficult question, and not
   relevant to the present discussion. For our object is neither to
   examine the soundness of doctrinal views, nor to analyze the mysterious
   reasons for the providences and judgments of God; but to detail as
   faithfully as possible the history of transactions which have taken
   place in the churches. The way in which the superstition of the
   Manichæans sprang up a little before the time of Constantine has been
   thus described; now let us return to the times and events which are the
   proper subjects of this history.

   Chapter XXIII.--Eusebius Bishop of Nicomedia, and Theognis Bishop of
   Nicæa, having recovered Confidence, endeavor to subvert the Nicene
   Creed, by plotting against Athanasius.

   The partisans of Eusebius and Theognis having returned from their
   exile, these latter were reinstated in their churches, having expelled,
   as we observed, those who had been ordained in their stead. Moreover,
   they came into great consideration with the emperor, who honored them
   exceedingly, as those who had returned from error to the orthodox
   faith. They, however, abused the license thus afforded them, by
   exciting greater commotions in the world than they had done before;
   being instigated to this by two causes--on the one hand the Arian
   heresy with which they had been previously infected, and bitter
   animosity against Athanasius on the other, because he had so vigorously
   withstood them in the Synod while the articles of faith were under
   discussion. And in the first place they objected to the ordination of
   Athanasius partly as a person unworthy of the prelacy, and partly
   because he had been elected by disqualified persons. But when
   Athanasius had shown himself superior to this calumny (for having
   assumed control of the church of Alexandria, he ardently contended for
   the Nicene creed), then Eusebius exerted himself to the utmost
   insidiously to cause the removal of Athanasius and to bring Arius back
   to Alexandria; for he thought that thus only he should be able to
   expunge the doctrine of consubstantiality, and introduce Arianism.
   Eusebius therefore wrote to Athanasius, desiring him to re-admit Arius
   and his adherents into the church. Now the tone of his letter indeed
   was that of entreaty, but openly he menaced him. And as Athanasius
   would by no means accede to this, he endeavored to induce the emperor
   to give Arius an audience, and then permit him to return to Alexandria:
   and by what means he attained his object, I shall mention in its proper
   place. Meanwhile before this another commotion was raised in the
   church. In fact, her own children again disturbed her peace. Eusebius
   Pamphilus says, [232] that immediately after the Synod, Egypt became
   agitated by intestine divisions: not assigning, however, the reason for
   this, so that hence he has won the reputation of disingenuousness, and
   of avoiding to specify the causes of these dissensions, from a
   determination on his part not to give his sanction to the proceedings
   at Nicæa. Yet as we ourselves have discovered from various letters
   which the bishops wrote to one another after the Synod, the term
   homoousios troubled some of them. So that while they occupied
   themselves in a too minute investigation of its import, they roused the
   strife against each other; it seemed not unlike a contest in the dark;
   for neither party appeared to understand distinctly the grounds on
   which they calumniated one another. Those who objected to the word
   homoousios, conceived that those who approved it favored the opinion of
   Sabellius [233] and Montanus; [234] they therefore called them
   blasphemers, as subverting the existence of the Son of God. And again
   the advocates of this term, charging their opponents with polytheism,
   inveighed against them as introducers of heathen superstitions.
   Eustathius, bishop of Antioch, accuses Eusebius Pamphilus of perverting
   the Nicene Creed; Eusebius again denies that he violates that
   exposition of the faith, and recriminates, saying that Eustathius was a
   defender of the opinion of Sabellius. In consequence of these
   misunderstandings, each of them wrote as if contending against
   adversaries: and although it was admitted on both sides that the Son of
   God has a distinct person and existence, and all acknowledged that
   there is one God in three Persons, yet from what cause I am unable to
   divine, they could not agree among themselves, and therefore could in
   no way endure to be at peace.

   [234] It is not clear why Socrates joins the name of Montanus to that

   Chapter XXIV.--Of the Synod held at Antioch, which deposed Eustathius,
   Bishop of Antioch, on whose account a Sedition broke out and almost
   ruined the City.

   Having therefore convened a Synod at Antioch, they deposed Eustathius,
   as a supporter of the Sabellian heresy, rather than of the tenets which
   the council at Nicæa had formulated. As some affirm [this measure was
   taken] for other and unsatisfactory reasons, though none other have
   been openly assigned: this is a matter of common occurrence; the
   bishops are accustomed to do this in all cases, accusing and
   pronouncing impious those whom they depose, but not explaining their
   warrant for so doing. George, bishop of Laodicea in Syria, one of the
   number of those who abominated the term homoousios, assures us in his
   Encomium of Eusebius Emisenus, that they deposed Eustathius as favoring
   Sabellianism, on the impeachment of Cyrus, bishop of Beroea. Of
   Eusebius Emisenus we shall speak elsewhere in due order. [235] George
   has written of Eustathius [somewhat inconsistently]; for after
   asserting that he was accused by Cyrus of maintaining the heresy of
   Sabellius, he tells us again that Cyrus himself was convicted of the
   same error, and degraded for it. Now how was it possible that Cyrus
   should accuse Eustathius as a Sabellian, when he inclined to
   Sabellianism himself? It appears likely therefore that Eustathius must
   have been condemned on other grounds. At that time, however, there
   arose a dangerous sedition at Antioch on account of his deposition: for
   when they proceeded to the election of a successor, so fierce a
   dissension was kindled, as to threaten the whole city with destruction.
   The populace was divided into two factions, one of which vehemently
   contended for the translation of Eusebius Pamphilus from Cæsarea in
   Palestine to Antioch; the other equally insisted on the reinstatement
   of Eustathius. And the populace of the city were infected with the
   spirit of partisanship in this quarrel among the Christians, a military
   force was arrayed on both sides with hostile intent, so that a bloody
   collision would have taken place, had not God and the dread of the
   emperor repressed the violence of the multitude. For the emperor
   through letters, and Eusebius by refusing to accept the bishopric,
   served to allay the ferment: on which account that prelate was
   exceedingly admired by the emperor, who wrote to him commending his
   prudent determination, and congratulating him as one who was considered
   worthy of being bishop not of one city merely, but of almost the whole
   world. Consequently it is said that the episcopal chair of the church
   at Antioch was vacant for eight consecutive years after this period;
   [236] but at length by the exertions of those who aimed at the
   subversion of the Nicene creed, Euphronius was duly installed. This is
   the amount of my information respecting the Synod held at Antioch on
   account of Eustathius. Immediately after these events Eusebius, who had
   long before left Berytus, and was at that time presiding over the
   church at Nicomedia, strenuously exerted himself in connection to those
   of his party, to bring back Arius to Alexandria. But how they managed
   to effect this, and by what means the emperor was prevailed on to admit
   both Arius and with him Euzoïus into his presence must now be related.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [235] See II. 9.

   [236] Socrates is in error here, as according to Eusebius (H. E. X. 1),
   immediately after the deposition of Eustathius and his own refusal of
   the bishopric of Antioch, Paulinus was transferred there from the see
   of Tyre. This was in 329 a.d., so that no vacancy of eight years
   intervened.

   Chapter XXV.--Of the Presbyter who exerted himself for the Recall of
   Arius. [237]

   The Emperor Constantine had a sister named Constantia, the widow of
   Licinius, who had for some time shared the imperial dignity with
   Constantine, but had assumed tyrannical powers and had been put to
   death in consequence. This princess maintained in her household
   establishment a certain confidential presbyter, tinctured with the
   dogmas of Arianism; Eusebius and others having prompted him, he took
   occasion in his familiar conversations with Constantia, to insinuate
   that the Synod had done Arius injustice, and that the common report
   concerning him was not true. Constantia gave full credence to the
   presbyter's assertions, but durst not report them to the emperor. Now
   it happened that she became dangerously ill, and her brother visited
   her daily. As the disease became aggravated and she expected to die,
   she commended this presbyter to the emperor, testifying to his
   diligence and piety, as well as his devoted loyalty to his sovereign.
   She died soon after, whereupon the presbyter became one of the most
   confidential persons about the emperor; and having gradually increased
   in freedom of speech, he repeated to the emperor what he had before
   stated to his sister, affirming that Arius had no other views than the
   sentiments avowed by the Synod; and that if he were admitted to the
   imperial presence, he would give his full assent to what the Synod had
   decreed: he added, moreover, that he had been unreasonably slandered.
   The presbyter's words appeared strange to the emperor, and he said, If
   Arius subscribes with the Synod and holds its views, I will both give
   him an audience, and send him back to Alexandria with honor.' Having
   thus said, he immediately wrote to him in these words:

   Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to Arius.'

   It was intimated to your reverence some time since, that you might come
   to my court, in order to obtain an interview with us. We are not a
   little surprised that you did not do this immediately. Wherefore having
   at once mounted a public vehicle, hasten to arrive at our court; that
   when you have experienced our clemency and regard for you, you may
   return to your own country. May God protect you, beloved. Dated the
   twenty-fifth of November.

   This was the letter of the emperor to Arius. And I cannot but admire
   the ardent zeal which the prince manifested for religion: for it
   appears from this document that he had often before exhorted Arius to
   change his views, inasmuch as he censures his delaying to return to the
   truth, although he had himself written frequently to him. Now on the
   receipt of this letter, Arius came to Constantinople accompanied by
   Euzoïus, whom Alexander had divested of his deaconship when he
   excommunicated Arius and his partisans. The emperor accordingly
   admitted them to his presence, and asked them whether they would agree
   to the creed. And when they readily gave their assent, he ordered them
   to deliver to him a written statement of their faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [237] Cf. Rufinus, H. E. I. 11. The fact that the name of this
   presbyter is not mentioned, and Athanasius' apparent ignorance of the
   story, together with the untrustworthiness of Rufinus, throw suspicion
   on the authenticity of this account. Cf. also ch. 39, note 2.

   Chapter XXVI.--Arius, on being recalled, presents a Recantation to the
   Emperor, and pretends to accept the Nicene Creed.

   They having drawn up a declaration to the following effect, presented
   it to the emperor.

   Arius and Euzoïus, to our Most Religious and Pious Lord, the Emperor
   Constantine.

   In accordance with the command of your devout piety, sovereign lord, we
   declare our faith, and before God profess in writing, that we and our
   adherents believe as follows:

   We believe in one God the Father Almighty: and in the Lord Jesus Christ
   his Son, who was begotten [238] of him before all ages, God the Word
   through whom all things were made, both those which are in the heavens
   and those upon the earth; who descended, and became incarnate, and
   suffered, and rose again, ascended into the heavens, and will again
   come to judge the living and the dead. [We believe] also in the Holy
   Spirit, and in the resurrection of the flesh, and in the life of the
   coming age, and in the kingdom of the heavens, and in one Catholic
   Church of God, extending from one end of the earth to the other.

   This faith we have received from the holy gospels, the Lord therein
   saying to his disciples: [239] "Go and teach all nations, baptizing
   them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Spirit." If we do not so believe and truly receive the Father, the Son,
   and the Holy Spirit, as the whole Catholic Church and the holy
   Scriptures teach (in which we believe in every respect), God is our
   judge both now, and in the coming judgment. Wherefore we beseech your
   piety, most devout emperor, that we who are persons consecrated to the
   ministry, and holding the faith and sentiments of the church and of the
   holy Scriptures, may by your pacific and devoted piety be reunited to
   our mother, the Church, all superfluous questions and disputings being
   avoided: that so both we and the whole church being at peace, may in
   common offer our accustomed prayers for your tranquil reign, and on
   behalf of your whole family.'

   Chapter XXVII.--Arius having returned to Alexandria with the Emperor's
   Consent, and not being received by Athanasius, the Partisans of
   Eusebius bring Many Charges against Athanasius before the Emperor.

   Arius having thus satisfied the emperor, returned to Alexandria. But
   his artifice for suppressing the truth did not succeed; for on his
   arrival at Alexandria, as Athanasius would not receive him, but turned
   away from him as a pest, he attempted to excite a fresh commotion in
   that city by disseminating his heresy. Then indeed both Eusebius
   himself wrote, and prevailed on the emperor also to write, in order
   that Arius and his partisans might be readmitted into the church.
   Athanasius nevertheless wholly refused to receive them, and wrote to
   inform the emperor in reply, that it was impossible for those who had
   once rejected the faith, and had been anathematized, to be again
   received into communion on their return. But the emperor, provoked at
   this answer, menaced Athanasius in these terms:

   Since you have been apprised of my will, afford unhindered access into
   the church to all those who are desirous of entering it. For if it
   shall be intimated to me that you have prohibited any of those claiming
   to be reunited to the church, or have hindered their admission, I will
   forthwith send some one who at my command shall depose you, and drive
   you into exile.'

   The emperor wrote thus from a desire of promoting the public good, and
   because he did not wish to see the church ruptured; for he labored
   earnestly to bring them all into harmony. Then indeed the partisans of
   Eusebius, ill-disposed towards Athanasius, imagining they had found a
   seasonable opportunity, welcomed the emperor's displeasure as an
   auxiliary to their own purpose: and on this account they raised a great
   disturbance, endeavoring to eject him from his bishopric; for they
   entertained the hope that the Arian doctrine would prevail only upon
   the removal of Athanasius. The chief conspirators against him were
   Eusebius bishop of Nicomedia, Theognis of Nicæa, Maris of Chalcedon,
   Ursacius of Singidnum in Upper Moesia, and Valens of Mursa in Upper
   Pannonia. These persons suborn by bribes certain of the Melitian heresy
   to fabricate various charges against Athanasius; and first they accuse
   him through the Melitians Ision, Eudæmon and Callinicus, of having
   ordered the Egyptians to pay a linen garment as tribute to the church
   at Alexandria. But this calumny was immediately disproved by Alypius
   and Macarius, presbyters of the Alexandrian church, who then happened
   to be at Nicomedia; they having convinced the emperor that these
   statements to the prejudice of Athanasius were false. Wherefore the
   emperor by letter severely censured his accusers, but urged Athanasius
   to come to him. But before he came the Eusebian faction anticipating
   his arrival, added to their former accusation the charge of another
   crime of a still more serious nature than the former; charging
   Athanasius with plotting against his sovereign, and with having sent
   for treasonable purposes a chest full of gold to one Philumenus. When,
   however, the emperor had himself investigated this matter at Psamathia,
   which is in the suburbs of Nicomedia, and had found Athanasius
   innocent, he dismissed him with honor; and wrote with his own hand to
   the church at Alexandria to assure them that their bishop had been
   falsely accused. It would indeed have been both proper and desirable to
   have passed over in silence the subsequent attacks which the Eusebians
   made upon Athanasius, lest from these circumstances the Church of
   Christ should be judged unfavorably of by those who are adverse to its
   interests. [240] But since having been already committed to writing,
   they have become known to everybody, I have on that account deemed it
   necessary to make as cursory allusion to these things as possible, the
   particulars of which would require a special treatise. Whence the
   slanderous accusation originated, and the character of those who
   devised it, I shall now therefore state in brief. Mareotes [241] is a
   district of Alexandria; there are contained in it very many villages,
   and an abundant population, with numerous splendid churches; these
   churches are all under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Alexandria,
   and are subject to his city as parishes. [242] There was in this region
   a person named Ischyras, who had been guilty of an act deserving of
   many deaths; [243] for although he had never been admitted to holy
   orders, he had the audacity to assume the title of presbyter, and to
   exercise sacred functions belonging to the priesthood. But having been
   detected in his sacrilegious career, he made his escape thence and
   sought refuge in Nicomedia, where he implored the protection of the
   party of Eusebius; who from their hatred to Athanasius, not only
   received him as a presbyter, but even promised to confer upon him the
   dignity of the episcopacy, if he would frame an accusation against
   Athanasius, listening as a pretext for this to whatever stories
   Ischyras had invented. For he spread a report that he had suffered
   dreadfully in consequence of an assault; and that Macarius had rushed
   furiously toward the altar, had overturned the table, and broken a
   mystical cup: he added also that he had burnt the sacred books. As a
   reward for this accusation, the Eusebian faction, as I have said,
   promised him a bishopric; foreseeing that the charges against Macarius
   would involve, along with the accused party, Athanasius, under whose
   orders he would seem to have acted. But this charge they formulated
   later; before it they devised another full of the bitterest malignity,
   to which I shall now advert. Having by some means, I know not what,
   obtained a man's hand; whether they themselves had murdered any one,
   and cut off his hand, or had severed it from some dead body, God knows
   and the authors of the deed: but be that as it may, they publicly
   exposed it as the hand of Arsenius, a Melitian bishop, while they kept
   the alleged owner of it concealed. This hand, they asserted, had been
   made use of by Athanasius in the performance of certain magic arts; and
   therefore it was made the gravest ground of accusation which these
   calumniators had concerted against him: but as it generally happens,
   all those who entertained any pique against Athanasius came forward at
   the same time with a variety of other charges. When the emperor was
   informed of these proceedings, he wrote to his nephew Dalmatius the
   censor, who then had his residence at Antioch in Syria, directing him
   to order the accused parties to be brought before him, and after due
   investigation, to inflict punishment on such as might be convicted. He
   also sent thither Eusebius and Theognis, that the case might be tried
   in their presence. When Athanasius knew that he was to be summoned
   before the censor, he sent into Egypt to make a strict search after
   Arsenius; and he ascertained indeed that he was secreted there, but was
   unable to apprehend him, because he often changed his place of
   concealment. Meanwhile the emperor suppressed the trial which was to
   have been held before the censor, on the following account.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [240] From the sentiments expressed here may be inferred the respect of
   the author for the church. His view on the suppression of facts which
   did not redound to the honor of the church does not show a very high
   ideal of history, but it bespeaks a laudable regard for the good name
   of Christianity.

   [241] This description is probably dependent on Athanasius, who says in
   his Apologia contra Arianos, 85, Mareotes is a region of Alexandria. In
   that region there never was a bishop or a deputy bishop; but the
   churches of the whole region are subject to the bishop of Alexandria.
   Each of the presbyters has separate villages, which are
   numerous,--sometimes ten or more.' Ischyras was probably a resident of
   one of the obscurest of these villages; and it can be seen that what is
   said of his doings here could easily come to pass.

   [242] paroikia = later parochia'; hence the derivatives.

   [243] Another evidence of the author's reverence for the institutions
   of religion. For subsequent history of Ischyras, see II. 20.

   Chapter XXVIII.--On Account of the Charges against Athanasius, the
   Emperor convokes a Synod of Bishops at Tyre.

   The emperor had ordered a Synod of bishops to be present at the
   consecration of the church which he had erected at Jerusalem. He
   therefore directed that, as a secondary matter, they should on their
   way first assemble at Tyre, to examine into the charges against
   Athanasius; in order that all cause of contention being removed there,
   they might the more peacefully perform the inaugural ceremonies [244]
   in the dedication of the church of God. This was the thirtieth year of
   Constantine's reign, and sixty bishops were thus convened at Tyre from
   various places, on the summons of Dionysius the consul. As to Macarius
   the presbyter, he was conducted from Alexandria in chains, under a
   military escort; while Athanasius was unwilling to go thither, not so
   much from dread, because he was innocent of the charges made, as
   because he feared lest any innovations should be made on the decisions
   of the council at Nicæa; he was, however, constrained to be present by
   the menacing letters of the emperor. For it had been written him that
   if he did not come voluntarily, he should be brought by force.

   Chapter XXIX.--Of Arsenius, and his Hand which was said to have been
   cut off.

   The special providence of God drove Arsenius also to Tyre; for,
   disregarding the injunctions he had received from the accusers who had
   bribed him, he went thither disguised to see what would be done. It by
   some means happened that the servants of Archelaus, the governor of the
   province, heard some persons at an inn affirm that Arsenius, who was
   reported to have been murdered, was concealed in the house of one of
   the citizens. Having heard this and marked the individuals by whom this
   statement was made, they communicated the information to their master,
   who causing strict search to be made for the man immediately,
   discovered and properly secured him; after which he gave notice to
   Athanasius that he need not be under any alarm, inasmuch as Arsenius
   was alive and there present. Arsenius on being apprehended, at first
   denied that he was the person; but Paul, bishop of Tyre, who had
   formerly known him, established his identity. Divine providence having
   thus disposed matters, Athanasius was shortly after summoned by the
   Synod; and as soon as he presented himself, his traducers exhibited the
   hand, and pressed their charge. He managed the affair with great
   prudence, for he enquired of those present, as well as of his accusers,
   who were the persons who knew Arsenius? and several having answered
   that they knew him, he caused Arsenius to be introduced, having his
   hands covered by his cloak. Then he again asked them, Is this the
   person who has lost a hand?' All were astonished at the unexpectedness
   of this procedure, except those who knew whence the hand had been cut
   off; for the rest thought that Arsenius was really deficient of a hand,
   and expected that the accused would make his defense in some other way.
   But Athanasius turning back the cloak of Arsenius on one side showed
   one of the man's hands; again, while some were supposing that the other
   hand was wanting, permitting them to remain a short time in doubt
   afterward he turned back the cloak on the other side and exposed the
   other hand. Then addressing himself to those present, he said,
   Arsenius, as you see, is found to have two hands: let my accusers show
   the place whence the third was cut off.' [245]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [245] A full account of the circumstances narrated in this and the
   following chapters is given by Athanasius in his Apol. contra Arianos,
   65, 71 and 72. Parallel accounts may also be found in Sozom. II. 25;
   Theodoret, H. E. I. 28; Rufinus, H. E. X. 17; Philostorgius, II. 11.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXX.--Athanasius is found Innocent of what he was accused; his
   Accusers take to Flight.

   Matters having been brought to this issue with regard to Arsenius, the
   contrivers of this imposture were reduced to perplexity; and Achab,
   [246] who was also called John, one of the principal accusers, having
   slipped out of court in the tumult, effected his escape. Thus
   Athanasius cleared himself from this charge, without having recourse to
   any pleading; [247] for he was confident that the sight only of
   Arsenius alive would confound his calumniators.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [246] In Athanasius' account (Apol. c. Arian. 65) this man's name is
   given as 'Archaph(Archaph), which is an Egyptian name; its assonance
   with the biblical 'Achaab may have made the latter a current
   appellation. John was no doubt his monastic name.

   Chapter XXXI.--When the Bishops will not listen to Athanasius' Defense
   on the Second Charge, he betakes himself to the Emperor.

   But in refuting the false allegations against Macarius, he made use of
   legal forms; taking exception in the first place to Eusebius and his
   party, as his enemies, protesting against the injustice of any man's
   being tried by his adversaries. He next insisted on its being proved
   that his accuser Ischyras had really obtained the dignity of presbyter;
   for so he had been designated in the indictment. But as the judges
   would not allow any of these objections, the case of Macarius was
   entered into, and the informers being found deficient of proofs, the
   hearing of the matter was postponed, until some persons should have
   gone into Mareotis, in order that all doubtful points might be examined
   on the spot. Athanasius seeing that those very individuals were to be
   sent to whom he had taken exception (for the persons sent were
   Theognis, Maris, Theodorus, Macedonius, Valens, and Ursacius),
   exclaimed that their procedure was both treacherous and fraudulent; for
   that it was unjust that the presbyter Macarius should be detained in
   bonds, while the accuser together with the judges who were his
   adversaries, were permitted to go, in order that an ex parte collection
   of the facts in evidence might be made.' Having made this protest
   before the whole Synod and Dionysius the governor of the province, and
   finding that no one paid any attention to his appeal, he privately
   withdrew. Those, therefore, who were sent to Mareotis, having made an
   ex parte [248] investigation, held that what the accuser said was true.

   Chapter XXXII.--On the Departure of Athanasius, those who composed the
   Synod vote his Deposition.

   Thus Athanasius departed, hastening to the emperor, and the Synod in
   the first place condemned him in his absence; and when the result of
   the enquiry which had been instituted at Mareotis was presented, they
   voted to depose him; loading him with opprobrious epithets in their
   sentence of deposition, but being wholly silent respecting the
   disgraceful defeat of the charge of murder brought by his calumniators.
   They moreover received into communion Arsenius, who was reported to
   have been murdered; and he who had formerly been a bishop of the
   Melitian heresy subscribed to the deposition of Athanasius as bishop of
   the city of Hypselopolis. Thus by an extraordinary course of
   circumstances, the alleged victim of assassination by Athanasius, was
   found alive to assist in deposing him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXXIII.--The Members of the Synod proceed from Tyre to
   Jerusalem, and having celebrated the Dedication of the New Jerusalem,'
   receive Arius and his Followers into Communion.

   Letters in the meantime were brought from the emperor directing those
   who composed the Synod to hasten to the New Jerusalem: [249] having
   therefore immediately left Tyre, they set forward with all despatch to
   Jerusalem, where, after celebrating a festival in connection with the
   consecration of the place, they readmitted Arius [250] and his
   adherents into communion, in obedience, as they said, to the wishes of
   the emperor, who had signified in his communication to them, that he
   was fully satisfied respecting the faith of Arius and Euzoïus. They
   moreover wrote to the church at Alexandria, [251] stating that all envy
   being now banished, the affairs of the church were established in
   peace: and that since Arius had by his recantation acknowledged the
   truth, it was but just that, being thenceforth a member of the church,
   he should also be henceforth received by them, alluding to the
   banishment of Athanasius [in their statement that all envy was now
   banished']. At the same time they sent information of what had been
   done to the emperor, in terms nearly to the same effect. But whilst the
   bishops were engaged in these transactions, other letters came
   unexpectedly from the emperor, intimating that Athanasius had fled to
   him for protection; and that it was necessary for them on his account
   to come to Constantinople. This unanticipated communication from the
   emperor was as follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [249] See above, ch. 17.

   [250] Arius, the originator of the Arian heresy, died before the
   council at Jerusalem; hence Valesius infers that this Arius must be
   another man of the same name mentioned in the encyclical of Alexander
   of Alexandria as a partisan of the arch-heretic. Cf. ch. 6.

   Chapter XXXIV.--The Emperor summons the Synod to himself by Letter, in
   order that the Charges against Athanasius might be carefully examined
   before him.

   Victor Constantine Maximus Augustus, to the bishops convened at Tyre.

   I am indeed ignorant of the decisions which have been made by your
   Council with so much turbulence and storm: but the truth seems to have
   been perverted by some tumultuous and disorderly proceedings: because,
   that is to say, in your mutual love of contention, which you seem
   desirous of perpetuating, you disregard the consideration of those
   things which are acceptable to God. It will, however, I trust, be the
   work of Divine Providence to dissipate the mischiefs resulting from
   this jealous rivalry, as soon as they shall have been detected; and to
   make it apparent to us, whether ye who have been convened have had
   regard to truth, and whether your decisions on the subjects which have
   been submitted to your judgment have been made apart from partiality or
   prejudice. Wherefore it is indispensable that you should all without
   delay attend upon my piety, that you may yourselves give a strict
   account of your transactions. For what reason I have deemed it proper
   to write thus, and to summon you before me, you will learn from what
   follows. As I was making my entry into the city which bears our name,
   in this our most flourishing home, Constantinople,--and it happened
   that I was riding on horseback at the time,--suddenly the Bishop
   Athanasius, with certain ecclesiastics whom he had around him,
   presented himself so unexpectedly in our path, as to produce an
   occasion of consternation. For the Omniscient God is my witness that at
   first sight I did not recognize him until some of my attendants, in
   answer to my enquiry, informed me, as was very natural, both who he
   was, and what injustice he had suffered. At that time indeed I neither
   conversed, nor held any communication with him. But as he repeatedly
   entreated an audience, and I had not only refused it, but almost
   ordered that he should be removed from my presence, he said with
   greater boldness, that he petitioned for nothing more than that you
   might be summoned hither, in order that in our presence, he, driven by
   necessity to such a course, might have a fair opportunity afforded him
   of complaining of his wrongs. Wherefore as this seems reasonable, and
   consistent with the equity of my government, I willingly gave
   instructions that these things should be written to you. My command
   therefore is, that all, as many as composed the Synod convened at Tyre,
   should forthwith hasten to the court of our clemency, in order that
   from the facts themselves you may make clear the purity and integrity
   of your decision in my presence, whom you cannot but own to be a true
   servant of God. It is in consequence of the acts of my religious
   service towards God that peace is everywhere reigning; and that the
   name of God is sincerely had in reverence even among the barbarians
   themselves, who until now were ignorant of the truth. Now it is evident
   that he who knows not the truth, does not have a true knowledge of God
   also: yet, as I before said even the barbarians on my account, who am a
   genuine servant of God, have acknowledged and learned to worship him,
   whom they have perceived in very deed protecting and caring for me
   everywhere. So that from dread of us chiefly, they have been thus
   brought to the knowledge of the true God whom they now worship.
   Nevertheless we who pretend to have a religious veneration for (I will
   not say who guard) the holy mysteries of his church, we, I say, do
   nothing but what tends to discord and animosity, and to speak plainly,
   to the destruction of the human race. But hasten, as I have already
   said, all of you to us as speedily as possible: and be assured that I
   shall endeavor with all my power to cause that what is contained in the
   Divine Law may be preserved inviolate, on which neither stigma nor
   reproach shall be able to fasten itself; and this will come to pass
   when its enemies, who under cover of the sacred profession introduce
   numerous and diversified blasphemies, are dispersed, broken to pieces,
   and altogether annihilated.

   Chapter XXXV.--The Synod not having come to the Emperor, the Partisans
   of Eusebius accuse Athanasius of having threatened to divert the Corn
   supplied to Constantinople from Alexandria: the Emperor being
   exasperated at this banishes Athanasius into Gaul. [252]

   This letter rendered those who constituted the Synod very fearful,
   wherefore most of them returned to their respective cities. But
   Eusebius, Theognis, Maris, Patrophilus, Ursacius, and Valens, having
   gone to Constantinople, would not permit any further enquiry to be
   instituted concerning the broken cup, the overturned communion table,
   and the murder of Arsenius; but they had recourse to another calumny,
   informing the emperor that Athanasius had threatened to prohibit the
   sending of corn which was usually conveyed from Alexandria to
   Constantinople. They affirmed also that these menaces were heard from
   the lips of Athanasius by the bishops Adamantius, Anubion, Arbathion
   and Peter, for slander is most prevalent when of the assertor of it
   appears to be a person worthy of credit. Hence the emperor being
   deceived, and excited to indignation against Athanasius by this charge,
   at once condemned him to exile, ordering him to reside in the Gauls.
   Now some affirm that the emperor came to this decision with a view to
   the establishment of unity in the church, since Athanasius was
   inexorable in his refusal to hold any communion with Arius and his
   adherents. He accordingly took up his abode at Treves, a city of Gaul.

   Chapter XXXVI.--Of Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra, and Asterius the
   Sophist.

   The bishops assembled at Constantinople deposed also Marcellus bishop
   of Ancyra, a city of Galatia Minor, on this account. A certain
   rhetorician of Cappadocia named Asterius having abandoned his art, and
   professed himself a convert to Christianity, undertook the composition
   of some treatises, which are still extant, in which he commended the
   dogmas of Arius; asserting that Christ is the power of God, in the same
   sense as the locust and the palmer-worm are said by Moses to be the
   power of God, [253] with other similar utterances. Now Asterius was in
   constant association with the bishops, and especially with those of
   their number who did not discountenance the Arian doctrine: he also
   attended their Synods, in the hope of insinuating himself into the
   bishopric of some city: but he failed to obtain ordination, in
   consequence of having sacrificed during the persecution. [254] Going
   therefore throughout the cities of Syria, he read in public the books
   which he had composed. Marcellus being informed of this, and wishing to
   counteract his influence, in his over-anxiety to confute him, fell into
   the diametrically opposite error; for he dared to say, as the
   Samosatene [255] had done, that Christ was a mere man. When the bishops
   then convened at Jerusalem had intelligence of these things, they took
   no notice of Asterius, because he was not enrolled even in the
   catalogue of ordained priests; but they insisted that Marcellus, as a
   priest, should give an account of the book which he had written.
   Finding that he entertained Paul of Samosata's sentiments, they
   required him to retract his opinion; and he being thoroughly ashamed of
   himself, promised to burn his book. But the convention of bishops being
   hastily dissolved by the emperor's summoning them to Constantinople,
   the Eusebians on their arrival at that city, again took the case of
   Marcellus into consideration; and as Marcellus refused to fulfil his
   promise of burning his untimely book, those present deposed him, and
   sent Basil into Ancyra in his stead. Moreover Eusebius wrote a
   refutation of this work in three books, in which he exposed its
   erroneous doctrine. Marcellus however was afterwards reinstated [256]
   in his bishopric by the Synod at Sardica, on his assurance that his
   book had been misunderstood, and that on that account he was supposed
   to favor the Samosatene's views. But of this we shall speak more fully
   in its proper place.

   Chapter XXXVII.--After the Banishment of Athanasius, Arius having been
   sent for by the Emperor, raises a Disturbance against Alexander Bishop
   of Constantinople.

   While these things were taking place, the thirtieth year of
   Constantine's reign was completed. But Arius with his adherents having
   returned to Alexandria, again disturbed the whole city; for the people
   of Alexandria were exceedingly indignant both at the restoration of
   this incorrigible heretic with his partisans, and also because their
   bishop Athanasius had been sent to exile. When the emperor was apprised
   of the perverse disposition of Arius, he once more ordered him to
   repair to Constantinople, to give an account of the commotions he had
   afresh endeavored to excite. It happened at that time that Alexander,
   who had some time before succeeded Metrophanes, presided over the
   church at Constantinople. That this prelate was a man of devoted piety
   was distinctly manifested by the conflict he entered into with Arius;
   for when Arius arrived and the people were divided into two factions
   and the whole city was thrown into confusion: some insisting that the
   Nicene Creed should be by no means infringed on, while others contended
   that the opinion of Arius was consonant to reason. In this state of
   affairs, Alexander was driven to straits: more especially since
   Eusebius of Nicomedia had violently threatened that he would cause him
   to be immediately deposed, unless he admitted Arius and his followers
   to communion. Alexander, however, was far less troubled at the thought
   of his own deposition as fearful of the subversion of the principles of
   the faith, which they were so anxious to effect: and regarding himself
   as the constituted guardian of the doctrines recognized, and the
   decisions made by the council at Nicæa, he exerted himself to the
   utmost to prevent their being violated or depraved. Reduced to this
   extremity, he bade farewell to all logical resources, and made God his
   refuge, devoting himself to continued fasting and never ceased from
   praying. Communicating his purpose to no one, he shut himself up alone
   in the church called Irene: there going up to the altar, and
   prostrating himself on the ground beneath the holy communion table, he
   poured forth his fervent prayers weeping; and this he ceased not to do
   for many successive nights and days. What he thus earnestly asked from
   God, he received: for his petition was such a one: If the opinion of
   Arius were correct, he might not be permitted to see the day appointed
   for its discussion; but that if he himself held the true faith, Arius,
   as the author of all these evils, might suffer the punishment due to
   his impiety.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXXVIII.--The Death of Arius. [257]

   Such was the supplication of Alexander. Meanwhile the emperor, being
   desirous of personally examining Arius, sent for him to the palace, and
   asked him whether he would assent to the determinations of the Synod at
   Nicæa. He without hesitation replied in the affirmative, and subscribed
   the declaration of the faith in the emperor's presence, acting with
   duplicity. The emperor, surprised at his ready compliance, obliged him
   to confirm his signature by an oath. This also he did with equal
   dissimulation. The way he evaded, as I have heard, was this: he wrote
   his own opinion on paper, and carried it under his arm, so that he then
   swore truly that he really held the sentiments he had written. That
   this is so, however, I have written from hearsay, but that he added an
   oath to his subscription, I have myself ascertained, from an
   examination of the emperor's own letters. The emperor being thus
   convinced, ordered that he should be received into communion by
   Alexander, bishop of Constantinople. It was then Saturday, and Arius
   was expecting to assemble with the church on the day following: but
   divine retribution overtook his daring criminalities. For going out of
   the imperial palace, attended by a crowd of Eusebian partisans like
   guards, he paraded proudly through the midst of the city, attracting
   the notice of all the people. As he approached the place called
   Constantine's Forum, where the column of porphyry is erected, a terror
   arising from the remorse of conscience seized Arius, and with the
   terror a violent relaxation of the bowels: he therefore enquired
   whether there was a convenient place near, and being directed to the
   back of Constantine's Forum, he hastened thither. Soon after a
   faintness came over him, and together with the evacuations his bowels
   protruded, followed by a copious hemorrhage, and the descent of the
   smaller intestines: moreover portions of his spleen and liver were
   brought off in the effusion of blood, so that he almost immediately
   died. The scene of this catastrophe still is shown at Constantinople,
   as I have said, behind the shambles in the colonnade: and by persons
   going by pointing the finger at the place, there is a perpetual
   remembrance preserved of this extraordinary kind of death. So
   disastrous an occurrence filled with dread and alarm the party of
   Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia; and the report of it quickly spread
   itself over the city and throughout the whole world. As the king grew
   more earnest in Christianity and confessed that the confession at Nicæa
   was attested by God, he rejoiced at the occurrences. He was also glad
   because of his three sons whom he had already proclaimed Cæsars; one of
   each of them having been created at every successive decennial
   anniversary of his reign. To the eldest, whom he called Constantine,
   after his own name, he assigned the government of the western parts of
   the empire, on the completion of his first decade. His second son
   Constantius, who bore his grandfather's name, he constituted Cæsar in
   the eastern division, when the second decade had been completed. And
   Constans, the youngest, he invested with a similar dignity, in the
   thirtieth year of his own reign.

   Chapter XXXIX.--The Emperor falls sick and dies.

   A year having passed, the Emperor Constantine having just entered the
   sixty-fifth year of his age, was taken with a sickness; he therefore
   left Constantinople, and made a voyage to Helenopolis, that he might
   try the effect of the medicinal hot springs which are found in the
   vicinity of that city. Perceiving, however, that his illness increased,
   he deferred the use of the baths; and removing from Helenopolis to
   Nicomedia, he took up his residence in the suburbs, and there received
   Christian baptism. [258] After this he became cheerful; and making his
   will, appointed his three sons heirs to the empire, allotting to each
   one of them his portion, in accordance with the arrangements he had
   made while living. He also granted many privileges to the cities of
   Rome and Constantinople; and entrusting the custody of his will [259]
   to that presbyter by whose means Arius had been recalled, and of whom
   we have already made mention, he charged him to deliver it into no
   one's hand, except that of his son Constantius, to whom he had given
   the sovereignty of the East. After the making of his will, he survived
   a few days and died. Of his sons none were present at his death. A
   courier was therefore immediately despatched into the East, to inform
   Constantius of his father's decease.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [258] It was the belief of many in the earlier ages of the church that
   baptism had a certain magical power purging away the sins previous to
   it, but having no force as regards those that might follow; this led
   many to postpone their baptism until disease or age warned them of the
   nearness of death; such delayed baptism was called clinic baptism,' and
   was discouraged by the more judicious and spiritual-minded Fathers,
   some of whom doubted its validity and rebuked those who delayed as
   actuated by selfishness and desire to indulge in sin. The church,
   however, encouraged it in the cases of gross offenders. Cf. Bingham,
   Eccl. Antiq. IV. 3, and XI. 11, and Bennett, Christian Archæology, pp.
   407 and 409.

   [259] Cf. Euseb. Life of Const. IV. 63, and Rufinus, H. E. I. 11. The
   story is, however, doubtful, as Valesius observes. It is more likely
   that some one of the lay officials of the government, or, as
   Philostorgius says, Eusebius of Nicomedia, was entrusted with this
   will, and not a mere presbyter. That it was probably Eusebius of
   Nicomedia becomes the more probable when we consider that that bishop
   also probably baptized Constantine.

   Chapter XL.--The Funeral of the Emperor Constantine.

   The body of the emperor was placed in a coffin of gold by the proper
   persons, and then conveyed to Constantinople, where it was laid out on
   an elevated bed of state in the palace, surrounded by a guard, and
   treated with the same respect as when he was alive, and this was done
   until the arrival of one of his sons. When Constantius was come out of
   the eastern parts of the empire, it was honored with an imperial
   sepulture, and deposited in the church called The Apostles: which he
   had caused to be constructed for this very purpose, that the emperors
   and prelates might receive a degree of veneration but little inferior
   to that which was paid to the relics of the apostles. The Emperor
   Constantine lived sixty-five years, and reigned thirty-one. He died in
   the consulate of Felician and Tatian, on the twenty-second of May, in
   the second year of the 278th Olympiad. [260] This book, therefore,
   embraces a period of thirty-one years.

   Book II.

   Chapter I.--Introduction containing the Reason for the Author's
   Revision of his First and Second Books.

   Rufinus, who wrote an Ecclesiastical History in Latin, [261] has erred
   in respect to chronology. For he supposes that what was done against
   Athanasius occurred after the death of the Emperor Constantine: he was
   also ignorant of his exile to the Gauls and of various other
   circumstances. Now we in the first place wrote the first two books of
   our history following Rufinus; but in writing our history from the
   third to the seventh, some facts we collected from Rufinus, others from
   different authors, and some from the narration of individuals still
   living. Afterward, however, we perused the writings of Athanasius,
   wherein he depicts his own sufferings and how through the calumnies of
   the Eusebian fiction he was banished, and judged that more credit was
   due to him who had suffered, and to those who were witnesses of the
   things they describe, than to such as have been dependent on
   conjecture, and had therefore erred. Moreover, having obtained several
   letters of persons eminent at that period, we have availed ourselves of
   their assistance also in tracing out the truth as far as possible. On
   this account we were compelled to revise the first and second books of
   this history, using, however, the testimony of Rufinus where it is
   evident that he could not be mistaken. It should also be observed, that
   in our former edition, neither the sentence of deposition which was
   passed upon Arius, nor the emperor's letters were inserted, but simply
   the narration or facts in order that the history might not become bulky
   and weary the readers with tedious matters of detail. But in the
   present edition, such alterations and additions have been made for your
   sake, O sacred man of God, Theodore, [262] in order that you might not
   be ignorant what the princes wrote in their own words, as well as the
   decisions of the bishops in their various Synods, wherein they
   continually altered the confession of faith. Wherefore, whatever we
   have deemed necessary we have inserted in this later edition. Having
   adopted this course in the first book, we shall endeavor to do the same
   in the consecutive portion of our history, I mean the second. On this
   let us now enter.

   Chapter II.--Eusebius, Bishop of Nicomedia, and his Party, by again
   endeavoring to introduce the Arian Heresy, create Disturbances in the
   Churches.

   After the death of the Emperor Constantine, Eusebius, bishop of
   Nicomedia, and Theognis of Nicæa, imagining that a favorable
   opportunity had arisen, used their utmost efforts to expunge the
   doctrine of homoousion, and to introduce Arianism in its place. They,
   nevertheless, despaired of effecting this, if Athanasius should return
   to Alexandria: in order therefore to accomplish their designs, they
   sought the assistance of that presbyter by whose means Arius had been
   recalled from exile a little before. How this was done shall now be
   described. The presbyter in question presented the will and the request
   of the deceased king to his son Constantius; who finding those
   dispositions in it which he was most desirous of, for the empire of the
   East was by his father's will apportioned to him, treated the presbyter
   with great consideration, loaded him with favors, and ordered that free
   access should be given him both to the palace and to himself. This
   license soon obtained for him familiar intercourse with the empress, as
   well as with her eunuchs. There was at that time a chief eunuch of the
   imperial bed-chamber named Eusebius; him the presbyter persuaded to
   adopt Arian's views, after which the rest of the eunuchs were also
   prevailed on to adopt the same sentiments. Not only this but the
   empress also, under the influence of the eunuchs and the presbyters,
   became favorable to the tenets of Arius; and not long after the subject
   was introduced to the emperor himself. Thus it became gradually
   diffused throughout the court, and among the officers of the imperial
   household and guards, until at length it spread itself over the whole
   population of the city. The chamberlains in the palace discussed this
   doctrine with the women; and in the family of every citizen there was a
   logical contest. Moreover, the mischief quickly extended to other
   provinces and cities, the controversy, like a spark, insignificant at
   first, exciting in the auditors a spirit of contention: for every one
   who inquired the cause of the tumult, found immediately occasion for
   disputing, and determined to take part in the strife at the moment of
   making the inquiry. By general altercation of this kind all order was
   subverted; the agitation, however, was confined to the cities of the
   East, those of Illyricum and the western parts of the empire meanwhile
   were perfectly tranquil, because they would not annul the decisions of
   the Council of Nicæa. As this affair increased, going from bad to
   worse, Eusebius of Nicomedia and his party looked upon popular ferment
   as a piece of good fortune. For only thus they thought they would be
   enabled to constitute some one who held their own sentiments bishop of
   Alexandria. But the return of Athanasius at that time defeated their
   purpose; for he came thither fortified by a letter from one of the
   Augusti, which the younger Constantine, who bore his father's name,
   addressed to the people of Alexandria, from Treves, a city in Gaul.
   [263] A copy of this epistle is here subjoined.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [263] There is some difference of opinion as to the exact year of the
   recall of Athanasius. Baronius and others allege that this took place
   in 338 a.d., the year after the death of Constantine; but Valesius
   maintains that Athanasius was recalled the year preceding. This he
   infers from the words of Athanasius (Apol. c. Arian, 61), and the title
   of the letter which Constantine the younger addressed to the church in
   Alexandria.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter III.--Athanasius, encouraged by the Letter of Constantine the
   Younger, returns to Alexandria.

   Constantine Cæsar to the members of the Catholic Church of the
   Alexandrians.

   It cannot, I conceive, have escaped the knowledge of your devout minds,
   that Athanasius, the expositor of the venerated law, was sent for a
   while unto the Gauls, lest he should sustain some irreparable injury
   from the perverseness of his blood-thirsty adversaries, whose ferocity
   continually endangered his sacred life. To evade this [perverseness],
   therefore, he was taken from the jaws of the men who threatened him
   into a city under my jurisdiction, where, as long as it was his
   appointed residence, he has been abundantly supplied with every
   necessity: although his distinguished virtue trusting in divine aid
   would have made light of the pressure of a more rigorous fortune. And
   since our sovereign, my father, Constantine Augustus of blessed memory,
   was prevented by death from accomplishing his purpose of restoring this
   bishop to his see, and to your most sanctified piety, I have deemed it
   proper to carry his wishes into effect, having inherited the task from
   him. With how great veneration he has been regarded by us, ye will
   learn on his arrival among you; nor need any one be surprised at the
   honor I have put upon him, since I have been alike influenced by a
   sense of what was due to so excellent a personage, and the knowledge of
   your affectionate solicitude respecting him. May Divine Providence
   preserve you, beloved brethren.

   Relying on this letter, Athanasius came to Alexandria, and was most
   joyfully received by the people of the city. Nevertheless as many in it
   as had embraced Arianism, combining together, entered into conspiracies
   against him, by which frequent seditions were excited, affording a
   pretext to the Eusebians for accusing him to the emperor of having
   taken possession of the Alexandrian church on his own responsibility,
   in spite of the adverse judgment of a general council of bishops. So
   far indeed did they succeed in pressing their charges, that the emperor
   became exasperated, and banished him from Alexandria. How indeed this
   came about I shall hereafter explain.

   At this time Eusebius, who was bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine, and had
   the surname of Pamphilus, having died, Acacius, his disciple, succeeded
   him in the bishopric. This individual published several books, and
   among others a biographical sketch of his master.

   Chapter V.--The Death of Constantine the Younger.

   Not long after this the brother of the Emperor Constantius, Constantine
   the younger, who bore his father's name, having invaded those parts of
   the empire which were under the government of his younger brother
   Constans, engaging in a conflict with his brother's soldiery, was slain
   by them. This took place under the consulship of Acindynus and Proclus.

   Chapter VI.--Alexander, Bishop of Constantinople, when at the Point of
   Death proposes the Election either of Paul or of Macedonius as his
   Successor.

   About the same time another disturbance in addition to those we have
   recorded, was raised at Constantinople on the following account.
   Alexander, who had presided over the churches in that city, and had
   strenuously opposed Arius, departed this life, [265] having occupied
   the bishopric for twenty-three years and lived ninety-eight years in
   all, without having ordained any one to succeed him. But he had
   enjoined the proper persons to choose one of the two whom he named;
   that is to say, if they desired one who was competent to teach, and of
   eminent piety, they should elect Paul, whom he had himself ordained
   presbyter, a man young indeed in years, but of advanced intelligence
   and prudence; but if they wished a man of venerable aspect, and
   external show only of sanctity, they might appoint Macedonius, who had
   long been a deacon among them and was aged. Hence there arose a great
   contest respecting the choice of a bishop which troubled the church
   exceedingly; for ever since the people were divided into two parties,
   one of which favored the tenets of Arius, while the other held what the
   Nicene Synod had defined, those who held the doctrine of
   consubstantiality always had the advantage during the life of
   Alexander, the Arians disagreeing among themselves and perpetually
   conflicting in opinion. But after the death of that prelate, the issue
   of the struggle became doubtful, the defenders of the orthodox faith
   insisting on the ordination of Paul, and all the Arian party espousing
   the cause of Macedonius. Paul therefore was ordained bishop in the
   church called Irene, [266] which is situated near the great church of
   Sophia; whose election appeared to be more in accordance with the
   suffrage of the deceased.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [265] Socrates is undoubtedly mistaken in setting the date of
   Alexander's death as late as 340 a.d. The council convened to examine
   and confute the charges against Athanasius met in 339 a.d., and the
   record at that date has it (see chap. 7) that Eusebius had taken
   possession of the see of Constantinople. Alexander must therefore have
   died before 339.

   [266] So called, not because there was a saint or eminent person of
   that name, but on the same principle as the church called Sophia. For
   the history of the latter church, see Dehio and Bezold, Die Kirchliche
   Baukuns des Abendlandes, I. p. 21.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter VII.--The Emperor Constantius ejects Paul after his Election to
   the Bishopric, and sending for Eusebius of Nicomedia, invests him with
   the Bishopric of Constantinople.

   Not long afterwards the emperor having arrived at Constantinople was
   highly incensed at the consecration [of Paul]; and having convened an
   assembly of bishops of Arian sentiments, he divested Paul of his
   dignity, and translating Eusebius from the see of Nicomedia, he
   appointed him bishop of Constantinople. Having done this the emperor
   proceeded to Antioch.

   Chapter VIII.--Eusebius having convened Another Synod at Antioch in
   Syria, causes a New Creed to be promulgated.

   Eusebius, however, could by no means remain quiet, but as the saying
   is, left no stone unturned, in order to effect the purpose he had in
   view. He therefore causes a Synod to be convened at Antioch in Syria,
   under pretense of dedicating the church which the father of the Augusti
   had commenced, and which his son Constantius had finished in the tenth
   year after its foundations were laid, but with the real intention of
   subverting and abolishing the doctrine of the homoousion. There were
   present at this Synod ninety bishops from various cities. Maximus,
   however, bishop of Jerusalem; who had succeeded Macarius, did not
   attend, recollecting that he had been deceived and induced to subscribe
   the deposition of Athanasius. Neither was Julius, bishop of the great
   Rome, [267] there, nor had he sent a substitute, although an
   ecclesiastical canon [268] commands that the churches shall not make
   any ordinances against the opinion of the bishop of Rome. This Synod
   assembled at Antioch in presence of the emperor Constantius in the
   consulate of Marcellus and Probinus, [269] which was the fifth year
   after the death of Constantine, father of the Augusti. Placitus,
   otherwise called Flaccillus, successor to Euphronius, at that time
   presided over the church at Antioch. The confederates of Eusebius had
   previously designed to calumniate Athanasius; accusing him in the first
   place of having acted contrary to a canon which they then constituted,
   in resuming his episcopal authority without the license of a general
   council of bishops, inasmuch as on his return from exile he had on his
   own responsibility taken possession of the church; and then because a
   tumult had been excited on his entrance and many were killed in the
   riot; moreover that some had been scourged by him, and others brought
   before the tribunals. Besides they brought forward what had been
   determined against Athanasius at Tyre.

   effect, having the force of an unwritten law. In any case the use of

   Chapter IX.--Of Eusebius of Emisa.

   On the ground of such charges as these, they proposed another bishop
   for the Alexandrian church, and first indeed Eusebius surnamed
   Emisenus. Who this person was, George, bishop of Laodicea, who was
   present on this occasion, informs us. For he says in the book which he
   has composed on his life, that Eusebius was descended from the nobility
   of Edessa in Mesopotamia, and that from a child he had studied the holy
   Scriptures; [270] that he was afterwards instructed in Greek literature
   by a master resident at Edessa; and finally that the sacred books were
   expounded to him by Patrophilus and Eusebius, of whom the latter
   presided over the church at Cæsarea, and the former over that at
   Scythopolis. Afterwards when he dwelt in Antioch, it happened that
   Eustathius was deposed on the accusation of Cyrus of Beroea for holding
   the tenets of Sabellius. Then again he associated with Euphronius,
   successor of Eustathius, and avoiding a bishopric, he retired to
   Alexandria, and there devoted himself to the study of philosophy. On
   his return to Antioch he formed an intimate acquaintance with Placitus
   [or Flaccillus], the successor of Euphronius. At length he was ordained
   bishop of Alexandria, by Eusebius, bishop of Constantinople; but did
   not go thither in consequence of the attachment of the people of that
   city to Athanasius, and was therefore sent to Emisa. As the inhabitants
   of Emisa excited a sedition on account of his appointment,--for he was
   commonly charged with the study and practice of judicial astrology,
   [271] --he fled and came to Laodicea, to George, who has given so many
   historical details of him. George having taken him to Antioch, procured
   his being again brought back to Emisa by Placitus and Narcissus; but he
   was afterwards charged with holding the Sabellian views. George more
   elaborately describes the circumstances of his ordination and adds at
   the close that the emperor took him with him in his expedition against
   the barbarians, and that miracles were wrought by his hand. The
   information given by George concerning Eusebius of Emisa may be
   considered reproduced at sufficient length by me here.

   Chapter X.--The Bishops assembled at Antioch, on the Refusal of
   Eusebius of Emisa to accept the Bishopric of Alexandria, ordain
   Gregory, and change the Language of the Nicene Creed.

   Now at that time Eusebius having been proposed and fearing to go to
   Alexandria, the Synod at Antioch designated Gregory as bishop of that
   church. This being done, they altered the creed; not as condemning
   anything in that which was set forth at Nicæa, but in fact with a
   determination to subvert and nullify the doctrine of consubstantiality
   by means of frequent councils, and the publication of various
   expositions of the faith, so as gradually to establish the Arian views.
   How these things issued we will set forth in the course of our
   narrative; but the epistle then promulgated respecting the faith was as
   follows: [272]

   We have neither become followers of Arius,--for how should we who are
   bishops be guided by a presbyter?--nor have we embraced any other faith
   than that which was set forth from the beginning. But being constituted
   examiners and judges of his sentiments, we admit their soundness,
   rather than adopt them from him: and you will recognize this from what
   we are about to state. We have learned from the beginning to believe in
   one God of the Universe, the Creator and Preserver of all things both
   those thought of and those perceived by the senses: and in one
   only-begotten Son of God, subsisting before all ages, and co-existing
   with the Father who begat him, through whom also all things visible and
   invisible were made; who in the last days according to the Father's
   good pleasure, descended, and assumed flesh from the holy virgin, and
   having fully accomplished his Father's will, that he should suffer, and
   rise again, and ascend into the heavens, and sit at the right hand of
   the Father; and is coming to judge the living and the dead, continuing
   King and God for ever. We believe also in the Holy Spirit. And if it is
   necessary to add this, we believe in the resurrection of the flesh, and
   the life everlasting.'

   Having thus written in their first epistle, they sent it to the bishops
   of every city. But after remaining some time at Antioch, as if to
   condemn the former, they published another letter in these words:

   Another Exposition of the Faith.

   In conformity with evangelic and apostolic tradition, we believe in one
   God the Father Almighty, the Creator and Framer of the universe. And in
   one Lord Jesus Christ, his Son, God the only-begotten, through whom all
   things were made: begotten of the Father before all ages, God of God,
   Whole of Whole, Only of Only, Perfect of Perfect, King of King, Lord of
   Lord; the living Word, the Wisdom, the Life, the True Light, the Way of
   Truth, the Resurrection, the Shepherd, the Gate; immutable and
   inconvertible; the unaltering image of the Divinity, Substance and
   Power, and Counsel and Glory of the Father; born before all creation';
   who was in the beginning with God, God the Word, according as it is
   declared in the Gospel, [273] and the Word was God, by whom all things
   were made, and in whom all things subsist: who in the last days came
   down from above, and was born of the virgin according to the
   Scriptures; and was made man, the Mediator between God and men, the
   Apostle of our Faith, and the Prince of Life, as he says, [274] I came
   down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that
   sent me.' Who suffered on our behalf, and rose again for us on the
   third day, and ascended into the heavens, and is seated at the right
   hand of the Father; and will come again with glory and power to judge
   the living and the dead. [We believe] also in the Holy Spirit, who is
   given to believers for their consolation, sanctification, and
   perfection; even as our Lord Jesus Christ commanded his disciples,
   saying, [275] Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit'; that is to say of
   the Father who is truly the Father, of the Son who is truly the Son,
   and of the Holy Spirit who is truly the Holy Spirit, these words not
   being simply or insignificantly applied, but accurately expressing the
   proper subsistence, glory, and order, of each of these who are named:
   so that there are three in person, but one in concordance. Holding
   therefore this faith in the presence of God and of Christ, we
   anathematize all heretical and false doctrine. And if any one shall
   teach contrary to the sound and right faith of the Scriptures,
   affirming that there is or was a period or an age before the Son of God
   existed, let him be accursed. And if any one shall say that the Son is
   a creature as one of the creatures, or that he is offspring as one of
   the offsprings, and shall not hold each of the aforesaid doctrines as
   the Divine Scriptures have delivered them to us: or if any one shall
   teach or preach any other doctrine contrary to that which we have
   received, let him be accursed. For we truly and unreservedly believe
   and follow all things handed down to us from the sacred Scriptures by
   the prophets and apostles.

   Such was the exposition of the faith published by those then assembled
   at Antioch, to which Gregory also subscribed as bishop of Alexandria,
   although he had not yet entered that city. The Synod having done these
   things, and legislated some other canons, was dissolved. At this time
   it happened that public affairs also were disturbed. The nation called
   Franks made incursions into the Roman territories in Gaul, and at the
   same time there occurred violent earthquakes in the East, and
   especially at Antioch, which continued to suffer concussions during a
   whole year.

   Chapter XI.--On the Arrival of Gregory at Alexandria, tended by a
   Military Escort, Athanasius flees.

   After these things, Syrian, the military commander, and the corps of
   heavy armed soldiers, five thousand in number, conducted Gregory to
   Alexandria; and such of the citizens as were of Arian sentiments
   combined with them. But it will be proper here to relate by what means
   Athanasius escaped the hands of those who wished to apprehend him,
   after his expulsion from the church. It was evening, and the people
   were attending the vigil there, a service [276] being expected. The
   commander arrived, and posted his forces in order of battle on every
   side of the church. Athanasius having observed what was done,
   considered within himself how he might prevent the people's suffering
   in any degree on his account: accordingly having directed the deacon to
   give notice of prayer, after that he ordered the recitation of a psalm;
   and when the melodious chant of the psalm arose, all went out through
   one of the church doors. While this was doing, the troops remained
   inactive spectators, and Athanasius thus escaped unhurt in the midst of
   those who were chanting the psalm, and immediately hastened to Rome.
   Gregory then prevailed in the church: but the people of Alexandria,
   being indignant at this procedure, set the church called that of
   Dionysius on fire. Let this be sufficient on this subject. Now
   Eusebius, having thus far obtained his object, sent a deputation to
   Julius, bishop of Rome, [277] begging that he would himself take
   cognizance of the charges against Athanasius, and order a judicial
   investigation to be made in his presence. [278]

   Chapter XII.--The People of Constantinople restore Paul to his See
   after the Death of Eusebius, while the Arians elect Macedonius.

   But Eusebius did not live to learn the decision of Julius concerning
   Athanasius, for he died a short time after that Synod was held.
   Whereupon the people introduced Paul again into the church of
   Constantinople: the Arians, however, ordained Macedonius at the same
   time, in the church dedicated to Paul. This those who had formerly
   co-operated with Eusebius (that disturber of the public peace) brought
   about, assuming all his authority. These were Theognis, bishop of
   Nicæa, Maris of Chalcedon, Theodore of Heraclea in Thrace, Ursacius of
   Singidunum in Upper Mysia, and Valens of Mursa in Upper Pannonia.
   Ursacius and Valens indeed afterward altered their opinions, and
   presented a written recantation of them to bishop Julius, so that on
   subscribing the doctrine of consubstantiability they were again
   admitted to communion; but at that time they warmly supported the Arian
   error, and were instigators of the most violent conflicts in the
   churches, one of which was connected with Macedonius at Constantinople.
   By this intestine war among the Christians, continuous seditions arose
   in that city, and many lives were sacrificed in consequence of these
   occurrences.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XIII.--Paul is again ejected from the Church by Constantius, in
   consequence of the Slaughter of Hermogenes, his General.

   Intelligence of these proceedings reached the ears of the Emperor
   Constantius, whose residence was then at Antioch. Accordingly he
   ordered his general Hermogenes, who had been despatched to Thrace, to
   pass through Constantinople on his way, and expel Paul from the church.
   He, on arriving at Constantinople, threw the whole city into confusion,
   attempting to cast out the bishops; for sedition immediately arose from
   the people in their eagerness to defend the bishop. And when Hermogenes
   persisted in his efforts to drive out Paul by means of his military
   force, the people became exasperated as is usual in such cases; and
   making a desperate attack upon him, they set his house on fire, and
   after dragging through the city, they at last put him to death. This
   took place in the consulate [279] of the two Augusti,--that is to say,
   the third consulship,--Constantius, and the second of Constans: at
   which time Constans, having subdued the Franks, compelled them to enter
   into a treaty of peace with the Romans. The Emperor Constantius, on
   being informed of the assassination of Hermogenes, set off on horseback
   from Antioch, and arriving at Constantinople immediately expelled Paul,
   and then punished the inhabitants by withdrawing from them more than
   40,000 measures of the daily allowance of wheat which had been granted
   by his father for gratuitous distribution among them: for prior to this
   catastrophe, nearly 80,000 measures of wheat brought from Alexandria
   had been bestowed on the citizens. [280] He hesitated, however, to
   ratify [281] the appointment of Macedonius to the bishopric of that
   city, being irritated against him not only because he had been ordained
   without his own consent; but also because on account of the contests in
   which he had been engaged with Paul, Hermogenes, his general, and many
   other persons had been slain. But having given him permission to
   minister in the church in which he had been consecrated, he returned to
   Antioch.

   [279] 342 a.d. This assassination of Hermogenes was evidently recorded
   in that portion of Am. Marcellinus' work which has been lost; at least

   2 (ed. Eyssenhart).

   Chapter XIV.--The Arians remove Gregory from the See of Alexandria, and
   appoint George in his Place. [282]

   About the same time the Arians ejected Gregory from the see of
   Alexandria, on the ground that he was unpopular and at the same time
   because he had set a church [283] on fire, and did not manifest
   sufficient zeal in promoting the interests of their party. [284] They
   therefore inducted George into his see, who was a native of Cappadocia,
   and had acquired the reputation of being an able advocate of their
   tenets.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [282] There is an error here, repeated also by Sozomen (III. 7), but
   corrected by Theodoret, H. E. II. 4 and 12, without the mention of the
   names of his predecessors. The error consists in the statement that
   Gregory was ejected at this time. It appears that he remained in his
   position until the Council of Sardica, by which he was deposed and
   excommunicated. He survived this council by six months.

   [283] That of Dionysius.

   [284] This is the same Gregory that is mentioned in ch. 10 as violently
   put into possession of the see of Alexandria by the Arians. It is
   evident that they were disappointed in him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XV.--Athanasius and Paul [285] going to Rome, and having
   obtained Letters from Bishop Julius, recover their respective Dioceses.

   Athanasius, meanwhile, after a lengthened journey, at last reached
   Italy. The western division of the empire was then under the sole power
   of Constans, the youngest of Constantine's sons, his brother
   Constantine having been slain by the soldiers, as was before stated. At
   the same time also Paul, bishop of Constantinople, Asclepas of Gaza,
   Marcellus of Ancyra, a city of the Lesser Galatia, and Lucius of
   Adrianople, having been accused on various charges, and expelled from
   their several churches arrived at the imperial city. There each laid
   his case before Julius, bishop of Rome. He on his part, by virtue of
   the Church of Rome's peculiar privilege, sent them back again into the
   East, fortifying them with commendatory letters; and at the same time
   restored to each his own place, and sharply rebuked those by whom they
   had been deposed. Relying on the signature of the bishop Julius, the
   bishops departed from Rome, and again took possession of their own
   churches, forwarding the letters to the parties to whom they were
   addressed. These persons considering themselves treated with indignity
   by the reproaches of Julius, called a council at Antioch, assembled
   themselves and dictated a reply to his letters as the expression of the
   unanimous feeling of the whole Synod. [286] It was not his province,
   they said, to take cognizance of their decisions in reference to any
   whom they might wish to expel from their churches; seeing that they had
   not opposed themselves to him, when Novatus was ejected from the
   church. These things the bishops of the Eastern church communicated to
   Julius, bishop of Rome. But, as on the entry of Athanasius into
   Alexandria, a tumult was raised by the partisans of George the Arian,
   in consequence of which, it is affirmed, many persons were killed; and
   since the Arians endeavor to throw the whole odium of this transaction
   on Athanasius as the author of it, it behooves us to make a few remarks
   on the subject. God the Judge of all only knows the true causes of
   these disorders; but no one of any experience can be ignorant of the
   fact, that such fatal accidents are for the most part concomitants of
   the factious movements of the populace. It is vain, therefore, for the
   calumniators of Athanasius to attribute the blame to him; and
   especially Sabinus, [287] bishop of the Macedonian heresy. For had the
   latter reflected on the number and magnitude of the wrongs which
   Athanasius, in conjunction with the rest who hold the doctrine of
   consubstantiality, had suffered from the Arians, or on the many
   complaints made of these things by the Synods convened on account of
   Athanasius, or in short on what that arch-heretic Macedonius himself
   has done throughout all the churches, he would either have been wholly
   silent, or if constrained to speak, would have spoken more plausible
   words, instead of these reproaches. But as it is intentionally
   overlooking all these things, he willfully misrepresents the facts. He
   makes, however, no mention whatever of the heresiarch, desiring by all
   means to conceal the daring enormities of which he knew him to be
   guilty. And what is still more extraordinary, he has not said one word
   to the disadvantage of the Arians, although he was far from
   entertaining their sentiments. The ordination of Macedonius, whose
   heretical views he had adopted, he has also passed over in silence; for
   had he mentioned it, he must necessarily have recorded his impieties
   also, which were most distinctly manifested on that occasion. Let this
   suffice on this subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [285] Julius, in his letter to the Eastern bishops (Ep. I. adv.
   Eusebianos, 4 and 5), mentions Athanasius and Marcellus, ex-bishop of
   Ancyra, as with him at this time, but does not allude to Paul; from
   which it has been inferred that Socrates is in error here in setting
   the date of Paul's visit to Rome at this time, as otherwise Julius
   would have named him also with Athanasius and Marcellus. Sozomen, as
   usual, copies the mistake of Socrates; cf. Sozom. III. 15.

   [286] It appears from this that there was no recognition of any special
   prerogative or right belonging to the bishop of Rome as yet. The
   position of that bishop during these agitations in the Eastern church,
   when the Western church was in comparative peace, seems to be that of
   an arbitrator voluntarily invoked, rather than of an official judge.

   Chapter XVI.--The Emperor Constantius, through an Order to Philip the
   Prætorian Prefect, secures the Exile of Paul, and the Installation of
   Macedonius in his See.

   When the Emperor Constantius, who then held his court at Antioch, heard
   that Paul had again obtained possession of the episcopal throne, he was
   excessively enraged at his presumption. He therefore despatched a
   written order to Philip, the Prætorian Prefect, whose power exceeded
   that of the other governors of provinces, and who was styled the second
   person from the emperor, [288] to drive Paul out of the church again,
   and introduce Macedonius into it in his place. Now the prefect Philip,
   dreading an insurrectionary movement among the people, used artifice to
   entrap the bishop: keeping, therefore, the emperor's mandate secret, he
   went to the public bath called Zeuxippus, and on pretense of attending
   to some public affairs, sent to Paul with every demonstration of
   respect, requesting his attendance there, on the ground that his
   presence was indispensable. The bishop came; and as he came in
   obedience to this summons, the prefect immediately showed him the
   emperor's order; the bishop patiently submitted condemnation without a
   hearing. But as Philip was afraid of the violence of the multitude--for
   great numbers had gathered around the building to see what would take
   place, for their suspicions had been aroused by current reports--he
   commanded one of the bath doors to be opened which communicated with
   the imperial palace, and through that Paul was carried off, put on
   board a vessel provided for the purpose, and so sent into exile
   immediately. The prefect directed him to go to Thessalonica, the
   metropolis of Macedonia, whence he had derived his origin from his
   ancestors; commanding him to reside in that city, but granting him
   permission to visit other cities of Illyricum, while he strictly
   forbade his passing into any portion of the Eastern empire. Thus was
   Paul, contrary to his expectation, at once expelled from the church,
   and from the city, and again hurried off into exile. Philip, the
   imperial prefect, leaving the bath, immediately proceeded to the
   church. Together with him, as if thrown there by an engine, Macedonius
   rode seated in the same seat with the prefect in the chariot seen by
   everybody, and a military guard with drawn swords was about them. The
   multitude was completely overawed by this spectacle, and both Arians
   and Homoousians hastened to the church, every one endeavoring to secure
   an entrance there. As the prefect with Macedonius came near the church,
   an irrational panic seized the multitude and even the soldiers
   themselves; for as the assemblage was so numerous and no room to admit
   the passage of the prefect and Macedonius was found, the soldiers
   attempted to thrust aside the people by force. But the confined space
   into which they were crowded together rendering it impossible to
   recede, the soldiers imagined that resistance was offered, and that the
   populace intentionally stopped the passage; they accordingly began to
   use their naked swords, and to cut down those that stood in their way.
   It is affirmed that about 3150 persons were massacred on this occasion;
   of whom the greater part fell under the weapons of the soldiers, and
   the rest were crushed to death by the desperate efforts of the
   multitude to escape their violence. After such distinguished
   achievements, Macedonius, as if he had not been the author of any
   calamity, but was altogether guiltless of what had been perpetrated,
   was seated in the episcopal chair by the prefect, rather than by the
   ecclesiastical canon. Thus, then, by means of so many murders in the
   church, Macedonius and the Arians grasped the supremacy in the
   churches. About this period the emperor built the great church called
   Sophia, adjoining to that named Irene, which being originally of small
   dimensions, the emperor's father had considerably enlarged and adorned.
   In the present day both are seen within one enclosure, and have but one
   appellation.

   Chapter XVII.--Athanasius, intimidated by the Emperor's Threats,
   returns to Rome again.

   At this time another accusation was concocted against Athanasius by the
   Arians, who invented this pretext for it. The father of the Augusti had
   long before granted an allowance of corn to the church of the
   Alexandrians for the relief of the indigent. This, they asserted, had
   usually been sold by Athanasius, and the proceeds converted to his own
   advantage. The emperor, giving credence to this slanderous report,
   threatened Athanasius with death, as a penalty; who, becoming alarmed
   at the intimation of this threat, took to flight, and kept himself
   concealed. When Julius, bishop of Rome, was apprised of these fresh
   machinations of the Arians against Athanasius, and had also received
   the letter of the then deceased Eusebius, he invited the persecuted
   Athanasius to come to him, having ascertained where he was secreted.
   The epistle also of the bishops who had been some time before assembled
   at Antioch, just then reached him; and at the same time others from the
   bishops in Egypt, assuring him that the entire charge against
   Athanasius was a fabrication. On the receipt of these contradictory
   communications, Julius first replied to the bishops who had written to
   him from Antioch, complaining of the acrimonious feeling they had
   evinced in their letter, and charging them with a violation of the
   canons, because they had not requested his attendance at the council,
   [289] seeing that the ecclesiastical law required that the churches
   should pass no decisions contrary to the views of the bishop of Rome:
   he then censured them with great severity for clandestinely attempting
   to pervert the faith; in addition, that their former proceedings at
   Tyre were fraudulent, because the investigation of what had taken place
   at Mareotes was on one side of the question only; not only this, but
   that the charge respecting Arsenius had plainly been proved a false
   charge. Such and similar sentiments did Julius write in his answer to
   the bishops convened at Antioch; we should have inserted here at
   length, these as well as those letters which were addressed to Julius,
   did not their prolixity interfere with our purpose. But Sabinus, the
   advocate of the Macedonian heresy, of whom we have before spoken, has
   not incorporated the letters of Julius in his Collection of Synodical
   Transactions; [290] although he has not omitted that which the bishops
   of Antioch sent to Julius. This, however, is usual with him; he
   carefully introduces such letters as make no reference to, or wholly
   repudiate the term homoousion; while he purposely passes over in
   silence those of a contrary tendency. This is sufficient on this
   subject. Not long after this, Paul, pretending to make a journey from
   Thessalonica to Corinth, arrived in Italy: upon which both the bishops
   [291] made an appeal to the emperor of those parts, laying their
   respective cases before him.

   Chapter XVIII.--The Emperor of the West requests his Brother to send
   him Three Persons who could give an Account of the Deposition of
   Athanasius and Paul. Those who are sent publish Another Form of the
   Creed.

   When the Western emperor [292] was informed of their affairs, he
   sympathized with their sufferings; and wrote to his brother
   [Constantius], begging him to send three bishops who should explain to
   him the reason for the deposition of Athanasius and Paul. In compliance
   with this request, Narcissus the Cilician, Theodore the Thracian, Maris
   of Chalcedon, and Mark the Syrian, were deputed to execute this
   commission; who on their arrival refused to hold any communication with
   Athanasius or his friends, but suppressing the creed which had been
   promulgated at Antioch, presented to the Emperor Constans another
   declaration of faith composed by themselves, in the following terms:

   Another Exposition of the Faith.

   We believe in one God the Father Almighty, the Creator and Maker of all
   things, of whom the whole family in heaven and upon earth is named;
   [293] and in his only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was
   begotten of the Father before all ages; God of God; Light of Light;
   through whom all things in the heavens and upon the earth, both visible
   and invisible, were made: who is the Word, and Wisdom, and Power, and
   Life, and true Light: who in the last days for our sake was made man,
   and was born of the holy virgin; was crucified, and died; was buried,
   arose again from the dead on the third day, ascended into the heavens,
   is seated at the right hand of the Father, and shall come at the
   consummation of the ages, to judge the living and the dead, and to
   render to every one according to his works: whose kingdom being
   perpetual, shall continue to infinite ages; for he shall sit at the
   right hand of the Father, not only in this age, but also in that which
   is to come. [We believe] in the Holy Spirit, that is, in the Comforter,
   whom the Lord, according to his promise, sent to his apostles after his
   ascension into the heavens, to teach them, and bring all things to
   their remembrance: by whom also the souls of those who have sincerely
   believed on him shall be sanctified; and those who assert that the Son
   was made of things which are not, or of another substance, and not of
   God, or that there was a time when he did not exist, the Catholic
   Church accounts as aliens.

   Having delivered this creed to the emperor, and exhibited it to many
   others also, they departed without attending to anything besides. But
   while there was yet an inseparable communion between the Western and
   Eastern churches, there sprang up another heresy at Sirmium, a city of
   Illyricum; for Photinus, who presided over the churches in that
   district, a native of the Lesser Galatia, and a disciple of that
   Marcellus who had been deposed, adopting his master's sentiments,
   asserted that the Son of God was a mere man. We shall, however, enter
   into this matter more fully in its proper place. [294]

   Chapter XIX.--Of the Creed sent by the Eastern Bishops to those in
   Italy, called the Lengthy Creed. [295]

   After the lapse of about three years from the events above recorded,
   the Eastern bishops again assembled a Synod, and having composed
   another form of faith, they transmitted it to those in Italy by the
   hands of Eudoxius, at that time bishop of Germanicia, and Martyrius,
   and Macedonius, who was bishop of Mopsuestia [296] in Cilicia. This
   expression of the Creed, being written in more lengthy form, contained
   many additions to those which had preceded it, and was set forth in
   these words:

   We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, the Creator and Maker of
   all things, of whom the whole family in heaven and upon earth is named;
   and in his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was begotten of
   the Father before all ages; God of God; Light of Light; through whom
   all things in the heavens and upon the earth, both visible and
   invisible, were made: who is the Word, and Wisdom, and Power, and Life,
   and true Light: who in the last days for our sake was made man, and was
   born of the holy virgin; who was crucified, and died, and was buried,
   and rose again from the dead on the third day, and ascended into
   heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father, and shall come
   at the consummation of the ages, to judge the living and the dead, and
   to render to every one according to his works: whose kingdom being
   perpetual shall continue to infinite ages; for he sits at the right
   hand of the Father, not only in this age, but also in that which is to
   come. We believe also in the Holy Spirit, that is, in the Comforter,
   whom the Lord according to his promise sent to his apostles after his
   ascension into heaven, to teach them and bring all things to their
   remembrance, through whom also the souls of those who sincerely believe
   on him are sanctified. But those who assert that the Son was made of
   things not in being, or of another substance, and not of God, or that
   there was a time or age when he did not exist, [297] the holy catholic
   Church accounts as aliens. The holy and catholic Church likewise
   anathematizes those also who say that there are three Gods, or that
   Christ is not God before all ages, or that he is neither Christ, nor
   the Son of God, or that the same person is Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit, or that the Son was not begotten, or that the Father begat not
   the Son by his own will or desire. Neither is it safe to affirm that
   the Son had his existence from things that were not, since this is
   nowhere declared concerning him in the divinely inspired Scriptures.
   Nor are we taught that he had his being from any other pre-existing
   substance besides the Father, but that he was truly begotten of God
   alone; for the Divine word teaches that there is one unbegotten
   principle without beginning, the Father of Christ. But those who
   unauthorized by Scripture rashly assert that there was a time when he
   was not, ought not to preconceive any antecedent interval of time, but
   God only who without time begat him; for both times and ages were made
   through him. Yet it must not be thought that the Son is co-inoriginate,
   [298] or co-unbegotten [299] with the Father: for there is properly no
   father of the co-inoriginate or co-unbegotten. But we know that the
   Father alone being inoriginate and incomprehensible, [300] has
   ineffably and incomprehensibly to all begotten, and that the Son was
   begotten before the ages, but is not unbegotten like the Father, but
   has a beginning, viz. the Father who begat him, for "the head of Christ
   is God." [301] Now although according to the Scriptures we acknowledge
   three things or persons, viz. that of the Father, and of the Son, and
   of the Holy Spirit, we do not on that account make three Gods: since we
   know that that there is but one God perfect in himself, unbegotten,
   inoriginate, and invisible, the God and Father of the only-begotten,
   who alone has existence from himself, and alone affords existence
   abundantly to all other things. But neither while we assert that there
   is one God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten, do
   we therefore deny that Christ is God before the ages, as the followers
   of Paul of Samosata do, who affirm that after his incarnation he was by
   exaltation deified, in that he was by nature a mere man. We know indeed
   that he was subject to his God and Father: nevertheless he was begotten
   of God, and is by nature true and perfect God, and was not afterwards
   made God out of man; but was for our sake made man out of God, and has
   never ceased to be God. Moreover we execrate and anathematize those who
   falsely style him the mere unsubstantial word of God, having existence
   only in another, either as the word to which utterance is given, or as
   the word conceived in the mind: and who pretend that before the ages he
   was neither the Christ, the Son of God, the Mediator, nor the Image of
   God; but that he became the Christ, and the Son of God, from the time
   he took our flesh from the virgin, about four hundred years ago. [302]
   For they assert that Christ had the beginning of his kingdom from that
   time, and that it shall have an end after the consummation of all
   things and the judgment. Such persons as these are the followers of
   Marcellus and Photinus, the Ancyro-Galatians, who under pretext of
   establishing his sovereignty, like the Jews set aside the eternal
   existence and deity of Christ, and the perpetuity of his kingdom. But
   we know him to be not simply the word of God by utterance or mental
   conception, but God the living Word subsisting of himself; and Son of
   God and Christ; and who did, not by presence only, co-exist and was
   conversant with his Father before the ages, and ministered to him at
   the creation of all things, whether visible or invisible, but was the
   substantial Word of the Father, and God of God: for this is he to whom
   the Father said, "Let us make man in our image, and according to our
   likeness:" who in his own person appeared to the fathers, gave the law,
   and spake by the prophets; and being at last made man, he manifested
   his Father to all men, and reigns to endless ages. Christ has not
   attained any new dignity; but we believe that he was perfect from the
   beginning, and like his Father in all things; and those who say that
   the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are the same person, impiously
   supposing the three names to refer to one and the same thing and
   person, we deservedly expel from the church because by the incarnation
   they render the Father, who is incomprehensible and insusceptible of
   suffering, subject to comprehension and suffering. Such are those
   denominated Patropassians [303] among the Romans, and by us Sabellians.
   For we know that the Father who sent, remained in the proper nature of
   his own immutable deity; but that Christ who was sent, has fulfilled
   the economy of the incarnation. In like manner those who irreverently
   affirm that Christ was begotten not by the will and pleasure of his
   Father; thus attributing to God an involuntary necessity not springing
   from choice, as if he begat the Son by constraint, we consider most
   impious and strangers to the truth because they have dared to determine
   such things respecting him as are inconsistent with our common notions
   of God, and are contrary indeed to the sense of the divinely-inspired
   Scripture. For knowing that God is self-dependent and Lord of himself
   we devoutly maintain that of his own volition and pleasure he begat the
   Son. And while we reverentially believe what is spoken concerning him;
   [304] "The Lord created me the beginning of his ways on account of his
   works": yet we do not suppose that he was made similarly to the
   creatures or works made by him. For it is impious and repugnant to the
   church's faith to compare the Creator with the works created by him; or
   to imagine that he had the same manner of generation as things of a
   nature totally different from himself: for the sacred Scriptures teach
   us that the alone only-begotten Son was really and truly begotten. Nor
   when we say that the Son is of himself, and lives and subsists in like
   manner to the Father, do we therefore separate him from the Father, as
   if we supposed them dissociated by the intervention of space and
   distance in a material sense. For we believe that they are united
   without medium or interval, and that they are incapable of separation
   from each other: the whole Father embosoming the Son; and the whole Son
   attached to and eternally reposing in the Father's bosom. Believing,
   therefore, in the altogether perfect and most holy Trinity, and
   asserting that the Father is God, and that the Son also is God, we do
   not acknowledge two Gods, but one only, on account of the majesty of
   the Deity, and the perfect blending and union of the kingdoms: the
   Father ruling over all things universally, and even over the Son
   himself; the Son being subject to the Father, but except him, ruling
   over all things which were made after him and by him; and by the
   Father's will bestowing abundantly on the saints the grace of the Holy
   Spirit. For the Sacred Oracles inform us that in this consists the
   character of the sovereignty which Christ exercises.

   We have been compelled, since the publication of our former epitome, to
   give this more ample exposition of the creed; not in order to gratify a
   vain ambition, but to clear ourselves from all strange suspicion
   respecting our faith which may exist among those who are ignorant of
   our real sentiments. And that the inhabitants of the West may both be
   aware of the shameless misrepresentations of the heterodox party; and
   also know the ecclesiastical opinion of the Eastern bishops concerning
   Christ, confirmed by the unwrested testimony of the divinely-inspired
   Scriptures, among all those of unperverted minds.'

   Chapter XX.--Of the Council at Sardica. [305]

   The Western prelates on account of their being of another language, and
   not understanding this exposition, would not admit of it; saying that
   the Nicene Creed was sufficient, and that they would not waste time on
   anything beyond it. But when the emperor had again written to insist on
   the restoration to Paul and Athanasius of their respective sees, but
   without effect in consequence of the continual agitation of the
   people--these two bishops demanded that another Synod should be
   convened, so that their case, as well as other questions in relation to
   the faith might be settled by an ecumenical council, for they made it
   obvious that their deposition arose from no other cause than that the
   faith might be the more easily perverted. Another general council was
   therefore summoned to meet at Sardica,--a city of Illyricum,--by the
   joint authority of the two emperors; the one requesting by letter that
   it might be so, and the other, of the East, readily acquiescing in it.
   It was the eleventh year after the death of the father of the two
   Augusti, during the consulship of Rufinus and Eusebius, [306] that the
   Synod of Sardica met. According to the statement of Athanasius [307]
   about 300 bishops from the western parts of the empire were present;
   but Sabinus says there came only seventy from the eastern parts, among
   whom was Ischyras of Mareotes, [308] who had been ordained bishop of
   that country by those who deposed Athanasius. Of the rest, some
   pretended infirmity of body; others complained of the shortness of the
   notice given, casting the blame of it on Julius, bishop of Rome,
   although a year and a half had elapsed from the time of its having been
   summoned: in which interval Athanasius remained at Rome awaiting the
   assembling of the Synod. When at last they were convened at Sardica,
   the Eastern prelates refused either to meet or to enter into any
   conference with those of the West, unless they first excluded
   Athanasius and Paul from the convention. But as Protogenes, bishop of
   Sardica, and Hosius, bishop of Cordova, a city in Spain, would by no
   means permit them to be absent, the Eastern bishops immediately
   withdrew, and returning to Philippopolis in Thrace, held a separate
   council, wherein they openly anathematized the term homoousios; and
   having introduced the Anomoian [309] opinion into their epistles, they
   sent them in all directions. On the other hand those who remained at
   Sardica, condemning in the first place their departure, afterwards
   divested the accusers of Athanasius of their dignity; then confirming
   the Nicene Creed, and rejecting the term anomoion, they more distinctly
   recognized the doctrine of consubstantiality, which they also inserted
   in epistles addressed to all the churches. Both parties believed they
   had acted rightly: those of the East, because the Western bishops had
   countenanced those whom they had deposed; and these again, in
   consequence not only of the retirement of those who had deposed them
   before the matter had been examined into, but also because they
   themselves were the defenders of the Nicene faith, which the other
   party had dared to adulterate. They therefore restored to Paul and
   Athanasius their sees, and also Marcellus of Ancyra in Lesser Galatia,
   who had been deposed long before, as we have stated in the former book.
   [310] At that time indeed he exerted himself to the utmost to procure
   the revocation of the sentence pronounced against him, declaring that
   his being suspected of entertaining the error of Paul of Samosata arose
   from a misunderstanding of some expressions in his book. It must,
   however, be noticed that Eusebius Pamphilus wrote three entire books
   against Marcellus, [311] in which he quotes that author's own words to
   prove that he asserts with Sabellius the Libyan, and Paul of Samosata,
   that the Lord [Jesus] was a mere man.

   Socrates had ever seen them. At the end of the second book, Eusebius
   asserts that he had written at the request of the bishops who had
   excommunicated Marcellus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXI.--Defense of Eusebius Pamphilus.

   But since some have attempted to stigmatize even Eusebius Pamphilus
   himself as having favored the Arian views in his works, it may not be
   irrelevant here to make a few remarks respecting him. In the first
   place then he was both present at the council of Nicæa, which defined
   the doctrine of the homoousion and gave his assent to what was there
   determined. And in the third book of the Life of Constantine, he
   expressed himself in these words: [312] The emperor incited all to
   unanimity, until he had rendered them united in judgment on those
   points on which they were previously at variance; so that they were
   quite agreed at Nicæa in matters of faith.' Since therefore Eusebius,
   in mentioning the Nicene Synod, says that all differences were removed,
   and that all came to unity of sentiment, what ground is there for
   assuming that he was himself an Arian? The Arians are also certainly
   deceived in supposing him to be a favorer of their tenets. But some one
   will perhaps say that in his discourses he seems to have adopted the
   opinions of Arius, because of his frequently saying through Christ,
   [313] to whom we should answer that ecclesiastical writers often use
   this mode of expression and others of a similar kind denoting the
   economy of our Saviour's humanity: and that before all these the
   apostle [314] made use of such expressions, and never has been
   accounted a teacher of false doctrine. Moreover, inasmuch as Arius has
   dared to say that the Son is a creature, as one of the others, observe
   what Eusebius says on this subject, in his first book against
   Marcellus: [315]

   He alone, and no other, has been declared to be, and is the
   only-begotten Son of God; whence any one could justly censure those who
   have presumed to affirm that he is a Creature made of nothing, like the
   rest of the creatures; for how then would he be a Son? and how could he
   be God's only-begotten, were he assigned the same nature as the other
   creatures...and were he one of the many created things, seeing that he,
   like them, would in that case be partaker of a creation from nothing?
   But the Sacred Scriptures do not thus instruct us.' He again adds a
   little afterwards: Whoever then defines the Son as made of things that
   are not, and as a creature produced from nothing pre-existing, forgets
   that while he concedes the name of Son, he denies him to be a Son in
   reality. For he that is made of nothing, cannot truly be the Son of
   God, any more than the other things which have been made; but the true
   Son of God, forasmuch as he is begotten of the Father, is properly
   denominated the only-begotten and beloved of the Father. For this
   reason also, he himself is God; for what can the offspring of God be,
   but the perfect resemblance of him who begot him? A sovereign indeed
   builds a city, but does not beget it; and is said to beget a son, not
   to build one. An artificer, also, may be called the framer, but not the
   father of his work; while he could by no means be styled the framer of
   him whom he had begotten. So also the God of the Universe is the Father
   of the Son; but might be fitly termed the Framer and Maker of the
   world. And although it is once said in Scripture, [316] "The Lord
   created me the beginning of his ways on account of his works," yet it
   becomes us to consider the import of this phrase, which I shall
   hereafter explain; and not, as Marcellus has done, from a single
   passage to jeopardize the most important doctrine of the church.'

   These and many other such expressions Eusebius Pamphilus has given
   utterance to in the first book against Marcellus; and in his third
   book, [317] declaring in what sense the term creature is to be taken,
   he says:

   Accordingly, these things being thus established, it follows that in
   the same sense as that which preceded, the words, "The Lord created me
   the beginning of his ways, on account of his works," must have been
   spoken. For although he says that he was created, it is not as if he
   should say that he had arrived at existence from what was not, nor that
   he himself also was made of nothing like the rest of the creatures,
   which some have erroneously supposed; but as subsisting, living,
   pre-existing, and being before the constitution of the whole world; and
   having been appointed to rule the universe by his Lord and Father: the
   word created being here used instead of ordained or constituted.
   Certainly the apostle [318] expressly called the rulers and governors
   among men creature, when he said, "Submit yourselves to every human
   creature for the Lord's sake; whether to the king as supreme, or to
   governors as those sent by him." The prophet also [319] when he says,
   "Prepare, Israel, to invoke thy God. For behold he who confirms the
   thunder, creates the Spirit, and announces his Christ unto men": ...has
   not used the word "he who creates" in the sense of makes out of
   nothing. For God did not then create the Spirit, when he declared his
   Christ to all men, since [320] "There is nothing new under the sun";
   but the Spirit existed, and had being previously: but he was sent at
   what time the apostles were gathered together, when like thunder "There
   came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind; and they were
   filled with the Holy Spirit." [321] And thus they declared unto all men
   the Christ of God, in accordance with that prophecy which says, [322]
   "Behold he who confirms the thunder, creates the Spirit, and announces
   his Christ unto men": the word "creates" being used instead of "sends
   down," or appoints; and thunder in another figure implying the
   preaching of the Gospel. Again he that says, "Create in me a clean
   heart, O God," [323] said not this as if he had no heart; but prayed
   that his mind might be purified. Thus also it is said, [324] "That he
   might create the two into one new man," instead of unite. Consider also
   whether this passage is not of the same kind, [325] "Clothe yourselves
   with the new man, which is created according to God"; and this, [326]
   "If, therefore, any one be in Christ, he is a new creature"; and
   whatever other expressions of a similar nature any one may find who
   shall carefully search the divinely inspired Scripture. Wherefore, one
   should not be surprised if in this passage, "The Lord created me the
   beginning of his ways," the term "created" is used metaphorically,
   instead of "appointed" or constituted.'

   Such words Eusebius uses in his work against Marcellus; we have quoted
   them on account of those who have slanderously attempted to traduce and
   criminate him. Neither can they prove that Eusebius attributes a
   beginning of subsistence to the Son of God, although they may find him
   often using the expressions by accommodation; and especially so,
   because he was an emulator and admirer of the works of Origen, in which
   those who are able to comprehend the depth of Origen's writings, will
   perceive it to be everywhere stated that the Son was begotten of the
   Father. These remarks have been made in passing, in order to refute
   those who have misrepresented Eusebius.

   Chapter XXII.--The Council of Sardica restores Paul and Athanasius to
   their Sees; and on the Eastern Emperor's Refusal to admit them, the
   Emperor of the West threatens him with War.

   Those convened at Sardica, as well as those who had formed a separate
   council at Philippopolis in Thrace, having severally performed what
   they deemed requisite, returned to their respective cities. From that
   time, therefore, the Western church was severed from the Eastern; [327]
   and the boundary of communion between them was the mountain called
   Soucis, [328] which divides the Illyrians from the Thracians. As far as
   this mountain there was indiscriminate communion, although there was a
   difference of faith; but beyond it they did not commune with one
   another. Such was the perturbed condition of the churches at that
   period. Soon after these transactions, the emperor of the Western parts
   informed his brother Constantius of what had taken place at Sardica,
   and begged him to restore Paul and Athanasius to their sees. But as
   Constantius delayed to carry this matter into effect, the emperor of
   the West again wrote to him, giving him the choice either of
   re-establishing Paul and Athanasius in their former dignity, and
   restoring their churches to them; or, on his failing to do this, of
   regarding him as his enemy, and immediately expecting war. The letter
   which he addressed to his brother was as follows:

   Athanasius and Paul are here with me; and I am quite satisfied after
   investigation, that they are persecuted for the sake of piety. If,
   therefore, you will pledge yourself to reinstate them in their sees,
   and to punish those who have so unjustly injured them, I will send them
   to you; but should you refuse to do this, be assured, that I will
   myself come thither, and restore them to their own sees, in spite of
   your opposition.'

   recognized in the ancient church, see Bingham, Eccl. Antiq. Bk. XVI. 1.

   Chapter XXIII.--Constantius, being Afraid of his Brother's Threats,
   recalls Athanasius by Letter, and sends him to Alexandria.

   On receiving this communication the emperor of the East fell into
   perplexity; and immediately sending for the greater part of the Eastern
   bishops, he acquainted them with the choice his brother had submitted
   to him, and asked what ought to be done. They replied, it was better to
   concede the churches to Athanasius, than to undertake a civil war.
   Accordingly the emperor, urged by necessity, summoned Athanasius and
   his friends to his presence. Meanwhile the emperor of the West sent
   Paul to Constantinople, with two bishops and other honorable
   attendance, having fortified him with his own letters, together with
   those of the Synod. But while Athanasius was still apprehensive, and
   hesitated to go to him,--for he dreaded the treachery of his
   calumniators,--the emperor of the East not once only, but even a second
   and a third time, invited him to come to him; this is evident from his
   letters, which, translated from the Latin tongue, are as follows:

   Epistle of Constantius to Athanasius. [329]

   Constantius Victor Augustus to Athanasius the bishop.

   Our compassionate clemency cannot permit you to be any longer tossed
   and disquieted as it were by the boisterous waves of the sea. Our
   unwearied piety has not been unmindful of you driven from your native
   home, despoiled of your property, and wandering in pathless solitudes.
   And although I have too long deferred acquainting you by letter with
   the purpose of my mind, expecting your coming to us of your own accord
   to seek a remedy for your troubles; yet since fear perhaps has hindered
   the execution of your wishes, we therefore have sent to your reverence
   letters full of indulgence, in order that you may fearlessly hasten to
   appear in our presence, whereby after experiencing our benevolence, you
   may attain your desire, and be re-established in your proper position.
   For this reason I have requested my Lord and brother Constans Victor
   Augustus to grant you permission to come, to the end that by the
   consent of us both you may be restored to your country, having this
   assurance of our favor.

   Another Epistle to Athanasius.

   Constantius Victor Augustus to the bishop Athanasius.

   Although we have abundantly intimated in a former letter that you might
   confidently come to our court, [330] as we are extremely anxious to
   reinstate you in your proper place, yet we have again addressed this
   letter to your reverence. We therefore urge you, without any distrust
   or apprehension, to take a public vehicle and hasten to us, in order
   that you may be able to obtain what you desire.

   Another Epistle to Athanasius.

   Constantius Victor Augustus to the bishop Athanasius.

   While we were residing at Edessa, where your presbyters were present,
   it pleased us to send one of them to you, for the purpose of hastening
   your arrival at our court, in order that after having been introduced
   to our presence, you might forthwith proceed to Alexandria. But
   inasmuch as a considerable time has elapsed since you received our
   letter, and yet have not come, we now therefore hasten to remind you to
   speedily present yourself before us, that so you may be able to return
   to your country, and obtain your desire. For the more ample assurance
   of our intention, we have despatched to you Achetas the deacon, from
   whom you will learn both our mind in regard to you, and that you will
   be able to secure what you wish; viz., our readiness to facilitate the
   objects you have in view.

   When Athanasius had received these letters at Aquileia,--for there he
   abode after his departure from Sardica,--he immediately hastened to
   Rome; and having shown these communications to Julius the bishop, he
   caused the greatest joy in the Roman Church. For it seemed as if the
   emperor of the East also had recognized their faith, since he had
   recalled Athanasius. Julius then wrote to the clergy and laity of
   Alexandria on behalf of Athanasius as follows:

   Epistle of Julius, Bishop of Rome, to those at Alexandria. [331]

   Julius, the bishop, to the presbyters, deacons, and people inhabiting
   Alexandria, brethren beloved, salutations in the Lord.

   I also rejoice with you, beloved brethren, because you at length see
   before your eyes the fruit of your faith. For that this is really so,
   any one may perceive in reference to my brother and fellow-prelate
   Athanasius, whom God has restored to you, both on account of his purity
   of life, and in answer to your prayers. From this it is evident that
   your supplications to God have unceasingly been offered pure and
   abounding with love; for mindful of the divine promises and of the
   charity connected with them, which ye learned from the instruction of
   my brother, ye knew assuredly, and according to the sound faith which
   is in you clearly foresaw that your bishop would not be separated from
   you for ever, whom ye had in your devout hearts as though he were ever
   present. Wherefore it is unnecessary for me to use many words in
   addressing you, for your faith has already anticipated whatever I could
   have said; and the common prayer of you all has been fulfilled
   according to the grace of Christ. I therefore rejoice with you, and
   repeat that ye have preserved your souls invincible in the faith. And
   with my brother Athanasius I rejoice equally; because, while suffering
   many afflictions, he has never been unmindful of your love and desire;
   for although he seemed to be withdrawn from you in person for a season,
   yet was he always present with you in spirit. Moreover, I am convinced,
   beloved, that every trial which he has endured has not been inglorious;
   since both your faith and his has thus been tested and made manifest to
   all. But had not so many troubles happened to him, who would have
   believed, either that you had so great esteem and love for this eminent
   prelate, or that he was endowed with such distinguished virtues, on
   account of which also he will by no means be defrauded of his hope in
   the heavens? He has accordingly obtained a testimony of confession in
   every way glorious both in the present age and in that which is to
   come. For having suffered so many and diversified trials both by land
   and by sea, he has trampled on every machination of the Arian heresy;
   and though often exposed to danger in consequence of envy, he despised
   death, being protected by Almighty God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, ever
   trusting that he should not only escape the plots [of his adversaries],
   but also be restored for your consolation, and bring back to you at the
   same time greater trophies from your own conscience. By which means he
   has been made known even to the ends of the whole earth as glorious,
   his worth having been approved by the purity of his life, the firmness
   of his purpose, and his steadfastness in the heavenly doctrine, all
   being attested by your unchanging esteem and love. He therefore returns
   to you, more illustrious now than when he departed from you. For if the
   fire tries the precious metals (I speak of gold and silver) for
   purification, what can be said of so excellent a man proportionate to
   his worth, who after having overcome the fire of so many calamities and
   dangers, is now restored to you, being declared innocent not only by
   us, but also by the whole Synod? Receive therefore with godly honor and
   joy, beloved brethren, your bishop Athanasius, together with those who
   have been his companions in tribulation. And rejoice in having attained
   the object of your prayers, you who have supplied with meat and drink,
   by your supporting letters, your pastor hungering and thirsting, so to
   speak, for your spiritual welfare. And in fact ye were a comfort to him
   while he was sojourning in a strange land; and ye cherished him in your
   most faithful affections when he was plotted against and persecuted. As
   for me, it makes me happy even to picture to myself in imagination the
   delight of each one of you at his return, the pious greetings of the
   populace, the glorious festivity of those assembled to meet him, and
   indeed what the entire aspect of that day will be when my brother shall
   be brought back to you again; when past troubles will be at an end, and
   his prized and longed-for return will unite all hearts in the warmest
   expression of joy. This feeling will in a very high degree extend to
   us, who regard it as a token of divine favor that we should have been
   privileged to become acquainted with so eminent a person. It becomes us
   therefore to close this epistle with prayer. May God Almighty and his
   Son our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ afford you this grace
   continually, thus rewarding the admirable faith which ye have
   manifested in reference to your bishop by an illustrious testimony:
   that the things most excellent which Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,
   neither have entered into the heart of man; even the things which God
   has prepared for them that love him,' [332] may await you and yours in
   the world to come, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom be glory
   to God Almighty for ever and ever, Amen. I pray that ye may be
   strengthened, beloved brethren.

   Athanasius, relying on these letters, arrived at the East. The Emperor
   Constantius did not at that time receive him with hostility of feeling;
   nevertheless at the instigation of the Arians he endeavored to
   circumvent him, and addressed him in these words: You have been
   reinstated in your see in accordance with the decree of the Synod, and
   with our consent. But inasmuch as some of the people of Alexandria
   refuse to hold communion with you, permit them to have one church in
   the city.' To this demand Athanasius promptly replied: You have the
   power, my sovereign, both to order, and to carry into effect, whatever
   you may please. I also, therefore, would beg you to grant me a favor.'
   The emperor having readily promised to acquiesce, Athanasius
   immediately added, that he desired the same thing might be conceded to
   him, which the emperor had sought from him, viz.: that in every city
   one church should be assigned to those who might refuse to hold
   communion with the Arians. The Arians perceiving the purpose of
   Athanasius to be inimical to their interests, said that this affair
   might be postponed to another time: but they suffered the emperor to
   act as he pleased. He therefore restored to Athanasius, Paul, and
   Marcellus their respective sees; as also to Asclepas, bishop of Gaza,
   and Lucius of Adrianople. For these, too, had been received by the
   Council of Sardica: Asclepas, because he showed records from which it
   appeared that Eusebius Pamphilus, in conjunction with several others,
   after having investigated his case, had restored him to his former
   rank; and Lucius, because his accusers had fled. Hereupon the emperor's
   edicts were despatched to their respective cities, enjoining the
   inhabitants to receive them readily. At Ancyra indeed, when Basil was
   ejected, and Marcellus was introduced in his stead, there was a
   considerable tumult made, which afforded his enemies an occasion of
   calumniating him: but the people of Gaza willingly received Asclepas.
   Macedonius at Constantinople, for a short time gave place to Paul,
   convening assemblies by himself separately, in a separate church in
   that city. Moreover the emperor wrote on behalf of Athanasius to the
   bishops, clergy, and laity, in regard to receiving him cheerfully: and
   at the same time he ordered by other letters, that whatever had been
   enacted against him in the judicial courts should be abrogated. The
   communications respecting both these matters were as follows:

   The Epistle of Constantius in Behalf of Athanasius. [333]

   Victor Constantius Maximus Augustus, to the bishops and presbyters of
   the Catholic Church.

   The most reverend bishop Athanasius has not been forsaken by the grace
   of God. But although he was for a short time subjected to trial
   according to men, yet has he obtained from an omniscient Providence the
   exoneration which was due to him; having been restored by the will of
   God, and our decision, both to his country and to the church over which
   by divine permission he presided. It was therefore suitable that what
   is in accordance with this should be duly attended to by our clemency:
   so that all things which have been heretofore determined against those
   who held communion with him should now be rescinded; that all suspicion
   against him should henceforward cease; and that the immunity which
   those clergymen who are with him formerly enjoyed, should be, as it is
   meet, confirmed to them. Moreover, we thought it just to add this to
   our grace toward him, that the whole ecclesiastical body should
   understand that protection is extended to all who have adhered to him,
   whether bishops or other clergymen: and union with him shall be a
   sufficient evidence of each person's right intention. Wherefore we have
   ordered, according to the similitude of the previous providence, that
   as many as have the wisdom to enroll themselves with the sounder
   judgment and party and to choose his communion, shall enjoy that
   indulgence which we have now granted in accordance with the will of
   God.

   Another Epistle sent to the Alexandrians. [334]

   Victor Constantius Maximus Augustus, to the people of the Catholic
   Church at Alexandria.

   Setting before us as an aim your good order in all respects, and
   knowing that you have long since been bereft of episcopal oversight, we
   thought it just to send back to you again Athanasius your bishop, a man
   known to all by the rectitude and sanctity of his life and manners.
   Having received him with your usual and becoming courtesy, and
   constituted him the assistant of your prayers to God, exert yourselves
   to maintain at all times, according to the ecclesiastical canon,
   harmony and peace, which will be alike honorable to yourselves, and
   grateful to us. For it is unreasonable that any dissension or faction
   should be excited among you, hostile to the prosperity of our times;
   and we trust that such a misfortune will be wholly removed from you. We
   exhort you, therefore, to assiduously persevere in your accustomed
   devotions, by his assistance, as we before said: so that when this
   resolution of yours shall become generally known, entering into the
   prayers of all, even the pagans, who are still enslaved in the
   ignorance of idolatrous worship, may hasten to seek the knowledge of
   our sacred religion, most beloved Alexandrians. Again, therefore, we
   exhort you to give heed to these things: heartily welcome your bishop,
   as one appointed you by the will of God and our decree; and esteem him
   worthy of being embraced with all the affections of your souls. For
   this becomes you, and is consistent with our clemency. But in order to
   check all tendency to seditions and tumult in persons of a factious
   disposition, orders have been issued to our judges to give up to the
   severity of the laws all whom they may discover to be seditious. Having
   regard, therefore, to our determination and God's, [335] as well as to
   the anxiety we feel to secure harmony among you, and remembering also
   the punishment that will be inflicted on the disorderly, make it your
   especial care to act agreeably to the sanctions of our sacred religion,
   with all reverence honoring your bishop; that so in conjunction with
   him you may present your supplications to the God and Father of the
   universe, both for yourselves, and for the orderly government of the
   whole human race.

   An Epistle respecting the Rescinding of the Enactments against
   Athanasius.

   Victor Constantius Augustus to Nestorius, and in the same terms to the
   governors of Augustamnica, Thebaïs, and Libya.

   If it be found that at any time previously any enactment has been
   passed prejudicial and derogatory to those who hold communion with
   Athanasius the bishop, our pleasure is that it should now be wholly
   abrogated; and that his clergy should again enjoy the same immunity
   which was granted to them formerly. We enjoin strict obedience to this
   command, to the intent that since the bishop Athanasius has been
   restored to his church, all who hold communion with him may possess the
   same privileges as they had before, and such as other ecclesiastics now
   enjoy: that so their affairs being happily arranged, they also may
   share in the general prosperity.

   Chapter XXIV.--Athanasius, passing through Jerusalem on his Return to
   Alexandria, is received into Communion by Maximus: and a Synod of
   Bishops, convened in that City, confirms the Nicene Creed.

   Athanasius the bishop being fortified with such letters as these,
   passed through Syria, and came into Palestine. On arriving at Jerusalem
   he acquainted Maximus the bishop both with what had been done in the
   Council of Sardica, and also that the Emperor Constantius had confirmed
   its decision: he then proposed that a Synod of the bishops there should
   be held. Maximus, [336] therefore, without delay sent for certain of
   the bishops of Syria and Palestine, and having assembled a council, he
   restored Athanasius to communion, and to his former dignity. After
   which the Synod communicated by letter [337] to the Alexandrians, and
   to all the bishops of Egypt and Libya, what had been determined
   respecting Athanasius. Whereupon the adversaries of Athanasius
   exceedingly derided Maximus, because having before assisted in his
   deposition, he had suddenly changed his mind, and as if nothing had
   previously taken place, had voted for his restoration to communion and
   rank. When Ursacius and Valens, who had been fiery partisans of
   Arianism, ascertained these things, condemning their former zeal, they
   proceeded to Rome, where they presented their recantation to Julius the
   bishop, and gave their assent to the doctrine of consubstantiality:
   they also wrote to Athanasius, and expressed their readiness to hold
   communion with him in future. Thus Ursacius and Valens were at that
   time subdued by the good fortune of Athanasius and induced to recognize
   the orthodox faith. Athanasius passed through Pelusium on his way to
   Alexandria, and admonished the inhabitants of every city to beware of
   the Arians, and to receive those only that professed the Homoousian
   faith. In some of the churches also he performed ordination; which
   afforded another ground of accusation against him, because of his
   undertaking to ordain in the dioceses of others. [338] Such was the
   progress of affairs at that period in reference to Athanasius.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [336] The bishop of Jerusalem was under the jurisdiction of the
   metropolitan bishop of Cæsarea, and according to later usage and canon,
   had no right to call a synod without the permission of the
   metropolitan. Evidently usage had not yet become fixed into uniformity
   in this respect.

   [337] Cf. Athan, Apol. c. Arian. 57.

   [338] Cf. Apost. Cann. XXXV. Let not a bishop dare to ordain beyond his
   limits, in cities and places not subject to him.' It follows,
   therefore, that the whole of Egypt was not under the bishop of
   Alexandria; otherwise no such charge as is here mentioned could have
   been made against Athanasius. That these ordinations were made in Egypt
   is evident from the mention of Pelusium, which Athanasius had already
   passed through.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXV.--Of the Usurpers Magnentius and Vetranio.

   About this time an extraordinary commotion shook the whole state, of
   the principal heads, of which we shall give a brief account, deeming it
   necessary not to pass over them altogether. We mentioned in our first
   book, [339] that after the death of the founder of Constantinople, his
   three sons succeeded him in the empire: it must now be also stated,
   that a kinsman of theirs, Dalmatius, so named from his father, shared
   with them the imperial authority. This person after being associated
   with them in the sovereignty for a very little while, the soldiers put
   to death, [340] Constantius having neither commanded his destruction,
   nor forbidden it. The manner in which Constantine the younger was also
   killed by the soldiers, on his invading that division of the empire
   which belonged to his brother, has already been recorded [341] more
   than once. After his death, the Persian war was raised against the
   Romans, in which Constantius did nothing prosperously: for in a battle
   fought by night on the frontiers of both parties, the Persians had to
   some slight extent the advantage. And this at a time when the affairs
   of the Christians became no less unsettled, there being great
   disturbance throughout the churches on account of Athanasius, and the
   term homoousion. Affairs having reached this pass, there sprang up a
   tyrant in the western parts called Magnentius, [342] who by treachery
   slew Constans, the emperor of the western division of the empire, at
   that time residing in the Gauls. This being done, a furious civil war
   arose, and Magnentius made himself master of all Italy, reduced Africa
   and Libya under his power, and even obtained possession of the Gauls.
   But at the city of Sirmium in Illyricum, the military set up another
   tyrant whose name was Vetranio; [343] while a fresh trouble threw Rome
   itself into commotion. For there was a nephew of Constantine's,
   Nepotian by name, who, supported by a body of gladiators, there assumed
   the sovereignty. He was, however, slain by some of the officers of
   Magnentius, who himself invaded the western provinces, and spread
   desolation in every direction.

   Chapter XXVI.--After the Death of Constans, the Western Emperor, Paul
   and Athanasius are again ejected from their Sees: the Former on his Way
   into Exile is slain; but the Latter escapes by Flight.

   The conflux of these disastrous events occurred during a short space of
   time; for they happened in the fourth year after the council at
   Sardica, during the consulate of Sergius and Nigrinian. [344] When
   these circumstances were published, the entire sovereignty of the
   empire seemed to devolve on Constantius alone, who, being accordingly
   proclaimed in the East sole Autocrat, made the most vigorous
   preparations against the usurpers. Hereupon the adversaries of
   Athanasius, thinking a favorable crisis had arisen, again framed the
   most calumnious charges against him, before his arrival at Alexandria;
   assuring the Emperor Constantius that he was subverting all Egypt and
   Libya. And his having undertaken to ordain out of the limits of his own
   diocese, tended not a little to accredit the accusations against him.
   Meanwhile in this conjuncture, Athanasius entered Alexandria; and
   having convened a council of the bishops in Egypt, they confirmed by
   their unanimous vote, what had been determined in the Synod at Sardica,
   and that assembled at Jerusalem by Maximus. But the emperor, who had
   been long since imbued with Arian doctrine, reversed all the indulgent
   proceedings he had so recently resolved on. And first of all he ordered
   that Paul, bishop of Constantinople, should be sent into exile; whom
   those who conducted strangled, at Cucusus in Cappadocia. Marcellus was
   also ejected, and Basil again made ruler of the church at Ancyra.
   Lucius of Adrianople, being loaded with chains, died in prison. The
   reports which were made concerning Athanasius so wrought on the
   emperor's mind, that in an ungovernable fury he commanded him to be put
   to death wherever he might be found: he moreover included Theodulus and
   Olympius, who presided over churches in Thrace, in the same
   proscription. Athanasius, however, was not ignorant of the intentions
   of the emperor; but learning of them he once more had recourse to
   flight, and so escaped the emperor's menaces. The Arians denounced this
   retreat as criminal, particularly Narcissus, bishop of Neronias in
   Cilicia, George of Laodicæa, and Leontius who then had the oversight of
   the church at Antioch. This last person, when a presbyter, had been
   divested of his rank, [345] because in order to remove all suspicion of
   illicit intercourse with a woman named Eustolium, with whom he spent a
   considerable portion of his time, he had castrated himself and
   thenceforward lived more unreservedly with her, on the ground that
   there could be no longer any ground for evil surmises. Afterwards
   however, at the earnest desire of the Emperor Constantius, he was
   created bishop of the church at Antioch, after Stephen, the successor
   of Placitus. So much respecting this.

   [345] Cf. Apost. Cann. XXII. and XXIII.; according to these any cleric
   was to be deposed if found guilty of such a crime. The Council of Nicæa
   also passed a canon on the subject which is as follows: If a man has
   been mutilated by physicians during sickness, or by barbarians, he may
   remain among the clergy; but if a man in good health has mutilated
   himself, he must resign his post after the matter has been proved among
   the clergy, and in future no one who has thus acted should be ordained.
   But as it is evident that what has just been said only concerns those
   who have thus acted with intention, and have dared to mutilate
   themselves, those who have been made eunuchs by barbarians or by their
   masters will be allowed, conformably to the canon, to remain among the
   clergy, if in other respects they are worthy.' Canon I. See Hefele,
   Hist. of the Councils, Vol. I. p. 375, 376.

   Chapter XXVII.--Macedonius having possessed himself of the See of
   Constantinople inflicts much Injury on those who differ from him.

   At that time Paul having been removed in the manner described,
   Macedonius became ruler of the churches in Constantinople; who,
   acquiring very great ascendancy over the emperor, stirred up a war
   among Christians, of a no less grievous kind than that which the
   usurpers themselves were waging. For having prevailed on his sovereign
   to co-operate with him in devastating the churches, he procured that
   whatever pernicious measures he determined to pursue should be ratified
   by law. And on this account throughout the several cities an edict was
   proclaimed, and a military force appointed to carry the imperial
   decrees into effect. Accordingly those who acknowledged the doctrine of
   consubstantiality were expelled not only from the churches, but also
   from the cities. Now at first they were satisfied with expulsion; but
   as the evil grew they resorted to the worse extremity of inducing
   compulsory communion with them, caring but little for such a
   desecration of the churches. Their violence indeed was scarcely less
   than that of those who had formerly obliged the Christians to worship
   idols; for they applied all kinds of scourgings, a variety of tortures,
   and confiscation of property. Many were punished with exile; some died
   under the torture; and others were put to death while they were being
   led into exile. These atrocities were exercised throughout all the
   eastern cities, but especially at Constantinople; the internal strife
   which was but slight before was thus savagely increased by Macedonius,
   as soon as he obtained the bishopric. The cities of Greece, however,
   and Illyricum, with those of the western parts, still enjoyed
   tranquillity; inasmuch as they preserved harmony among themselves, and
   continued to adhere to the rule of faith promulgated by the council of
   Nicæa.

   Chapter XXVIII.--Athanasius' Account of the Deeds of Violence committed
   at Alexandria by George the Arian.

   What cruelties George perpetrated at Alexandria at the same time may be
   learned from the narration of Athanasius, who both suffered in and
   witnessed the occurrences. In his Apology for his flight,' [346]
   speaking of these transactions, he thus expresses himself:

   Moreover, they came to Alexandria, again seeking to destroy me: and on
   this occasion their proceedings were worse than before; for the
   soldiery having suddenly surrounded the church, there arose the din of
   war, instead of the voice of prayer. Afterwards, on his arrival during
   Lent, [347] George, sent from Cappadocia, added to the evil which he
   was instructed to work. When Easter-week [348] was passed, the virgins
   were cast into prison, the bishops were led in chains by the military,
   and the dwellings even of orphans and widows were forcibly entered and
   their provisions pillaged. Christians were assassinated by night;
   houses were sealed; [349] and the relatives of the clergy were
   endangered on their account. Even these outrages were dreadful; but
   those that followed were still more so. For in the week after the holy
   Pentecost, the people, having fasted, went forth to the cemetery to
   pray, because all were averse to communion with George: that wickedest
   of men being informed of this, instigated against them Sebastian, an
   officer who was a Manichæan. He, accordingly, at the head of a body of
   troops armed with drawn swords, bows, and darts, marched out to attack
   the people, although it was the Lord's day: finding but few at
   prayers,--as the most part had retired because of the lateness of the
   hour,--he performed such exploits as might be expected from them.
   Having kindled a fire, he set the virgins near it, in order to compel
   them to say that they were of the Arian faith: but seeing they stood
   their ground and despised the fire, he then stripped them, and so beat
   them on the face, that for a long time afterwards they could scarcely
   be recognized. Seizing also about forty men, he flogged them in an
   extraordinary manner: for he so lacerated their backs with rods fresh
   cut from the palm-tree, which still had their thorns on, that some were
   obliged to resort repeatedly to surgical aid in order to have the
   thorns extracted from their flesh, and others, unable to bear the
   agony, died under its infliction. All the survivors with one virgin
   they banished to the Great Oasis. [350] The bodies of the dead they did
   not so much as give up to their relatives, but denying them the rites
   of sepulture they concealed them as they thought fit, that the
   evidences of their cruelty might not appear. They did this acting as
   madmen. For while the friends of the deceased rejoiced on account of
   their confession, but mourned because their bodies were uninterred, the
   impious inhumanity of these acts was sounded abroad the more
   conspicuously. For soon after this they sent into exile out of Egypt
   and the two Libyas the following bishops: Ammonius, Thmuïs, Caïus,
   Philo, Hermes, Pliny, Psenosiris, Nilammon, Agatho, Anagamphus, Mark,
   Ammonius, another Mark, Dracontius, Adelphius, and Athenodorus; and the
   presbyters Hierax and Discorus. And so harshly did they treat them in
   conducting them, that some expired while on their journey, and others
   in the place of banishment. In this way they got rid of more than
   thirty bishops, for the anxious desire of the Arians, like Ahab's, was
   to exterminate the truth if possible.'

   Such are the words of Athanasius in regard to the atrocities
   perpetrated by George at Alexandria. The emperor meanwhile led his army
   into Illyricum. For there the urgency of public affairs demanded his
   presence; and especially the proclamation of Vetranio [351] as emperor
   by the military. On arriving at Sirmium, he came to a conference with
   Vetranio during a truce; and so managed, that the soldiers who had
   previously declared for him changed sides, and saluted Constantius
   alone as Augustus and sovereign autocrat. In the acclamations,
   therefore, no notice was taken of Vetranio. Vetranio, perceiving
   himself to be abandoned, immediately threw himself at the feet of the
   emperor; Constantius, taking from him his imperial crown and purple,
   treated him with great clemency, and recommended him to pass the rest
   of his days tranquilly in the condition of a private citizen: observing
   that a life of repose at his advanced age was far more suitable than a
   dignity which entailed anxieties and care. Vetranio's affairs came to
   this issue; and the emperor ordered that a liberal provision out of the
   public revenue should be given him. Often afterwards writing to the
   emperor during his residence at Prusa in Bithynia, Vetranio assured him
   that he had conferred the greatest blessing on him, by liberating him
   from the disquietudes which are the inseparable concomitants of
   sovereign power. Adding that he himself did not act wisely in depriving
   himself of that happiness in retirement, which he had bestowed upon
   him. Let this suffice on this point. After these things, the Emperor
   Constantius having created Gallus his kinsman Cæsar, and given him his
   own name, [352] sent him to Antioch in Syria, providing thus for the
   guarding of the eastern parts. When Gallus was entering this city, the
   Savior's sign appeared in the East: [353] for a pillar in the form of a
   cross seen in the heavens gave occasion of great amazement to the
   spectators. His other generals the emperor despatched against
   Magnentius with considerable forces, and he himself remained at
   Sirmium, awaiting the course of events.

   Chapter XXIX.--Of the Heresiarch Photinus.

   During this time Photinus, [354] who then presided over the church in
   that city more openly avowed the creed he had devised; wherefore a
   tumult being made in consequence, the emperor ordered a Synod of
   bishops to be held at Sirmium. There were accordingly convened there of
   the Oriental bishops, [355] Mark of Arethusa, George of Alexandria,
   whom the Arians sent, as I have before said, having placed him over
   that see on the removal of Gregory, Basil who presided over the church
   at Ancyra after Marcellus was ejected, Pancratius of Pelusium, and
   Hypatian of Heraclea. Of the Western bishops there were present Valens
   of Mursa, and the then celebrated Hosius of Cordova in Spain, who
   attended much against his will. These met at Sirmium, after the
   consulate of Sergius and Nigrinian, [356] in which year no consul
   celebrated the customary inaugural [357] solemnities, in consequence of
   the tumults of war; and having met and found that Photinus held the
   heresy of Sabellius the Libyan, and Paul of Samosata, they immediately
   deposed him. This decision was both at that time and afterwards
   universally commended as honorable and just; but those who continued
   there, subsequently acted in a way which was by no means so generally
   approved.

   Chapter XXX.--Creeds published at Sirmium in Presence of the Emperor
   Constantius.

   As if they would rescind their former determinations respecting the
   faith, they published anew other expositions of the creed, viz.: one
   which Mark of Arethusa composed in Greek; and others in Latin, which
   harmonized neither in expression nor in sentiment with one another, nor
   with that dictated by the bishop of Arethusa. I shall here subjoin one
   of those drawn up in Latin, to that prepared in Greek by Mark: the
   other, which was afterwards recited at Sirmium, [358] will be given
   when we describe what was done at Ariminum. It must be understood,
   however, that both the Latin forms were translated into Greek. The
   declaration of faith set forth by Mark, was as follows: [359]

   We believe in one God the Father Almighty, the Creator and Maker of all
   things, of whom the whole family in heaven and on earth is named, [360]
   and in his only begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was begotten
   of the Father before all ages, God of God, Light of Light, by whom all
   things visible and invisible, which are in the heavens and upon the
   earth, were made: who is the Word, and the Wisdom, and the true Light,
   and the Life; who in the last days for our sake was made man and born
   of the holy virgin, and was crucified and died, and was buried, and
   rose again from the dead on the third day, and was received up into
   heaven, and sat at the right hand of the Father, and is coming at the
   completion of the age to judge the living and the dead, and to requite
   every one according to his works: whose kingdom being everlasting,
   endures into infinite ages; for he will be seated at the Father's right
   hand, not only in the present age, but also in that which is to come.
   [We believe] also in the Holy Spirit, that is to say the Comforter,
   whom, having promised to his apostles after his ascension into the
   heavens, to teach them, and bring all things to their remembrance, he
   sent; by whom also the souls of those who have sincerely believed in
   him are sanctified. But those who affirm that the Son is of things
   which are not, or of another substance, and not of God, and that there
   was a time or an age when he was not, the holy and catholic Church
   recognizes to be aliens. We therefore again say, if any one affirms
   that the Father and Son are two Gods, let him be anathema. And if any
   one admits that Christ is God and the Son of God before the ages, but
   does not confess that he ministered to the Father in the formation of
   all things, let him be anathema. If any one shall dare to assert that
   the Unbegotten, or a part of him, was born of Mary, let him be
   anathema. If any one should say that the Son was of Mary according to
   foreknowledge, and not that he was with God, begotten of the Father
   before the ages, and that all things were not made by him, let him be
   anathema. If any one affirms the essence of God to be dilated or
   contracted, let him be anathema. If any one says that the dilated
   essence of God makes the Son, or shall term the Son the dilatation of
   his essence, let him be anathema. If any one calls the Son of God the
   internal or uttered word, let him be anathema. If any one declares that
   the Son that was born of Mary was man only, let him be anathema. If any
   man affirming him that was born of Mary to be God and man, shall imply
   the unbegotten God himself, let him be anathema. If any one shall
   understand the text, "I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me
   there is no God," [361] which was spoken for the destruction of idols
   and false gods, in the sense the Jews do, as if it were said for the
   subversion of the only-begotten of God before the ages, let him be
   anathema. If any one hearing "the Word was made flesh," [362] should
   imagine that the Word was changed into flesh, or that he underwent any
   change in assuming flesh, let him be anathema. If any one hearing that
   the only-begotten Son of God was crucified, should say that his
   divinity underwent any corruption, or suffering, or change, or
   diminution, or destruction, let him be anathema. If any one should
   affirm that the Father said not to the Son, "Let us make man," [363]
   but that God spoke to himself, let him be anathema. If any one says
   that it was not the Son that was seen by Abraham, but the unbegotten
   God, or a part of him, let him be anathema. If any one says that it was
   not the Son that as man wrestled with Jacob, but the unbegotten God, or
   a part of him, let him be anathema. If any one shall understand the
   words, "The Lord rained from the Lord," [364] not in relation to the
   Father and the Son, but shall say that he rained from himself, let him
   be anathema: for the Lord the Son rained from the Lord the Father. If
   any one hearing "the Lord the Father, and the Lord the Son," shall term
   both the Father and the Son Lord, and saying "the Lord from the Lord"
   shall assert that there are two Gods, let him be anathema. For we do
   not co-ordinate the Son with the Father, but [conceive him to be]
   subordinate to the Father. For he neither came down to the body [365]
   without his Father's will; nor did he rain from himself, but from the
   Lord (i.e. the Father) who exercises supreme authority: nor does he sit
   at the Father's right hand of himself, but in obedience to the Father
   saying, "Sit thou at my right hand" [366] [let him be anathema]. If any
   one should say that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one person,
   let him be anathema. If any one, speaking of the Holy Spirit the
   Comforter, shall call him the unbegotten God, let him be anathema. If
   any one, as he hath taught us, shall not say that the Comforter is
   other than the Son, when he has himself said, "the Father, whom I will
   ask, shall send you another Comforter," [367] let him be anathema. If
   any one affirm that the Spirit is part of the Father and of the Son,
   let him be anathema. If any one say that the Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit are three Gods, let him be anathema. If any one say that the Son
   of God was made as one of the creatures by the will of God, let him be
   anathema. If any one shall say that the Son was begotten without the
   Father's will, let him be anathema: for the Father did not, as
   compelled by any natural necessity, beget the Son at a time when he was
   unwilling; but as soon as it pleased him, he has declared that of
   himself without time and without passion, he begot him. If any one
   should say that the Son is unbegotten, and without beginning,
   intimating that there are two without beginning, and unbegotten, so
   making two Gods, let him be anathema: for the Son is the head and
   beginning of all things; but "the head of Christ is God." [368] Thus do
   we devoutly trace up all things by the Son to one source of all things
   who is without beginning. Moreover, to give an accurate conception of
   Christian doctrine, we again say, that if any one shall not declare
   Christ Jesus to have been the Son of God before all ages, and to have
   ministered to the Father in the creation of all things; but shall
   affirm that from the time only when he was born of Mary, was he called
   the Son and Christ, and that he then received the commencement of his
   divinity, let him be anathema, as the Samosatan.' [369]

   Another Exposition of the Faith set forth at Sirmium in Latin,

   and afterwards translated into Greek. [370]

   Since it appeared good that some deliberation respecting the faith
   should be undertaken, all points have been carefully investigated and
   discussed at Sirmium, in presence of Valens, Ursacius, Germinius, and
   others.

   It is evident that there is one God, the Father Almighty, according as
   it is declared over the whole world; and his only-begotten Son Jesus
   Christ, our Lord, God, and Saviour, begotten of him before the ages.
   But we ought not to say that there are two Gods, since the Lord himself
   has said I go unto my Father and your Father, and unto my God and your
   God.' [371] Therefore he is God even of all, as the apostle also
   taught, Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles?
   Yea of the Gentiles also; seeing that it is one God who shall justify
   the circumcision by faith.' [372] And in all other matters there is
   agreement, nor is there any ambiguity. But since it troubles very many
   to understand about that which is termed substantia in Latin, and ousia
   in Greek; that is to say, in order to mark the sense more accurately,
   the word homoousion [373] or homoiousion, [374] it is altogether
   desirable that none of these terms should be mentioned: nor should they
   be preached on in the church, for this reason, that nothing is recorded
   concerning them in the holy Scriptures; and because these things are
   above the knowledge of mankind and human capacity, and that no one can
   explain the Son's generation, of which it is written, And who shall
   declare his generation?' [375] It is manifest that the Father only
   knows in what way he begat the Son; and again the Son, how he was
   begotten by the Father. But no one can doubt that the Father is greater
   in honor, dignity, and divinity, and in the very name of Father; the
   Son himself testifying My Father who hath sent me is greater than I.'
   [376] And no one is ignorant that this is also catholic doctrine, [377]
   that there are two persons of the Father and Son, and that the Father
   is the greater: but that the Son is subject, together with all things
   which the Father has subjected to him. That the Father had no
   beginning, and is invisible, immortal, and impassible: but that the Son
   was begotten of the Father, God of God, Light of Light; and that no one
   comprehends his generation, as was before said, but the Father alone.
   That the Son himself, our Lord and God, took flesh or a body, that is
   to say human nature, according as the angel brought glad tidings: and
   as the whole Scriptures teaches, and especially the apostle who was the
   great teacher of the Gentiles, Christ assumed the human nature through
   which he suffered, from the Virgin Mary. But the summary and
   confirmation of the entire faith is, that [the doctrine of] the Trinity
   should be always maintained, according as we have read in the gospel,
   Go ye and disciple all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.' [378] Thus the number
   of the Trinity is complete and perfect. Now the Comforter, the Holy
   Spirit, sent by the Son, came according to his promise, in order to
   sanctify and instruct the apostles and all believers.

   They endeavored to induce Photinus, even after his deposition, to
   assent to and subscribe these things, promising to restore him his
   bishopric, if by recantation he would anathematize the dogma he had
   invented, and adopt their opinion. But he did not accept their
   proposal, and on the other hand he challenged them to a disputation:
   [379] and a day being appointed by the emperor's arrangement, the
   bishops who were there present assembled, and not a few of the
   senators, whom the emperor had directed to attend to the discussion. In
   their presence, Basil, who at that time presided over the church at
   Ancyra, was appointed to oppose Photinus, and short-hand writers took
   down their respective speeches. The conflict of arguments on both sides
   was extremely severe; but Photinus having been worsted, was condemned,
   and spent the rest of his life in exile, during which time he composed
   treatises in both languages--for he was not unskilled in Latin--against
   all heresies, and in favor of his own views. Concerning Photinus let
   this suffice.

   Now the bishops who were convened at Sirmium, were afterwards
   dissatisfied with that form of the creed which had been promulgated by
   them in Latin; for after its publication, it appeared to them to
   contain many contradictions. They therefore endeavored to get it back
   again from the transcribers; but inasmuch as many secreted it, the
   emperor by his edicts commanded that the version should be sought for,
   threatening punishment to any one who should be detected concealing it.
   These menaces, however, were incapable of suppressing what had already
   fallen into the hands of many. Let this suffice in regard to these
   affairs.&gt;

   Chapter XXXI.--Of Hosius, Bishop of Cordova.

   Since we have observed that Hosius the Spaniard was present [at the
   council of Sirmium] against his will, it is necessary to give some
   brief account of him. A short time before he had been sent into exile
   by the intrigues of the Arians: but at the earnest solicitation of
   those convened at Sirmium, the emperor summoned him thither, wishing
   that by persuasion, or by compulsion he should give his sanction to
   their proceedings; for if this could be effected, they considered it
   would give great authority to their sentiments. On this ground,
   therefore, as I have said, he was most unwillingly obliged to be
   present: and when he refused to concur with them, stripes and tortures
   were inflicted on the old man. Wherefore he was constrained by force to
   acquiesce in and subscribe to their exposition of the faith. Such was
   the issue of affairs at that time transacted at Sirmium. But the
   emperor Constantius after these things still continued to reside at
   that place, awaiting there the result of the war against Magnentius.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXXII.--Overthrow of the Usurper Magnentius.

   Magnentius in the meanwhile having made himself master of the imperial
   city Rome, put to death many members of the senatorial council, as well
   as many of the populace. But as soon as the commanders under
   Constantius had collected an army of Romans, and commenced their march
   against him, he left Rome, and retired into the Gauls. There several
   battles were fought, sometimes to the advantage of one party, and
   sometimes to that of the other: but at last Magnentius having been
   defeated near Mursa--a fortress of Gaul--was there closely besieged. In
   this place the following remarkable incident is said to have occurred.
   Magnentius desiring to reassure the courage of his soldiers who were
   disheartened by their late overthrow, ascended a lofty tribunal for
   this purpose. They, wishing to give utterance to the usual acclamation
   with which they greet emperors, contrary to their intention
   simultaneously all shouted the name not of Magnentius, but of
   Constantius Augustus. Regarding this as an omen unfavorable to himself,
   Magnentius immediately withdrew from the fortress, and retreated to the
   remotest parts of Gaul. Thither the generals of Constantius hastened in
   pursuit. An engagement having again taken place near Mount Seleucus,
   [380] Magnentius was totally routed, and fled alone to Lyons, a city of
   Gaul, which is distant three days' journey from the fortress at Mursa.
   Magnentius, having reached this city, first slew his own mother; then
   having killed his brother also, whom he had created Cæsar, he at last
   committed suicide by falling on his own sword. This happened in the
   sixth consulate of Constantius, and the second of Constantius Gallus,
   on the fifteenth [381] day of August. Not long after, the other brother
   of Magnentius, named Decentius, put an end to his own life by hanging
   himself. Such was the end of the enterprises of Magnentius. The affairs
   of the empire were not altogether quieted; for soon after this another
   usurper arose whose name was Silvanus: but the generals of Constantius
   speedily put him also out of the way, whilst raising disturbances in
   Gaul.

   Chapter XXXIII.--Of the Jews inhabiting Dio-Cæsarea in Palestine.

   About the same time there arose another intestine commotion in the
   East: for the Jews who inhabited Dio-Cæsarea in Palestine took up arms
   against the Romans, and began to ravage the adjacent places. But Gallus
   who was also called Constantius, whom the emperor, after creating
   Cæsar, had sent into the East, despatched an army against them, and
   completely vanquished them: after which he ordered that their city
   Dio-Cæsarea should be razed to the foundations.

   Chapter XXXIV.--Of Gallus Cæsar.

   Gallus, having accomplished these things, was unable to bear his
   success with moderation; but forthwith attempted innovations against
   the authority of him who had constituted him Cæsar, himself aspiring to
   the sovereign power. His purpose was, however, soon detected by
   Constantius: for he had dared to put to death, on his own
   responsibility, Domitian, at that time Prætorian prefect of the East,
   and Magnus the quæstor, not having disclosed his designs to the
   emperor. Constantius, extremely incensed at this conduct, summoned
   Gallus to his presence, who being in great terror went very
   reluctantly; and when he arrived in the western parts, and had reached
   the island of Flanona, Constantius ordered him to be slain. But not
   long after he created Julian, the brother of Gallus, Cæsar, and sent
   him against the barbarians in Gaul. It was in the seventh consulate
   [382] of the emperor Constantius that Gallus, who was surnamed
   Constantius, was slain, when he himself was a third time consul: and
   Julian was created Cæsar on the 6th of November in the following year,
   when Arbetion [383] and Lollian were consuls; of him we shall make
   farther mention in the next book. [384] When Constantius was thus
   relieved from the disquietudes which had occupied him, his attention
   was again directed to ecclesiastical contentions. Going therefore from
   Sirmium to the imperial city Rome, he again appointed a synod of
   bishops, summoning some of the eastern prelates to hasten into Italy,
   [385] and arranging for those of the west to meet them there. While
   preparations were making in the east for this purpose, Julius bishop of
   Rome died, after having presided over the church in that place fifteen
   years, and was succeeded in the episcopal dignity by Liberius.

   Chapter XXXV.--Of Aëtius the Syrian, Teacher of Eunomius.

   At Antioch in Syria another heresiarch sprang up, Aëtius, surnamed
   Atheus. He agreed in doctrine with Arius, and maintained the same
   opinions: but separated himself from the Arian party because they had
   admitted Arius into communion. For Arius, as I have before related,
   [386] entertaining one opinion in his heart, professed another with his
   lips; having hypocritically assented to and subscribed the form of
   faith set forth at the council of Nicæa, in order to deceive the
   reigning emperor. On this account, therefore, Aëtius separated himself
   from the Arians. He had, however, previously been a heretic, and a
   zealous advocate of Arian views. After receiving some very scanty
   instruction at Alexandria, he departed thence, and arrived at Antioch
   in Syria, which was his native place, was ordained deacon by Leontius,
   who was then bishop of that city. Upon this he began to astonish those
   who conversed with him by the singularity of his discourses. And this
   he did in dependence on the precepts of Aristotle's Categories; there
   is a book of that name, the scope of which he neither himself
   perceived, nor had been enlightened on by intercourse with learned
   persons: so that he was little aware that he was framing fallacious
   arguments to perplex and deceive himself. For Aristotle had composed
   this work to exercise the ingenuity of his young disciples, and to
   confound by subtle arguments the sophists who affected to deride
   philosophy. Wherefore the Ephectic academicians, [387] who expound the
   writings of Plato and Plotinus, censure the vain subtlety which
   Aristotle has displayed in that book: but Aëtius, who never had the
   advantage of an academical preceptor, adhered to the sophisms of the
   Categories. For this reason he was unable to comprehend how there could
   be generation without a beginning, and how that which was begotten can
   be co-eternal with him who begat. In fact, Aëtius was a man of so
   superficial attainments, and so little acquainted with the sacred
   Scriptures, and so extremely fond of caviling, a thing which any clown
   might do, that he had never carefully studied those ancient writers who
   have interpreted the Christian oracles; wholly rejecting Clemens and
   Africanus and Origen, men eminent for their information in every
   department of literature and science. But he composed epistles both to
   the emperor Constantius, and to some other persons, wherein he
   interwove tedious disputes for the purpose of displaying his sophisms.
   He has therefore been surnamed Atheus. But although his doctrinal
   statements were similar to those of the Arians, yet from the abstruse
   nature of his syllogisms, which they were unable to comprehend, his
   associates in Arianism pronounced him a heretic. Being for that reason
   expelled from their church, he pretended to have separated himself from
   their communion. Even in the present day there are to be found some who
   from him were formerly named Aëtians, but now Eunomians. For some time
   later Eunomius, who had been his amanuensis, having been instructed by
   his master in this heretical mode of reasoning, afterwards became the
   head of that sect. But of Eunomius we shall speak more fully in the
   proper place. [388]

   anything, and disputed so as to make the understanding of them
   impossible.' The word ephectic' is derived from the verb epecho, to
   hold back,' and was used by the philosophers to whom it is applied as a
   title because they claimed to hold back their judgment, being unable to
   reach a conclusion. Cf. also the name skeptic,' from skeptomai . See

   Chapter XXXVI.--Of the Synod at Milan.

   Now at that time the bishops met in Italy, very few indeed from the
   East, most of them being hindered from coming either by the firmities
   of age or by the distance; but of the West there were more than three
   hundred. [389] It was a command of the emperor that they should be
   assembled at Milan. On meeting, the Eastern prelates opened the Synod
   by calling upon those convened to pass a unanimous sentence of
   condemnation against Athanasius; with this object in view, that he
   might thenceforward be utterly shut out from Alexandria. But Paulinus,
   bishop of Treves in Gaul, and Dionysius, of whom the former was bishop
   of Alba, [390] the metropolis of Italy, and Eusebius of Vercellæ, a
   city of Liguria in Italy, perceiving that the Eastern bishops, by
   demanding a ratification of the sentence against Athanasius, were
   intent on subverting the faith, arose and loudly exclaimed that this
   proposition indicated a covert plot against the principles of Christian
   truth. For they insisted that the charges against Athanasius were
   unfounded, and merely invented by his accusers as a means of corrupting
   the faith.' Having made this protest with much vehemence of manner, the
   congress of bishops was then dissolved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [389] So also Sozomen, IV. 9; but the number appears exorbitant.
   Valesius conjectures that the texts of Socrates and Sozomen are
   corrupted, and that we must read thirty instead of three hundred. The
   smaller number agrees exactly with the list given in the epistle of
   this council to Eusebius of Vercellæ; in this list thirty bishops are
   named as agreeing to the condemnation of Athanasius, Marcellus, and
   Photinus. Cf. Baronius, Annal. year 355.

   [390] Sozomen (IV. 9) agrees here also with Socrates; but Athanasius,
   in Epist. ad Solitar., and after him Baronius and Valesius, make Milan
   and not Alba, the metropolis of Italy, and Dionysius bishop of Milan,
   and not of Alba.

   Chapter XXXVII.--Of the Synod at Ariminum, and the Creed there
   published. [391]

   The emperor on being apprised of what had taken place, sent these three
   bishops into exile; and determined to convene an ecumenical council,
   that by drawing all the Eastern bishops into the West, he might if
   possible bring them all to agree. But when, on consideration, the
   length of the journey seemed to present serious obstacles, he directed
   that the Synod should consist of two divisions; permitting those
   present at Milan to meet at Ariminum in Italy: but the Eastern bishops
   he instructed by letters to assemble at Nicomedia in Bithynia. The
   emperor's object in these arrangements was to effect a general unity of
   opinion; but the issue was contrary to his expectation. For neither of
   the Synods was in harmony with itself, but each was divided into
   opposing factions: for those convened at Ariminum could not agree with
   one another; and the Eastern bishops assembled at Seleucia in Isauria
   made another schism. The details of what took place in both we will
   give in the course of our history, [392] but we shall first make a few
   observations on Eudoxius. About that time Leontius having died, who had
   ordained the heretic Aëtius [393] as deacon, Eudoxius bishop of
   Germanicia--this city is in Syria--who was then at Rome, thinking no
   time was to be lost, speciously represented to the emperor that the
   city over which he presided was in need of his counsel and care, and
   requested permission to return there immediately. This the emperor
   readily acceded to, having no suspicion of a clandestine purpose:
   Eudoxius having some of the principal officers of the emperor's
   bedchamber as coadjutors, deserted his own diocese, and fraudulently
   installed himself in the see of Antioch. His first desire was to
   restore Aëtius; accordingly he convened a council of bishops for the
   purpose of reinvesting Aëtius with the dignity of the diaconate. But
   this could in no way be brought about, for the odium with which Aëtius
   was regarded was more prevalent than the exertions of Eudoxius in his
   favor. When the bishops were assembled at Ariminum, those from the East
   declared that they were willing to pass in silence the case of
   Athanasius: a resolution that was zealously supported by Ursacius and
   Valens, who had formerly maintained the tenets of Arius; but, as I have
   already stated, had afterwards presented a recantation of their opinion
   to the bishop of Rome, and publicly avowed their assent to the doctrine
   of consubstantiality. For these men always inclined to side with the
   dominant party. Germinius, Auxentius, Demophilus and Gaius made the
   same declaration in reference to Athanasius. When therefore some
   endeavored to propose one thing in the convocation of bishops, and some
   another, Ursacius and Valens said that all former draughts of the creed
   ought to be considered as set aside, and the last alone, which had been
   prepared at their late convention at Sirmium, regarded as authorized.
   They then caused to be read a paper which they held in their hands,
   containing another form of the creed: this had indeed been drawn up at
   Sirmium, but had been kept concealed, as we have before observed, until
   their present publication of it at Ariminum. It has been translated
   from the Latin into Greek, and is as follows: [394]

   'The catholic faith was expounded at Sirmium in presence of our lord
   Constantius, [395] in the consulate [396] of the most illustrious
   Flavius Eusebius, and Hypatius, on the twenty-third of May.

   We believe in one only and true God, the Father Almighty, the Creator
   and Framer of all things: and in one only-begotten Son of God, before
   all ages, before all beginning, before all conceivable time, and before
   all comprehensible thought, begotten without passion: by whom the ages
   were framed, and all things made: who was begotten as the only-begotten
   of the Father, only of only, God of God, like to the Father who begat
   him, according to the Scriptures: whose generation no one knows, but
   the Father only who begat him. We know that this his only-begotten Son
   came down from the heavens by his Father's consent for the putting away
   of sin, was born of the Virgin Mary, conversed with his disciples, and
   fulfilled every dispensation according to the Father's will: was
   crucified and died, and descended into the lower parts of the earth,
   and disposed matters there; at the sight of whom the (door-keepers of
   Hades trembled [397] ): having arisen on the third day, he again
   conversed with his disciples, and after forty days were completed he
   ascended into the heavens, and is seated at the Father's right hand;
   and at the last day he will come in his Father's glory to render to
   every one according to his works. [We believe] also in the Holy Spirit,
   whom the only-begotten Son of God Jesus Christ himself promised to send
   to the human race as the Comforter, according to that which is written:
   [398] "I go away to my Father, and will ask him, and he will send you
   another Comforter, the Spirit of truth. He shall receive of mine, and
   shall teach you, and bring all things to your remembrance." As for the
   term "substance," which was used by our fathers for the sake of greater
   simplicity, but not being understood by the people has caused offense
   on account of the fact that the Scriptures do not contain it, it seemed
   desirable that it should be wholly abolished, and that in future no
   mention should be made of substance in reference to God, since the
   divine Scriptures have nowhere spoken concerning the substance of the
   Father and the Son. But we say that the Son is in all things like the
   Father, as the Holy Scriptures affirm and teach.'

   These statements having been read, those who were dissatisfied with
   them rose and said We came not hither because we were in want of a
   creed; for we preserve inviolate that which we received from the
   beginning; but we are here met to repress any innovation upon it which
   may have been made. If therefore what has been recited introduces no
   novelties, now openly anathematize the Arian heresy, in the same manner
   as the ancient canon of the church has rejected all heresies as
   blasphemous: for it is evident to the whole world that the impious
   dogma of Arius has excited the disturbances of the church, and the
   troubles which exist until now.' This proposition, which was not
   accepted by Ursacius, Valens, Germinius, Auxentius, Demophilus, and
   Gaïus, rent the church asunder completely: for these prelates adhered
   to what had then been recited in the Synod of Ariminum; while the
   others again confirmed the Nicene Creed. They also ridiculed the
   superscription of the creed that had been read; and especially
   Athanasius, in a letter which he sent to his friends, wherein he thus
   expresses himself: [399]

   What point of doctrine was wanting to the piety of the catholic church,
   that they should now make an investigation respecting the faith, and
   prefix moreover the consulate of the present times to their published
   exposition of it? For Ursacius, Valens, and Germinius have done what
   was neither done, nor even heard of, at any time before among
   Christians: having composed a creed such as they themselves are willing
   to believe, they prefaced it with the consulate, month, and day of the
   present time, in order to prove to all discerning persons that theirs
   is not the ancient faith, but such as was originated under the reign of
   the present emperor Constantius. [400] Moreover they have written all
   things with a view to their own heresy: and besides this, pretending to
   write respecting the Lord, they name another "Lord" as theirs, even
   Constantius, who has countenanced their impiety, so that those who deny
   the Son to be eternal, have styled him eternal emperor. Thus are they
   proved to be the enemies of Christ by their profanity. But perhaps the
   holy prophets' record of time afforded them a precedent for [noticing]
   the consulate! Now even if they should presume to make this pretext,
   they would most glaringly expose their own ignorance. The prophecies of
   these holy men do indeed mark the times. Isaiah and Hosea lived in the
   days of Uzziah, Joatham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah; [401] Jeremiah in the time
   of Josiah; [402] Ezekiel and Daniel in the reign of Cyrus and Darius;
   and others uttered their predictions in other times. Yet they did not
   then lay the foundations of religion. That was in existence before
   them, and always was, even before the creation of the world, God having
   prepared it for us in Christ. Nor did they designate the commencement
   of their own faith; for they were themselves men of faith previously:
   but they signified the times of the promises given through them. Now
   the promises primarily referred to our Saviour's advent; and all that
   was foretold respecting the course of future events in relation to
   Israel and the Gentiles was collateral and subordinate. Hence the
   periods mentioned indicated not the beginning of their faith, as I
   before observed, but the times in which these prophets lived and
   foretold such things. But these sages of our day, who neither compile
   histories, nor predict future events, after writing, "The Catholic
   Faith was published," immediately add the consulate, with the month and
   the day: and as the holy prophets wrote the date of their records and
   of their own ministration, so these men intimate the era of their own
   faith. And would that they had written concerning their own faith
   only--since they have now begun to believe--and had not undertaken to
   write respecting the Catholic faith. For they have not written, "Thus
   we believe"; but, "The Catholic Faith was published." The temerity of
   purpose herein manifested argues their ignorance; while the novelty of
   expression found in the document they have concocted shows it to be the
   same as the Arian heresy. By writing in this manner, they have declared
   when they themselves began to believe, and from what time they wish it
   to be understood their faith was first preached. And just as when the
   evangelist Luke says, [403] "A decree of enrolment was published," he
   speaks of an edict which was not in existence before, but came into
   operation at that time, and was published by him who had written it; so
   these men by writing "The faith has now been published," have declared
   that the tenets of their heresy are of modern invention, and did not
   exist previously. But since they apply the term "Catholic" to it, they
   seem to have unconsciously fallen into the extravagant assumption of
   the Cataphrygians, asserting even as they did, that "the Christian
   faith was first revealed to us, and commenced with us." And as those
   termed Maximilla and Montanus, so these style Constantius their Lord,
   instead of Christ. But if according to them the faith had its beginning
   from the present consulate, what will the fathers and the blessed
   martyrs do? Moreover what will they themselves do with those who were
   instructed in religious principles by them, and died before this
   consulate? By what means will they recall them to life, in order to
   obliterate from their minds what they seemed to have taught them, and
   to implant in its stead those new discoveries which they have
   published? So stupid are they as to be only capable of framing
   pretenses, and these such as are unbecoming and unreasonable, and carry
   with them their own refutation.'

   Athanasius wrote thus to his friends: and the interested who may read
   through his whole epistle will perceive how powerfully he treats the
   subject; but for brevity's sake we have here inserted a part of it
   only. The Synod deposed Valens, Ursacius, Auxentius, Germinius, Gaïus,
   and Demophilus for refusing to anathematize the Arian doctrine; who
   being very indignant at their deposition, hastened directly to the
   emperor, carrying with them the exposition of faith which had been read
   in the Synod. The council also acquainted the emperor with their
   determinations in a communication which translated from the Latin into
   Greek, was to the following effect: [404]

   Epistle of the Synod of Ariminum to the Emperor Constantius.

   We believe that it was by the appointment of God, as well as at the
   command of your piety, that the decrees formerly published have been
   executed. Accordingly we Western bishops came out of various districts
   to Ariminum, in order that the faith of the catholic church might be
   made manifest, and that those who held contrary views might be
   detected. For on a considerate review by us of all points, our decision
   has been to adhere to the ancient faith which the prophets, the
   gospels, and the apostles have revealed through our Lord Jesus Christ,
   the guardian of your empire, and the protector of your person, which
   faith also we have always maintained. We conceived that it would be
   unwarrantable and impious to mutilate any of those things which have
   been justly and rightly ratified, by those who sat in the Nicene
   council with Constantine of glorious memory, the father of your piety.
   Their doctrine and views have been infused into the minds and preached
   in the hearing of the people, and found to be powerfully opposed, even
   fatal, to the Arian heresy. And not only this heresy, but also all
   others have been put down by it. Should therefore anything be added to
   or taken away from what was at that time established, it would prove
   perilous; for if either of these things should happen, the enemy will
   have boldness to do as they please. [405]

   Wherefore Ursacius and Valens being heretofore suspected of
   entertaining Arian sentiments, were suspended from communion: but in
   order to be restored to it they made an apology, and claimed that they
   had repented of their shortcoming, as their written recantation
   attests: they therefore obtained pardon and complete absolution.

   The time when these things occurred was when the council was in session
   at Milan, when the presbyters of the church of Rome were also present.

   At [406] the same time, having known that Constantine, who even after
   his death is worthy of honorable mention, exposed the faith with due
   precision, but being born of men was baptized and departed to the peace
   due to him as his reward, we have deemed it improper to innovate after
   him disregarding so many holy confessors and martyrs, who also were
   authors of this confession, and persevered in their faith in the
   ancient system of the catholic church. Their faith God has perpetuated
   down to the years of your own reign through our Lord Jesus Christ,
   through whose grace it also became possible for you to so strengthen
   your dominion as to rule over one portion of the world.

   Yet have these infatuated and wretched persons, endued with an unhappy
   disposition, again had the temerity to declare themselves the
   propagators of false doctrine, and even endeavor to subvert the
   constitution of the Church. For when the letters of your piety had
   ordered us to assemble for the examination of the faith, they laid bare
   their intention, stripped of its deceitful garb. For they attempted
   with certain craft and confusion to propose innovations, having in this
   as allies Germinius, Auxentius, [407] and Gaius, who continually cause
   strife and dissension, and their single teaching has surpassed the
   whole body of blasphemies. But when they perceived that we had not the
   same disposition or mind as they in regard to their false views they
   changed their minds during our council and said another expression of
   belief should be put forth. And short indeed was the time which
   convinced them of the falsity of their views.

   In order, therefore, that the affairs of the Church may not be
   continually brought into the same condition, and in order that trouble
   and tumult may not continually arise and confuse all things, it
   appeared safe to preserve the previously determined views firm and
   unalterable, and to separate from our communion the persons above
   named; for which reason we have despatched to your clemency delegates
   who will communicate the opinion of the council to you. And to our
   delegates we have given this commission above all, that they should
   accredit the truth taking their motive from the ancient and right
   decisions. They will inform your holiness that peace will not be
   established as Ursacius and Valens say when some point of the right be
   overturned. For how can those be at peace who destroy peace? Rather
   will strife and tumult be occasioned by these things in the church of
   Rome also, as in the other cities. Wherefore, now, we beseech your
   clemency that you should look upon our delegation with a calm eye and
   listen to it with favor, and not allow that anything should be changed,
   thus bringing insult to the deceased, but permit us to continue in
   those things which have been defined and legislated by our ancestors;
   who, we should say, acted with shrewdness and wisdom and with the Holy
   Spirit. For the innovations they introduce at present fill the
   believing with distrust and the unbelieving with cruelty. [408] We
   further implore you to instruct that the bishops who dwell in foreign
   parts, whom both the infirmity of age and the ills of poverty harass
   should be assisted to return easily and speedily to their own homes, so
   that the churches may not remain bereft of their bishops. Still further
   we beg of you this also, that nothing be stricken off, nor anything be
   added, to the articles [of faith] remaining over from the times of your
   pious father even until now; but that these may continue inviolate.
   Permit us not to toil and suffer longer, nor to be separated from our
   dioceses, but that together with our own peoples we may in peace have
   time to offer prayers and thanksgiving, supplicating for your safety
   and continuance in the dominion, which may the divinity grant unto you
   perpetually. Our delegates bear the signatures and greetings of the
   bishops. These [delegates] will from the Divine Scriptures themselves
   instruct your piety.

   The Synod then thus wrote and sent their communications to the emperor
   by the bishops [selected for that purpose]. But the partisans of
   Ursacius and Valens having arrived before them, did their utmost to
   calumniate the council, exhibiting the exposition of the faith which
   they had brought with them. The emperor, prejudiced beforehand towards
   Arianism, became extremely exasperated against the Synod, but conferred
   great honor on Valens and Ursacius and their friends. Those deputed by
   the council were consequently detained a considerable time, without
   being able to obtain an answer: at length, however, the emperor replied
   through those who had come to him, in the manner following:

   Constantius Victor and Triumphator Augustus to all the bishops convened
   at Ariminum.

   That our especial care is ever exercised respecting the divine and
   venerated law even your sanctity is not ignorant. Nevertheless we have
   hitherto been unable to give an audience to the twenty bishops sent as
   deputation from you, for an expedition against the barbarians has
   become necessary. And since, as you will admit, matters relative to the
   divine law ought to be entered on with a mind free from all anxiety; I
   have therefore ordered these bishops to await our return to Adrianople;
   that when all public business shall have been duly attended to, we may
   be able then to hear and consider what they shall propose. In the
   meanwhile let it not seem troublesome to your gravity to wait for their
   return; since when they shall convey to you our resolution, you will be
   prepared to carry into effect such measures as may be most advantageous
   to the welfare of the catholic church.'

   The bishops on receipt of this letter wrote thus in reply: [409]

   We have received your clemency's letter, sovereign lord, most beloved
   of God, in which you inform us that the exigencies of state affairs
   have hitherto prevented your admitting our delegates to your presence:
   and you bid us await their return, until your piety shall have learnt
   from them what has been determined on by us in conformity with the
   tradition of our ancestors. But we again protest by this letter that we
   can by no means depart from our primary resolution; and this also we
   have commissioned our deputies to state. We beseech you therefore, both
   with serene countenance to order this present epistle of our modesty to
   be read; and also to listen favorably to the representations with which
   our delegates have been charged. Your mildness doubtless perceives, as
   well as we, to how great an extent grief and sadness prevail, because
   of so many churches being bereft of their bishops in these most blessed
   times of yours. Again therefore we entreat your clemency, sovereign
   lord most dear to God, to command us to return to our churches, if it
   please your piety, before the rigor of winter; in order that we may be
   enabled, in conjunction with the people, to offer up our accustomed
   prayers to Almighty God, and to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, his
   only-begotten Son, for the prosperity of your reign, as we have always
   done, and even now do in our prayers.'

   The bishops having waited together some time after this letter had been
   despatched, inasmuch as the emperor deigned no reply, they departed to
   their respective cities. Now the emperor had long before intended to
   disseminate Arian doctrine throughout the churches; and was anxious to
   give it the pre-eminence; hence he pretended that their departure was
   an act of contumely, declaring that they had treated him with contempt
   by dissolving the council in opposition to his wishes. He therefore
   gave the partisans of Ursacius unbounded license to act as they pleased
   in regard to the churches: and directed that the revised form of creed
   which had been read at Ariminum should be sent to the churches
   throughout Italy; ordering that whoever would not subscribe it should
   be ejected from their sees, and that others should be substituted in
   their place. [410] And first Liberius, bishop of Rome, having refused
   his assent to that creed, was sent into exile; the adherents of
   Ursacius appointing Felix to succeed him, who had been a deacon in that
   church, but on embracing the Arian heresy was elevated to the
   episcopate. Some however assert that he was not favorable to that
   opinion, but was constrained by force to receive the ordination of
   bishop. After this all parts of the West were filled with agitation and
   tumult, some being ejected and banished, and others established in
   their stead. These things were effected by violence, on the authority
   of the imperial edicts, which were also sent into the eastern parts.
   Not long after indeed Liberius was recalled, and reinstated in his see;
   for the people of Rome having raised a sedition, and expelled Felix
   from their church, the emperor even though against his wish consented.
   The partisans of Ursacius, quitting Italy, passed through the eastern
   parts; and arriving at Nice, a city of Thrace, they dwelt there a short
   time and held another Synod, and after translating the form of faith
   which was read at Ariminum into Greek, they confirmed and published it
   afresh in the form quoted above, giving it the name of the general
   council, in this way attempting to deceive the more simple by the
   similarity of names, and to impose upon them as the creed promulgated
   at Nicæa in Bithynia, that which they had prepared at Nice in Thrace.
   [411] But this artifice was of little advantage to them; for it was
   soon detected, they became the object of derision. Enough now has been
   said of the transactions which took place in the West: we must now
   proceed to the narrative of what was done in the East at the same time.

   Chapter XXXVIII.--Cruelty of Macedonius, and Tumults raised by him.

   The bishops of the Arian party began to assume greater assurance from
   the imperial edicts. In what manner they undertook to convene a Synod,
   we will explain somewhat later. Let us now briefly mention a few of
   their previous acts. Acacius and Patrophilus having ejected Maximus,
   bishop of Jerusalem, installed Cyril in his see. Macedonius subverted
   the order of things in the cities and provinces adjacent to
   Constantinople, promoting to ecclesiastical honors his assistants in
   his intrigues against the churches. [412] He ordained Eleusius bishop
   of Cyzicus, and Marathonius, bishop of Nicomedia: the latter had before
   been a deacon under Macedonius himself, and proved very active in
   founding monasteries both of men and women. But we must now mention in
   what way Macedonius desolated the churches in the cities and provinces
   around Constantinople. This man, as I have already said, [413] having
   seized the bishopric, inflicted innumerable calamities on such as were
   unwilling to adopt his views. His persecutions were not confined to
   those who were recognized as members of the catholic church, but
   extended to the Novatians also, inasmuch as he knew that they
   maintained the doctrine of the homoousion; they therefore with the
   others underwent the most intolerable sufferings, but their bishop,
   Angelius by name, effected his escape by flight. Many persons eminent
   for their piety were seized and tortured, because they refused to
   communicate with him: and after the torture, they forcibly constrained
   the men to be partakers of the holy mysteries, their mouths being
   forced open with a piece of wood, and then the consecrated elements
   thrust into them. Those who were so treated regarded this as a
   punishment far more grievous than all others. Moreover they laid hold
   of women and children, and compelled them to be initiated [by baptism];
   and if any one resisted or otherwise spoke against it, stripes
   immediately followed, and after the stripes, bonds and imprisonment,
   and other violent measures. I shall here relate an instance or two
   whereby the reader may form some idea of the extent of the harshness
   and cruelty exercised by Macedonius and those who were then in power.
   They first pressed in a box, and then sawed off, the breasts of such
   women as were unwilling to communicate with them. The same parts of the
   persons. of other women they burnt partly with iron, and partly with
   eggs intensely heated in the fire. This mode of torture which was
   unknown even among the heathen, was invented by those who professed to
   be Christians. These facts were related to me by the aged Auxanon, the
   presbyter in the Novatian church of whom I spoke in the first book.
   [414] He said also that he had himself endured not a few severities
   from the Arians, prior to his reaching the dignity of presbyter; having
   been thrown into prison and beaten with many stripes, together with
   Alexander the Paphlagonian, his companion in the monastic life. He
   added that he had himself been able to sustain these tortures, but that
   Alexander died in prison from the effects of their infliction. He is
   now buried on the right of those sailing into the bay of Constantinople
   which is called Ceras, close by the rivers, where there is a church of
   the Novatians named after Alexander. Moreover the Arians, at the
   instigation of Macedonius, demolished with many other churches in
   various cities, that of the Novatians at Constantinople near Pelargus.
   Why I particularly mention this church, will be seen from the
   extraordinary circumstances connected with it, as testified by the same
   aged Auxanon. The emperor's edict and the violence of Macedonius had
   doomed to destruction the churches of those who maintained the doctrine
   of consubstantiality; the decree and violence reached this church, and
   those also who were charged with the execution of the mandate were at
   hand to carry it into effect. I cannot but admire the zeal displayed by
   the Novatians on this occasion, as well as the sympathy they
   experienced from those whom the Arians at that time ejected, but who
   are now in peaceful possession of their churches. For when the
   emissaries of their enemies were urgent to accomplish its destruction,
   an immense multitude of Novatians, aided by numbers of others who held
   similar sentiments, having assembled around this devoted church, pulled
   it down, and conveyed the materials of it to another place: this place
   stands opposite the city, and is called Sycæ, and forms the thirteenth
   ward of the town of Constantinople. This removal was effected in a very
   short time, from the extraordinary ardor of the numerous persons
   engaged in it: one carried tiles, another stones, a third timber; some
   loading themselves with one thing, and some with another. Even women
   and children assisted in the work, regarding it as the realization of
   their best wishes, and esteeming it the greatest honor to be accounted
   the faithful guardians of things consecrated to God. In this way at
   that time was the church of the Novatians transported to Sycæ. Long
   afterwards when Constantius was dead, the emperor Julian ordered its
   former site to be restored, and permitted them to rebuild it there. The
   people therefore, as before, having carried back the materials, reared
   the church in its former position; and from this circumstance, and its
   great improvement in structure and ornament, they not inappropriately
   called it Anastasia. The church as we before said was restored
   afterwards in the reign of Julian. But at that time both the Catholics
   and the Novatians were alike subjected to persecution: for the former
   abominated offering their devotions in those churches in which the
   Arians assembled, but frequented the other three [415] --for this is
   the number of the churches which the Novatians have in the city--and
   engaged in divine service with them. Indeed they would have been wholly
   united, had not the Novatians refused from regard to their ancient
   precepts. In other respects however, they mutually maintained such a
   degree of cordiality and affection, as to be ready to lay down their
   lives for one another: both parties were therefore persecuted
   indiscriminately, not only at Constantinople, but also in other
   provinces and cities. At Cyzicus, Eleusius, the bishop of that place,
   perpetrated the same kind of enormities against the Christians there,
   as Macedonius had done elsewhere, harassing and putting them to flight
   in all directions and [among other things] he completely demolished the
   church of the Novatians at Cyzicus. But Macedonius consummated his
   wickedness in the following manner. Hearing that there was a great
   number of the Novatian sect in the province of Paphlagonia, and
   especially at Mantinium, and perceiving that such a numerous body could
   not be driven from their homes by ecclesiastics alone, he caused, by
   the emperor's permission, four companies of soldiers to be sent into
   Paphlagonia, that through dread of the military they might receive the
   Arian opinion. But those who inhabited Mantinium, animated to
   desperation by zeal for their religion, armed themselves with long
   reap-hooks, hatchets, and whatever weapon came to hand, and went forth
   to meet the troops; on which a conflict ensuing, many indeed of the
   Paphlagonians were slain, but nearly all the soldiers were destroyed. I
   learnt these things from a Paphlagonian peasant who said that he was
   present at the engagement; and many others of that province corroborate
   this account. Such were the exploits of Macedonius on behalf of
   Christianity, consisting of murders, battles, incarcerations, and civil
   wars: proceedings which rendered him odious not only to the objects of
   his persecution, but even to his own party. He became obnoxious also to
   the emperor on these accounts, and particularly so from the
   circumstance I am about to relate. The church where the coffin lay that
   contained the relics of the emperor Constantine threatened to fall. On
   this account those that entered, as well as those who were accustomed
   to remain there for devotional purposes, were in much fear. Macedonius,
   therefore, wished to remove the emperor's remains, lest the coffin
   should be injured by the ruins. The populace getting intelligence of
   this, endeavored to prevent it, insisting that the emperor's bones
   should not be disturbed, as such a disinterment would be equivalent, to
   their being dug up': many however affirmed that its removal could not
   possibly injure the dead body, and thus two parties were formed on this
   question; such as held the doctrine of consubstantiality joining with
   those who opposed it on the ground of its impiety. Macedonius, in total
   disregard of these prejudices, caused the emperor's remains to be
   transported to the church where those of the martyr Acacius lay.
   Whereupon a vast multitude rushed toward that edifice in two hostile
   divisions, which attacked one another with great fury, and great loss
   of life was occasioned, so that the churchyard was covered with gore,
   and the well also which was in it overflowed with blood, which ran into
   the adjacent portico, and thence even into the very street. When the
   emperor was informed of this unfortunate occurrence, he was highly
   incensed against Macedonius, both on account of the slaughter which he
   had occasioned, and because he had dared to move his father's body
   without consulting him. Having therefore left the Cæsar Julian to take
   care of the western parts, he himself set out for the east. How
   Macedonius was a short time afterwards deposed, and thus suffered a
   most inadequate punishment for his infamous crimes, I shall hereafter
   relate. [416]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [412] From this place it plainly appears, as Valesius remarks, that the
   authority of the see of Constantinople was acknowledged, even before
   the council of Constantinople, throughout the region of the Hellespont
   and Bithynia, which conclusion is also confirmed by the acts of
   Eudoxius, bishop of Constantinople, who made Eunomius bishop of
   Cyzicus. Two causes co-operated to secure this authority, viz. (1) the
   official establishment of the city as the capital of the empire by
   Constantine, and (2) the transference to it of Eusebius of Nicomedia, a
   most vigorous and aggressive bishop, who missed no opportunity for
   enlarging and consolidating the power of his see.

   [413] See above, ch. 16.

   [414] I. 13.

   [415] According to Valesius it appears incredible that the Catholics
   should have done what Socrates says they did. For there is nothing more
   contrary to ecclesiastical discipline than to communicate with heretics
   either in the sacraments or in prayer.' Hence Socrates was probably
   imposed upon by the aged Auxano, who fixed upon all the Catholics what
   was perhaps done by some few Christians who were less cautious.' But
   Socrates' own attitude towards the Novatians (cf. Introd. p. x.) shows
   that the difference between them and the Catholics (hoi tes ekklesias)
   was not universally regarded as an absolute schism forbidding
   communication even during such times of trial as these described here,
   which might certainly have drawn together parties already as near to
   one another as the Novatians and Catholics.

   Chapter XXXIX.--Of the Synod at Seleucia, in Isauria.

   But I must now give an account of the other Synod, which the emperor's
   edict had convoked in the east, as a rival to that of Ariminum. It was
   at first determined that the bishops should assemble at Nicomedia in
   Bithynia; but a great earthquake having nearly destroyed that city,
   prevented their being convened there. This happened in the consulate
   [417] of Tatian and Cerealis, on the 28th day of August. [418] They
   were therefore planning to transfer the council to the neighboring city
   of Nicæa: but this plan was again altered, as it seemed more convenient
   to meet at Tarsus in Cilicia. Being dissatisfied with this arrangement
   also, they at last assembled themselves at Seleucia, surnamed Aspera,
   [419] a city of Isauria. This took place in the same year [in which the
   council of Ariminum was held], under the consulate of Eusebius and
   Hypatius, [420] the number of those convened being about 160. There was
   present on this occasion Leonas, an officer of distinction attached to
   the imperial household, before whom the emperor's edict had enjoined
   that the discussion respecting the faith should be entered into.
   Lauricius also, the commander-in-chief of the troops in Isauria, was
   ordered to be there, to serve the bishops in such things as they might
   require. In the presence of these personages therefore, the bishops
   were there convened on the 27th of the month of September, and
   immediately began a discussion on the basis of the public records,
   shorthand writers being present to write down what each might say.
   Those who desire to learn the particulars of the several speeches, will
   find copious details of them in the collection of Sabinus; but we shall
   only notice the more important heads. On the first day of their being
   convened, Leonas ordered each one to propose what he thought fit: but
   those present said that no question ought to be agitated in the absence
   of those prelates who had not yet arrived; for Macedonius, bishop of
   Constantinople, Basil of Ancyra, and some others who were apprehensive
   of an impeachment for their misconduct, had not made their appearance.
   Macedonius pleaded indisposition, and failed to attend; Patrophilus
   said he had some trouble with his eyes, and that on this account it was
   needful for him to remain in the suburbs of Seleucia; and the rest
   offered various pretexts to account for their absence. When, however,
   Leonas declared that the subjects which they had met to consider must
   be entered on, notwithstanding the absence of these persons, the
   bishops replied that they could not proceed to the discussion of any
   question, until the life and conduct of the parties accused had been
   investigated: for Cyril of Jerusalem, Eustathius of Sebastia in
   Armenia, and some others, had been charged with misconduct on various
   grounds long before. A sharp contest arose in consequence of this
   demur; some affirming that cognizance ought first to be taken of all
   such accusations, and others denying that anything whatever should have
   precedence of matters of faith. The emperor's orders contributed not a
   little to augment this dispute, inasmuch as letters of his were
   produced urging now this and now that as necessary to be considered
   first. The dispute having arisen on this subject, a schism was thus
   made, and the Seleucian council was divided into two factions, one of
   which was headed by Acacius of Cæsarea in Palestine, George of
   Alexandria, Uranius of Tyre, and Eudoxius of Antioch, who were
   supported by only about thirty-two other bishops. Of the opposite
   party, which was by far the more numerous, the principal were George of
   Laodicea in Syria, Sophronius of Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, and
   Eleusius of Cyzicus. It being determined by the majority to examine
   doctrinal matters first, the party of Acacius openly opposed the Nicene
   Creed, and wished to introduce another instead of it. The other
   faction, [421] which was considerably more numerous, concurred in all
   the decisions of the council of Nicæa, but criticised its adoption of
   the term homoousion. Accordingly they debated on this point, much being
   said on each side, until late in the evening, when Silvanus, who
   presided over the church at Tarsus, insisted with much vehemence of
   manner, that there was no need of a new exposition of the faith; but
   that it was their duty rather to confirm that which was published at
   Antioch, [422] at the consecration of the church in that place.' On
   this declaration, Acacius and his partisans privately withdrew from the
   council; while the others, producing the creed composed at Antioch,
   read it, and then separated for that day. Assembling in the church of
   Seleucia on the day following, after having closed the doors, they
   again read the same creed, and ratified it by their signatures. At this
   time the readers and deacons present signed on behalf of certain absent
   bishops, who had intimated their acquiescence in its form.

   Chapter XL.--Acacius, Bishop of Cæsarea, dictates a new Form of Creed
   in the Synod at Seleucia.

   Acacius and his adherents criticised what was done: because, that is to
   say, they closed the church doors and thus affixed their signatures;
   declaring that all such secret transactions were justly to be
   suspected, and had no validity whatever.' These objections he made
   because he was anxious to bring forward another exposition of the faith
   drawn up by himself, which he had already submitted to the governors
   Leonas and Lauricius, and was now intent on getting it alone confirmed
   and established, instead of that which had been subscribed. The second
   day was thus occupied with nothing else but exertions on his part to
   effect this object. On the third day Leonas endeavored to produce an
   amicable meeting of both parties; Macedonius of Constantinople, and
   also Basil of Ancyra, having arrived during its course. But when the
   Acacians found that both the parties had come to the same position,
   they refused to meet; saying that not only those who had before been
   deposed, but also such as were at present under any accusation, ought
   to be excluded from the assembly.' And as after much cavilling on both
   sides, this opinion prevailed; those who lay under any charge went out
   of the council, and the party of Acacius entered in their places.
   Leonas then said that a document had been put into his hand by Acacius,
   to which he desired to call their attention: but he did not state that
   it was the drought of a creed, which in some particulars covertly, and
   in others unequivocally contradicted the former. When those present
   became silent, thinking that the document contained something else
   besides an exposition of a creed, the following creed composed by
   Acacius, together with its preamble, was read.

   'We having yesterday assembled by the emperor's command at Seleucia, a
   city of Isauria, on the 27th day of September, exerted ourselves to the
   utmost, with all moderation, to preserve the peace of the church, and
   to determine doctrinal questions on prophetic and evangelical
   authority, so as to sanction nothing in the ecclesiastic confession of
   faith at variance with the sacred Scriptures, as our Emperor
   Constantius most beloved of God has ordered. But inasmuch as certain
   individuals in the Synod have acted injuriously toward several of us,
   preventing some from expressing their sentiments, and excluding others
   from the council against their wills; and at the same time have
   introduced such as have been deposed, and persons who were ordained
   contrary to the ecclesiastical canon, so that the Synod has presented a
   scene of tumult and disorder, of which the most illustrious Leonas, the
   Comes, and the most eminent Lauricius, governor of the province, have
   been eye-witnesses, we are therefore under the necessity of making this
   declaration. That we do not repudiate the faith which was ratified at
   the consecration of the church at Antioch; [423] for we give it our
   decided preference, because it received the concurrence of our fathers
   who were assembled there to consider some controverted points. Since,
   however, the terms homoousion and homoiousion have in time past
   troubled the minds of many, and still continue to disquiet them; and
   moreover that a new term has recently been coined by some who assert
   the anomoion of the Son to the Father: we reject the first two, as
   expressions which are not found in the Scriptures; but we utterly
   anathematize the last, and regard such as countenance its use, as
   alienated from the church. We distinctly acknowledge the homoion of the
   Son to the Father, in accordance with what the apostle has declared
   concerning him, [424] "Who is the image of the invisible God."

   We confess then, and believe in one God the Father Almighty, the Maker
   of heaven and earth, and of things visible and invisible. We believe
   also in his Son our Lord Jesus Christ, who was begotten of him without
   passion before all ages, God the Word, the only-begotten of God, the
   Light, the Life, the Truth, the Wisdom: through whom all things were
   made which are in the heavens and upon the earth, whether visible or
   invisible. We believe that he took flesh of the holy Virgin Mary, at
   the end of the ages, in order to abolish sin; that he was made man,
   suffered for our sin, and rose again, and was taken up into the
   heavens, to sit at the right hand of the Father, whence he will come
   again in glory to judge the living and the dead. We believe also in the
   Holy Spirit, whom our Lord and Saviour has denominated the Comforter,
   and whom he sent to his disciples after his departure, according to his
   promise: by whom also he sanctifies all believers in the church, who
   are baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Ghost. Those who preach anything contrary to this creed, we regard as
   aliens from the catholic church.'

   This was the declaration of faith proposed by Acacius, and subscribed
   by himself and as many as adhered to his opinion, the number of whom we
   have already given. When this had been read, Sophronius bishop of
   Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, thus expressed himself: If to express a
   separate opinion day after day, be received as the exposition of the
   faith, we shall never arrive at any accurate understanding of the
   truth.' These were the words of Sophronius. And I firmly believe, that
   if the predecessors of these prelates, as well as their successors, had
   entertained similar sentiments in reference to the Nicene creed, all
   polemical debates would have been avoided; nor would the churches have
   been agitated by such violent and irrational disturbances. However let
   those judge who are capable of understanding how these things are. At
   that time after many remarks on all sides had been made both in
   reference to this doctrinal statement, and in relation to the parties
   accused, the assembly was dissolved. On the fourth day they all again
   met in the same place, and resumed their proceedings in the same
   contentious spirit as before. On this occasion Acacius expressed
   himself in these words: Since the Nicene creed has been altered not
   once only, but frequently, there is no hindrance to our publishing
   another at this time.' To which Eleusius bishop of Cyzicus, replied:
   The Synod is at present convened not to learn what it had no previous
   knowledge of, nor to receive a creed which it had not assented to
   before, but to confirm the faith of the fathers, from which it should
   never recede, either in life or death.' Thus Eleusius opposing Acacius
   spoke meaning by the faith of the fathers,' that creed which had been
   promulgated at Antioch. But surely he too might have been fairly
   answered in this way: How is it O Eleusius, that you call those
   convened at Antioch "the fathers," seeing that you do not recognize
   those who were their fathers? The framers of the Nicene creed, by whom
   the homoousian faith was acknowledged, have a far higher claim to the
   title of "the fathers"; both as having the priority in point of time,
   and also because those assembled at Antioch were by them invested with
   the sacerdotal office. Now if those at Antioch have disowned their own
   fathers, those who follow them are unconsciously following parricides.
   Besides how can they have received a legitimate ordination from those
   whose faith they pronounce unsound and impious? If those, however, who
   constituted the Nicene Synod had not the Holy Spirit which is imparted
   by the imposition of hands, [425] those at Antioch have not duly
   received the priesthood: for how could they have received it from those
   who had not the power of conferring it?' Such considerations as these
   might have been submitted to Eleusius in reply to his objections. But
   they then proceeded to another question, connected with the assertion
   made by Acacius in his exposition of the faith, that the Son was like
   the Father'; enquiring of one another in what this resemblance
   consisted. The Acacian party affirmed that the Son was like the Father
   as it respected his will only, and not his substance' or essence'; but
   the rest maintained that the likeness extended to both essence and
   will. In altercations on this point, the whole day was consumed; and
   Acacius, being confuted by his own published works, in which he had
   asserted that the Son is in all things like the Father,' his opponents
   asked him how do you now deny the likeness of the Son to the Father as
   to his "essence"?' Acacius in reply said, that no author, ancient or
   modern, was ever condemned out of his own writings.' As they kept on
   their discussion on this matter to a most tedious extent, with much
   acrimonious feeling and subtlety of argument, but without any approach
   to unity of judgment, Leonas arose and dissolved the council: and this
   was the conclusion of the Synod at Seleucia. For on the following day
   [Leonas] being urged to do so would not again meet with them. I have
   been deputed by the emperor,' said he, to attend a council where
   unanimity was expected to prevail: but since you can by no means come
   to a mutual understanding, I can no longer be present: go therefore to
   the church, if you please, and indulge in vain babbling there.' The
   Acacian faction conceiving this decision to be advantageous to
   themselves, also refused to meet with the others. The adverse party
   left alone met in the church and requested the attendance of those who
   followed Acacius, that cognizance might be taken of the case of Cyril,
   bishop of Jerusalem: for that prelate had been accused long before, on
   what grounds however I am unable to state. He had even been deposed,
   because owing to fear, he had not made his appearance during two whole
   years, after having been repeatedly summoned in order that the charges
   against him might be investigated. Nevertheless, when he was deposed,
   he sent a written notification to those who had condemned him, that he
   should appeal to a higher jurisdiction: and to this appeal the emperor
   Constantius gave his sanction. Cyril was thus the first and indeed only
   clergyman who ventured to break through ecclesiastical usage, by
   becoming an appellant, in the way commonly done in the secular courts
   of judicature: [426] and he was now present at Seleucia, ready to be
   put upon his trial; on this account the other bishops invited the
   Acacian party to take their places in the assembly, that in a general
   council a definite judgment might be pronounced on the case of those
   who were arraigned: for they cited others also charged with various
   misdemeanors to appear before them at the same time, who to protect
   themselves had sought refuge among the partisans of Acacius. When
   therefore that faction persisted in their refusal to meet, after being
   repeatedly summoned, the bishops deposed Acacius himself, together with
   George of Alexandria, Uranius of Tyre, Theodulus of Chæretapi in
   Phrygia, Theodosius of Philadelphia in Lydia, Evagrius of the island of
   Mytilene, Leontius of Tripolis in Lydia, and Eudoxius who had formerly
   been bishop of Germanica, but had afterwards insinuated himself into
   the bishopric of Antioch in Syria. They also deposed Patrophilus for
   contumacy, in not having presented himself to answer a charge preferred
   against him by a presbyter named Dorotheus. These they deposed: they
   also excommunicated Asterius, Eusebius, Abgarus, Basilicus, Phoebus,
   Fidelis, Eutychius, Magnus, and Eustathius; determining that they
   should not be restored to communion, until they made such a defense as
   would clear them from the imputations under which they lay. This being
   done, they addressed explanatory letters to each of the churches whose
   bishops had been deposed. Anianus was then constituted bishop of
   Antioch instead of Eudoxius: but the Acacians having soon after
   apprehended him, he was delivered into the hands of Leonas and
   Lauricius, by whom he was sent into exile. The bishops who had ordained
   him being incensed on this account, lodged protests against the Acacian
   party with Leonas and Lauricius, in which they openly charged them with
   having violated the decisions of the Synod. Finding that no redress
   could be obtained by this means, they went to Constantinople to lay the
   whole matter before the emperor.

   Chapter XLI.--On the Emperor's Return from the West, the Acacians
   assemble at Constantinople, and confirm the Creed of Ariminum, after
   making Some Additions to it.

   And now the emperor returned from the West and appointed a prefect over
   Constantinople, Honoratus by name, having abolished the office of
   proconsul. [427] But the Acacians being beforehand with the bishops,
   calumniated them to the emperor, persuading him not to admit the creed
   which they had proposed. This so annoyed the emperor that he resolved
   to disperse them; he therefore published an edict, commanding that such
   of them as were subject to fill certain public offices should be no
   longer exempted from the performance of the duties attached to them.
   For several of them were liable to be called on to occupy various
   official departments, [428] connected both with the city magistracy,
   and in subordination to the presidents and governors of provinces.
   [429] While these were thus harassed the partisans of Acacius remained
   for a considerable time at Constantinople and held another Synod.
   Sending for the bishops at Bithynia, about fifty assembled on this
   occasion, among whom was Maris, bishop of Chalcedon: these confirmed
   the creed read at Ariminum to which the names of the consuls had been
   prefixed. [430] It would have been unnecessary to repeat it here, had
   there not been some additions made to it; but since that was done, it
   may be desirable to transcribe it in its new form. [431]

   We believe in one God the Father Almighty, of whom are all things. And
   in the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of God before all ages, and
   before every beginning; through whom all things visible and invisible
   were made: who is the only-begotten born of the Father, the only of the
   only, God of God, like to the Father who begat him, according to the
   Scriptures, and whose generation no one knows but the Father only that
   begat him. We know that this only-begotten Son of God, as sent of the
   Father, came down from the heavens, as it is written, for the
   destruction of sin and death: and that he was born of the Holy Spirit,
   and of the Virgin Mary according to the flesh, as it is written, and
   conversed with his disciples; and that after every dispensation had
   been fulfilled according to his Father's will, he was crucified and
   died, and was buried and descended into the lower parts of the earth,
   at whose presence hades itself trembled: who also arose from the dead
   on the third day, again conversed with his disciples, and after the
   completion of forty days was taken up into the heavens, and sits at the
   right hand of the Father, whence he will come in the last day, the day
   of the resurrection, in his Father's glory, to requite every one
   accord-to his works. [We believe] also in the Holy Spirit, whom he
   himself the only-begotten of God, Christ our Lord and God, promised to
   send to mankind as the Comforter, according as it is written, [432]
   "the Spirit of truth"; whom he sent to them after he was received into
   the heavens. But since the term ousia [substance or essence], which was
   used by the fathers in a very simple and intelligible sense, but not
   being understood by the people, has been a cause of offense, we have
   thought proper to reject it, as it is not contained even in the sacred
   writings; and that no mention of it should be made in future, inasmuch
   as the holy Scriptures have nowhere mentioned the substance of the
   Father and of the Son. Nor ought the "subsistence" of the Father, and
   of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit to be even named. But we affirm that
   the Son is like the Father, in such a manner as the sacred Scriptures
   declare and teach. Let therefore all heresies which have been already
   condemned, or may have arisen of late, which are opposed to this
   exposition of the faith, be anathema.'

   These things were recognized at that time at Constantinople. And now as
   we have at length wound our way through the labyrinth of all the
   various forms of faith, let us reckon the number of them. After that
   which was promulgated at Nicæa, two others were proposed at Antioch at
   the dedication of the church there. [433] A third was presented to the
   Emperor in Gaul by Narcissus and those who accompanied him. [434] The
   fourth was sent by Eudoxius into Italy. [435] There were three forms of
   the creed published at Sirmium, one of which having the consuls' names
   prefixed was read at Ariminum. [436] The Acacian party produced an
   eighth at Seleucia. [437] The last was that of Constantinople,
   containing the prohibitory clause respecting the mention of substance'
   or subsistence' in relation to God. To this creed Ulfilas bishop of the
   Goths gave his assent, although he had previously adhered to that of
   Nicæa; for he was a disciple of Theophilus bishop of the Goths, who was
   present at the Nicene council, and subscribed what was there
   determined. Let this suffice on these subjects.

   Chapter XLII.--On the Deposition of Macedonius, Eudoxius obtains the
   Bishopric of Constantinople.

   Acacius, Eudoxius, and those at Constantinople who took part with them,
   became exceedingly anxious that they also on their side might depose
   some of the opposite party. Now it should be observed that neither of
   the factions were influenced by religious considerations in making
   depositions, but by other motives: for although they did not agree
   respecting the faith, yet the ground of their reciprocal depositions
   was not error in doctrine. The Acacian party therefore availing
   themselves of the emperor's indignation against others, and especially
   against Macedonius, which he was cherishing and anxious to vent, in the
   first place deposed Macedonius, both on account of his having
   occasioned so much slaughter, and also because he had admitted to
   communion a deacon who had been found guilty of fornication. [438] They
   then depose Eleusius bishop of Cyzicus, for having baptized, and
   afterwards invested with the diaconate, a priest of Hercules at Tyre
   named Heraclius, who was known to have practiced magic arts. [439] A
   like sentence was pronounced against Basil, or Basilas,--as he was also
   called,--who had been constituted bishop of Ancyra instead of
   Marcellus: the causes assigned for this condemnation were, that he had
   unjustly imprisoned a certain individual, loaded him with chains, and
   put him to the torture; that he had traduced some persons; and that he
   had disturbed the churches of Africa by his epistles. Dracontius was
   also deposed, because he had left the Galatian church for that of
   Pergamos. Moreover they deposed, on various pretenses, Neonas bishop of
   Seleucia, the city in which the Synod had been convened, Sophronius of
   Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, Elpidius of Satala, in Macedonia, and
   Cyril of Jerusalem, and others for various reasons.

   Chapter XLIII.--Of Eustathius Bishop of Sebastia.

   But Eustathius bishop of Sebastia in Armenia was not even permitted to
   make his defense; because he had been long before deposed by Eulalius,
   his own father, who was bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, for dressing
   in a style unbecoming the sacerdotal office. [440] Let it be noted that
   Meletius was appointed his successor, of whom we shall hereafter speak.
   Eustathius indeed was subsequently condemned by a Synod convened on his
   account at Gangra in Paphlagonia; he having, after his deposition by
   the council at Cæsarea, done many things repugnant to the
   ecclesiastical canons. For he had forbidden marriage,' [441] and
   maintained that meats were to be abstained from: he even separated many
   from their wives, and persuaded those who disliked to assemble in the
   churches to commune at home. Under the pretext of piety, he also
   seduced servants from their masters. He himself wore the habit of a
   philosopher, and induced his followers to adopt a new and extraordinary
   garb, directing that the hair of women should be cropped. He permitted
   the prescribed fasts to be neglected, but recommended fasting on
   Sundays. In short, he forbade prayers to be offered in the houses of
   married persons: and declared that both the benediction and the
   communion of a presbyter who continued to live with a wife whom he
   might have lawfully married, while still a layman, ought to be shunned
   as an abomination. For doing and teaching these things and many others
   of a similar nature, a Synod convened, as we have said, at Gangra [442]
   in Paphlagonia deposed him, and anathematized his opinions. This,
   however, was done afterwards. But on Macedonius being ejected from the
   see of Constantinople, Eudoxius, who now looked upon the see of Antioch
   as secondary in importance, was promoted to the vacant bishopric; being
   consecrated by the Acacians, who in this instance cared not to consider
   that it was inconsistent with their former proceedings. For they who
   had deposed Dracontius because of his translation from Galatia to
   Pergamos, were clearly acting in contrariety to their own principles
   and decisions, in ordaining Eudoxius, who then made a second change.
   After this they sent their own exposition of the faith, in its
   corrected and supplementary form, to Arminium, ordering that all those
   who refused to sign it should be exiled on the authority of the
   emperor's edict. They also informed such other prelates in the East as
   coincided with them in opinion of what they had done; and more
   especially Patrophilus bishop of Scythopolis, who on leaving Seleucia
   had proceeded directly to his own city. Eudoxius having been
   constituted bishop of the imperial city, the great church named Sophia
   was at that time consecrated, [443] in the tenth consulate [444] of
   Constantius, and the third of Julian Cæsar, on the 15th day of
   February. It was while Eudoxius occupied this see, that he first
   uttered that sentence which is still everywhere current, The Father is
   impious, the Son is pious.' When the people seemed startled by this
   expression, and a disturbance began to be made, Be not troubled,' said
   he, on account of what I have just said: for the Father is impious,
   because he worships no person; but the Son is pious because he worships
   the Father.' Eudoxius having said this, the tumult was appeased, and
   great laughter was excited in the church: and this saying of his
   continues to be a jest, even in the present day. The heresiarchs indeed
   frequently devised such subtle phrases as these, and by them rent the
   church asunder. Thus was the Synod at Constantinople terminated.

   the celibacy of the clergy, as follows: If any one maintains that, when
   a married priest offer the sacrifice, no one should take part in the
   service, let him be anathema.'

   [443] This was evidently the second consecration of the earlier church
   of St. Sophia (cf. I. 16, II. 6); the first consecration was celebrated
   in 326 a.d. Later, the structure was destroyed in a fire, in connection
   with a popular uprising; and the great church of St. Sophia, at present
   a Mohammedan mosque, was erected by Justinian, with Isidore of Miletus
   and Anthimius of Tralles as architects.

   Chapter XLIV.--Of Meletius [445] Bishop of Antioch.

   It becomes us now to speak of Meletius, who, as we have recently
   observed, was created bishop of Sebastia in Armenia, after the
   deposition of Eustathius; from Sebastia he was transferred to Beroea, a
   city of Syria. Being present at the Synod of Seleucia, he subscribed
   the creed set forth there by Acacius, and immediately returned thence
   to Beroea. When the convention of the Synod at Constantinople was held,
   the people of Antioch finding that Eudoxius, captivated by the
   magnificence of the see of Constantinople, had contemned their church,
   they sent for Meletius, and invested him with the bishopric of the
   church at Antioch. Now he at first avoided all doctrinal questions,
   confining his discourses to moral subjects; but subsequently he
   expounded to his auditors the Nicene creed, and asserted the doctrine
   of the homoousion. The emperor being informed of this, ordered that he
   should be sent into exile; and caused Euzoïus, who had before been
   deposed together with Arius, to be installed bishop of Antioch in his
   stead. Such, however, as were attached to Meletius, separated
   themselves from the Arian congregation, and held their assemblies
   apart: nevertheless, those who originally embraced the homoousian
   opinion would not communicate with them, because Meletius had been
   ordained by the Arians, and his adherents had been baptized by them.
   Thus was the Antiochian church divided, even in regard to those whose
   views on matters of faith exactly corresponded. Meanwhile the emperor
   getting intelligence that the Persians were preparing to undertake
   another war against the Romans, repaired in great haste to Antioch.

   Chapter XLV.--The Heresy of Macedonius.

   Macedonius on being ejected from Constantinople, bore his condemnation
   ill and became restless; he therefore associated himself with the other
   faction that had deposed Acacius and his party at Seleucia, and sent a
   deputation to Sophronius and Eleusius, to encourage them to adhere to
   that creed which was first promulgated at Antioch, and afterwards
   confirmed at Seleucia, proposing to give it the counterfeit [446] name
   of the homoiousian' creed. [447] By this means he drew around him a
   great number of adherents, who from him are still denominated
   Macedonians.' And although such as dissented from the Acacians at the
   Seleucian Synod had not previously used the term homoiousios, yet from
   that period they distinctly asserted it. There was, however, a popular
   report that this term did not originate with Macedonius, but was the
   invention rather of Marathonius, who a little before had been set over
   the church at Nicomedia; on which account the maintainers of this
   doctrine were also called Marathonians.' To this party Eustathius
   joined himself, who for the reasons before stated had been ejected from
   the church at Sebastia. But when Macedonius began to deny the Divinity
   of the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, Eustathius said: I can neither admit
   that the Holy Spirit is God, nor can I dare affirm him to be a
   creature.' For this reason those who hold the homoousion of the Son
   call these heretics Pneumatomachi.' [448] By what means these
   Macedonians became so numerous in the Hellespont, I shall state in its
   proper place. [449] The Acacians meanwhile became extremely anxious
   that another Synod should be convened at Antioch, in consequence of
   having changed their mind respecting their former assertion of the
   likeness in all things' of the Son to the Father. A small number of
   them therefore assembled in the following consulate [450] which was
   that of Taurus and Florentius, at Antioch in Syria, where the emperor
   was at that time residing, Euzoïus being bishop. A discussion was then
   renewed on some of those points which they had previously determined,
   in the course of which they declared that the term homoios' ought to be
   erased from the form of faith which had been published both at Ariminum
   and Constantinople; and they no longer concealed but openly declared
   that the Son was altogether unlike the Father, not merely in relation
   to his essence, but even as it respected his will; asserting boldly
   also, as Arius had already done, that he was made of nothing. Those in
   that city who favored the heresy of Aëtius, gave their assent to this
   opinion; from which circumstance in addition to the general appellation
   of Arians, they were also termed Anomoeans,' [451] and Exucontians,'
   [452] by those at Antioch who embraced the homoousian, who nevertheless
   were at that time divided among themselves on account of Meletius, as I
   have before observed. Being therefore questioned by them, how they
   dared to affirm that the Son is unlike the Father, and has his
   existence from nothing, after having acknowledged him God of God' in
   their former creed? they endeavored to elude this objection by such
   fallacious subterfuges as these. The expression, "God of God,"' said
   they, is to be understood in the same sense as the words of the
   apostle, [453] "but all things of God." Wherefore the Son is of God, as
   being one of these all things: and it is for this reason the words
   "according to the Scriptures" are added in the draught of the creed.'
   The author of this sophism was George bishop of Laodicea, who being
   unskilled in such phrases, was ignorant of the manner in which Origen
   had formerly explained these peculiar expressions of the apostle,
   having thoroughly investigated the matter. But notwithstanding these
   evasive cavilings, they were unable to bear the reproach and contumely
   they had drawn upon themselves, and fell back upon the creed which they
   had before put forth at Constantinople; and so each one retired to his
   own district. George returning to Alexandria, resumed his authority
   over the churches there, Athanasius still not having made his
   appearance. Those in that city who were opposed to his sentiments he
   persecuted; and conducting himself with great severity and cruelty, he
   rendered himself extremely odious to the people. At Jerusalem Arrenius
   [454] was placed over the church instead of Cyril: we may also remark
   that Heraclius was ordained bishop there after him, and after him
   Hilary. At length, however, Cyril returned to Jerusalem, and was again
   invested with the presidency over the church there. About the same time
   another heresy sprang up, which arose from the following circumstance.

   Chapter XLVI.--Of the Apollinarians, and their Heresy. [455]

   There were two men of the same name at Laodicea in Syria, a father and
   son: their name was Apollinaris; the former of them was a presbyter,
   and the latter a reader in that church. Both taught Greek literature,
   the father grammar, and the son rhetoric. The father was a native of
   Alexandria, and at first taught at Berytus, but afterwards removed to
   Laodicea, where he married, and the younger Apollinaris was born. They
   were contemporaries of Epiphanius the sophist, and being true friends
   they became intimate with him; but Theodotus bishop of Laodicea,
   fearing that such communication should pervert their principles, and
   lead them into paganism, forbade their associating with him: they,
   however, paid but little attention to this prohibition, their
   familiarity with Epiphanius being still continued. George, the
   successor of Theodotus, also endeavored to prevent their conversing
   with Epiphanius; but not being able in any way to persuade them on this
   point, he excommunicated them. The younger Apollinaris regarding this
   severe procedure as an act of injustice, and relying on the resources
   of his rhetorical sophistry, originated a new heresy, which was named
   after its inventor, and still has many supporters. Nevertheless some
   affirm that it was not for the reason above assigned that they
   dissented from George, but because they saw the unsettledness and
   inconsistency of his profession of faith; since he sometimes maintained
   that the Son is like the Father, in accordance with what had been
   determined in the Synod at Seleucia, and at other times countenanced
   the Arian view. They therefore made this a pretext for separation from
   him: but as no one followed their example, they introduced a new form
   of doctrine, and at first they asserted that in the economy of the
   incarnation, God the Word assumed a human body without a soul.
   Afterwards, as if changing mind, they retracted, admitting that he took
   a soul indeed, but that it was an irrational one, God the Word himself
   being in the place of a mind. Those who followed them and bear their
   name at this day affirm that this is their only point of distinction
   [from the Catholics]; for they recognize the consubstantiality of the
   persons in the Trinity. But we will make further mention of the two
   Apollinares in the proper place. [456]

   Chapter XLVII.--Successes of Julian; Death of the Emperor Constantius.

   While the Emperor Constantius continued his residence at Antioch,
   Julian Cæsar engaged with an immense army of barbarians in the Gauls,
   and obtaining the victory over them, he became extremely popular among
   the soldiery and was proclaimed emperor by them. When this was made
   known, the Emperor Constantius was affected most painfully; he was
   therefore baptized by Euzoïus, and immediately prepared to undertake an
   expedition against Julian. On arriving at the frontiers of Cappadocia
   and Cilicia, his excessive agitation of mind produced apoplexy, which
   terminated his life at Mopsucrene, in the consulate of Taurus and
   Florentius, [457] on the 3d of November. This was in the first year of
   the 285th Olympiad. Constantius had lived forty-five years, having
   reigned thirty-eight years; thirteen of which he was his father's
   colleague in the empire, and after his father's death for twenty-five
   years [sole emperor], the history of which latter period is contained
   in this book.

   Book III.

   Chapter I.--Of Julian; his Lineage and Education; his Elevation to the
   Throne; his Apostasy to Paganism.

   The Emperor Constantius died on the frontiers of Cilicia on the 3d of
   November, during the consulate of Taurus and Florentius; Julian leaving
   the western parts of the empire about the 11th of December following,
   under the same consulate, came to Constantinople, where he was
   proclaimed emperor. [458] And as I must needs speak of the character of
   this prince who was eminently distinguished for his learning, let not
   his admirers expect that I should attempt a pompous rhetorical style,
   as if it were necessary to make the delineation correspond with the
   dignity of the subject: for my object being to compile a history of the
   Christian religion, it is both proper in order to the being better
   understood, and consistent with my original purpose, to maintain a
   humble and unaffected style. [459] However, it is proper to describe
   his person, birth, education, and the manner in which he became
   possessed of the sovereignty; and in order to do this it will be
   needful to enter into some antecedent details. Constantine who gave
   Byzantium his own name, had two brothers named Dalmatius and
   Constantius, the offspring of the same father, but by a different
   mother. The former of these had a son who bore his own name: the latter
   had two sons, Gallus and Julian. Now as on the death of Constantine who
   founded Constantinople, the soldiery had put the younger brother
   Dalmatius to death, the lives of his two orphan children were also
   endangered: but a disease which threatened to be fatal preserved Gallus
   from the violence of his father's murderers; while the tenderness of
   Julian's age--for he was only eight years old at the time--protected
   him. The emperor's jealousy toward them having been gradually subdued,
   Gallus attended the schools at Ephesus in Ionia, in which country
   considerable hereditary possessions had been left them. And Julian,
   when he was grown up, pursued his studies at Constantinople, going
   constantly to the palace, where the schools then were, in plain
   clothes, under the superintendence of the eunuch Mardonius. In grammar
   Nicocles the Lacædemonian was his instructor; and Ecebolius the
   Sophist, who was at that time a Christian, taught him rhetoric: for the
   emperor had made the provision that he should have no pagan masters,
   lest he should be seduced to the pagan superstitions. For Julian was a
   Christian at the beginning. His proficiency in literature soon became
   so remarkable, that it began to be said that he was capable of
   governing the Roman empire; and this popular rumor becoming generally
   diffused, greatly disquieted the emperor's mind, so that he had him
   removed from the Great City to Nicomedia, forbidding him at the same
   time to frequent the school of Libanius the Syrian Sophist. For
   Libanius having been driven at that time from Constantinople, by a
   combination of the educators there, had retired to Nicomedia, where he
   opened a school. Here he gave vent to his indignation against the
   educators in the treatise he composed regarding them. Julian was,
   however, interdicted from being his auditor, because Libanius was a
   pagan in religion: nevertheless he privately procured his orations,
   which he not only greatly admired, but also frequently and with close
   study perused. As he was becoming very expert in the rhetorical art,
   Maximus the philosopher arrived at Nicomedia (not the Byzantine,
   Euclid's father) but the Ephesian, whom the emperor Valentinian
   afterwards caused to be executed as a practicer of magic. This took
   place later; at that time the only thing that attracted him to
   Nicomedia was the fame of Julian. From him [Julian] received, in
   addition to the principles of philosophy, his own religious sentiments,
   and a desire to possess the empire. When these things reached the ears
   of the emperor, Julian, between hope and fear, became very anxious to
   lull the suspicions which had been awakened, and therefore began to
   assume the external semblance of what he once was in reality. He was
   shaved to the very skin, [460] and pretended to live a monastic life:
   and while in private he pursued his philosophical studies, in public he
   read the sacred writings of the Christians, and moreover was
   constituted a reader [461] in the church of Nicomedia. Thus by these
   specious pretexts he succeeded in averting the emperor's displeasure.
   Now he did all this from fear, but he by no means abandoned his hope;
   telling his friends that happier times were not far distant, when he
   should possess the imperial sway. In this condition of things his
   brother Gallus having been created Cæsar, on his way to the East came
   to Nicomedia to see him. But when not long after this Gallus was slain,
   Julian was suspected by the emperor; wherefore he directed that a guard
   should be set over him: he soon, however, found means of escaping from
   them, and fleeing from place to place he managed to be in safety. At
   last the Empress Eusebia having discovered his retreat, persuaded the
   emperor to leave him uninjured, and permit him to go to Athens to
   pursue his philosophical studies. From thence--to be brief--the emperor
   recalled him, and after created him Cæsar; in addition to this, uniting
   him in marriage to his own sister Helen, he sent him against the
   barbarians. For the barbarians whom the Emperor Constantius had engaged
   as auxiliary forces against the tyrant Magnentius, having proved of no
   use against the usurper, were beginning to pillage the Roman cities.
   And inasmuch as he was young he ordered him to undertake nothing
   without consulting the other military chiefs.

   Now these generals having obtained such authority, became lax in their
   duties, and the barbarians in consequence strengthened themselves.
   Julian perceiving this allowed the commanders to give themselves up to
   luxury and revelling, but exerted himself to infuse courage into the
   soldiery, offering a stipulated reward to any one who should kill a
   barbarian. This measure effectually weakened the enemy and at the same
   time conciliated to himself the affections of the army. It is reported
   that as he was entering a town a civic crown which was suspended
   between two pillars fell upon his head, which it exactly fitted: upon
   which all present gave a shout of admiration, regarding it as a presage
   of his one day becoming emperor. Some have affirmed that Constantius
   sent him against the barbarians, in the hope that he would perish in an
   engagement with them. I know not whether those who say this speak the
   truth; but it certainly is improbable that he should have first
   contracted so near an alliance with him, and then have sought his
   destruction to the prejudice of his own interests. Let each form his
   own judgment of the matter. Julian's complaint to the emperor of the
   inertness of his military officers procured for him a coadjutor in the
   command more in sympathy with his own ardor; and by their combined
   efforts such an assault was made upon the barbarians, that they sent
   him an embassy, assuring him that they had been ordered by the
   emperor's letters, which were produced, to march into the Roman
   territories. But he cast the ambassador into prison, and vigorously
   attacking the forces of the enemy, totally defeated them; and having
   taken their king prisoner, he sent him alive to Constantius.
   Immediately after this brilliant success he was proclaimed emperor by
   the soldiers; and inasmuch as there was no imperial crown at hand, one
   of his guards took the chain which he wore about his own neck, and
   bound it around Julian's head. Thus Julian became emperor: but whether
   he subsequently conducted himself as became a philosopher, let my
   readers determine. For he neither entered into communication with
   Constantius by an embassy, nor paid him the least homage in
   acknowledgment of past favors; but constituting other governors over
   the provinces, he conducted everything just as it pleased him.
   Moreover, he sought to bring Constantius into contempt, by reciting
   publicly in every city the letters which he had written to the
   barbarians; and thus having rendered the inhabitants of these places
   disaffected, they were easily induced to revolt from Constantius to
   himself. After this he no longer wore the mask of Christianity, but
   everywhere opened the pagan temples, offering sacrifice to the idols;
   and designating himself Pontifex Maximus,' [462] gave permission to
   such as would to celebrate their superstitious festivals. In this
   manner he managed to excite a civil war against Constantius; and thus,
   as far as he was concerned, he would have involved the empire in all
   the disastrous consequences of a war. For this philosopher's aim could
   not have been attained without much bloodshed: but God, in the
   sovereignty of his own councils, checked the fury of these antagonists
   without detriment to the state, by the removal of one of them. For when
   Julian arrived among the Thracians, intelligence was brought him that
   Constantius was dead; and thus was the Roman empire at that time
   preserved from the intestine strife that threatened it. Julian
   forthwith made his public entry into Constantinople; and considered
   with himself how he might best conciliate the masses and secure popular
   favor. Accordingly he had recourse to the following measures: he knew
   that Constantius had rendered himself odious to the defenders of the
   homoousian faith by having driven them from the churches, and
   proscribed their bishops. [463] He was also aware that the pagans were
   extremely discontented because of the prohibitions which prevented
   their sacrificing to their gods, and were very anxious to get their
   temples opened, with liberty to exercise their idolatrous rites. In
   fact, he was sensible that while both these classes secretly
   entertained rancorous feelings against his predecessor, the people in
   general were exceedingly exasperated by the violence of the eunuchs,
   and especially by the rapacity of Eusebius the chief officer of the
   imperial bed-chamber. Under these circumstances he treated all parties
   with subtlety: with some he dissimulated; others he attached to himself
   by conferring obligations upon them, for he was fond of affecting
   beneficence; but to all in common he manifested his own predilection
   for the idolatry of the heathens. And first in order to brand the
   memory of Constantius by making him appear to have been cruel toward
   his subjects, he recalled the exiled bishops, and restored to them
   their confiscated estates. He next commanded the suitable agents to see
   that the pagan temples should be opened without delay. Then he directed
   that such individuals as had been victims of the extortionate conduct
   of the eunuchs, should receive back the property of which they had been
   plundered. Eusebius, the chief of the imperial bed-chamber, he punished
   with death, not only on account of the injuries he had inflicted on
   others, but because he was assured that it was through his machinations
   that his brother Gallus had been killed. The body of Constantius he
   honored with an imperial funeral, but expelled the eunuchs, barbers,
   and cooks from the palace. The eunuchs he dispensed with, because they
   were unnecessary in consequence of his wife's decease, as he had
   resolved not to marry again; the cooks, because he maintained a very
   simple table; and the barbers, because he said one was sufficient for a
   great many persons. These he dismissed for the reasons given; he also
   reduced the majority of the secretaries to their former condition, and
   appointed for those who were retained a salary befitting their office.
   The mode of public traveling [464] and conveyance of necessaries he
   also reformed, abolishing the use of mules, oxen, and asses for this
   purpose, and permitting horses only to be so employed. These various
   retrenchments were highly lauded by some few, but strongly reprobated
   by all others, as tending to bring the imperial dignity into contempt,
   by stripping it of those appendages of pomp and magnificence which
   exercise so powerful an influence over the minds of the vulgar. Not
   only so, but at night he was accustomed to sit up composing orations
   which he afterwards delivered in the senate: though in fact he was the
   first and only emperor since the time of Julius Cæsar who made speeches
   in that assembly. To those who were eminent for literary attainments,
   he extended the most flattering patronage, and especially to those who
   were professional philosophers; in consequence of which, abundance of
   pretenders to learning of this sort resorted to the palace from all
   quarters, wearing their palliums, being more conspicuous for their
   costume than their erudition. These impostors, who invariably adopted
   the religious sentiments of their prince, were all inimical to the
   welfare of the Christians; and Julian himself, whose excessive vanity
   prompted him to deride all his predecessors in a book which he wrote
   entitled The Cæsars, was led by the same haughty disposition to compose
   treatises against the Christians also. [465] The expulsion of the cooks
   and barbers is in a manner becoming a philosopher indeed, but not an
   emperor; but ridiculing and caricaturing of others is neither the part
   of the philosopher nor that of the emperor: for such personages ought
   to be superior to the influence of jealousy and detraction. An emperor
   may be a philosopher in all that regards moderation and self-control;
   but should a philosopher attempt to imitate what might become an
   emperor, he would frequently depart from his own principles. We have
   thus briefly spoken of the Emperor Julian, tracing his extraction,
   education, temper of mind, and the way in which he became invested with
   the imperial power.

   Chapter II.--Of the Sedition excited at Alexandria, and how George was
   slain.

   It is now proper to mention what took place in the churches under the
   same [emperor]. A great disturbance occurred at Alexandria in
   consequence of the following circumstance. There was a place in that
   city which had long been abandoned to neglect and filth, wherein the
   pagans had formerly celebrated their mysteries, and sacrificed human
   beings to Mithra. [466] This being empty and otherwise useless,
   Constantius had granted to the church of the Alexandrians; and George
   wishing to erect a church on the site of it, gave directions that the
   place should be cleansed. In the process of clearing it, an adytum
   [467] of vast depth was discovered which unveiled the nature of their
   heathenish rites: for there were found there the skulls of many persons
   of all ages, who were said to have been immolated for the purpose of
   divination by the inspection of entrails, when the pagans performed
   these and such like magic arts whereby they enchanted the souls of men.
   The Christians on discovering these abominations in the adytum of the
   Mithreum, went forth eagerly to expose them to the view and execration
   of all; and therefore carried the skulls throughout the city, in a kind
   of triumphal procession, for the inspection of the people. When the
   pagans of Alexandria beheld this, unable to bear the insulting
   character of the act, they became so exasperated, that they assailed
   the Christians with whatever weapon chanced to come to hand, in their
   fury destroying numbers of them in a variety of ways: some they killed
   with the sword, others with clubs and stones; some they strangled with
   ropes, others they crucified, purposely inflicting this last kind of
   death in contempt of the cross of Christ: most of them they wounded;
   and as it generally happens in such a case, neither friends nor
   relatives were spared, but friends, brothers, parents, and children
   imbrued their hands in each other's blood. Wherefore the Christians
   ceased from cleansing the Mithreum: the pagans meanwhile having dragged
   George out of the church, fastened him to a camel, and when they had
   torn him to pieces, they burnt him together with the camel. [468]

   Chapter III.--The Emperor Indignant at the Murder of George, rebukes
   the Alexandrians by Letter.

   The emperor being highly indignant at the assassination of George,
   wrote to the citizens of Alexandria, rebuking their violence in the
   strongest terms. A report was circulated that those who detested him
   because of Athanasius, perpetrated this outrage upon George: but as for
   me I think it is undoubtedly true that such as cherish hostile feelings
   against particular individuals are often found identified with popular
   commotions; yet the emperor's letter evidently attaches the blame to
   the populace, rather than to any among the Christians. George, however,
   was at that time, and had for some time previously been, exceedingly
   obnoxious to all classes, which is sufficient to account for the
   burning indignation of the multitude against him. That the emperor
   charges the people with the crime may be seen from his letter which was
   expressed in the following terms.

   Emperor Cæsar Julian Maximus Augustus to the Citizens of Alexandria.
   [469]

   Even if you have neither respect for Alexander the founder of your
   city, nor, what is more, for that great and most holy god Serapis; yet
   how is it you have made no account not only of the universal claims of
   humanity and social order, but also of what is due to us, to whom all
   the gods, and especially the mighty Serapis, have assigned the empire
   of the world, for whose cognizance therefore it became you to reserve
   all matters of public wrong? But perhaps the impulse of rage and
   indignation, which taking possession of the mind, too often stimulate
   it to the most atrocious acts, has led you astray. It seems, however,
   that when your fury had in some degree moderated, you aggravated your
   culpability by adding a most heinous offense to that which had been
   committed under the excitement of the moment: nor were you, although
   but the common people, ashamed to perpetrate those very acts on account
   of which you justly detested them. By Serapis I conjure you tell me,
   for what unjust deed were ye so indignant at George? You will perhaps
   answer, it was because he exasperated Constantius of blessed memory
   against you: because he introduced an army into the sacred city:
   because in consequence the governor [470] of Egypt despoiled the god's
   most holy temple of its images, votive offerings, and such other
   consecrated apparatus as it contained; who, when ye could not endure
   the sight of such a foul desecration, but attempted to defend the god
   from sacrilegious hands, or rather to hinder the pillage of what had
   been consecrated to his service, in contravention of all justice, law,
   and piety, dared to send armed bands against you. This he probably did
   from his dreading George more than Constantius: but he would have
   consulted better for his own safety had he not been guilty of this
   tyrannical conduct, but persevered in his former moderation toward you.
   Being on all these accounts enraged against George as the adversary of
   the gods, you have again polluted your sacred city; whereas you ought
   to have impeached him before the judges. For had you thus acted,
   neither murder, nor any other unlawful deed would have been committed;
   but justice being equitably dispensed, would have preserved you
   innocent of these disgraceful excesses, while it brought on him the
   punishment due to his impious crimes. Thus too, in short, the insolence
   of those would have been curbed who contemn the gods, and respect
   neither cities of such magnitude, nor so flourishing a population; but
   make the barbarities they practice against them the prelude, as it
   were, of their exercise of power. Compare therefore this my present
   letter, with that which I wrote you some time since. With what high
   commendation did I then greet you! But now, by the immortal gods, with
   an equal disposition to praise you I am unable to do so on account of
   your heinous misdoings. The people have had the audacity to tear a man
   in pieces, like dogs; nor have they been subsequently ashamed of this
   inhuman procedure, nor desirous of purifying their hands from such
   pollution, that they may stretch them forth in the presence of the gods
   undefiled by blood. You will no doubt be ready to say that George
   justly merited this chastisement; and we might be disposed perhaps to
   admit that he deserved still more acute tortures. Should you farther
   affirm that on your account he was worthy of these sufferings, even
   this might also be granted. But should you add that it became you to
   inflict the vengeance due to his offenses, that I could by no means
   acquiesce in; for you have laws to which it is the duty of every one of
   you to be subject, and to evince your respect for both publicly, as
   well as in private. If any individual should transgress those wise and
   salutary regulations which were originally constituted for the
   well-being of the community, does that absolve the rest from obedience
   to them? It is fortunate for you, ye Alexandrians, that such an
   atrocity has been perpetrated in our reign, who, by reason of our
   reverence for the gods, and on account of our grandfather and uncle
   [471] whose name we bear, and who governed Egypt and your city, still
   retain a fraternal affection for you. Assuredly that power which will
   not suffer itself to be disrespected, and such a government as is
   possessed of a vigorous and healthy constitution, could not connive at
   such unbridled licentiousness in its subjects, without unsparingly
   purging out the dangerous distemper by the application of remedies
   sufficiently potent. We shall however in your case, for the reasons
   already assigned, restrict ourselves to the more mild and gentle
   medicine of remonstrance and exhortation; to the which mode of
   treatment we are persuaded ye will the more readily submit, inasmuch as
   we understand ye are Greeks by original descent, and also still
   preserve in your memory and character the traces of the glory of your
   ancestors. Let this be published to our citizens of Alexandria.

   Such was the emperor's letter.

   Chapter IV.--On the Death of George, Athanasius returns to Alexandria,
   and takes Possession of his See.

   Not long after this, Athanasius returning from his exile, was received
   with great joy by the people of Alexandria. They expelled at that time
   the Arians from the churches, and restored Athanasius to the possession
   of them. The Arians meanwhile assembling themselves in low and obscure
   buildings, ordained Lucius to supply the place of George. Such was the
   state of things at that time at Alexandria.

   Chapter V.--Of Lucifer and Eusebius.

   About the same time Lucifer and Eusebius [472] were by an imperial
   order, recalled from banishment out of the Upper Thebaïs; the former
   being bishop of Carala, a city of Sardinia, the latter of Vercellæ, a
   city of the Ligurians in Italy, as I have said [473] previously. These
   two prelates therefore consulted together on the most effectual means
   of preventing the neglected canons [474] and discipline of the church
   from being in future violated and despised.

   [472] Theodoret, H. E. III, 4, mentions Hilarius, Astenius, and some

   restoring the authority of the canons and correcting abuses in the
   church.

   Chapter VI.--Lucifer goes to Antioch and consecrates Paulinus.

   It was decided therefore that Lucifer should go to Antioch in Syria,
   and Eusebius to Alexandria, that by assembling a Synod in conjunction
   with Athanasius, they might confirm the doctrines of the church.
   Lucifer sent a deacon as his representative, by whom he pledged himself
   to assent to whatever the Synod might decree; but he himself went to
   Antioch, where he found the church in great disorder, the people not
   being agreed among themselves. For not only did the Arian heresy, which
   had been introduced by Euzoïus, divide the church, but, as we before
   said, [475] the followers of Meletius also, from attachment to their
   teacher, separated themselves from those with whom they agreed in
   sentiment. When therefore Lucifer had constituted Paulinus their
   bishop, he again departed.

   Chapter VII.--By the Co-operation of Eusebius and Athanasius a Synod is
   held at Alexandria, wherein the Trinity is declared to be
   Consubstantial.

   As soon as Eusebius reached Alexandria, he in concert with Athanasius
   immediately convoked a Synod. The bishops assembled on this occasion
   out of various cities, took into consideration many subjects of the
   utmost importance. They asserted the divinity of the Holy Spirit [476]
   and comprehended him in the consubstantial Trinity: they also declared
   that the Word in being made man, assumed not only flesh, but also a
   soul, in accordance with the views of the early ecclesiastics. For they
   did not introduce any new doctrine of their own devising into the
   church, but contented themselves with recording their sanction of those
   points which ecclesiastical tradition has insisted on from the
   beginning, and wise Christians have demonstratively taught. Such
   sentiments the ancient fathers have uniformly maintained in all their
   controversial writings. Irenæus, Clemens, Apollinaris of Hierapolis,
   and Serapion who presided over the church at Antioch, assure us in
   their several works, that it was the generally received opinion that
   Christ in his incarnation was endowed with a soul. Moreover, the Synod
   convened on account of Beryllus [477] bishop of Philadelphia in Arabia,
   recognized the same doctrine in their letter to that prelate. Origen
   also everywhere in his extant works accepts that the Incarnate God took
   on himself a human soul. But he more particularly explains this mystery
   in the ninth volume of his Comments upon Genesis, where he shows that
   Adam and Eve were types of Christ and the church. That holy man
   Pamphilus, and Eusebius who was surnamed after him, are trustworthy
   witnesses on this subject: both these witnesses in their joint life of
   Origen, and admirable defense of him in answer to such as were
   prejudiced against him, prove that he was not the first who made this
   declaration, but that in doing so he was the mere expositor of the
   mystical tradition of the church. Those who assisted at the Alexandrian
   Council examined also with great minuteness the question concerning
   Essence' or Substance,' and Existence,' Subsistence,' or Personality.'
   For Hosius, bishop of Cordova in Spain, who has been before referred to
   as having been sent by the Emperor Constantine to allay the excitement
   which Arius had caused, originated the controversy about these terms in
   his earnestness to overthrow the dogma of Sabellius the Libyan. In the
   council of Nicæa, however, which was held soon after, this dispute was
   not agitated; but in consequence of the contention about it which
   subsequently arose, the matter was freely discussed at Alexandria.
   [478] It was there determined that such expressions as ousia and
   hypostasis ought not to be used in reference to God: for they argued
   that the word ousia is nowhere employed in the sacred Scriptures; and
   that the apostle has misapplied the term hypostasis [479] owing to an
   inevitable necessity arising from the nature of the doctrine. They
   nevertheless decided that in refutation of the Sabellian error these
   terms were admissible, in default of more appropriate language, lest it
   should be supposed that one thing was indicated by a threefold
   designation; whereas we ought rather to believe that each of those
   named in the Trinity is God in his own proper person. Such were the
   decisions of this Synod. If we may express our own judgment concerning
   substance and personality, it appears to us that the Greek philosophers
   have given us various definitions of ousia, but have not taken the
   slightest notice of hypostasis. Irenæus [480] the grammarian indeed, in
   his Alphabetical [Lexicon entitled] Atticistes, even declares it to be
   a barbarous term; for it is not to be found in any of the ancients,
   except occasionally in a sense quite different from that which is
   attached to it in the present day. Thus Sophocles, in his tragedy
   entitled Phoenix, uses it to signify treachery': in Menander it implies
   sauces'; as if one should call the sediment' at the bottom of a
   hogshead of wine hypostasis. But although the ancient philosophical
   writers scarcely noticed this word, the more modern ones have
   frequently used it instead of ousia. This term, as we before observed,
   has been variously defined: but can that which is capable of being
   circumscribed by a definition be applicable to God who is
   incomprehensible? Evagrius in his Monachicus, [481] cautions us against
   rash and inconsiderate language in reference to God; forbidding all
   attempt to define the divinity, inasmuch as it is wholly simple in its
   nature: for,' says he, definition belongs only to things which are
   compound.' The same author further adds, Every proposition has either a
   "genus" which is predicted, or a "species," or a "differentia," or a
   "proprium," or an "accidens," or that which is compounded of these: but
   none of these can be supposed to exist in the sacred Trinity. Let then
   what is inexplicable be adored in silence.' Such is the reasoning of
   Evagrius, of whom we shall again speak hereafter. [482] We have indeed
   made a digression here, but such as will tend to illustrate the subject
   under consideration.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [476] The bishops composing the Council of Nicæa simply declared their
   faith in the Holy Spirit, without adding any definition; they were not
   met with any denial of the divinity of the Holy Spirit. This denial was
   first made by Macedonius, in the fourth century.

   [477] Euseb. H. E. VI. 33, says that this Beryllus denied that Christ
   was God before the Incarnation. He, however, gives the see of Beryllus
   as Bostra in Arabia, instead of Philadelphia. So also Epiphanius
   Scholasticus; though Nicephorus, X. 2, calls him Cyrillus, instead of
   Beryllus.

   [478] Valesius conjectures that Socrates is wrong here in attributing
   such an action to the Synod of Alexandria, as the term ousia does not
   occur in the Nicene Creed, and such action would therefore be in
   manifest contradiction to the action at Nicæa. This, however, is not
   probable, in view of the dominating influence of Athanasius in both.
   But, as the acts of the Alexandrian synod are not extant, it is
   impossible to verify this conjecture.

   Chapter VIII.--Quotations from Athanasius' Defense of his Flight.'

   On this occasion Athanasius read to those present the Defense which he
   had composed some time before in justification of his flight; a few
   passages from which it may be of service to introduce here, leaving the
   entire production, which is too long to be transcribed, to be sought
   out and perused by the studious. [483] See the daring enormities of the
   impious persons! Such are their proceedings: and yet instead of
   blushing at their former clumsy intrigues against us, they even now
   abuse us for having effected our escape out of their murderous hands;
   nay, are grievously vexed that they were unable to put us out of the
   way altogether. In short, they overlook the fact that while they
   pretend to upbraid us with cowardice,' they are really criminating
   themselves: for if it be disgraceful to flee, it is still more so to
   pursue, since the one is only endeavoring to avoid being murdered,
   while the other is seeking to commit the deed. But Scripture itself
   directs us to flee: [484] and those who persecute unto death, in
   attempting to violate the law, constrain us to have recourse to flight.
   They should rather, therefore, be ashamed of their persecution, than
   reproach us for having sought to escape from it: let them cease to
   harass, and those who flee will also cease. Nevertheless they set no
   bounds to their malevolence, using every art to entrap us, in the
   consciousness that the flight of the persecuted is the strongest
   condemnation of the persecutor: for no one runs away from a mild and
   beneficent person, but from one who is of a barbarous and cruel
   disposition. Hence it was that Every one that was discontented and in
   debt' fled from Saul to David. [485] Wherefore these [foes of ours] in
   like manner desire to kill such as conceal themselves, that no evidence
   may exist to convict them of their wickedness. But in this also these
   misguided men most egregiously deceive themselves: for the more obvious
   the effort to elude them, the more manifestly will their deliberate
   slaughters and exiles be exposed. If they act the part of assassins,
   the voice of the blood which is shed will cry against them the louder:
   and if they condemn to banishment, they will raise so everywhere living
   monuments of their own injustice and oppression. Surely unless their
   intellects were unsound they would perceive the dilemma in which their
   own counsels entangle them. But since they have lost sound judgment,
   their folly is exposed when they vanish, and when they seek to stay
   they do not see their wickedness. [486] But if they reproach those who
   succeed in secreting themselves from the malice of their blood-thirsty
   adversaries, and revile such as flee from their persecutors, what will
   they say to Jacob's retreat from the rage of his brother Esau, [487]
   and to Moses [488] retiring into the land of Midian for fear of
   Pharaoh? And what apology will these babblers make for David's [489]
   flight from Saul, when he sent messengers from his own house to
   dispatch him; and for his concealment in a cave, after contriving to
   extricate himself from the treacherous designs of Abimelech, [490] by
   feigning madness? What will these reckless asserters of whatever suits
   their purpose answer, when they are reminded of the great prophet
   Elijah, [491] who by calling upon God had recalled the dead to life,
   hiding himself from dread of Ahab, and fleeing on account of Jezebel's
   menaces? At which time the sons of the prophets also, being sought for
   in order to be slain, withdrew, and were concealed in caves by Obadiah;
   [492] or are they unacquainted with these instances because of their
   antiquity? Have they forgotten also what is recorded in the Gospel,
   that the disciples retreated and hid themselves for fear of the Jews?
   [493] Paul, [494] when sought for by the governor [of Damascus] was let
   down from the wall in a basket, and thus escaped the hands of him that
   sought him.' Since then Scripture relates these circumstances
   concerning the saints, what excuse can they fabricate for their
   temerity? If they charge us with cowardice,' it is in utter
   insensibility to the condemnation it pronounces on themselves. If they
   asperse these holy men by asserting that they acted contrary to the
   will of God, they demonstrate their ignorance of Scripture. For it was
   commanded in the Law that cities of refuge' should be constituted,
   [495] by which provision was made that such as were pursued in order to
   be put to death might have means afforded of preserving themselves.
   Again in the consummation of the ages, when the Word of the Father, who
   had before spoken by Moses, came himself to the earth, he gave this
   express injunction, When they persecute you in one city, flee unto
   another:' [496] and shortly after, When therefore ye shall see the
   abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in
   the holy place (let whosoever reads, understand), then let those in
   Judea flee unto the mountains: let him that is on the house-top not
   come down to take anything out of his house; nor him that is in the
   fields return to take his clothes.' [497] The saints therefore knowing
   these precepts, had such a sort of training for their action: for what
   the Lord then commanded, he had before his coming in the flesh already
   spoken of by his servants. And this is a universal rule for man,
   leading to perfection, to practice whatever God has enjoined.' On this
   account the Word himself, becoming incarnate for our sake, deigned to
   conceal himself when he was sought for; [498] and being again
   persecuted, condescended to withdraw to avoid the conspiracy against
   him. For thus it became him, by hungering and thirsting and suffering
   other afflictions, to demonstrate that he was indeed made man. [499]
   For at the very commencement, as soon as he was born, he gave this
   direction by an angel to Joseph: Arise and take the young child and his
   mother, and flee into Egypt, for Herod will seek the infant's life.'
   [500] And after Herod's death, it appears that for fear of his son
   Archelaus he retired to Nazareth. Subsequently, when he gave
   unquestionable evidence of his Divine character by healing the withered
   hand, when the Pharisees took council how they might destroy him, [501]
   Jesus knowing their wickedness withdrew himself thence.' Moreover, when
   he had raised Lazarus from the dead, and they had become still more
   intent on destroying him, [we are told that] Jesus walked no more
   openly among the Jews, [502] but retired into a region on the borders
   of the desert.' Again when the Saviour said, Before Abraham was, I am;'
   [503] and the Jews took up stones to cast at him; Jesus concealed
   himself, and going through the midst of them out of the Temple, went
   away thence, and so escaped. Since then they see these things, or
   rather understand them, [504] (for they will not see,) are they not
   deserving of being burnt with fire, according to what is written, for
   acting and speaking so plainly contrary to all that the Lord did and
   taught? Finally, when John had suffered martyrdom, and his disciples
   had buried his body, Jesus having heard what was done, departed thence
   by ship into a desert place apart. [505] Now the Lord did these things
   and so taught. But would that these men of whom I speak, had the
   modesty to confine their rashness to men only, without daring to be
   guilty of such madness as to accuse the Saviour himself of cowardice';
   especially after having already uttered blasphemies against him. But
   even if they be insane they will not be tolerated and their ignorance
   of the gospels be detected by every one. The cause for retreat and
   flight under such circumstances as these is reasonable and valid, of
   which the evangelists have afforded us precedents in the conduct of our
   Saviour himself: from which it may be inferred that the saints have
   always been justly influenced by the same principle, since whatever is
   recorded of him as man, is applicable to mankind in general. For he
   took on himself our nature, and exhibited in himself the affections of
   our infirmity, which John has thus indicated: Then they sought to take
   him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.'
   [506] Moreover, before that hour came, he himself said to his mother,
   Mine hour is not yet come;' [507] and to those who were denominated his
   brethren, My time is not yet come.' Again when the time had arrived, he
   said to his disciples, Sleep on now, and take your rest: for behold the
   hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of
   sinners.' [508] ... So [509] that he neither permitted himself to be
   apprehended before the time came; nor when the time was come did he
   conceal himself, but voluntarily gave himself up to those who had
   conspired against him. [510] ... Thus also the blessed martyrs have
   guarded themselves in times of persecution: being persecuted they fled,
   and kept themselves concealed; but being discovered they suffered
   martyrdom.

   Such is the reasoning of Athanasius in his apology for his own flight.

   Chapter IX.--After the Synod of Alexandria, Eusebius proceeding to
   Antioch finds the Catholics at Variance on Account of Paulinus'
   Consecration; and having exerted himself in vain to reconcile them, he
   departs; Indignation of Lucifer and Origin of a Sect called after him.

   As soon as the council of Alexandria was dissolved, Eusebius bishop of
   Vercellæ went from Alexandria to Antioch; there finding that Paulinus
   had been ordained by Lucifer, and that the people were disagreeing
   among themselves,--for the partisans of Meletius held their assemblies
   apart,--he was exceedingly grieved at the want of harmony concerning
   this election, and in his own mind disapproved of what had taken place.
   His respect for Lucifer however induced him to be silent about it, and
   on his departure he engaged that all things should be set right by a
   council of bishops. Subsequently he labored with great earnestness to
   unite the dissentients, but did not succeed. Meanwhile Meletius
   returned from exile; and finding his followers holding their assemblies
   apart from the others, he set himself at their head. But Euzoïus, the
   chief of the Arian heresy, had possession of the churches: Paulinus
   [511] only retained a small church within the city, from which Euzoïus
   had not ejected him, on account of his personal respect for him. But
   Meletius assembled his adherents without the gates of the city. It was
   under these circumstances that Eusebius left Antioch at that time. When
   Lucifer understood that his ordination of Paul was not approved of by
   Eusebius, regarding it as an insult, he became highly incensed; and not
   only separated himself from communion with him, but also began, in a
   contentious spirit, to condemn what had been determined by the Synod.
   These things occurring at a season of grievous disorder, alienated many
   from the church; for many attached themselves to Lucifer, and thus a
   distinct sect arose under the name of Luciferians.' [512] Nevertheless
   Lucifer was unable to give full expression to his anger, inasmuch as he
   had pledged himself by his deacon to assent to whatever should be
   decided on by the Synod. Wherefore he adhered to the tenets of the
   church, and returned to Sardinia to his own see: but such as at first
   identified themselves with his quarrel, still continue separate from
   the church. Eusebius, on the other hand, traveling throughout the
   Eastern provinces like a good physician, completely restored those who
   were weak in the faith, instructing and establishing them in
   ecclesiastical principles. After this he passed over to Illyricum, and
   thence to Italy, where he pursued a similar course.

   Chapter X.--Of Hilary Bishop of Poictiers.

   There, however, Hilary bishop of Poictiers (a city of Aquitania
   Secunda) had anticipated him, having previously confirmed the bishops
   of Italy and Gaul in the doctrines of the orthodox faith; for he first
   had returned from exile to these countries. Both therefore nobly
   combined their energies in defense of the faith: and Hilary being a
   very eloquent man, maintained with great power the doctrine of the
   homoousion in books which he wrote in Latin. In these he gave
   sufficient support [to the doctrine] and unanswerably confuted the
   Arian tenets. These things took place shortly after the recall of those
   who had been banished. But it must be observed, that at the same time
   Macedonius, Eleusius, Eustathius, and Sophronius, with all their
   partisans, who had but the one common designation Macedonians, held
   frequent Synods in various places. [513] Having called together those
   of Seleucia who embraced their views, they anathematized the bishops of
   the other party, that is the Acacian: and rejecting the creed of
   Ariminum, they confirmed that which had been read at Seleucia. This, as
   I have stated in the preceding book, [514] was the same as had been
   before promulgated at Antioch. When they were asked by some one, Why
   have ye, who are called Macedonians hitherto, retained communion with
   the Acacians, as though ye agreed in opinion, if ye really hold
   different sentiments?' they replied thus, through Sophronius, bishop of
   Pompeiopolis, a city of Paphlagonia: Those in the West,' said he, were
   infected with the homoousian error as with a disease: Aëtius in the
   East adulterated the purity of the faith by introducing the assertion
   of a dissimilitude of substance. Now both of these dogmas are
   illegitimate; for the former rashly blended into one the distinct
   persons of the Father and the Son, binding them together by that cord
   of iniquity the term homoousion; while Aëtius wholly separated that
   affinity of nature of the Son to the Father, by the expression
   anomoion, unlike as to substance or essence. Since then both these
   opinions run into the very opposite extremes, the middle course between
   them appeared to us to be more consistent with truth and piety: we
   accordingly assert that the Son is "like the Father as to
   subsistence."'

   Such was the answer the Macedonians made by Sophronius to that
   question, as Sabinus assures us in his Collection of the Synodical
   Acts. But in decrying Aëtius as the author of the Anomoion doctrine,
   and not Acacius, they flagrantly disguise the truth, in order to seem
   as far removed from the Arians on the one side, as from the Homoousians
   on the other: for their own words convict them of having separated from
   them both, merely from the love of innovation. With these remarks we
   close our notice of these persons.

   Chapter XI.--The Emperor Julian extracts Money from the Christians.

   Although at the beginning of his reign the Emperor Julian conducted
   himself mildly toward all men; but as he went on he did not continue to
   show the same equanimity. He most readily indeed acceded to the
   requests of the Christians, when they tended in any way to cast odium
   on the memory of Constantius; but when this inducement did not exist,
   he made no effort to conceal the rancorous feelings which he
   entertained towards Christians in general. Accordingly he soon ordered
   that the church of the Novatians at Cyzicus, which Euzoïus had totally
   demolished, should be rebuilt, imposing a very heavy penalty upon
   Eleusius bishop of that city, if he failed to complete that structure
   at his own expense within the space of two months. Moreover, he favored
   the pagan superstitions with the whole weight of his authority: and the
   temples of the heathen were opened, as we have before stated; [515] but
   he himself also publicly offered sacrifices to Fortune, goddess of
   Constantinople, in the cathedral, [516] where her image was erected.

   Chapter XII.--Of Maris Bishop of Chalcedon; Julian forbids Christians
   from entering Literary Pursuits.

   About this time, Maris bishop of Chalcedon in Bithynia being led by the
   hand into the emperor's presence,--for on account of extreme old age he
   had a disease in his eyes termed cataract,'--severely rebuked his
   impiety, apostasy, and atheism. Julian answered his reproaches by
   loading him with contumelious epithets: and he defended himself by
   words calling him blind.' You blind old fool,' said he, this Galilæan
   God of yours will never cure you.' For he was accustomed to term Christ
   the Galilæan,' [517] and Christians Galilæans. Maris with still greater
   boldness replied, I thank God for bereaving me of my sight, that I
   might not behold the face of one who has fallen into such awful
   impiety.' The emperor suffered this to pass without farther notice at
   that time; but he afterwards had his revenge. Observing that those who
   suffered martyrdom under the reign of Diocletian were greatly honored
   by the Christians, and knowing that many among them were eagerly
   desirous of becoming martyrs, he determined to wreak his vengeance upon
   them in some other way. Abstaining therefore from the excessive
   cruelties which had been practiced under Diocletian; he did not however
   altogether abstain from persecution (for any measures adopted to
   disquiet and molest I regard as persecution). This then was the plan he
   pursued: he enacted a law [518] by which Christians were excluded from
   the cultivation of literature; lest,' said he, when they have sharpened
   their tongue, they should be able the more readily to meet the
   arguments of the heathen.'

   Chapter XIII.--Of the Outrages committed by the Pagans against the
   Christians.

   He moreover interdicted such as would not abjure Christianity, and
   offer sacrifice to idols, from holding any office at court: nor would
   he allow Christians to be governors of provinces; for,' said he, their
   law forbids them to use the sword against offenders worthy of capital
   punishment.' [519] He also induced many to sacrifice, partly by
   flatteries, and partly by gifts. Immediately, as if tried in a furnace,
   it at once became evident to all, who were the real Christians, and who
   were merely nominal ones. Such as were Christians in integrity of
   heart, very readily resigned their commission, [520] choosing to endure
   anything rather than deny Christ. Of this number were Jovian,
   Valentinian, and Valens, each of whom afterwards became emperor. But
   others of unsound principles, who preferred the riches and honor of
   this world to the true felicity, sacrificed without hesitation. Of
   these was Ecebolius, a sophist [521] of Constantinople who,
   accommodating himself to the dispositions of the emperors, pretended in
   the reign of Constantius to be an ardent Christian; while in Julian's
   time he appeared an equally vigorous pagan: and after Julian's death,
   he again made a profession of Christianity. For he prostrated himself
   before the church doors, and called out, Trample on me, for I am as
   salt that has lost its savor.' Of so fickle and inconstant a character
   was this person, throughout the whole period of his history. About this
   time the emperor wishing to make reprisals on the Persians, for the
   frequent incursions they had made on the Roman territories in the reign
   of Constantius, marched with great expedition through Asia into the
   East. But as he well knew what a train of calamities attend a war, and
   what immense resources are needful to carry it on successfully and that
   without it cannot be carried on, he craftily devised a plan for
   collecting money by extorting it from the Christians. On all those who
   refused to sacrifice he imposed a heavy fine, which was exacted with
   great rigor from such as were true Christians, every one being
   compelled to pay in proportion to what he possessed. By these unjust
   means the emperor soon amassed immense wealth; for this law was put in
   execution, both where Julian was personally present, and where he was
   not. The pagans at the same time assailed the Christians; and there was
   a great concourse of those who styled themselves philosophers.' They
   then proceeded to institute certain abominable mysteries; [522] and
   sacrificing pure children both male and female, they inspected their
   entrails, and even tasted their flesh. These infamous rites were
   practiced in other cities, but more particularly at Athens and
   Alexandria; in which latter place, a calumnious accusation was made
   against Athanasius the bishop, the emperor being assured that he was
   intent on desolating not that city only, but all Egypt, and that
   nothing but his expulsion out of the country could save it. The
   governor of Alexandria was therefore instructed by an imperial edict to
   apprehend him.

   Chapter XIV.--Flight of Athanasius.

   But he fled again, saying to his intimates, Let us retire for a little
   while, friends; it is but a small cloud which will soon pass away.' He
   then immediately embarked, and crossing the Nile, hastened with all
   speed into Egypt, closely pursued by those who sought to take him. When
   he understood that his pursuers were not far distant, his attendants
   were urging him to retreat once more into the desert, but he had
   recourse to an artifice and thus effected his escape. He persuaded
   those who accompanied him to turn back and meet his adversaries, which
   they did immediately; and on approaching them they were simply asked
   where they had seen Athanasius': to which they replied that he was not
   a great way off,' and, that if they hastened they would soon overtake
   him.' Being thus deluded, they started afresh in pursuit with quickened
   speed, but to no purpose; and Athanasius making good his retreat,
   returned secretly to Alexandria; and there he remained concealed until
   the persecution was at an end. Such were the perils which succeeded one
   another in the career of the bishop of Alexandria, these last from the
   heathen coming after that to which he was before subjected from
   Christians. In addition to these things, the governors of the provinces
   taking advantage of the emperor's superstition to feed their own
   cupidity, committed more grievous outrages on the Christians than their
   sovereign had given them a warrant for; sometimes exacting larger sums
   of money than they ought to have done, and at others inflicting on them
   corporal punishments. The emperor learning of these excesses, connived
   at them; and when the sufferers appealed to him against their
   oppressors, he tauntingly said, It is your duty to bear these
   afflictions patiently; for this is the command of your God.'

   Chapter XV.--Martyrs at Merum in Phrygia, under Julian.

   Amachius governor of Phrygia ordered that the temple at Merum, a city
   of that province, should be opened, and cleared of the filth which had
   accumulated there by lapse of time: also that the statues it contained
   should be polished fresh. This in being put into operation grieved the
   Christians very much. Now a certain Macedonius and Theodulus and
   Tatian, unable to endure the indignity thus put upon their religion,
   and impelled by a fervent zeal for virtue, rushed by night into the
   temple, and broke the images in pieces. The governor infuriated at what
   had been done, would have put to death many in that city who were
   altogether innocent, when the authors of the deed voluntarily
   surrendered themselves, choosing rather to die themselves in defense of
   the truth, than to see others put to death in their stead. The governor
   seized and ordered them to expiate the crime they had committed by
   sacrificing: on their refusal to do this, their judge menaced them with
   tortures; but they despising his threats, being endowed with great
   courage, declared their readiness to undergo any sufferings, rather
   than pollute themselves by sacrificing. After subjecting them to all
   possible tortures he at last laid them on gridirons under which a fire
   was placed, and thus slew them. But even in this last extremity they
   gave the most heroic proofs of fortitude, addressing the ruthless
   governor thus: If you wish to eat broiled flesh, Amachius, turn us on
   the other side also, lest we should appear but half cooked to your
   taste.' Thus these martyrs ended their life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XVI.--Of the Literary Labors of the Two Apollinares and the
   Emperor's Prohibition of Christians being instructed in Greek
   Literature.

   The imperial law [523] which forbade Christians to study Greek
   literature, rendered the two Apollinares of whom we have above spoken,
   much more distinguished than before. For both being skilled in polite
   learning, the father as a grammarian, and the son as a rhetorician,
   they made themselves serviceable to the Christians at this crisis. For
   the former, as a grammarian, composed a grammar consistent with the
   Christian faith: he also translated the Books of Moses into heroic
   verse; and paraphrased all the historical books of the Old Testament,
   putting them partly into dactylic measure, and partly reducing them to
   the form of dramatic tragedy. He purposely employed all kinds of verse,
   that no form of expression peculiar to the Greek language might be
   unknown or unheard of amongst Christians. The younger Apollinaris, who
   was well trained in eloquence, expounded the gospels and apostolic
   doctrines in the way of dialogue, as Plato among the Greeks had done.
   Thus showing themselves useful to the Christian cause they overcame the
   subtlety of the emperor through their own labors. But Divine Providence
   was more potent than either their labors, or the craft of the emperor:
   for not long afterwards, in the manner we shall hereafter explain,
   [524] the law became wholly inoperative; and the works of these men are
   now of no greater importance, than if they had never been written. But
   perhaps some one will vigorously reply saying: On what grounds do you
   affirm that both these things were effected by the providence of God?
   That the emperor's sudden death was very advantageous to Christianity
   is indeed evident: but surely the rejection of the Christian
   compositions of the two Apollinares, and the Christians beginning
   afresh to imbue their minds with the philosophy of the heathens, this
   works out no benefit to Christianity, for pagan philosophy teaches
   Polytheism, and is injurious to the promotion of true religion.' This
   objection I shall meet with such considerations as at present occur to
   me. Greek literature certainly was never recognized either by Christ or
   his Apostles as divinely inspired, nor on the other hand was it wholly
   rejected as pernicious. And this they did, I conceive, not
   inconsiderately. For there were many philosophers among the Greeks who
   were not far from the knowledge of God; and in fact these being
   disciplined by logical science, strenuously opposed the Epicureans and
   other contentious Sophists who denied Divine Providence, confuting
   their ignorance. And for these reasons they have become useful to all
   lovers of real piety: nevertheless they themselves were not acquainted
   with the Head of true religion, being ignorant of the mystery of Christ
   which had been hidden from generations and ages.' [525] And that this
   was so, the Apostle in his epistle to the Romans thus declares: [526]
   For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
   and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.
   Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has
   shown it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation
   of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
   made, even his eternal power and Godhead, that they may be without
   excuse; because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as
   God.' From these words it appears that they had the knowledge of truth,
   which God had manifested to them; but were guilty on this account, that
   when they knew God, they glorified him not as God. Wherefore by not
   forbidding the study of the learned works of the Greeks, they left it
   to the discretion of those who wished to do so. This is our first
   argument in defense of the position we took: another may be thus put:
   The divinely inspired Scriptures undoubtedly inculcate doctrines that
   are both admirable in themselves, and heavenly in their character: they
   also eminently tend to produce piety and integrity of life in those who
   are guided by their precepts, pointing out a walk of faith which is
   highly approved of God. But they do not instruct us in the art of
   reasoning, by means of which we may be enabled successfully to resist
   those who oppose the truth. Besides adversaries are most easily foiled,
   when we can use their own weapons against them. But this power was not
   supplied to Christians by the writings of the Apollinares. Julian had
   this in mind when he by law prohibited Christians from being educated
   in Greek literature, for he knew very well that the fables it contains
   would expose the whole pagan system, of which he had become the
   champion to ridicule and contempt. Even Socrates, the most celebrated
   of their philosophers, despised these absurdities, and was condemned on
   account of it, as if he had attempted to violate the sanctity of their
   deities. Moreover, both Christ and his Apostle enjoin us to become
   discriminating money-changers,' [527] so that we might prove all
   things, and hold fast that which is good': [528] directing us also to
   beware lest any one should spoil us through philosophy and vain
   deceit.' [529] But this we cannot do, unless we possess ourselves of
   the weapons of our adversaries: taking care that in making this
   acquisition we do not adopt their sentiments, but testing them, reject
   the evil, but retain all that is good and true: for good wherever it is
   found, is a property of truth. Should any one imagine that in making
   these assertions we wrest the Scriptures from their legitimate
   construction, let it be remembered that the Apostle not only does not
   forbid our being instructed in Greek learning, but that he himself
   seems by no means to have neglected it, inasmuch as he knows many of
   the sayings of the Greeks. Whence did he get the saying, The Cretans
   are always liars, evil beasts, slow-bellies,' [530] but from a perusal
   of The Oracles of Epimenides, [531] the Cretan Initiator? Or how would
   he have known this, For we are also his offspring,' [532] had he not
   been acquainted with The Phenomena of Aratus [533] the astronomer?
   Again this sentence, Evil communications corrupt good manners,' [534]
   is a sufficient proof that he was conversant with the tragedies of
   Euripides. [535] But what need is there of enlarging on this point? It
   is well known that in ancient times the doctors of the church by
   unhindered usage were accustomed to exercise themselves in the learning
   of the Greeks, until they had reached an advanced age: this they did
   with a view to improve themselves in eloquence and to strengthen and
   polish their mind, and at the same time to enable them to refute the
   errors of the heathen. Let these remarks be sufficient in the subject
   suggested by the two Apollinares.

   Chapter XVII.--The Emperor preparing an Expedition against the
   Persians, arrives at Antioch, and being ridiculed by the Inhabitants,
   he retorts on them by a Satirical Publication entitled Misopogon, or
   the Beard-Hater.'

   The emperor having extorted immense sums of money from the Christians,
   hastening his expedition against the Persians, arrived at Antioch in
   Syria. There, desiring to show the citizens how much he affected glory,
   he unduly depressed the prices of commodities; neither taking into
   account the circumstances of that time, nor reflecting how much the
   presence of an army inconveniences the population of the provinces, and
   of necessity lessens the supply of provisions to the cities. The
   merchants and retailers [536] therefore left off trading, being unable
   to sustain the losses which the imperial edict entailed upon them;
   consequently the necessaries failed. The Antiochians not bearing the
   insult,--for they are a people naturally impatient with
   insult,--instantly broke forth into invectives against Julian;
   caricaturing his beard also, which was a very long one, and saying that
   it ought to be cut off and manufactured into ropes. They added that the
   bull which was impressed upon his coin, was a symbol of his having
   desolated the world. For the emperor, being excessively superstitious,
   was continually sacrificing bulls [537] on the altars of his idols; and
   had ordered the impression of a bull and altar to be made on his coin.
   Irritated by these scoffs, he threatened to punish the city of Antioch,
   and returned to Tarsus in Cilicia, giving orders that preparations
   should be made for his speedy departure thence. Whence Libanius the
   sophist took occasion to compose two orations, one addressed to the
   emperor in behalf of the Antiochians, the other to the inhabitants of
   Antioch on the emperor's displeasure. It is however affirmed that these
   compositions were merely written, and never recited in public. Julian
   abandoning his former purpose of revenging himself on his satirists by
   injurious deeds, expended his wrath in reciprocating their abusive
   taunts; for he wrote a pamphlet against them which he entitled
   Antiochicus, or Misopogon, thus leaving an indelible stigma upon that
   city and its inhabitants. But we must now speak of the evils which he
   brought upon the Christians at Antioch.

   Chapter XVIII.--The Emperor consulting an Oracle, the Demon gives no
   Response, being awed by the Nearness of Babylas the Martyr.

   Having ordered that the pagan temples at Antioch should be opened, he
   was very eager to obtain an oracle from Apollo of Daphne. But the demon
   that inhabited the temple remained silent through fear of his neighbor,
   Babylas [538] the martyr; for the coffin which contained the body of
   that saint was close by. When the emperor was informed of this
   circumstance, he commanded that the coffin should be immediately
   removed: upon which the Christians of Antioch, including women and
   children, transported the coffin from Daphne to the city, with solemn
   rejoicings and chanting of psalms. The psalms [539] were such as cast
   reproach on the gods of the heathen, and those who put confidence in
   them and their images.

   Chapter XIX.--Wrath of the Emperor, and Firmness of Theodore the
   Confessor.

   Then indeed the emperor's real temper and disposition, which he had
   hitherto kept as much as possible from observation, became fully
   manifested: for he who had boasted so much of his philosophy, was no
   longer able to restrain himself; but being goaded almost to madness by
   these reproachful hymns, he was ready to inflict the same cruelties on
   the Christians, with which Diocletian's agents had formerly visited
   them. Since, however, his solicitude about the Persian expedition
   afforded him no leisure for personally executing his wishes, he
   commanded Sallust the Prætorian Prefect to seize those who had been
   most conspicuous for their zeal in psalm-singing, in order to make
   examples of them. The prefect, though a pagan, was far from being
   pleased with his commission; but since he durst not contravene it, he
   caused several of the Christians to be apprehended, and some of them to
   be imprisoned. One young man named Theodore, whom the heathens brought
   before him, he subjected to a variety of tortures, causing his person
   to be so lacerated and only released him from further punishment when
   he thought that he could not possibly outlive the torments: yet God
   preserved this sufferer, so that he long survived that confession.
   Rufinus, the author of the Ecclesiastical History written in Latin,
   states that he himself conversed with the same Theodore a considerable
   time afterwards: and enquired of him whether in the process of
   scourging and racking he had not felt the most intense pains; his
   answer was, that he felt the pain of the tortures to which he was
   subjected for a very short time; and that a young man stood by him who
   both wiped off the sweat which was produced by the acuteness of the
   ordeal through which he was passing, and at the same time strengthened
   his mind, so that he rendered this time of trial a season of rapture
   rather than of suffering. Let this suffice concerning the most
   wonderful Theodore. About this time Persian ambassadors came to the
   emperor, requesting him to terminate the war on certain express
   conditions. But Julian abruptly dismissed them, saying, You shall very
   shortly see me in person, so that there will be no need of an embassy.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XX.--The Jews instigated by the Emperor attempt to rebuild
   their Temple, and are frustrated in their Attempt by Miraculous
   Interposition.

   The emperor in another attempt to molest the Christians exposed his
   superstition. Being fond of sacrificing, he not only himself delighted
   in the blood of victims, but considered it an indignity offered to him,
   if others did not do likewise. And as he found but few persons of this
   stamp, he sent for the Jews and enquired of them why they abstained
   from sacrificing, since the law of Moses enjoined it? On their replying
   that it was not permitted them to do this in any other place than
   Jerusalem, he immediately ordered them to rebuild Solomon's temple.
   Meanwhile he himself proceeded on his expedition against the Persians.
   The Jews who had been long desirous of obtaining a favorable
   opportunity for rearing their temple afresh in order that they might
   therein offer sacrifice, applied themselves very vigorously to the
   work. Moreover, they conducted themselves with great insolence toward
   the Christians, and threatened to do them as much mischief, as they had
   themselves suffered from the Romans. The emperor having ordered that
   the expenses of this structure should be defrayed out of the public
   treasury, all things were soon provided, such as timber and stone,
   burnt brick, clay, lime, and all other materials necessary for
   building. On this occasion Cyril bishop of Jerusalem, called to mind
   the prophecy of Daniel, which Christ also in the holy gospels has
   confirmed, and predicted in the presence of many persons, that the time
   had indeed come in which one stone should not be left upon another in
   that temple,' but that the Saviour's prophetic declaration [540] should
   have its full accomplishment. Such were the bishop's words: and on the
   night following, a mighty earthquake tore up the stones of the old
   foundations of the temple and dispersed them all together with the
   adjacent edifices. Terror consequently possessed the Jews on account of
   the event; and the report of it brought many to the spot who resided at
   a great distance: when therefore a vast multitude was assembled,
   another prodigy took place. Fire came down from heaven and consumed all
   the builders' tools: so that the flames were seen preying upon mallets,
   irons to smooth and polish stones, saws, hatchets, adzes, in short all
   the various implements which the workmen had procured as necessary for
   the undertaking; and the fire continued burning among these for a whole
   day. The Jews indeed were in the greatest possible alarm, and
   unwillingly confessed Christ, calling him God: yet they did not do his
   will; but influenced by inveterate prepossessions they still clung to
   Judaism. Even a third miracle which afterwards happened failed to lead
   them to a belief of the truth. For the next night luminous impressions
   of a cross appeared imprinted on their garments, which at daybreak they
   in vain attempted to rub or wash out. They were therefore blinded' as
   the apostle says, [541] and cast away the good which they had in their
   hands: and thus was the temple, instead of being rebuilt, at that time
   wholly overthrown.

   Chapter XXI.--The Emperor's Invasion of Persia, and Death.

   The emperor meanwhile invaded the country of the Persians a little
   before spring, having learnt that the races of Persia were greatly
   enfeebled and totally spiritless in winter. For from their inability to
   endure cold, they abstain from military service at that season, and it
   has become a proverb that a Mede will not then draw his hand from
   underneath his cloak.' And well knowing that the Romans were inured to
   brave all the rigors of the atmosphere he let them loose on the
   country. After devastating a considerable tract of country, including
   numerous villages and fortresses, they next assailed the cities; and
   having invested the great city Ctesiphon, he reduced the king of the
   Persians to such straits that the latter sent repeated embassies to the
   emperor, offering to surrender a portion of his dominions, on condition
   of his quitting the country, and putting an end to the war. But Julian
   was unaffected by these submissions, and showed no compassion to a
   suppliant foe: nor did he think of the adage, To conquer is honorable,
   but to be more than conqueror gives occasion for envy.' Giving credit
   to the divinations of the philosopher Maximus, with whom he was in
   continual intercourse, he was deluded into the belief that his exploits
   would not only equal, but exceed those of Alexander of Macedon; so that
   he spurned with contempt the entreaties of the Persian monarch. He even
   supposed in accordance with the teachings of Pythagoras and Plato on
   the transmigration of souls,' [542] that he was possessed of
   Alexander's soul, or rather that he himself was Alexander in another
   body. This ridiculous fancy deluded and caused him to reject the
   negotiations for peace proposed by the king of the Persians. Wherefore
   the latter convinced of the uselessness of them was constrained to
   prepare for conflict, and therefore on the next day after the rejection
   of his embassy, he drew out in order of battle all the forces he had.
   The Romans indeed censured their prince, for not avoiding an engagement
   when he might have done so with advantage: nevertheless they attacked
   those who opposed them, and again put the enemy to flight. The emperor
   was present on horseback, and encouraged his soldiers in battle; but
   confiding simply in his hope of success, he wore no armor. In this
   defenceless state, a dart cast by some one unknown, pierced through his
   arm and entered his side, making a wound. In consequence of this wound
   he died. Some say that a certain Persian hurled the javelin, and then
   fled; others assert that one of his own men was the author of the deed,
   which indeed is the best corroborated and most current report. But
   Callistus, one of his body-guards, who celebrated this emperor's deeds
   in heroic verse, says in narrating the particulars of this war, that
   the wound of which he died was inflicted by a demon. This is possibly a
   mere poetical fiction, or perhaps it was really the fact; for vengeful
   furies have undoubtedly destroyed many persons. Be the case however as
   it may, this is certain, that the ardor of his natural temperament
   rendered him incautious, his learning made him vain, and his
   affectation of clemency exposed him to contempt. Thus Julian ended his
   life in Persia, [543] as we have said, in his fourth consulate, [544]
   which he bore with Sallust his colleague. This event occurred on the
   26th of June, in the third year of his reign, and the seventh from his
   having been created Cæsar by Constantius, he being at that time in the
   thirty-first year of his age.

   Chapter XXII.--Jovian is proclaimed Emperor.

   The soldiery being thrown into extreme perplexity by an event so
   unexpected, and without delay, on the following day proclaimed Jovian
   emperor, a person alike distinguished for his courage and birth. He was
   a military tribune when Julian put forth an edict giving his officers
   the option of either sacrificing or resigning their rank in the army,
   and chose rather to lay down his commission, [545] than to obey the
   mandate of an impious prince. Julian, however, being pressed by the
   urgency of the war which was before him, retained him among his
   generals. On being saluted emperor, he positively declined to accept
   the sovereign power: and when the soldiers brought him forward by
   force, he declared that being a Christian, he did not wish to reign
   over a people who chose to adopt paganism as their religion.' They all
   then with one voice answered that they also were Christians: upon which
   he accepted the imperial dignity. Perceiving himself suddenly left in
   very difficult circumstances, in the midst of the Persian territory,
   where his army was in danger of perishing for want of necessaries, he
   agreed to terminate the war, even on terms by no means honorable to the
   glory of the Roman name, but rendered necessary by the exigencies of
   the crisis. Submitting therefore to the loss of the government of
   Syria, [546] and giving up also Nisibis, a city of Mesopotamia, he
   withdrew from their territories. The announcement of these things gave
   fresh hope to the Christians; while the pagans vehemently bewailed
   Julian's death. Nevertheless the whole army reprobated his intemperate
   heat, and ascribed to his rashness in listening to the wily reports of
   a Persian deserter, the humiliation of ceding the territories lost: for
   being imposed upon by the statements of this fugitive, he was induced
   to burn the ships which supplied them with provisions by water, by
   which means they were exposed to all the horrors of famine. Then also
   Libanius composed a funeral oration on him, which he designated
   Julianus, or Epitaph, wherein he celebrates with lofty encomiums almost
   all his actions; but in referring to the books which Julian wrote
   against the Christians, he says that he has therein clearly
   demonstrated the ridiculous and trifling character of their sacred
   books. Had this sophist contented himself with extolling the emperor's
   other acts, I should have quietly proceeded with the course of my
   history; but since this famous rhetorician has thought proper to take
   occasion to inveigh against the Scriptures of the Christian faith, we
   also propose to pause a little and in a brief review consider his
   words.

   Chapter XXIII.--Refutation of what Libanius the Sophist said concerning
   Julian.

   When the winter,' says he, [547] had lengthened the nights, the emperor
   made an attack on those books which made the man of Palestine both God,
   and the Son of God: and by a long series of arguments having proved
   that these writings, which are so much revered by Christians, are
   ridiculous and unfounded, he has evinced himself wiser and more
   skillful than the Tyrian [548] old man. But may this Tyrian sage be
   propitious to me, and mildly bear with what has been affirmed, seeing
   that he has been excelled by his son!' Such is the language of Libanius
   the Sophist. But I confess, indeed, that he was an excellent
   rhetorician, but am persuaded that had he not coincided with the
   emperor in religious sentiment, he would not only have given expression
   to all that has been said against him by Christians, but would have
   magnified every ground of censure as naturally becomes a rhetorician.
   For while Constantius was alive he wrote encomiums upon him; but after
   his death he brought the most insulting and reproachful charges against
   him. So that if Porphyry had been emperor, Libanius would certainly
   have preferred his books to Julian's: and had Julian been a mere
   sophist, he would have termed him a very indifferent one, as he does
   Ecebolius in his Epitaph upon Julian. Since then he has spoken in the
   spirit of a pagan, a sophist, and the friend of him whom he lauded, we
   shall endeavor to meet what he has advanced, as far as we are able. In
   the first place he says that the emperor undertook to attack' these
   books during the long winter nights. Now to attack' means to make the
   writing of a confutation of them a task, as the sophists commonly do in
   teaching the rudiments of their art; for he had perused these books
   long before, but attacked them at this time. But throughout the long
   contest into which he entered, instead of attempting to disprove
   anything by sound reasoning, as Libanius asserts, in the absence of
   truth he had recourse to sneers and contemptuous jests, of which he was
   excessively fond; and thus he sought to hold up to derision what is too
   firmly established to be overthrown. For every one who enters into
   controversy with another, sometimes trying to pervert the truth, and at
   others to conceal it, falsifies by every possible means the position of
   his antagonist. And an adversary is not satisfied with doing malignant
   acts against one with whom he is at variance, but will speak against
   him also, and charge upon the object of his dislike the very faults he
   is conscious of in himself. That both Julian and Porphyry, whom
   Libanius calls the Tyrian old man,' took great delight in scoffing, is
   evident from their own works. For Porphyry in his History of the
   Philosophers has treated with ridicule the life of Socrates, the most
   eminent of all the philosophers, making such remarks on him as neither
   Melitus, nor Anytus, his accusers, would have dared to utter; of
   Socrates, I say, who was admired by all the Greeks for his modesty,
   justice, and other virtues; whom Plato, [549] the most admirable among
   them, Xenophon, and the rest of the philosophic band, not only honor as
   one beloved of God, but also are accustomed to think of as having been
   endowed with superhuman intelligence. And Julian, imitating his
   father,' displayed a like morbidness of mind in his book, entitled The
   Cæsars, wherein he traduces all his imperial predecessors, not sparing
   even Mark the philosopher. [550] Their own writings therefore show that
   they both took pleasure in taunts and reviling; and I have no need of
   profuse and clever expressions to do this; but what has been said is
   enough concerning their mood in this respect. Now I write these things,
   using the oration of each as witnesses respecting their dispositions,
   but of Julian in particular, what Gregory of Nazianzus [551] says in
   his Second Oration against the Pagans is in the following terms:

   These things were made evident to others by experience, after the
   possession of imperial authority had left him free to follow the bent
   of his inclinations: but I had foreseen it all, from the time I became
   acquainted with him at Athens. Thither he came, by permission of the
   emperor, soon after the change in his brother's fortune. His motive for
   this visit was twofold: one reason was honorable to him, viz. to see
   Greece, and attend the schools there; the other was a more secret one,
   which few knew anything about, for his impiety had not yet presumed to
   openly avow itself, viz. to have opportunity of consulting the
   sacrificers and other impostors respecting his own destiny. I well
   remember that even then I was no bad diviner concerning this person,
   although I by no means pretend to be one of those skilled in the art of
   divination: but the fickleness of his disposition, and the incredible
   extravagancy of his mind, rendered me prophetic; if indeed he is the
   "best prophet who conjectures correctly" [552] events. For it seemed to
   me that no good was portended by a neck seldom steady, the frequent
   shrugging of shoulders, an eye scowling and always in motion, together
   with a frenzied aspect; a gait irregular and tottering, a nose
   breathing only contempt and insult, with ridiculous contortions of
   countenance expressive of the same thing; immoderate and very loud
   laughter, nods as it were of assent, and drawings back of the head as
   if in denial, without any visible cause; speech with hesitancy and
   interrupted by his breathing; disorderly and senseless questions,
   answers no better, all jumbled together without the least consistency
   or method. Why need I enter into minute particulars? Such I foresaw he
   would be beforehand as I found him afterwards from experience. And if
   any of those who were then present and heard me, were now here, they
   would readily testify that when I observed these prognostics I
   exclaimed, "Ah! how great a mischief to itself is the Roman empire
   fostering!" And that when I had uttered these words I prayed God that I
   might be a false prophet. For it would have been far better [that I
   should have been convicted of having formed an erroneous judgment],
   than that the world should be filled with so many calamities, and that
   such a monster should have appeared as never before had been seen:
   although many deluges and conflagrations are recorded, many earthquakes
   and chasms, and descriptions are given of many ferocious and inhuman
   men, as well as prodigies of the brute creation, compounded of
   different races, of which nature produced unusual forms. His end has
   indeed been such as corresponds with the madness of his career.'

   This is the sketch which Gregory has given us of Julian. Moreover, that
   in their various compilations they have endeavored to do violence to
   the truth, sometimes by the corruption of passages of sacred Scripture,
   at others by either adding to the express words, and putting such a
   construction upon them as suited their own purpose, many have
   demonstrated, by confuting their cavils, and exposing their fallacies.
   Origen in particular, who lived long before Julian's time, by himself
   raising objections to such passages of Holy Scripture [553] as seemed
   to disturb some readers, and then fully meeting them, has shut out the
   invidious clamors of the thoughtless. And had Julian and Porphyry given
   his writings a candid and serious perusal, they would have discoursed
   on other topics, and not have turned to the framing of blasphemous
   sophisms. It is also very obvious that the emperor in his discourses
   was intent on beguiling the ignorant, and did not address himself to
   those who possess the form' of the truth as it is presented in the
   sacred Scriptures. For having grouped together various expressions in
   which God is spoken of dispensationally, and more according to the
   manner of men, he thus comments on them. [554] Every one of these
   expressions is full of blasphemy against God, unless the phrase
   contains some occult and mysterious sense, which indeed I can suppose.'
   This is the exact language he uses in his third book against the
   Christians. But in his treatise On the Cynic Philosophy, where he shows
   to what extent fables may be invented on religious subjects, he says
   that in such matters the truth must be veiled: For,' to quote his very
   words, [555] Nature loves concealment; and the hidden substance of the
   gods cannot endure being cast into polluted ears in naked words.' From
   which it is manifest that the emperor entertained this notion
   concerning the divine Scriptures, that they are mystical discourses,
   containing in them some abstruse meaning. He is also very indignant
   because all men do not form the same opinion of them; and inveighs
   against those Christians who understand the sacred oracles in a more
   literal sense. But it ill became him to rail so vehemently against the
   simplicity of the vulgar, and on their account to behave so arrogantly
   towards the sacred Scriptures: nor was he warranted in turning with
   aversion from those things which others rightly apprehended, because
   forsooth they understood them otherwise than he desired they should.
   But now as it seems a similar cause of disgust seems to have operated
   upon him to that which affected Porphyry, who having been beaten by
   some Christians at Cæsarea in Palestine and not being able to endure
   [such treatment], from the working of unrestrained rage renounced the
   Christian religion: and from hatred of those who had beaten him he took
   to write blasphemous works against Christians, as Eusebius Pamphilus
   has proved who at the same time refuted his writings. So the emperor
   having uttered disdainful expressions against the Christians in the
   presence of an unthinking multitude, through the same morbid condition
   of mind fell into Porphyry's blasphemies. Since therefore they both
   willfully broke forth into impiety, they are punished by the
   consciousness of their guilt. But when Libanius the Sophist says [556]
   in derision, that the Christians make a man of Palestine both God and
   the Son of God,' he appears to have forgotten that he himself has
   deified Julian at the close of his oration. For they almost killed,'
   says he, the first messenger of his death, as if he had lied against a
   god.' And a little afterwards he adds, O thou cherished one of the
   gods! thou disciple of the gods! thou associate [557] with the gods!'
   Now although Libanius may have meant otherwise, yet inasmuch as he did
   not avoid the ambiguity of a word which is sometimes taken in a bad
   sense, he seems to have said the same things as the Christians had done
   reproachfully. If then it was his intention to praise him, he ought to
   have avoided equivocal terms; as he did on another occasion, when being
   criticised he avoided a certain word, cutting it out of his works.
   Moreover, that man in Christ was united to the Godhead, so that while
   he was apparently but man, he was the invisible God, and that both
   these things are most true, the divine books of Christians distinctly
   teach. But the heathen before they believe, cannot understand: for it
   is a divine oracle that declares [558] Unless ye believe, assuredly ye
   shall not understand.' Wherefore they are not ashamed to place many men
   among the number of their gods: and would that they had done this, at
   least to the good, just, and sober, instead of the impure, unjust, and
   those addicted to drunkenness, like the Hercules, the Bacchus, and the
   Æsculapius, by whom Libanius does not blush to swear frequently in his
   orations. And were I to attempt to enumerate the unnatural debaucheries
   and infamous adulteries of these, the digression would be lengthened
   beyond measure: but for those who desire to be informed on the subject,
   Aristotle's Peplum, Dionysius' Corona, Rheginus' Polymnemon, and the
   whole host of poets will be enough to show that the pagan theology is a
   tissue of extravagant absurdities. We might indeed show by a variety of
   instances that the practice of deifying human beings was far from
   uncommon among the heathen, nay, that they did so without the slightest
   hesitation: let a few examples suffice. The Rhodians having consulted
   an oracle on some public calamity, a response was given directing them
   to pay their adoration to Atys, a pagan priest who instituted frantic
   rites in Phrygia. The oracle was thus expressed:

   Atys propitiate, the great god, the chaste Adonis, the blessed
   fair-haired Dionysius rich in gifts.'

   Here Atys, who from an amatory mania had castrated himself, is by the
   oracle designated as Adonis and Bacchus.

   Again, when Alexander, king of the Macedonians, passed over into Asia,
   the Amphictyons courted his favor, and the Pythoness uttered this
   oracle:

   To Zeus supreme among the gods, and Athene Tritogenia pay homage, and
   to the king divine concealed in mortal form, him Zeus begat in honor to
   be the protector and dispenser of justice among mortals, Alexander the
   king.'

   These are the words of the demon at Delphi, who when he wished to
   flatter potentates, did not scruple to assign them a place among the
   gods. The motive here was perhaps to conciliate by adulation: but what
   could one say of the case of Cleomedes the pugilist, whom they ranked
   among the gods in this oracle?

   The last of the heroes is Cleomedes, the Astypalian. Him honor with
   sacrifices; for he is no longer a mortal.'

   Because of this oracle Diogenes the cynic, and Oënomaus the
   philosopher, strongly condemned Apollo. The inhabitants of Cyzicus
   declared Hadrian to be the thirteenth god; and Adrian himself deified
   his own catamite Antinoüs. [559] Libanius does not term these
   ridiculous and contemptible absurdities,' although he was familiar with
   these oracles, as well as with the work of Adrias on the life of
   Alexander [560] (the pseudo-prophet of Paphlagonia): nor does he
   himself hesitate to dignify Porphyry in a similar manner, when after
   having preferred Julian's books to his, he says, May the Syrian be
   propitious to me.' This digression will suffice to repel the scoffs of
   the sophist, without following him farther in what he has advanced; for
   to enter into a complete refutation would require an express work. We
   shall therefore proceed with our history.

   Chapter XXIV.--The Bishops flock around Jovian, each attempting to draw
   him to his own Creed.

   Jovian having returned from Persia, ecclesiastical commotions were
   again renewed: for those who presided over the churches endeavored to
   anticipate each other, in the hope that the emperor would attach
   himself to their own tenets. He however had from the beginning adhered
   to the homoousian faith, and openly declared that he preferred this to
   all others. Moreover, he wrote letters to and encouraged Athanasius
   bishop of Alexandria, who immediately after Julian's death had
   recovered the Alexandrian church, and at that time gaining confidence
   from the letters [spoken of] put away all fear. The emperor further
   recalled from exile all those prelates whom Constantius had banished,
   and who had not been re-established by Julian. Moreover, the pagan
   temples were again shut up, and they secreted themselves wherever they
   were able. The philosophers also laid aside their palliums, and clothed
   themselves in ordinary attire. That public pollution by the blood of
   victims, which had been profusely lavished even to disgust in the reign
   of Julian, was now likewise taken away.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXV.--The Macedonians and Acacians meet at Antioch, and
   proclaim their Assent to the Nicene Creed.

   Meanwhile the state of the church was by no means tranquil; for the
   heads of the sects assiduously paid their court to the emperor their
   king that protection for themselves meant also power against their
   acknowledged opponents. And first the Macedonians presented a petition
   to him, in which they begged that all those who asserted the Son to be
   unlike the Father, might be expelled from the churches, and themselves
   allowed to take their place. This supplication was presented by Basil
   bishop of Ancyra, Silvanus of Tarsus, Sophronius of Pompeiopolis,
   Pasinicus of Zelæ, [561] Leontius of Comana, Callicrates of
   Claudiopolis, and Theophilus of Castabala. The emperor having perused
   it, dismissed them without any other answer than this: I abominate
   contentiousness; but I love and honor those who exert themselves to
   promote unanimity.' When this remark became generally known, it subdued
   the violence of those who were desirous of altercation and thus was
   realized in the design of the emperor. At this time the real spirit of
   the Acacian sect, and their readiness to accommodate their opinions to
   those invested with supreme authority, became more conspicuous than
   ever. For assembling themselves at Antioch in Syria, they entered into
   a conference with Melitius, who had separated from them a little
   before, and embraced the homoousian' opinion. This they did because
   they saw Melitius was in high estimation with the emperor, who then
   resided at Antioch; and assenting therefore by common consent, they
   drew up a declaration of their sentiments acknowledging the homoousion
   and ratifying the Nicene Creed and presented it to the emperor. It was
   expressed in the following terms.

   The Synod of bishops convened at Antioch out of various provinces, to
   the most pious and beloved of God, our lord Jovian Victor Augustus.

   That your piety has above all things aimed at establishing the peace
   and harmony of the church, we ourselves, most devout emperor, are fully
   aware. Nor are we insensible that you have wisely judged an
   acknowledgment of the orthodox faith to be the sum and substance of
   this unity. Wherefore lest we should be included in the number of those
   who adulterate the doctrine of the truth, we hereby declare to your
   piety that we embrace and steadfastly hold the faith of the holy Synod
   formerly convened at Nicæa. Especially since the term homoousios, which
   to some seems novel [562] and inappropriate, has been judiciously
   explained by the fathers to denote that the Son was begotten of the
   Father's substance, and that he is like the Father as to substance. Not
   indeed that any passion is to be understood in relation to that
   ineffable generation. Nor is the term ousia, "substance," taken by the
   fathers in any usual signification of it among the Greeks; but it has
   been employed for the subversion of what Arius impiously dared to
   assert concerning Christ, viz.--that he was made of things "not
   existing." Which heresy the Anomoeans, who have lately sprung up, still
   more audaciously maintain, to the utter destruction of ecclesiastical
   unity. We have therefore annexed to this our declaration, a copy of the
   faith set forth by the bishops assembled at Nicæa, with which also we
   are fully satisfied. It is this: "We believe in one God the Father
   Almighty," and all the rest of the Creed in full. We, the undersigned,
   in presenting this statement, most cordially assent to its contents.
   Melitius bishop of Antioch, Eusebius of Samosata, Evagrius of Sicily,
   Uranius of Apamæa, Zoilus of Larissa, Acacius of Cæsarea, Antipater of
   Rhosus, Abramius of Urimi, [563] Aristonicus of Seleucia-upon-Belus,
   Barlamenus of Pergamus, Uranius of Melitina, Magnus of Chalcedon,
   Eutychius of Eleutheropolis, Isacocis of Armenia Major, Titus of
   Bostra, Peter of Sippi, [564] Pelagius of Laodicæa, Arabian of Antros,
   Piso of Adana through Lamydrion a presbyter, Sabinian bishop of Zeugma,
   Athanasius of Ancyra through Orphitus and Aëtius presbyters, Irenion
   bishop of Gaza, Piso of Augusta, Patricius of Paltus through Lamyrion a
   presbyter, Anatolius bishop of Beroea, Theotimus of the Arabs, and
   Lucian of Arca.' [565]

   This declaration we found recorded in that work of Sabinus, entitled A
   Collection of the Acts of Synods. Now the emperor had resolved to allay
   if possible the contentious spirit of the parties at variance, by bland
   manners and persuasive language toward them all; declaring that he
   would not molest any one on account of his religious sentiments, and
   that he should love and highly esteem such as would zealously promote
   the unity of the church.' The philosopher Themistius attests that such
   was his conduct, in the oration he composed on his consulate.' For he
   extols the emperor for his overcoming the wiles of flatterers by freely
   permitting every one to worship God according to the dictates of his
   conscience. And in allusion to the check which the sycophants received,
   he facetiously observes [566] that experience has made it evident that
   such persons worship the purple and not God; and resemble the changeful
   Euripus, [567] which sometimes rolls its waves in one direction, and at
   others the very opposite way.'

   Chapter XXVI.--Death of the Emperor Jovian.

   Thus did the emperor repress at that time the impetuosity of those who
   were disposed to cavil: and immediately departing from Antioch, he went
   to Tarsus in Cilicia, where he duly performed the funeral obsequies of
   Julian, after which he was declared consul. Proceeding thence directly
   to Constantinople, he arrived at a place named Dadastana, situated on
   the frontiers of Galatia and Bithynia. There Themistius the
   philosopher, with others of the senatorial order, met him, and
   pronounced the consular oration before him, which he afterwards recited
   before the people at Constantinople. And indeed the Roman empire, blest
   with so excellent a sovereign, would doubtless have flourished
   exceedingly, as it is likely that both the civil and ecclesiastical
   departments would have been happily administered, had not his sudden
   death bereft the state of so eminent a personage. For disease caused by
   some obstruction, having attacked him at the place above mentioned
   during the winter season, he died there on the 17th day of February, in
   his own and his son Varronian's consulate, [568] in the thirty-third
   year of his age, after having reigned seven months.

   This book contains an account of the events which took place in the
   space of two years and five months.

   Book IV.

   Chapter I.--After Jovian's Death, Valentinian is proclaimed Emperor,
   and takes his Brother Valens as Colleague in the Empire; Valentinian
   holds the Orthodox Faith, but Valens is an Arian.

   The Emperor Jovian having died, as we have said, at Dadastana, in his
   own consulate and that of Varronian his son on the 17th of February,
   the army leaving Galatia arrived at Nicæa in Bithynia in seven days'
   march, and there unanimously proclaimed Valentinian emperor, on the
   25th of February, in the same consulate. He was a Pannonian by race, a
   native of the city of Cibalis, and being entrusted with a military
   command, had displayed great skill in tactics. He was moreover endowed
   with such greatness of mind, that he always appeared superior to any
   degree of honor he might have attained. As soon as they had created him
   emperor, he proceeded forthwith to Constantinople; and thirty days
   after his own possession of the imperial dignity, he made his brother
   Valens his colleague in the empire. They both professed Christianity,
   but did not hold the same Christian creed: for Valentinian respected
   the Nicene Creed; but Valens was prepossessed in favor of the Arian
   opinions. And this prejudice was caused by his having been baptized by
   Eudoxius bishop of Constantinople. Each of them was zealous for the
   views of his own party; but when they had attained sovereign power,
   they manifested very different dispositions. For previously in the
   reign of Julian, when Valentinian was a military tribune, and Valens
   held a command in the emperor's guards, they both proved their zeal for
   the faith; for being constrained to sacrifice, they chose rather to
   give up their military rank than to do so and renounce Christianity.
   [569] Julian, however, knowing the necessity of the men to the state,
   retained them in their respective places, as did also Jovian, his
   successor in the empire. Later on, being invested with imperial
   authority, they were in accord in the management of public affairs, but
   as regards Christianity, as I have said, they behaved themselves very
   differently: for Valentinian while he favored those who agreed with him
   in sentiment, offered no violence to the Arians; but Valens, in his
   anxiety to promote the Arian cause, grievously disturbed those who
   differed from them, as the course of our history will show. Now at that
   time Liberius presided over the Roman church; and at Alexandria
   Athanasius was bishop of the Homoousians, while Lucius had been
   constituted George's successor by the Arians. At Antioch Euzoïus was at
   the head of the Arians: but the Homoousians were divided into two
   parties, of one of which Paulinus was chief, and Melitius of the other.
   Cyril was again constituted over the church at Jerusalem. The churches
   at Constantinople were under the government of Eudoxius, who openly
   taught the dogmas of Arianism, but the Homoousians had but one small
   edifice in the city wherein to hold their assemblies. Those of the
   Macedonian heresy who had dissented from the Acacians at Seleucia, then
   retained their churches in every city. Such was the state of
   ecclesiastical affairs at that time. [570]

   Chapter II.--Valentinian goes into the West; Valens remains at
   Constantinople, and grants the Request of the Macedonians to hold a
   Synod, but persecutes the Adherents of the Homoousion.'

   Of the emperors one, i.e. Valentinian, speedily went to the western
   parts of the empire; for the exigencies of affairs required his
   presence thither: meanwhile Valens, residing at Constantinople, was
   addressed by most of the prelates of the Macedonion heresy, requesting
   that another Synod might be convened for the correction of the creed.
   The emperor supposing they agreed in sentiment with Eudoxius and
   Acacius, gave them permission to do so: they therefore made
   preparations for assembling in the city of Lampsacus. But Valens
   proceeded with the utmost despatch toward Antioch in Syria, fearing
   lest the Persians should violate the treaty into which they had entered
   for thirty years in the reign of Jovian, and invade the Roman
   territories. They however remained quiet; and Valens employed this
   season of external tranquillity to prosecute a war of extermination
   against all who acknowledged the homoousion. Paulinus their bishop,
   because of his eminent piety, he left unmolested. Melitius he punished
   with exile: and all the rest, as many as refused to communicate with
   Euzoïus, he drove out from the churches in Antioch, and subjected to
   various losses and punishments. It is even affirmed that he caused many
   to be drowned in the river Orontes, which flows by that city.

   East, a Usurper arises at Constantinople named Procopius: and at the
   Same Time an Earthquake and Inundation take Place and injure Several
   Cities.

   While Valens was thus occupied in Syria, there arose a usurper at
   Constantinople named Procopius; who having collected a large body of
   troops in a very short time, meditated an expedition against the
   emperor. This intelligence created extreme solicitude in the emperor's
   mind and checked for a while the persecution he had commenced against
   all who dared to differ from him in opinion. And while the commotions
   of a civil war were painfully anticipated, an earthquake occurred which
   did much damage to many cities. The sea also changed its accustomed
   boundaries, and overflowed to such an extent in some places, that
   vessels might sail where roads had previously existed; and it retired
   so much from other places, that the ground became dry. These events
   happened in the first consulate of the two emperors. [571]

   Chapter IV.--The Macedonians hold a Synod at Lampsacus, during a Period
   of Both Secular and Ecclesiastical Agitation; and after confirming the
   Antiochian Creed, and anathematizing that promulgated at Ariminum, they
   again ratify the Deposition of Acacius and Eudoxius.

   While these events were taking place there could be no peace either in
   the church or in the state. Now those who had been empowered by the
   emperor to hold a council assembled at Lampsacus in the consulate just
   mentioned: this was seven years after the council of Seleucia. There,
   after confirming the Antiochian Creed, to which they had subscribed at
   Seleucia, [572] they anathematized that which had been set forth at
   Ariminum [573] by their former associates in opinion. They moreover
   again condemned the party of Acacius and Eudoxius, and declared their
   deposition to have been just. [574] The civil war which was then
   impending prevented Eudoxius bishop of Constantinople from either
   gainsaying or revenging these determinations. Wherefore Eleusius bishop
   of Cyzicus and his adherents became for a little while the stronger
   party; inasmuch as they supported the views of Macedonius, which
   although before but obscurely known, acquired great publicity through
   the Synod at Lampsacus. This Synod, I think, was the cause of the
   increase of the Macedonians in the Hellespont; for Lampsacus is
   situated in one of the narrow bays of the Hellespont. Such was the
   issue of this council.

   Chapter V.--Engagement between Valens and Procopius near Nacolia in
   Phrygia; after which the Usurper is betrayed by his Chief Officers, and
   with them put to Death.

   Under the consulate [575] of Gratian and Dagalaïfus in the following
   year, the war was begun. For as soon as the usurper Procopius, leaving
   Constantinople, began his march at the head of his army toward the
   emperor, Valens hastened from Antioch, and came to an engagement with
   him near a city of Phrygia, called Nacolia. In the first encounter he
   was defeated; but soon after he took Procopius alive, through the
   treachery of Agilo and Gomarius, two of his generals, whom he subjected
   to the most extraordinary punishments. [576] The traitors he caused to
   be executed by being sawn asunder, disregarding the oaths he had sworn
   to them. Two trees standing near each other being forcibly bowed down,
   one of the usurper's legs was fastened to each of them, after which the
   trees being suddenly permitted to recover their erect position, by
   their rise rent the tyrant into two parts; and thus torn apart the
   usurper perished.

   [576] Ammianus Marcellinus, Rerum Gestarum, XXVI. ix. 8-10, says that

   Procopius bound to Valens, and that Procopius was immediately beheaded,
   and Florentius and Barchalba soon underwent the same punishment.
   Philostorgius also (IX.) relates that Procopius was beheaded, and that
   Florentius, who delivered him to Valens, was burnt.

   Chapter VI.--After the Death of Procopius Valens constrains those who
   composed the Synod, and All Christians, to profess Arianism.

   The emperor having thus successfully terminated the conflict,
   immediately began to move against the Christians, with the design of
   converting every sect to Arianism. But he was especially incensed
   against those who had composed the Synod at Lampsacus, not only on
   account of their deposition of the Arian bishops, but because they had
   anathematized the creed published at Ariminum. On arriving therefore at
   Nicomedia in Bithynia, he sent for Eleusius bishop of Cyzicus, who, as
   I have before said, [577] closely adhered to the opinions of
   Macedonius. Therefore the emperor having convened a council of Arian
   bishops, commanded Eleusius to give his assent to their faith. At first
   he refused to do so, but on being terrified with threats of banishment
   and confiscation of property, he was intimidated and assented to the
   Arian belief. Immediately afterwards, however, he repented; and
   returning to Cyzicus, bitterly complained in presence of all the
   people, asserting that his quiescence was due to violence, and not of
   his own choice. He then exhorted them to seek another bishop for
   themselves, since he had been compelled to renounce his own opinion.
   But the inhabitants of Cyzicus loved and venerated him too much to
   think of losing him; they therefore refused to be subject to any other
   bishop, nor would they permit him to retire from his own church: and
   thus continuing under his oversight, they remained steadfast in their
   own heresy.

   Chapter VII.--Eunomius supersedes Eleusius the Macedonian in the See of
   Cyzicus, His Origin and Imitation of Aëtius, whose Amanuensis he had
   been.

   The bishop of Constantinople being informed of these circumstances,
   constituted Eunomius bishop of Cyzicus, inasmuch as he was a person
   able by his eloquence to win over the minds of the multitude to his own
   way of thinking. On his arrival at Cyzicus an imperial edict was
   published in which it was ordered that Eleusius should be ejected, and
   Eunomius installed in his place. This being carried into effect, those
   who attached themselves to Eleusius, after erecting a sacred edifice
   without the city, assembled there with him. But enough has been said of
   Eleusius: let us now give some account of Eunomius. He had been
   secretary to Aëtius, surnamed Atheus, of whom we have before spoken,
   [578] and had learnt from conversing with him, to imitate his
   sophistical mode of reasoning; being little aware that while exercising
   himself in framing fallacious arguments, and in the use of certain
   insignificant terms, he was really deceiving himself. This habit
   however inflated him with pride, and he fell into blasphemous heresies,
   and so became an advocate of the dogmas of Arius, and in various ways
   an adversary to the doctrines of truth. And as he had but a very
   slender knowledge of the letter of Scripture, he was wholly unable to
   enter into the spirit of it. Yet he abounded in words, and was
   accustomed to repeat the same thoughts in different terms, without ever
   arriving at a clear explanation of what he had proposed to himself. Of
   this his seven books On the Apostle's Epistle to the Romans, on which
   he bestowed a quantity of vain labor, is a remarkable proof: for
   although he has employed an immense number of words in the attempt to
   expound it, he has by no means succeeded in apprehending the scope and
   object of that epistle. All other works of his extant are of a similar
   character, in which he that would take the trouble to examine them,
   would find a great scarcity of sense, amidst a profusion of verbiage.
   This Eunomius Eudoxius promoted to the see of Cyzicus; [579] who being
   come thither, astonished his auditors by the extraordinary display of
   his dialectic' art, and thus a great sensation was produced at Cyzicus.
   At length the people unable to endure any longer the empty and
   assumptions parade of his language, drove him out of their city. He
   therefore withdrew to Constantinople, and taking up his abode with
   Eudoxius, was regarded as a titular [580] bishop. But lest we should
   seem to have said these things for the sake of detraction, let us hear
   what Eunomius himself has the hardihood to utter in his sophistical
   discourses concerning the Deity himself, for he uses the following
   language: God knows no more of his own substance than we do; nor is
   this more known to him, and less to us: but whatever we know about the
   Divine substance, that precisely is known to God; and on the other
   hand, whatever he knows, the same also you will find without any
   difference in us.' This and many other similar tedious and absurd
   fallacies Eunomius was accustomed to draw up in utter insensibility to
   his own folly. On what account he afterwards separated from the Arians,
   we shall state in its proper place. [581]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [578] II. 35, end.

   [579] Sozom. VI. 8, gives the same account; but Philostorgius (V. 3)
   and Theodoret (H. E. II. 37 and 39) say that Eunomius was made bishop
   of Cyzicus under the Emperor Constantius immediately after the Synod of
   Seleucia. He was banished by Valens because he favored the usurper
   Procopius.

   Byzantine Periods) as suspended. It appears, however, that among the
   civil and military officers in the Roman system there were some who
   bore the title without being concerned in the management of their
   offices, and that these were termed vacantes and therefore that
   Socrates is using the Greek equivalent of a Latin term and applying it
   in ecclesiastical matters as its original was applied in civil and
   military affairs. Cf., on the position of bishops without churches
   Bingham, Christ. Antiq. IV. ii. 14. This system of clerics without
   charges was abused so much that the Council of Chalcedon (Canon 6)
   forbade further ordination sine titulo.

   Chapter VIII.--Of the Oracle found inscribed an a Stone, when the Walls
   of Chalcedon were demolished by Order of the Emperor Valens.

   An order was issued by the emperor that the walls of Chalcedon, a city
   opposite to Byzantium, should be demolished: for he had sworn to do
   this, after he should have conquered the usurper, because the
   Chalcedonians had sided with the usurper, and had used insulting
   language toward Valens, [582] and shut their gates against him as he
   passed by their city. In consequence of the imperial decree, therefore,
   the walls were razed and the stones were conveyed to Constantinople to
   serve for the formation of the public baths which are called
   Constantianæ. [583] On one of these stones an oracle was found
   engraven, which had lain concealed for a long time, in which it was
   predicted that when the city should be supplied with abundance of
   water, then should the wall serve for a bath; and that innumerable
   hordes of barbarous nations having overrun the provinces of the Roman
   empire, and done a great deal of mischief, should themselves at length
   be destroyed. We shall here insert this oracle for the gratification of
   the studious: [584]

   When nymphs their mystic dance with wat'ry feet

   Shall tread through proud Byzantium's stately street;

   When rage the city wall shall overthrow,

   Whose stones to fence a bathing-place shall go:

   Then savage lands shall send forth myriad swarms,

   Adorned with golden locks aud burnished arms,

   That having Ister's silver streams o'erpast,

   Shall Scythian fields and Moesia's meadows waste.

   But when with conquest flushed they enter Thrace,

   Fate shall assign them there a burial-place.'

   Such was the prophecy. And indeed it afterwards happened, that when
   Valens by building an aqueduct supplied Constantinople with abundance
   of water, the barbarous nations made various irruptions, as we shall
   hereafter see. But it happened that some explained the prediction
   otherwise. For when that aqueduct was completed, Clearchus the prefect
   of the city built a stately bath, to which the name of the Plentiful
   Water' [585] was given, in that which is now called the Forum of
   Theodosius: on which account the people celebrated a festival with
   great rejoicings, whereby there was, say they, an accomplishment of
   those words of the oracle,

   their mystic dance with wat'ry feet

   Shall tread through proud Byzantium's stately street.'

   But the completion of the prophecy took place afterwards. While the
   demolition was in progress the Constantinopolitans besought the emperor
   to suspend the destruction of the walls; and the inhabitants of
   Nicomedia and Nicæa sending from Bithynia to Constantinople, made the
   same request. But the emperor being exceedingly exasperated against the
   Chalcedonians, was with difficulty prevailed upon to listen to these
   petitions in their favor: but that he might perform his oath, he
   commanded that the walls should be pulled down, while at the same time
   the breaches should be repaired by being filled up with other small
   stones. Whence it is that in the present day one may see in certain
   parts of the wall very inferior materials laid upon prodigiously large
   stones, forming those unsightly patches which were made on that
   occasion. So much will be sufficient on the walls of Chalcedon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [582] Ammianus Marcellinus (Rerum Gestarum XXVI. viii. 2 seq.) says,
   From the walls of Chalcedon they uttered reproaches to him and
   insultingly reviled him as Sabaiarius. For, sabaia is a poor drink made
   of wheat or barley in Illyricum (whence Valens came).' On the Pannonian
   or Illyrian origin of Valens, see IV. I. It appears also that the
   Pannonians were accustomed to live on poor diet in general.

   [583] Sozom. VIII. 21, mentions these baths. Am. Marcellinus (Rerum.
   Gestarum, XXXI. I. 4) relates that Valens built a bath out of the
   stones of the walls of Chalcedon. So also Themist. Orat. Decen. ad
   Valentem, and Gregory Nazianzen, Orat. 25; the latter calls it a
   subterraneous and aerial river.' Zonaras and Cedrenus, however, affirm
   that the structure built was not a bath, but an aqueduct. Cf. Cedrenus,
   I. 543 (p. 310, B).

   Chapter IX.--Valens persecutes the Novatians, because they accepted the
   Orthodox Faith.

   The emperor however did not cease his persecution of those who embraced
   the doctrine of the homoousion, but drove them away from
   Constantinople: and as the Novatians acknowledged the same faith, they
   also were subjected to similar treatment. He commanded that their
   churches should be shut up, also their bishop they sent into exile. His
   name was Agelius, a person that had presided over their churches from
   the time of Constantine, and had led an apostolic life: for he always
   walked barefoot, and used but one coat, observing the injunction of the
   gospel. [586] But the emperor's displeasure against this sect was
   moderated by the efforts of a pious and eloquent man named Marcian, who
   had formerly been in military service at the imperial palace, but was
   at that time a presbyter in the Novatian church, and taught Anastasia
   and Carosa, the emperor's daughters, grammar; from the former of whom
   the public baths yet standing, which Valens erected at Constantinople,
   were named. [587] From respect for this person therefore the Novatian
   churches which had been for some time closed, were again opened. The
   Arians however would not suffer this people to remain undisturbed, for
   they disliked them on account of the sympathy and love the Novatians
   manifested toward the Homoousians, with whom they agreed in sentiment.
   Such was the state of affairs at that time. We may here remark that the
   war against the usurper Procopius was terminated about the end of May,
   in the consulate [588] of Gratian and Dagalaïfus.

   [586] Matt. x. 10.

   [587] Am. Marcellinus (Rerum Gestarum, XXVI. 4. 14), in speaking of
   Procopius, the usurper, says: Procopius...resorted to the Anastasian
   baths, named from the sister of Constantine'; from which it appears
   that either (1) there were two baths of the same name, or (2) the baths
   here alluded to were named after Constantine's sister and renamed on
   the occasion of their being repaired or altered, or (3) that Socrates
   is in error. From the improbabilities connected with (1) and (2) we may
   infer that (3) is the right view.

   Chapter X.--Birth of Valentinian the Younger.

   Soon after the conclusion of this war, and under the same consulate,
   [589] a son was born to Valentinian, the emperor in the Western parts,
   to whom the same name as his father's was given. For Gratian had been
   born previously to his becoming emperor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [589] Sozomen (VI. 10) says the same. There were two Valentinians in
   the second generation; one a son of Valens, and another the son of
   Valentinian the Elder. According to Idatius' Fasti, it was the former
   that was born during the consulate of Gratian and Dagalaifus; so that
   Socrates was in error here, confusing perhaps the two younger
   Valentinians. Valesius adduces other reasons proving the same, which it
   is unnecessary to repeat here.

   Chapter XI.--Hail of Extraordinary Size; and Earthquakes in Bithynia
   and the Hellespont.

   On the 2d of June of the following year, in the consulate [590] of
   Lupicin and Jovian, there fell at Constantinople hail of such a size as
   would fill a man's hand. Many affirmed that this hail had fallen as a
   consequence of the Divine displeasure, because of the emperor's having
   banished several persons engaged in the sacred ministry, those, that is
   to say, who refused to communicate with Eudoxius. [591] During the same
   consulate, on the 24th of August, the emperor Valentinian proclaimed
   his son Gratian Augustus. In the next year, [592] when Valentinian and
   Valens were a second time consuls, there happened on the 11th of
   October, an earthquake in Bithynia which destroyed the city of Nicæa on
   the eleventh day of October. This was about twelve years after
   Nicomedia had been visited by a similar catastrophe. Soon afterwards
   the largest portion of Germa in the Hellespont was reduced to ruins by
   another earthquake. Nevertheless no impression was made on the mind of
   either Eudoxius the Arian bishop, or the emperor Valens, by these
   occurrences; for they did not desist from their relentless persecution
   of those who dissented from them in matters of faith. Meanwhile these
   convulsions of the earth were regarded as typical of the disturbances
   which agitated the churches: for many of the clerical body were sent
   into exile, as we have stated; Basil and Gregory alone, by a special
   dispensation of Divine Providence, being on account of their eminent
   piety exempted from this punishment. The former of these individuals
   was bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia; while Gregory presided over
   Nazianzus, [593] a little city in the vicinity of Cæsarea. But we shall
   have occasion to mention both Basil and Gregory again in the course of
   our history. [594]

   [592] 368 a.d.

   [593] If Socrates means to speak with precision here of the offices
   occupied by these men during the year which his narrative has reached
   he is mistaken, for Basil became bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia the
   year following, and Gregory was made bishop, not of Nazianzus at this
   time, but of Sisima. He did not, however, enter on the duties of this
   bishopric as he says in his letters.

   Chapter XII.--The Macedonians, pressed by the Emperor's Violence toward
   them, send a Deputation to Liberius Bishop of Rome, and subscribe the
   Nicene Creed.

   When the maintainers of the homoousian' doctrine had been thus severely
   dealt with, and put to flight, the persecutors began afresh to harass
   the Macedonians; who impelled by fear rather than violence, send
   deputations to one another from city to city, declaring the necessity
   of appealing to the emperor's brother, and also to Liberius bishop of
   Rome: and that it was far better for them to embrace their faith, than
   to communicate with the party of Eudoxius. They sent for this purpose
   Eustathius bishop of Sebastia, who had been several times deposed,
   Silvanus of Tarsus in Cilicia, and Theophilus of Castabala in the same
   province; charging them to dissent in nothing from Liberius concerning
   the faith, but to enter into communion with the Roman church, and
   confirm the doctrine of the homoousian. These persons therefore
   proceeded to Old Rome, carrying with them the letters of those who had
   separated themselves from Acacius at Seleucia. To the emperor they
   could not have access, he being occupied in the Gauls with a war
   against the Sarmatæ; but they presented their letters to Liberius. He
   at first refused to admit them; saying they were of the Arian faction,
   and could not possibly be received into communion by the church,
   inasmuch as they had rejected the Nicene Creed. To this they replied
   that by change of sentiment they had acknowledged the truth, having
   long since renounced the Anomoean [595] Creed, and avowed the Son to be
   in every way like the Father': moreover that they considered the terms
   like' (homoios) and homoousios to have precisely the same import. When
   they had made this statement, Liberius demanded of them a written
   confession of their faith; and they accordingly presented him a
   document in which the substance of the Nicene Creed was inserted. I
   have not introduced here, because of their length, the letters from
   Smyrna, Asia, and from Pisidia, Isauria, Pamphylia, and Lycia, in all
   which places they had held Synods. The written profession which the
   deputies sent with Eustathius, delivered to Liberius, is as follows:

   To our Lord, Brother, and fellow-Minister Liberius: Eustathius,
   Theophilus, and Silvanus, salutations in the Lord.

   On account of the insane opinion of heretics, who cease not to
   introduce occasions of offense into the catholic churches, we being
   desirous of checking their career, come forward to express our
   approbation of the doctrines recognized the Synod of orthodox bishops
   which has been convened at Lampsacus, Smyrna, and various other places:
   from which Synod we being constituted a deputation, bring a letter to
   your benignity and to all the Italian and Western bishops, by which we
   declare that we hold and maintain the catholic faith which was
   established in the holy council at Nicæa under the reign of Constantine
   of blessed memory, by three hundred and eighteen bishops, and has
   hitherto continued entire and unshaken; in which creed the term
   homoousios is holily and devoutly employed in opposition to the
   pernicious doctrine of Arius. We therefore, together with the aforesaid
   persons whom we represent, profess under our own hand, that we have
   held, do hold, and will maintain the same faith even unto the end. We
   condemn Arius, and his impious doctrine, with his disciples, and those
   who agree with his sentiments; as also the same heresy of Sabellius,
   [596] the Patripassians, [597] the Marcionites, [598] the Photinians,
   [599] the Marcellians, [600] that of Paul of Samosata, [601] and those
   who countenance such tenets; in short all the heresies which are
   opposed to the aforesaid sacred creed, which was piously and in a
   catholic spirit set forth by the holy fathers at Nicæa. But we
   especially anathematize that form of the creed which was recited at the
   Synod of Ariminum, [602] as altogether contrary to the before-mentioned
   creed of the holy Synod of Nicæa, to which the bishops at
   Constantinople affixed their signatures, being deceived by artifice and
   perjury, by reason of its having been brought from Nice, [603] a town
   of Thrace. Our own creed, and that of those whose delegates we are, is
   this:

   "We believe in one God the Father Almighty, the Maker of all things
   visible and invisible: and in one only-begotten God, the Lord Jesus
   Christ, the Son of God; begotten of the Father; that is of the
   substance of the Father; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very
   God; begotten not made, of the same substance with the Father, through
   whom all things were made which are in heaven, and which are upon the
   earth: who for us men, and for our salvation, descended, became
   incarnate, and was made man; suffered, and rose again the third day;
   ascended into the heavens, and will come to judge the living and the
   dead. [We believe] also in the Holy Spirit. But the Catholic and
   Apostolic Church of God anathematizes those who assert that there was a
   time when he was not,' and that he was not before he was begotten,' and
   that he was made of things which are not'; or those that say the Son of
   God is of another hypostasis' or substance than the Father,' or that he
   is mutable, or susceptible of change.'

   "I, Eustathius, bishop of the city of Sebastia, with Theophilus and
   Silvanus, delegates of the Synod of Lampsacus, Smyrna, and other
   places, have voluntarily subscribed this confession of faith with our
   own hands. And if, after the publication of this creed, any one shall
   presume to calumniate either us, or those who sent us, let him come
   with the letters of your holiness before such orthodox bishops as your
   sanctity shall approve of, and bring the matter to an issue with us
   before them; and if any charge shall be substantiated, let the guilty
   be punished."'

   Liberius having securely pledged the delegates by this document,
   received them into communion, and afterwards dismissed them with this
   letter:

   The Letter of Liberius Bishop of Rome, to the Bishops of the
   Macedonians.

   To our beloved brethren and fellow-ministers, Evethius, Cyril,
   Hyperechius, Uranius, Heron, Elpidius, Maximus, Eusebius, Eucarpius,
   Heortasius, Neon, Eumathius, Faustinus, Proclinus, Pasinicus, Arsenius,

   Leontius, Philagrius, Lucius, and to all the orthodox bishops in the
   East, Liberius bishop of Italy, and the bishops throughout the West,
   salutations always in the Lord.

   Your letters, beloved brethren, resplendent with the light of faith,
   delivered to us by our highly esteemed brethren, the bishops
   Eustathius, Silvanus, and Theophilus, brought to us the much longed-for
   joy of peace and concord: and this chiefly because they have
   demonstrated and assured us that your opinion and sentiments are in
   perfect harmony with those both of our insignificance, and also with
   those of all the bishops in Italy and the Western parts. We knowledge
   this to be the Catholic and Apostolic faith, which until the time of
   the Synod at Nicæa had continued unadulterated and unshaken. This creed
   your legates have professed that they themselves hold, and to our great
   joy have obliterated every vestige and impression of an injurious
   suspicion, by attesting it not only in word, but also in writing. We
   have deemed it proper to subjoin to these letters a copy of this their
   declaration, lest we should leave any pretext to the heretics for
   entering into a fresh conspiracy, by which they might stir up the
   smouldering embers of their own malice, and according to their custom,
   rekindle the flames of discord. Moreover our most esteemed brethren,
   Eustathius, Silvanus, and Theophilus, have professed this also, both
   that they themselves, and also your love, have always held, and will
   maintain unto the last, the creed approved of at Nicæa by 318 Orthodox
   Bishops; which contains the perfect truth, and both confutes and
   overthrows the whole swarm of heretics. For it was not of their own
   will, but by Divine appointment that so great a number of bishops was
   collected against the madness of Arius, as equaled that of those by
   whose assistance blessed Abraham through faith destroyed so many
   thousand of his enemies. [604] This faith being comprehended in the
   terms hypostasis and homoousios, like a strong and impregnable fortress
   checks and repels all the assaults and vain machinations of Arian
   perverseness. Wherefore when all the Western bishops were assembled at
   Ariminum, whither the craft of the Arians had drawn them, in order that
   either by deceptive persuasions, or to speak more truly, by the
   coercion of the secular power, they might erase, or indirectly revoke
   what had been introduced into the creed with so much prudence, their
   subtlety was not of the least avail. For almost all those who at
   Ariminum were either allured into error, or at that time deceived, have
   since taken a right view of the matter; and after anathematizing the
   exposition of faith set forth by those who were convened at Ariminum,
   have subscribed the Catholic and Apostolic Creed which was promulgated
   at Nicæa. They have entered into communion with us, and regard the
   dogma of Arius and his disciples with increased aversion, and are even
   indignant against it. Of which fact when the legates of your love saw
   the indubitable evidences, they annexed yourselves to their own
   subscription; anathematizing Arius, and what was transacted at Ariminum
   against the creed ratified at Nicæa, to which even you yourselves,
   beguiled by perjury, were induced to subscribe. Whence it appeared
   suitable to us to write to your love, and to accede to your just
   request, especially since we are assured by the profession of your
   legates that the Eastern bishops have recovered their senses, and now
   concur in opinion with the orthodox of the West. We further give you to
   understand, lest ye should be ignorant of it, that the blasphemies of
   the Synod of Ariminum have been anathematized by those who seem to have
   been at that time deceived by fraud, and that all have acknowledged the
   Nicene Creed. It is fit therefore that it should be made generally
   known by you that such as have had their faith vitiated by violence or
   guile, may now emerge from heretical darkness into the Divine light of
   catholic liberty. Moreover whosoever of them, after this council, shall
   not disgorge the poison of corrupt doctrine, by abjuring all the
   blasphemies of Arius, and anathematizing them, let them know that they
   are themselves, together with Arius and his disciples and the rest of
   the serpents, whether Sabellians, Patripassians, or the followers of
   any other heresy, dissevered and excommunicated from the assemblies of
   the Church, which does not admit of illegitimate children. May God
   preserve you steadfast, beloved brethren.

   When the adherents of Eustathius had received this letter, they
   proceeded to Sicily, where they caused a Synod of Sicilian bishops to
   be convened, and in their presence avowed the homoousian faith, and
   professed their adherence to the Nicene Creed: then having received
   from them also a letter to the same effect as the preceding, they
   returned to those who had sent them. They on their part, on the receipt
   of the letters of Liberius, sent delegates from city to city to the
   prominent supporters of the doctrine of the homoousion, exhorting them
   to assemble simultaneously at Tarsus in Cilicia, in order to confirm
   the Nicene Creed, and terminate all the contentions which had
   subsequently arisen. And indeed this would probably have been
   accomplished had not the Arian bishop, Eudoxius, who at that time
   possessed great influence with the emperor, thwarted their purpose; for
   on learning of the Synod that had been summoned to meet [at Tarsus], he
   became so exasperated that he redoubled his persecution against them.
   That the Macedonians by sending legates to Liberius were admitted to
   communion with him, and professed the Nicene Creed, is attested by
   Sabinus himself, in his Collection of Synodical Transactions.

   Chapter XIII.--Eunomius separates from Eudoxius; a Disturbance is
   raised at Alexandria by Eudoxius, and Athanasius flees into Voluntary
   Exile again, but in Consequence of the Clamors of the People the
   Emperor recalls and re-establishes him in his See.

   About the same time Eunomius [605] separated himself from Eudoxius, and
   held assemblies apart, because after he had repeatedly entreated that
   his preceptor Aëtius might be received into communion, Eudoxius
   continued to oppose it. Now Eudoxius did this against his preference,
   for he did not reject the opinion with Aëtius since it was the same as
   his own; [606] but he yielded to the prevailing sentiment of his own
   party, who objected to Aëtius as heterodox. This was the cause of the
   division between Eunomius and Eudoxius, and such was the state of
   things at Constantinople. But the church at Alexandria was disturbed by
   an edict of the prætorian prefects, sent hither by means of Eudoxius.
   Whereupon Athanasius, dreading the irrational impetuosity of the
   multitude, and fearing lest he should be regarded as the author of the
   excesses that might be committed, concealed himself for four entire
   months in an ancestral tomb. Inasmuch however as the people, on account
   of their affection for him, became seditious in impatience of his
   absence, the emperor, on ascertaining that on this account agitation
   prevailed at Alexandria, ordered by his letters that Athanasius should
   be suffered to preside over the churches without molestation; and this
   was the reason why the Alexandrian church enjoyed tranquillity until
   the death of Athanasius. How the Arian faction became possessed of the
   churches after his decease, we shall unfold in the course of our
   history. [607]

   [605] Eunomius adopted the standpoint and also the views of Aëtius and
   gave them his own name. Briefly his fundamental principle was that the
   Son is absolutely unlike the Father in substance, and hence a creature
   among other creatures, a mere man.

   Chapter XIV.--The Arians ordain Demophilus after the Death of Eudoxius
   at Constantinople; but the Orthodox Party constitute Evagrius his
   Successor.

   The Emperor Valens leaving Constantinople again set out towards
   Antioch; but on his arrival at Nicomedia, a city of Bithynia, his
   progress was arrested by the following circumstances. Eudoxius the
   bishop of the Arian church who has been in possession of the seat of
   the Constantinopolitan church for nineteen [608] years, died soon after
   the emperor's departure from that city, in the third consulate [609] of
   Valentinian and Valens. The Arians therefore appointed Demophilus to
   succeed him; but the Homoousians considering that an opportunity was
   afforded them, elected a certain Evagrius, a person who maintained
   their own principles; and Eustathius, who had been bishop of Antioch,
   formally ordained him. He had been recalled from exile by Jovian, and
   had at this time privately come to Constantinople, for the purpose of
   confirming the adherents to the doctrine of the homoousion.

   Chapter XV.--The Emperor banishes Evagrius and Eustathius. The Arians
   persecute the Orthodox.

   When this had been accomplished the Arians renewed their persecution of
   the Homoousians: and the emperor was very soon informed of what had
   taken place, and apprehending the subversion of the city in consequence
   of some popular tumult, immediately sent troops from Nicomedia to
   Constantinople; ordering that both he who had been ordained, and the
   one who had ordained him, should be apprehended and sent into exile in
   different regions. Eustathius therefore was banished to Bizya a city of
   Thrace; and Evagrius was conveyed to another place. After this the
   Arians, becoming bolder, grievously harassed the orthodox party,
   frequently beating them, reviling them, causing them to be imprisoned,
   and fined; in short they practiced distressing and intolerable
   annoyances against them. The sufferers were induced to appeal to the
   emperor for protection against their adversaries if haply they might
   obtain some relief from this oppression. But whatever hope of redress
   they might have cherished from this quarter, was altogether frustrated,
   inasmuch as they thus merely spread their grievances before him who was
   the very author of them.

   Chapter XVI.--Certain Presbyters burnt in a Ship by Order of Valens.
   Famine in Phrygia.

   Certain pious men of the clerical order, eighty in number, among whom
   Urbanus, Theodore, and Menedemus were the leaders, proceeded to
   Nicomedia, and there presented to the emperor a supplicatory petition,
   informing him and complaining of the ill-usage to which they had been
   subjected. The emperor was filled with wrath; but dissembled his
   displeasure in their presence, and gave Modestus the prefect a secret
   order to apprehend these persons, and put them to death. The manner in
   which they were destroyed being unusual, deserves to be recorded. The
   prefect fearing that he should excite the populace to a seditious
   movement against himself, if he attempted the public execution of so
   many, pretended to send the men away into exile. Accordingly as they
   received the intelligence of their destiny with great firmness of mind
   the prefect ordered that they should be embarked as if to be conveyed
   to their several places of banishment, having meanwhile enjoined on the
   sailors to set the vessel on fire, as soon as they reached the mid sea,
   that their victims being so destroyed, might even be deprived of
   burial. This injunction was obeyed; for when they arrived at the middle
   of the Astacian Gulf, the crew set fire to the ship, and then took
   refuge in a small barque which followed them, and so escaped. Meanwhile
   it came to pass that a strong easterly wind blew, and the burning ship
   was roughly driven but moved faster and was preserved until it reached
   a port named Dacidizus, where it was utterly consumed together with the
   men who were shut up in it. Many have asserted that this impious deed
   was not suffered to go unpunished: for there immediately after arose so
   great a famine throughout all Phrygia, that a large proportion of the
   inhabitants were obliged to abandon their country for a time, and
   betake themselves some to Constantinople and some to other provinces.
   For Constantinople, notwithstanding the vast population it supplies,
   yet always abounds with the necessaries of life, all manner of
   provisions being imported into it by sea from various regions; and the
   Euxine which lies near it, furnishes it with wheat to any extent it may
   require. [610]

   Chapter XVII.--The Emperor Valens, while at Antioch, again persecutes
   the Adherents of the Homoousion.'

   The Emperor Valens, little affected by the calamities resulting from
   the famine, went to Antioch in Syria, and during his residence there
   cruelly persecuted such as would not embrace Arianism. For not content
   with ejecting out of almost all the churches of the East those who
   maintained the homoousian' opinion, he inflicted on them various
   punishments besides. He destroyed a greater number even than before,
   delivering them up to many different kinds of death, but especially
   drowning in the river.

   Chapter XVIII.--Events at Edessa: Constancy of the Devout Citizens, and
   Courage of a Pious Woman.

   But we must here mention certain circumstances that occurred at Edessa
   in Mesopotamia. There is in that city a magnificent church [611]
   dedicated to St. Thomas the Apostle, wherein, on account of the
   sanctity of the place, religious assemblies are incessantly held. The
   Emperor Valens wishing to inspect this edifice, and having learnt that
   all who usually congregated there were opposed to the heresy which he
   favored, he is said to have struck the prefect with his own hand,
   because he had neglected to expel them thence also. As the prefect
   after submitting to this ignominy, was most unwillingly constrained to
   subserve the emperor's indignation against them,--for he did not desire
   to effect the slaughter of so great a number of persons,--he privately
   suggested that no one should be found there. But no one gave heed
   either to his admonitions or to his menaces; for on the following day
   they all crowded to the church. [612] And when the prefect was going
   towards it with a large military force in order to satisfy the
   emperor's rage, a poor woman leading her own little child by the hand
   hurried hastily by, on her way to the church, breaking through the
   ranks of the prefect's company of soldiers. The prefect irritated at
   this, ordered her to be brought to him, and thus addressed her:
   Wretched woman! whither are you running in so disorderly a manner?' She
   replied, To the same place that others are hastening.' Have you not
   heard,' said he, that the prefect is about to put to death all that
   shall be found there?' Yes,' said the woman, and therefore I hasten
   that I may be found there.' And whither are you dragging that little
   child?' said the prefect: the woman answered, That he also may be made
   worthy of martyrdom.' [613] The prefect on hearing these things,
   conjecturing that a similar resolution actuated the others who were
   assembled there, immediately went back to the emperor, and informed him
   that all were ready to die in behalf of their own faith. He added that
   it would be preposterous to destroy so many persons at one time, and
   thus persuaded the emperor to control his wrath. In this way were the
   Edessenes preserved from being massacred by order of their sovereign.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [611] The kind of church here meant was a memorial structure to a
   martyr, erected where his relics were deposited, and was called
   Marturion . See Bingham, Christ. Antiq. VIII. 1.

   [612] The same church which above was called a marturion from its
   origin, is here called eukterios topos, from its use (a place of
   prayer').

   [613] Gibbon, in his Decline and Fall, chap. 16, quotes a number of
   extracts from Sulpicius Severus and Ignatius, showing the honor in
   which martyrdom was held in the early church, and the eagerness with
   which it was sought. To check the excess of zeal which was thus
   manifested, the Council of Elvira, in 306 a.d., passed a canon (its
   sixtieth) to the following intent: that if any one should overthrow
   idols, and should therefore be put to death, inasmuch as this is not
   written in the Gospel nor found done among the apostles at any time,
   such a one should not be received among the martyrs.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XIX.--Slaughter of Many Persons by Valens an Account of their
   Names, in Consequence of a Heathen Prediction. [614]

   The cruel disposition of the emperor was at this time abused by an
   execrable demon, who induced certain curious persons to institute an
   inquiry by means of necromancy as to who should succeed Valens on the
   throne. To their magical incantations the demon gave responses not
   distinct and unequivocal, but as the general practice is, full of
   ambiguity; for displaying the four letters q, e, o, and d, he declared
   that the name of the successor of Valens began with these; and that it
   was a compound name. When the emperor was apprised of this oracle,
   instead of committing to God, who alone can penetrate futurity, the
   decision of this matter, in contravention of those Christian principles
   to which he pretended the most zealous adherence, he put to death very
   many persons of whom he had the suspicion that they aimed at the
   sovereign power: thus such as were named Theodore,' Theodotus,'
   Theodosius,' Theodulus,' and the like, were sacrificed to the emperor's
   fears; and among the rest was Theodosiolus, a very brave man, descended
   from a noble family in Spain. Many persons therefore, to avoid the
   danger to which they were exposed, changed their names, giving up those
   which they had received from their parents in infancy as dangerous.
   This will be enough on that subject.

   Chapter XX.--Death of Athanasius, and Elevation of Peter to His See.
   [615]

   It must be said that as long as Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, was
   alive, the emperor, restrained by the Providence of God, abstained from
   molesting Alexandria and Egypt: indeed he knew very well that the
   multitude of those who were attached to Athanasius was very great; and
   on that account he was careful lest the public affairs should be
   hazarded, by the Alexandrians, who are an irritable race, being excited
   to sedition. But Athanasius, after being engaged in so many and such
   severe conflicts on behalf of the church, departed this life in the
   second consulate [616] of Gratian and Probus, having governed that
   church amidst the greatest perils forty-six years. He left as his
   successor Peter, a devout and eloquent man.

   Chapter XXI.--The Arians are allowed by the Emperor to imprison Peter
   and to set Lucius over the See of Alexandria.

   Upon this the Arians, emboldened by their knowledge of the emperor's
   religious sentiments, again took courage, and without delay informed
   him of the circumstance. He was then residing at Antioch. Then indeed
   Euzoïus who presided over the Arians of that city, eagerly embracing
   the favorable opportunity thus presented, begged permission to go to
   Alexandria, for the purpose of putting Lucius the Arian in possession
   of the churches there. The emperor acceded to this request, and as
   speedily as possible Euzoïus proceeded forthwith to Alexandria,
   attended by the imperial troops. Magnus, also, the emperor's treasurer,
   went with him. Moreover an imperial mandate had been issued to
   Palladius, the governor of Egypt, enjoining him to aid them with a
   military force. Wherefore having apprehended Peter, they cast him into
   prison; and after dispersing the rest of the clergy, they placed Lucius
   in the episcopal chair.

   Chapter XXII.--Silence of Sabinus on the Misdeeds of the Arians; Flight
   of Peter to Rome; Massacre of the Solitaries at the Instigation of the
   Arians.

   Of the outrages perpetrated upon the installation of Lucius, and the
   treatment of those who were ejected, both in the courts and outside of
   the courts, and how some were subjected to a variety of tortures, and
   others sent into exile even after this excruciating process, Sabinus
   takes not the slightest notice. In fact, being half disposed to
   Arianism himself, he purposely veils the atrocities of his friends.
   Peter, however, has exposed them, in the letters he addressed to all
   the churches, when he had escaped from prison. For this [bishop] having
   managed to escape from prison, fled to Damasus, bishop of Rome. The
   Arians though not very numerous, becoming thus possessed of the
   Alexandrian churches soon after obtained an imperial edict directing
   the governor of Egypt to expel not only from Alexandria but even out of
   the country, the favorers of the homoousian' doctrine, and all such as
   were obnoxious to Lucius. After this they assailed and disturbed and
   terribly harassed the monastic institutions in the desert; armed men
   rushed in the most ferocious manner upon those who were utterly
   defenceless, and who would not lift an arm to repel their violence: so
   that numbers of unresisting victims were in this manner slaughtered
   with a degree of wanton cruelty beyond description.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXIII.--The Deeds of Some Holy Persons who devoted themselves
   to a Solitary Life. [617]

   Since I have referred to the monasteries of Egypt, it may be proper
   here to give a brief account of them. They were founded probably at a
   very early period, but were greatly enlarged and augmented by a devout
   man whose name was Ammoun. In his youth this person had an aversion to
   matrimony; but when some of his relatives urged him not to contemn
   marriage, but to take a wife to himself, he was prevailed upon and was
   married. On leading the bride with the customary ceremonies from the
   banquet-room to the nuptial couch, after their mutual friends had
   withdrawn, he took a book [618] containing the epistles of the apostles
   and read to his wife Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians, explaining to
   her the apostle's admonitions to married persons. [619] Adducing many
   external considerations besides, he descanted on the inconveniences and
   discomforts attending matrimonial intercourse, the pangs of
   child-bearing, and the trouble and anxiety connected with rearing a
   family. He contrasted with all this the advantages of chastity;
   described the liberty, and immaculate purity of a life of continence;
   and affirmed that virginity places persons in the nearest relation to
   the Deity. By these and other arguments of a similar kind, he persuaded
   his virgin bride to renounce with him a secular life, prior to their
   having any conjugal knowledge of each other. Having taken this
   resolution, they retired together to the mountain of Nitria, and in a
   hut there inhabited for a short time one common ascetic apartment,
   without regarding their difference of sex, being according to the
   apostles, one in Christ.' [620] But not long after, the recent and
   unpolluted bride thus addressed Ammoun: It is unsuitable,' said she,
   for you who practice chastity, to look upon a woman in so confined a
   dwelling; let us therefore, if it is agreeable to you, perform our
   exercise apart.' This agreement again was satisfactory to both, and so
   they separated, and spent the rest of their lives in abstinence from
   wine and oil, eating dry bread alone, sometimes passing over one day,
   at others fasting two, and sometimes more. Athanasius, bishop of
   Alexandria, asserts in his Life of Anthony, [621] that the subject of
   his memoir who was contemporary with this Ammoun, saw his soul taken up
   by angels after his decease. Accordingly, a great number of persons
   emulated Ammoun's manner of life, so that by degrees the mountains of
   Nitria and Scitis were filled with monks, an account of whose lives
   would require an express work. As, however, there were among them
   persons of eminent piety, distinguished for their strict discipline and
   apostolic lives, who said and did many things worthy of being recorded,
   I deem it useful to interweave with my history a few particulars
   selected out of the great number for the information of my readers. It
   is said that Ammoun never saw himself naked, being accustomed to say
   that it became not a monk to see even his own person exposed.' And when
   once he wanted to pass a river, but was unwilling to undress, he
   besought God to enable him to cross without his being obliged to break
   his resolution; and immediately an angel transported him to the other
   side of the river. Another monk named Didymus [622] lived entirely
   alone to the day of his death, although he had reached the age of
   ninety years. Arsenius, another of them, would not separate young
   delinquents from communion, but only those that were advanced in age:
   for,' said he, when a young person is excommunicated he becomes
   hardened; but an elderly one is soon sensible of the misery of
   excommunication.' Pior was accustomed to take his food as he walked
   along. As a certain one asked him, Why do you eat thus?' That I may not
   seem,' said he, to make eating serious business but rather a thing done
   by the way.' To another putting the same question he replied, Lest even
   in eating my mind should be sensible of corporeal enjoyment.' Isidore
   affirmed that he had not been conscious of sin even in thought for
   forty years; and that he had never consented either to lust or anger.
   Pambos being an illiterate man went to some one for the purpose of
   being taught a psalm; and having heard the first verse of the
   thirty-eighth psalm, I said I will take heed to my ways, that I offend
   not with my tongue,' [623] he departed without staying to hear the
   second verse, saying, this one will suffice, if I can practically
   acquire it.' And when the person who had given him the verse reproved
   him because he had not seen him for the space of six months, he
   answered that he had not yet learnt to practice the verse of the psalm.
   After a considerable lapse of time, being asked by one of his friends
   whether he had made himself master of the verse, his answer was, I have
   scarcely succeeded in accomplishing it during nineteen years.' A
   certain individual having placed gold in his hands for distribution to
   the poor, requested him to reckon what he had given him. There is no
   need of counting,' said he, but of integrity of mind.' This same
   Pambos, at the desire of Athanasius the bishop, came out of the desert
   to Alexandria and on beholding an actress there, he wept. When those
   present asked him why he wept, he replied, Two causes have affected me:
   one is the destruction of this woman; the other is that I exert myself
   less to please my God than she does to please obscene characters.'
   Another said that a monk who did not work ought to be regarded as on a
   level with the covetous man.' Piterus was well-informed in many
   branches of natural philosophy, and was accustomed frequently to enter
   into expositions of the principles sometimes of one and sometimes of
   another department of science, but he always commenced his expositions
   with prayer. There were also among the monks of that period, two of the
   same name, of great sanctity, each being called Macarius; one of whom
   was from Upper Egypt, the other from the city of Alexandria. Both were
   celebrated for their ascetic discipline, the purity of their life and
   conversation, and the miracles which were wrought by their hands. The
   Egyptian Macarius performed so many cures, and cast out so many devils,
   that it would require a distinct treatise to record all that the grace
   of God enabled him to do. His manner toward those who resorted to him
   was austere, yet at the same time calculated to inspire veneration. The
   Alexandrian Macarius, while in all respects resembling his Egyptian
   namesake, differed from him in this, that he was always cheerful to his
   visitors; and by the affability of his manners led many young men to
   asceticism. Evagrius [624] became a disciple of these men, acquired
   from them the philosophy of deeds, whereas he had previously known that
   which consisted in words only. He was ordained deacon at Constantinople
   by Gregory of Nazianzus, and afterwards went with him into Egypt, where
   he became acquainted with these eminent persons, and emulated their
   course of conduct, and miracles were done by his hands as numerous and
   important as those of his preceptors. Books were also composed by him
   of very valuable nature, one of which is entitled The Monk, or, On
   Active Virtue; another The Gnostic, [625] or, To him who is deemed
   worthy of Knowledge: this book is divided into fifty chapters. A third
   is designated Antirrheticus, and contains selections from the Holy
   Scriptures against tempting spirits, distributed into eight parts,
   according to the number of the arguments. He wrote moreover Six Hundred
   Prognostic Problems, and also two compositions in verse, one addressed
   To the Monks living in Communities, and the other To the Virgin.
   Whoever shall read these productions will be convinced of their
   excellence. It will not be out of place here, I conceive, to subjoin to
   what has been before stated, a few things mentioned by him respecting
   the monks. These are his words: [626]

   It becomes us to enquire into the habits of the pious monks who have
   preceded us, in order that we may correct ourselves by their example:
   for undoubtedly very many excellent things have been said and done by
   them. One of them was accustomed to say, that a drier and not irregular
   diet combined with love, would quickly conduct a monk into the haven of
   tranquillity.' The same individual freed one of his brethren from being
   troubled by apparitions at night, by enjoining him to minister while
   fasting to the sick. And being asked why he prescribed this: Such
   affections,' said he, are by nothing so effectually dissipated as by
   the exercise of compassion.' A certain philosopher of those times
   coming to Anthony the Just, said to him, How can you endure, father,
   being deprived of the comfort of books?' My book, O philosopher,'
   replied Anthony, is the nature of things that are made, and it is
   present whenever I wish to read the words of God.' That chosen vessel,'
   [627] the aged Egyptian Macarius, asked me, why the strength of the
   faculty of memory is impaired by cherishing the remembrance of injury
   received from men; while by remembering those done us by devils it
   remains uninjured? And when I hesitated, scarcely knowing what answer
   to make, and begged him to account for it: Because,' said he, the
   former is an affection contrary to nature, and the latter is
   conformable to the nature of the mind.' Going on one occasion to the
   holy father Macarius about mid-day, and being overcome with the heat
   and thirst, I begged for some water to drink: Content yourself with the
   shade,' was his reply, for many who are now journeying by land, or
   sailing on the deep, are deprived even of this.' Discussing with him
   afterwards the subject of abstinence, Take courage, my son,' said he:
   for twenty years I have neither eaten, drunk, nor slept to satiety; my
   bread has always been weighed, my water measured, and what little sleep
   I have had has been stolen by reclining myself against a wall.' [628]
   The death of his father was announced to one of the monks: Cease your
   blasphemy,' said he to the person that told him; my father is
   immortal.' One of the brethren who possessed nothing but a copy of the
   Gospels, sold it, and distributed the price in food to the hungry,
   uttering this memorable saying--I have sold the book which says, "Sell
   that thou hast and give to the poor."' [629] There is an island about
   the northern part of the city of Alexandria, beyond the lake called
   Maria, where a monk from Parembole [630] dwells, in high repute among
   the Gnostics. This person was accustomed to say, that all the deeds of
   the monks were done for one of these five reasons;--on account of God,
   nature, custom, necessity, or manual labor. The same also said that
   there was only one virtue in nature, but that it assumes various
   characteristics according to the dispositions of the soul: just as the
   light of the sun is itself without form, but accommodates itself to the
   figure of that which receives it. Another of the monks said, I withdraw
   myself from pleasures, in order to cut off the occasions of anger: for
   I know that it always contends for pleasures, disturbing my
   tranquillity of mind, and unfitting me for the attainment of
   knowledge.' One of the aged monks said that Love knows not how to keep
   a deposit either of provisions or money.' He added, I never remember to
   have been twice deceived by the devil in the same thing.' Thus wrote
   Evagrius in his book entitled Practice. [631] And in that which he
   called The Gnostic he says, We have learned from Gregory the Just, that
   there are four virtues, having distinct characteristics:--prudence and
   fortitude, temperance and justice. That it is the province of prudence
   to contemplate the sacred and intelligent powers apart from expression,
   because these are unfolded by wisdom: of fortitude to adhere to truth
   against all opposition, and never to turn aside to that which is
   unreal: of temperance to receive seed from the chief husbandman, [632]
   but to repel him who would sow over it seed of another kind: and
   finally, of justice to adapt discourse to every one, according to their
   condition and capacity; stating some things obscurely, others in a
   figurative manner, and explaining others clearly for the instruction of
   the less intelligent.' That pillar of truth, Basil of Cappadocia, used
   to say that the knowledge which men teach is perfected by constant
   study and exercise; but that which proceeds from the grace of God, by
   the practice of justice, patience, and mercy.' That the former indeed
   is often developed in persons who are still subject to the passions;
   whereas the latter is the portion of those only who are superior to
   their influence, and who during the season of devotion, contemplate
   that peculiar light of the mind which illumines them. That luminary of
   the Egyptians, holy Athanasius, assures us that Moses was commanded to
   place the table on the north [633] side. Let the Gnostics therefore
   understand what wind is contrary to them, and so nobly endure every
   temptation, and minister nourishment with a willing mind to those who
   apply to them.' Serapion, the angel of the church of the Thmuïtae,
   declared that the mind is completely purified by drinking in spiritual
   knowledge': that charity cures the inflammatory tendencies of the
   soul'; and that the depraved lusts which spring up in it are restrained
   by abstinence.' Exercise thyself continually,' said the great and
   enlightened teacher Didymus, in reflecting on providence and judgment;
   and endeavor to bear in memory the material of whatever discourses thou
   mayst have heard on these topics, for almost all fail in this respect.
   Thou wilt find reasonings concerning judgment in the difference of
   created forms, and the constitution of the universe: sermons on
   providence comprehended in those means by which we are led from vice
   and ignorance to virtue and knowledge.'

   These few extracts from Evagrius we thought it would be appropriate to
   insert here. There was another excellent man among the monks, named
   Ammonius, who had so little interest in secular matters, that when he
   went to Rome with Athanasius, he chose to investigate none of the
   magnificent works of that city, contenting himself with examining the
   Cathedral of Peter and Paul only. This same Ammonius on being urged to
   enter upon the episcopal office, cut off his own right ear, that by
   mutilation of his person he might disqualify himself for ordination.
   But when long afterwards Evagrius, whom Theophilus, bishop of
   Alexandria, wished to make a bishop, having effected his escape without
   maiming himself in any way, afterwards happened to meet Ammonius, and
   told him jocosely, that he had done wrong in cutting off his own ear,
   as he had by that means rendered himself criminal in the sight of God.
   To which Ammonius replied, And do you think, Evagrius, that you will
   not be punished, who from self-love have cut out your own tongue, to
   avoid the exercise of that gift of utterance which has been committed
   to you?' There were at the same time in the monasteries very many other
   admirable and devout characters whom it would be too tedious to
   enumerate in this place, and besides if we should attempt to describe
   the life of each, and the miracles they did by means of that sanctity
   with which they were endowed, we should necessarily digress too far
   from the object we have in view. Should any one desire to become
   acquainted with their history, in reference both to their deeds and
   experiences and discourses for the edification of their auditors, as
   well as how wild beasts became subject to their authority, there is a
   specific treatise [634] as on the subject, composed by the monk
   Palladius, who was a disciple of Evagrius, and gives all these
   particulars in minute detail. In that work he also mentions several
   women, who practiced the same kind of austerities as the men that have
   been referred to. Both Evagrius and Palladius flourished a short time
   after the death of Valens. We must now return to the point whence we
   diverged.

   Chapter XXIV.--Assault upon the Monks, and Banishment of their
   Superiors, who exhibit Miraculous Power.

   The emperor Valens having issued an edict commanding that the orthodox
   should be persecuted both in Alexandria and in the rest of Egypt,
   depopulation and ruin to an immense extent immediately followed: some
   were dragged before the tribunals, others cast into prison, and many
   tortured in various ways, and in fact all sorts of punishments were
   inflicted upon persons who aimed only at peace and quiet. When these
   outrages had been perpetrated at Alexandria just as Lucius thought
   proper, Euzoïus returned to Antioch, and Lucian the Arian, attended by
   the commander-in-chief of the army with a considerable body of troops,
   immediately proceeded to the monasteries of Egypt, where the general in
   person assailed the assemblage of holy men with greater fury even than
   the ruthless soldiery. On reaching these solitudes they found the monks
   engaged in their customary exercises, praying, healing diseases, and
   casting out devils. Yet they, regardless of these extraordinary
   evidences of Divine power, suffered them not to continue their solemn
   devotions, but drove them out of the oratories by force. Rufinus
   declares that he was not only a witness of these cruelties, but also
   one of the sufferers. Thus in them were renewed those things which are
   spoken of by the apostle: [635] for they were mocked, and had trial of
   scourgings, were stripped naked, put in bonds, stoned, slain with the
   sword, went about in the wilderness clad in sheep-skins and goat-skins,
   being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not
   worthy, wandering in deserts, in mountains, in dens and caves of the
   earth.' In all these things they obtained a good report' for their
   faith and their works, and the cures which the grace of Christ wrought
   by their hands. But as it appears Divine Providence permitted them to
   endure these evils, having for them provided something better,' [636]
   that through their sufferings others might obtain the salvation of God,
   and this subsequent events seem to prove. When therefore these
   wonderful men proved superior to all the violence which was exercised
   toward them, Lucius in despair advised the military chief to send the
   fathers of the monks into exile: these were the Egyptian Macarius, and
   his namesake of Alexandria, both of whom were accordingly banished to
   an island where there was no Christian inhabitant, and in this island
   there was an idolatrous temple, and a priest whom the inhabitants
   worshiped as a god. On the arrival of these holy men at the island, the
   demons of that place were filled with fear and trepidation. Now it
   happened at the same time that the priest's daughter became suddenly
   possessed by a demon, and began to act with great fury, and to overturn
   everything that came in her way; nor was any force sufficient to
   restrain her, but she cried with a loud voice to these saints of God,
   saying:--Why are ye come here to cast us out from hence also?' [637]
   Then did the men there also display the peculiar power which they had
   received through Divine grace: for having cast out the demon from the
   maid, and presented her cured to her father, they led the priest
   himself, and also all the inhabitants of the island to the Christian
   faith. Whereupon they immediately brake their images in pieces, and
   changed the form of their temple into that of a church; and having been
   baptized, they joyfully received instruction in the doctrines of
   Christianity. Thus these marvelous individuals, after enduring
   persecution on account of the homoousian' faith, were themselves more
   approved, became the means of salvation to others, and confirmed the
   truth.

   Chapter XXV.--Of Didymus the Blind Man. [638]

   About the same period God brought into observation another faithful
   person, deeming it worthy that through him faith might be witnessed
   unto: this was Didymus, a most admirable and eloquent man, instructed
   in all the learning of the age in which he flourished. At a very early
   age, when he had scarcely acquired the first elements of learning, he
   was attacked by disease in the eyes which deprived him of sight. But
   God compensated to him the loss of corporeal vision, by bestowing
   increased intellectual acumen. For what he could not learn by seeing,
   he was enabled to acquire through the sense of hearing; so that being
   from his childhood endowed with excellent abilities, he soon far
   surpassed his youthful companions who possessed the keenest sight. He
   made himself master of the principles of grammar and rhetoric with
   astonishing facility; and proceeded thence to philosophical studies,
   dialectics, arithmetic, music, and the various other departments of
   knowledge to which his attention was directed; and he so treasured up
   in his mind these branches of science, that he was prepared with the
   utmost readiness to enter into a discussion of these subjects with
   those who had become conversant therewith by reading books. Not only
   this, but he was so well acquainted with the Divine oracles contained
   in the Old and New Testament that he composed several treatises in
   exposition of them, besides three books on the Trinity. He published
   also commentaries [639] on Origen's book Of Principles, in which he
   commends these writings, saying that they are excellent, and that those
   who calumniate their author, and speak slightingly of his works, are
   mere cavilers. For,' says he, they are destitute of sufficient
   penetration to comprehend the profound wisdom of that extraordinary
   man.' Those who may desire to form a just idea of the extensive
   erudition of Didymus, and the intense ardor of his mind, must peruse
   with attention his diversified and elaborate works. It is said that
   after Anthony had conversed for some time with this Didymus, long
   before the reign of Valens, when he came from the desert to Alexandria
   on account of the Arians, perceiving the learning and intelligence of
   the man, he said to him, Didymus, let not the loss of your bodily eyes
   distress you: for you are deprived of such eyes merely as are the
   common possession of gnats and flies; rather rejoice that you have eyes
   such as angels see with, by which the Deity himself is discerned, and
   his light comprehended.' This address of the pious Anthony to Didymus
   was made long before the times we are describing: in fact Didymus was
   then regarded as the great bulwark of the true faith, answering the
   Arians, whose sophistic cavilings he fully exposed, triumphantly
   refuting all their vain subtleties and deceptive reasonings.

   Chapter XXVI.--Of Basil of Cæsarea, and Gregory of Nazianzus. [640]

   Now Providence opposed Didymus to the Arians at Alexandria. But for the
   purpose of confuting them in other cities, it raised up Basil of
   Cæsarea and Gregory of Nazianzus; concerning these it will be
   reasonable to give a brief account in this place. Indeed the
   universally prevalent memory of the men would be enough as a token of
   their fame; and the extent of their knowledge is sufficiently
   perceptible in their writings. Since, however, the exercise of their
   talents was of great service to the Church, tending in a high degree to
   the maintenance of the catholic faith, the nature of my history obliges
   me to take particular notice of these two persons. If any one should
   compare Basil and Gregory with one another, and consider the life,
   morals, and virtues of each, he would find it difficult to decide to
   which of them he ought to assign the pre-eminence: so equally did they
   both appear to excel, whether you regard the rectitude of their
   conduct, or their deep acquaintance with Greek literature and the
   sacred Scriptures. In their youth they were pupils at Athens of
   Himerius [641] and Prohæresius, [642] the most celebrated sophists of
   that age: subsequently they frequented the school of Libanius [643] at
   Antioch in Syria, where they cultivated rhetoric to the utmost. Having
   been deemed worthy of the profession of sophistry, they were urged by
   many of their friends to enter the profession of teaching eloquence;
   others would have persuaded them to practice law: but despising both
   these pursuits, they abandoned their former studies, and embraced the
   monastic life. Having had some slight taste of philosophical science
   from him who then taught it at Antioch, they procured Origen's works,
   and drew from them the right interpretation of the sacred Scriptures;
   for the fame of Origen was very great and widespread throughout the
   whole world at that time; after a careful perusal of the writings of
   that great man, they contended against the Arians with manifest
   advantage. And when the defenders of Arianism quoted the same author in
   confirmation, as they imagined, of their own views, these two confuted
   them, and clearly proved that their opponents did not at all understand
   the reasoning of Origen. Indeed, although Eunomius, [644] who was then
   their champion, and many others on the side of the Arians were
   considered men of great eloquence, yet whenever they attempted to enter
   into controversy with Gregory and Basil, they appeared in comparison
   with them ignorant and illiterate. Basil being ordained to the office
   of deacon, was by Meletius, bishop of Antioch, from that rank elevated
   to the bishopric of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, which was his native
   country. Thither he therefore hastened, fearing lest these Arian dogmas
   should have infected the provinces of Pontus; and in order to
   counteract them, he founded several monasteries, diligently instructed
   the people in his own doctrines, and confirmed the faith of those whose
   minds were wavering. Gregory being constituted bishop of Nazianzus,
   [645] a small city of Cappadocia over which his own father had before
   presided, pursued a course similar to that which Basil took; for he
   went through the various cities, and strengthened the weak in faith. To
   Constantinople in particular he made frequent visits, and by his
   ministrations there, comforted and assured the orthodox believers,
   wherefore a short time after, by the suffrage of many bishops, he was
   made bishop of the church at Constantinople. When intelligence of the
   proceedings of these two zealous and devoted men reached the ears of
   the emperor Valens, he immediately ordered Basil to be brought from
   Cæsarea to Antioch; [646] where being arraigned before the tribunal of
   the prefect, that functionary asked him why he would not embrace the
   emperor's faith?' Basil with much boldness condemned the errors of that
   creed which his sovereign countenanced, and vindicated the doctrine of
   the homoousion: and when the prefect threatened him with death, Would,'
   said Basil, that I might be released from the bonds of the body for the
   truth's sake.' The prefect having exhorted him to reconsider the matter
   more seriously, Basil is reported to have said, I am the same to-day
   that I shall be to-morrow: but I wish that you had not changed
   yourself.' At that time, therefore, Basil remained in custody
   throughout the day. It happened, however, not long afterwards that
   Galates, the emperor's infant son, was attacked with a dangerous
   malady, so that the physicians despaired of his recovery; when the
   empress Dominica, his mother, assured the emperor that she had been
   greatly disquieted in her dreams by fearful visions, which led her to
   believe that the child's illness was a chastisement on account of the
   ill treatment of the bishop. The emperor after a little reflection sent
   for Basil, and in order to prove his faith said to him, If the doctrine
   you maintain is the truth, pray that my son may not die.' If your
   majesty should believe as I do,' replied Basil, and the church should
   be unified, the child shall live.' To these conditions the emperor
   would not agree: God's will concerning the child will be done then,'
   said Basil; as Basil said this the emperor ordered him to be dismissed;
   the child, however, died shortly after. Such is an epitome of the
   history of these distinguished ecclesiastics, both of whom have left us
   many admirable works, some of which Rufinus says he has translated into
   Latin. Basil had two brothers, Peter and Gregory; the former of whom
   adopted Basil's monastic mode of life; while the latter emulated his
   eloquence in teaching, and completed after his death Basil's treatise
   on the Six Days' Work, which had been left unfinished. He also
   pronounced at Constantinople the funeral oration of Meletius, bishop of
   Antioch; and many other orations of his are still extant.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [640] For full accounts of the lives of these eminent men, see Smith
   and Wace, Dict. of Christ. Biog., and the sources and literature
   therein referred to.

   [641] Himerius, a native of Prusias (mod. Broussa) in Bithynia,
   flourished about 360 a.d. as a sophist under Julian the Apostate. He
   published various discourses, which, according to Photius, contained
   insidious attacks on Christianity. Cf. Eunapius, p. 153, under title
   Prohæresius; Photius, Bibl. Cod. 165.

   [642] Prohæresius was a native of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, and taught in
   Athens a short time before Libanius. Cf. Eunapius, Prohæresius, par.
   129-162.

   [643] This is doubted by Valesius on the ground that Gregory in his
   autobiography (in verse) says that he was thirty years of age when he
   left Athens, where his friends wished him to stay and teach rhetoric;
   but if he stayed at Athens until the thirtieth year of his age, it is
   not likely that he could have studied with Libanius after that time. So
   also Rufinus, H. E. II. 9.

   [644] Cf. chap. 7 of the present book.

   [645] Rufinus (H. E. II. 9) says this. But from Gregory's own works
   (Orat. VIII.) it appears that he was not made bishop of Nazianzus but
   assistant to his father, and on the express condition that he should
   not succeed his father. He was first consecrated bishop of Sasimi by
   Basil the Great, from thence transferred to Constantinople, but
   resigned that bishopric (V. 7) and retired to Nazianzus, where he
   remained bishop until he chose his successor there.

   [646] Sozomen (VI. 16) says that Valens came from Antioch to Cæsarea
   and ordered Basil to be brought before the prefect of the prætorium.
   This account agrees better with what both Gregory of Nazianzus and
   Gregory of Nyssa say of this experience of Basil.

   Chapter XXVII.--Of Gregory Thaumaturgus (the Wonder-Worker).

   But since from the likeness of the name, and the title of the books
   attributed to Gregory, persons are liable to confound very different
   parties, it is important to notice that Gregory of Pontus is a
   different person. He was a native of Neocæsarea in Pontus, of greater
   antiquity than the one above referred to, inasmuch as he was a disciple
   of Origen. [647] This Gregory's fame was celebrated at Athens, at
   Berytus, throughout the entire diocese of Pontus, and I might almost
   add in the whole world. When he had finished his education in the
   schools of Athens, he went to Berytus to study civil law, where hearing
   that Origen expounded the Holy Scriptures at Cæsarea, he quickly
   proceeded thither; and after his understanding had been opened to
   perceive the grandeur of these Divine books, bidding adieu to all
   further cultivation of the Roman laws, he became thenceforth
   inseparable from Origen, from whom having acquired a knowledge of the
   true philosophy, he was recalled soon after by his parents and returned
   to his own country; and there, while still a layman, he performed many
   miracles, healing the sick, and casting out devils even by his letters,
   insomuch that the pagans were no less attracted to the faith by his
   acts, than by his discourses. Pamphilus Martyr mentions this person in
   the books which he wrote in defence of Origen; to which there is added
   a commendatory oration of Gregory's, composed in praise of Origen, when
   he was under the necessity of leaving him. There were then, to be
   brief, several Gregories: the first and most ancient was the disciple
   of Origen; the second was the bishop of Nazianzus; the third was
   Basil's brother; and there was another Gregory [648] whom the Arians
   constituted bishop during the exile of Athanasius. But enough has been
   said respecting them.

   Chapter XXVIII.--Of Novatus and his Followers. The Novatians of Phrygia
   alter the Time of keeping Easter, following Jewish Usage.

   About this time the Novatians [649] inhabiting Phrygia changed the day
   for celebrating the Feast of Easter. How this happened I shall state,
   after first explaining the reason of the strict discipline which is
   maintained in their church, even to the present day, in the provinces
   of Phrygia and Paphlagonia. Novatus, [650] a presbyter of the Roman
   Church, separated from it, because Cornelius the bishop received into
   communion believers who had sacrificed during the persecution which the
   Emperor Decius [651] had raised against the Church. Having seceded on
   this account, on being afterwards elevated to the episcopacy by such
   bishops as entertained similar sentiments, he wrote to all the churches
   [652] that they should not admit to the sacred mysteries those who had
   sacrificed; but exhorting them to repentance, leave the pardoning of
   their offense to God, who has the power to forgive all sin.' Receiving
   such letters, the parties in the various provinces, to whom they were
   addressed, acted according to their several dispositions and judgments.
   As he asked that they should not receive to the sacraments those who
   after baptism had committed any deadly sin [653] this appeared to some
   a cruel and merciless course: but others received the rule as just and
   conducive to the maintenance of discipline, and the promotion of
   greater devotedness of life. In the midst of the agitation of this
   question, letters arrived from Cornelius the bishop, promising
   indulgence to delinquents after baptism. Thus as these two persons
   wrote contrary to one another, and each confirmed his own procedure by
   the testimony of the Divine word, as it usually happens, every one
   identified himself with that view which favored his previous habits and
   inclinations. Those who had pleasure in sin, encouraged by the license
   then granted them, took occasion from it to revel in every species of
   criminality. Now the Phrygians appear to be more temperate than other
   nations, and are seldom guilty of swearing. The Scythians, on the other
   hand, and the Thracians, are naturally of a very irritable disposition:
   while the inhabitants of the East are addicted to sensual pleasures.
   But the Paphlagonians and Phrygians are prone to neither of these
   vices; nor are the sports of the circus and theatrical exhibitions in
   much estimation among them even to the present day. And for this
   reason, it seems to me, these people, as well as others of the same
   character, so readily assented to the letters then written by Novatus.
   Fornication and adultery are regarded among them as the grossest
   enormities: and it is well known that there is no race of men on the
   face of the earth who more rigidly govern their passions in this
   respect than the Phrygians and Paphlagonians. The same reason I think
   had force with those who dwelt in the West and followed Novatus. Yet
   although for the sake of stricter discipline Novatus became a
   separatist, he made no change in the time of keeping Easter, [654] but
   invariably observed the practice that obtained in the Western churches.
   For they celebrate this feast after the equinox, according to the usage
   which had of old been delivered to them when first they embraced
   Christianity. He himself indeed afterwards suffered martyrdom in the
   reign of Valerian, [655] during the persecution which was then raised
   against the Christians. But those in Phrygia [656] who are named after
   him Novatians, about this period changed the day of celebrating Easter,
   being averse to communion with other Christians even on this occasion.
   This was effected by means of a few obscure bishops of that sect
   convening a Synod at the village of Pazum, which is situated near the
   sources of the river Sangarius; for there they framed a canon
   appointing its observance on the same day as that on which the Jews
   annually keep the feast of Unleavened Bread. An aged man, who was the
   son of a presbyter, and had been present with his father at this Synod,
   gave us our information on this matter. But both Agelius, bishop of the
   Novatians at Constantinople, and Maximus of Nicæa, as also the bishops
   of Nicomedia and Cotyæum, were absent, although the ecclesiastical
   affairs of the Novatians were for the most part under the control of
   these bishops. How the church of the Novatians soon after was divided
   into two parties in consequence of this Synod, shall be related in its
   proper course: [657] but we must now notice what took place about the
   same time in the Western parts.

   Chapter XXIX.--Damasus ordained Bishop of Rome. Sedition and Loss of
   Life caused by the Rivalry of Ursinus.

   While the emperor Valentinian governed in peace, and interfered with no
   sect, Damasus after Liberius undertook the administration of the
   bishopric at Rome; [658] whereupon a great disturbance was caused on
   the following account. [659] A certain Ursinus, a deacon of that
   church, had been nominated among others when the election of a bishop
   took place; as Damasus [660] was preferred, this Ursinus, unable to
   bear the disappointment of his hopes, held schismatic assemblies apart
   from the church, and even induced certain bishops of little distinction
   to ordain him in secret. This ordination was made, not in a church,
   [661] but in a retired place called the Palace of Sicine, whereupon
   dissension arose among the people; their disagreement being not about
   any article of faith or heresy, but simply as to who should be bishop.
   Hence frequent conflicts arose, insomuch that many lives were
   sacrificed in this contention; and many of the clergy as well as laity
   were punished on that account by Maximin, the prefect of the city. Thus
   was Ursinus obliged to desist from his pretensions at that time, and
   those who were minded to follow him were reduced to order.

   Chapter XXX.--Dissension about a Successor to Auxentius, Bishop of
   Milan. Ambrose, Governor of the Province, going to appease the Tumult,
   is by General Consent and with the Approval of the Emperor Valentinian
   elected to the Bishopric of that Church.

   About the same time it happened that [662] another event took place at
   Milan well worthy of being recorded. On the death of Auxentius, who had
   been ordained bishop of that church by the Arians, the people again
   were disturbed respecting the election of a successor; for as some
   proposed one person, and others favored another, the city was full of
   contention and uproar. In this state of things the governor of the
   province, Ambrose by name, [663] who was also of consular dignity,
   dreading some catastrophe from the popular excitement, ran into the
   church in order to quell the disturbance. As he arrived there and the
   people became quiet, he repressed the irrational fury of the multitude
   by a long and appropriate address, by urging such motives as they felt
   to be right, and all present suddenly came to an unanimous agreement,
   crying out that Ambrose was worthy of the bishopric,' and demanding his
   ordination: for by that means only,' it was alleged, would the peace of
   the church be secured, and all be reunited in the same faith and
   judgment.' And inasmuch as such unanimity among the people appeared to
   the bishops then present to proceed from some Divine appointment,
   immediately they laid hands on Ambrose; and having baptized him--for he
   was then but a catechumen--they were about to invest him with the
   episcopal office. But although Ambrose willingly received baptism, he
   with great earnestness refused to be ordained: upon which the bishops
   referred the matter to the Emperor Valentinian. This prince regarding
   the universal consent of the people as the work of God, sent word to
   the bishops to do the will of God by ordaining him; declaring that his
   choice was by the voice of God rather than by the votes of men.'
   Ambrose was therefore ordained; and thus the inhabitants of Milan who
   were divided among themselves, were once more restored to unity.

   [662] Synchronization of the events attending the accession of Damasus
   and Ambrose, the former in Rome, the latter at Milan, is dependent on
   Rufinus. Cf. H. E. II. 11. The events of this chapter more properly
   fall within the time reached by Socrates, i.e. 374 a.d. (see chap. 29,
   note 1). Hence rightly seven years later than the events of the
   preceding chapter.

   Chapter XXXI.--Death of Valentinian.

   The Sarmatæ after this having made incursions into the Roman
   territories, the emperor marched against them with a numerous army but
   when the barbarians understood the formidable nature of this
   expedition, they sent an embassy to him to sue for peace on certain
   conditions. As the ambassadors were introduced to the emperor's
   presence, and appeared to him to be not very dignified fellows, he
   enquired whether all the Sarmatæ were such as these? As they replied
   that the noblest personages of their whole nation had come to him,
   Valentinian became excessively enraged, and exclaimed with great
   vehemence, that the Roman empire was indeed most wretched in devolving
   upon him at a time when a nation of such despicable barbarians, not
   content with being permitted to exist in safety within their own
   limits, dared to take up arms, invade the Roman territories, and break
   forth into open war.' The violence of his manner and utterance of these
   words was so great, that all his veins were opened by the effort, and
   all the arteries ruptured; and from the quantity of blood which
   thereupon gushed forth he died. This occurred at Bergition Castle,
   after Gratian's third consulate [664] in conjunction with Equitius, on
   the seventeenth day of November, Valentinian having lived fifty-four
   years and reigned thirteen. Upon the decease of Valentinian, six days
   after his death the army in Italy proclaimed his son Valentinian, then
   a young child, emperor, at Acincum, a city of Italy. [665] When this
   was announced to the other two emperors, they were displeased, not
   because the brother of the one and the nephew of the other had been
   declared emperor, but because the military presumed to proclaim him
   without consulting them, whom they themselves wished to have
   proclaimed. They both, however, ratified the transaction, and thus was
   Valentinian the younger seated on his father's throne. Now this
   Valentinian was born of Justina, whom Valentinian the elder married
   while Severa his former wife was alive, under the following
   circumstances. Justus the father of Justina, who had been governor of
   Picenum under the reign of Constantius, had a dream in which he seemed
   to himself to bring forth the imperial purple out of his right side.
   When this dream had been told to many persons, it at length came to the
   knowledge of Constantius, who conjecturing it to be a presage that a
   descendant of Justus would become emperor, caused him to be
   assassinated. Justina being thus bereft of her father, still continued
   a virgin. Some time after she became known to Severa, wife of the
   emperor Valentinian, and had frequent intercourse with the empress,
   until their intimacy at length grew to such an extent that they were
   accustomed to bathe together. When Severa saw Justina in the bath she
   was greatly struck with the beauty of the virgin, and spoke of her to
   the emperor; saying that the daughter of Justus was so lovely a
   creature, and possessed of such symmetry of form, that she herself,
   though a woman, was altogether charmed with her. The emperor,
   treasuring this description by his wife in his own mind, considered
   with himself how he could espouse Justina, without repudiating Severa,
   as she had borne him Gratian, whom he had created Augustus a little
   while before. He accordingly framed a law, and caused it to be
   published throughout all the cities, by which any man was permitted to
   have two lawful wives. [666] The law was promulgated and he married
   Justina, by whom he had Valentinian the younger, and three daughters,
   Justa, Grata, and Galla; the two former of these remained virgins: but
   Calla was afterwards married to the emperor Theodosius the Great, who
   had by her a daughter named Placidia. For that prince had Arcadius and
   Honorius by Flaccilla his former wife: we shall however enter into
   particulars respecting Theodosius and his sons in the proper place.

   [665] Rather Pannonia.

   [666] Baronius (Am. IV. 272) and Valesius in this passage agree in
   looking upon this whole story as a groundless fiction which some
   pretended eyewitness palmed off on Socrates. The law mentioned here is
   never mentioned by any other historian; no vestige of it is found in
   any of the codes; on the contrary, according to Bingham (Christ. Antiq.
   XVI. 11), bigamy and polygamy were treated with the utmost severity in
   the ancient Church, and the Roman law was very much against them;
   furthermore, Am. Marcellinus (XXX.) says that Valentinian was
   remarkable for his chastity, both at home and abroad, and Zosimus (IV.
   19) that his second wife had been married to Magnentius previously [and
   hence was not a virgin as here stated] and that he married her after
   the death of his first wife; all of which considerations taken together
   render it historically certain that the story is not true.

   Chapter XXXII.--The Emperor Valens, appeased by the Oration of
   Themistius the Philosopher, abates his Persecution of the Christians.

   In the meanwhile Valens, making his residence at Antioch, was wholly
   undisturbed by foreign wars; for the barbarians on every side
   restrained themselves within their own boundaries. Nevertheless, he
   himself waged a most cruel war against those who maintained the
   homoousian' doctrine, inflicting on them more grievous punishments
   every day; until the philosopher Themistius by his Appealing Oration
   [668] somewhat moderated his severity. In this speech he tells the
   emperor, That he ought not to be surprised at the difference of
   judgment on religious questions existing among Christians; inasmuch as
   that discrepancy was trifling when compared with the multitude of
   conflicting opinions current among the heathen; for these amount to
   above three hundred; that dissension indeed was an inevitable
   consequence of this disagreement; but that God would be the more
   glorified by a diversity of sentiment, and the greatness of his majesty
   be more venerated, from the fact of its not being easy to have a
   knowledge of Him.' The philosopher having said these and similar
   things, the emperor became milder, but did not completely give up his
   wrath; for although he ceased to put ecclesiastics to death, he
   continued to send them into exile, until this fury of his also was
   repressed by the following event.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [668] This oration of Themistius is extant in a Latin translation by
   Dudithius appended to G. Remo's Themisttii Phil. orationes sex
   augustales, and entitled, ad Valentem, pro Libertate relligionis. The
   passage alluded to by Socrates is found in Dudithius as follows:
   Wherefore, in regard God has removed himself at the greatest distance
   from our knowledge, and does not humble to the capacity of our
   understanding; it is a sufficient argument that he does not require one
   and the same law and rule of religion from all persons, but leaves
   every man a license and faculty concerning himself, according to his
   own, not another man's, liberty and choice. Whence it also happens that
   a greater admiration of the Deity, and a more religious veneration of
   his eternal majesty, is engendered in the minds of men. For it usually
   comes to pass that we loathe and disregard those things which are
   readily apparent and prostrated to every understanding.'

   Chapter XXXIII.--The Goths, under the Reign of Valens, embrace
   Christianity.

   The barbarians, dwelling beyond the Danube, called the Goths, [669]
   having engaged in a civil war among themselves, were divided into two
   parties, one of which was headed by Fritigernes, the other by
   Athanaric. When the latter had obtained an evident advantage over his
   rival, Fritigernes had recourse to the Romans, and implored their
   assistance against his adversary. This was reported to the Emperor
   Valens, and he ordered the troops which were garrisoned in Thrace to
   assist those barbarians who had appealed to him against their more
   powerful countrymen; and by means of this subsidy they won a complete
   victory over Athanaric beyond the Danube, totally routing the enemy.
   This became the occasion for the conversion of many of the barbarians
   to the Christian religion: [670] for Fritigernes, to express his sense
   of the obligation the emperor had conferred upon him, embraced the
   religion of his benefactor, and urged those who were under his
   authority to do the same. Therefore it is that so many of the Goths are
   even to the present time infected with the errors of Arianism, they
   having on the occasion preferred to become adherents to that heresy on
   the emperor's account. Ulfilas, their bishop at that time, invented the
   Gothic letters, [671] and translating the Sacred Scriptures into their
   own language, undertook to instruct these barbarians in the Divine
   oracles. And as Ulfilas did not restrict his labors to the subjects of
   Fritigernes, but extended them to those who acknowledged the sway of
   Athanaric also, Athanaric regarding this as a violation of the
   privileges of the religion of his ancestors, subjected those who
   professed Christianity to severe punishments; so that many of the Arian
   Goths of that period became martyrs. Arius indeed, failing in his
   attempt to refute the opinion of Sabellius the Libyan, fell from the
   true faith, and asserted the Son of God to be a new God': [672] but the
   barbarians embracing Christianity with greater simplicity of mind
   despised the present life for the faith of Christ. With these remarks
   we shall close our notice of the Christianized Goths.

   [669] The fullest and best ancient authors on the origin and history of
   the Goths are Procopius of Cæsarea (Historia, IV.-VIII., de Bello
   Italico adversus Gothos gesto), Jornandes (de Getarum [Gothorum]

   Chapter XXXIV.--Admission of the Fugitive Goths into the Roman
   Territories, which caused the Emperor's Overthrow, and eventually the
   Ruin of the Roman Empire.

   Not long after the barbarians had entered into a friendly alliance with
   one another, they were again vanquished by other barbarians, their
   neighbors, called the Huns; and being driven out of their own country,
   they fled into the territory of the Romans, offering to be subject to
   the emperor, and to execute whatever he should command them. When
   Valens was made acquainted with this, not having the least presentiment
   of the consequences, he ordered that the suppliants should be received
   with kindness; in this one instance alone showing himself
   compassionate. He therefore assigned them certain parts of Thrace for
   their habitation, deeming himself peculiarly fortunate in this matter:
   for he calculated that in future he should possess a ready and
   well-equipped army against all assailants; and hoped that the
   barbarians would be a more formidable guard to the frontiers of the
   empire even than the Romans themselves. For this reason he in the
   future neglected to recruit his army by Roman levies; and despising
   those veterans who had bravely straggled and subdued his enemies in
   former wars, he put a pecuniary value on the militia which the
   inhabitants of the provinces, village by village, had been accustomed
   to furnish, ordering the collectors of his tribute to demand eighty
   pieces of gold for every soldier, although he had never before
   lightened the public burdens. This change was the origin of many
   disasters to the Roman empire subsequently.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXXV.--Abatement of Persecution against the Christians because
   of the War with the Goths.

   The barbarians having been put into possession of Thrace, and securely
   enjoying that Roman province, were unable to bear their good fortune
   with moderation; but committing hostile aggressions upon their
   benefactors, devastated all Thrace and the adjacent countries. When
   these proceedings came to the knowledge of Valens, he desisted from
   sending the adherents of the homoousion into banishment; and in great
   alarm left Antioch, and came to Constantinople, where also the
   persecution of the orthodox Christians was for the same reason come to
   an end. At the same time Euzoïus, bishop of the Arians at Antioch,
   departed this life, in the fifth consulate [673] of Valens, and the
   first of Valentinian the younger; and Dorotheus was appointed in his
   place.

   Chapter XXXVI.--The Saracens, under Mavia their Queen, embrace
   Christianity; and Moses, a Pious Monk, is consecrated their Bishop.

   No sooner had the emperor departed from Antioch, than the Saracens,
   [674] who had before been in alliance with the Romans, revolted from
   them, being led by Mavia their queen, whose husband was then dead. All
   the regions of the East therefore were at that time ravaged by the
   Saracens: but a certain divine Providence repressed their fury in the
   manner I am about to describe. A person named Moses, a Saracen by
   birth, who led a monastic life in the desert, became exceedingly
   eminent for his piety, faith, and miracles. Mavia the queen of the
   Saracens was therefore desirous that this person should be constituted
   bishop over her nation, and promised on the condition to terminate the
   war. The Roman generals considering that a peace founded on such terms
   would be extremely advantageous, gave immediate directions for its
   ratification. Moses was accordingly seized, and brought from the desert
   to Alexandria, in order that he might there be invested with the
   bishopric: but on his presentation for that purpose to Lucius, who at
   that time presided over the churches in that city, he refused to be
   ordained by him, protesting against it in these words: I account myself
   indeed unworthy of the sacred office; but if the exigencies of the
   state require my bearing it, it shall not be by Lucius laying his hand
   on me, for it has been filled with blood.' When Lucius told him that it
   was his duty to learn from him the principles of religion, and not to
   utter reproachful language, Moses replied, Matters of faith are not now
   in question: but your infamous practices against the brethren
   sufficiently prove that your doctrines are not Christian. For a
   Christian is "no striker, reviles not, does not fight"; for "it becomes
   not a servant of the Lord to fight." [675] But your deeds cry out
   against you by those who have been sent into exile, who have been
   exposed to the wild beasts, and who had been delivered up to the
   flames. Those things which our own eyes have beheld are far more
   convincing than what we receive from the report of another.' As Moses
   expressed these and other similar sentiments his friends took him to
   the mountains, that he might receive ordination from those bishops who
   lived in exile there. Moses having thus been consecrated, the Saracen
   war was terminated; and so scrupulously did Mavia observe the peace
   thus entered into with the Romans that she gave her daughter in
   marriage to Victor the commander-in-chief of the Roman army. Such were
   the transactions in relation to the Saracens.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [674] The name Saracen (Sarakenos , perhaps from the Arabic Sharkeen
   Orientals') was used vaguely at first; the Greek writers of the first
   centuries gave it to the Bedouin Arabs of Eastern Arabia, while others
   used it to designate the Arab races of Syria and Palestine, and others
   the Berber of North Eastern Africa, who later conquered Spain and
   Sicily and invaded France. The name became very familiar in Europe
   during the period of the Crusades. On Saracens, consult the interesting
   fiftieth chapter of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.

   Chapter XXXVII.--After the Departure of Valens from Antioch, the
   Alexandrians expel Lucius, and restore Peter, who had come with Letters
   from Damasus Bishop of Rome.

   About the same time, as soon as the Emperor Valens left Antioch, all
   those who had anywhere been suffering persecution began again to take
   courage, and especially those of Alexandria. Peter returned to that
   city from Rome, with letters from Damasus the Roman bishop, in which he
   confirmed the homoousian' faith, and sanctioned Peter's ordination. The
   people therefore resuming confidence, expelled Lucius, who immediately
   embarked for Constantinople: but Peter survived his re-establishment a
   very short time, and at his death appointed his brother Timothy to
   succeed him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXXVIII.--The Emperor Valens is ridiculed by the People on
   Account of the Goths; undertakes an Expedition against them and is
   slain in an Engagement near Adrianople.

   The Emperor Valens arrived at Constantinople on the 30th of May, in the
   sixth year of his own consulate, [676] and the second of Valentinian
   the Younger, and found the people in a very dejected state of mind: for
   the barbarians, who had already desolated Thrace, were now laying waste
   the very suburbs of Constantinople, there being no adequate force at
   hand to resist them. But when they undertook to make near approaches,
   even to the walls of the city, the people became exceedingly troubled,
   and began to murmur against the emperor; accusing him of having brought
   on the enemy thither, and then indolently prolonging the struggle
   there, instead of at once marching out against the barbarians. Moreover
   at the exhibition of the sports of the Hippodrome, all with one voice
   clamored against the emperor's negligence of the public affairs, crying
   out with great earnestness, Give us arms, and we ourselves will fight.'
   The emperor provoked at these seditious clamors, marched out of the
   city, on the 11th of June; threatening that if he returned, he would
   punish the citizens not only for their insolent reproaches, but for
   having previously favored the pretensions of the usurper Procopius;
   declaring also that he would utterly demolish their city, and cause the
   plough to pass over its ruins, he advanced against the barbarians, whom
   he routed with great slaughter, and pursued as far as Adrianople, a
   city of Thrace, situated on the frontiers of Macedonia. Having at that
   place again engaged the enemy, who had by this time rallied, he lost
   his life on the 9th of August, under the consulate just mentioned, and
   in the fourth year of the 289th Olympiad. Some have asserted that he
   was burnt to death in a village whither he had retired, which the
   barbarians assaulted and set on fire. But others affirm that having put
   off his imperial robe he ran into the midst of the main body of
   infantry; and that when the cavalry revolted and refused to engage, the
   infantry were surrounded by the barbarians, and completely destroyed in
   a body. Among these it is said the emperor fell, but could not be
   distinguished, in consequence of his not having on his imperial habit.
   He died in the fiftieth year of his age, having reigned in conjunction
   with his brother thirteen years, and three years after the death of the

   Book V.

   Introduction.

   Before we begin the fifth book of our history, we must beg those who
   may peruse this treatise, not to censure us too hastily because having
   set out to write a church history we still intermingle with
   ecclesiastical matters, such an account of the wars which took place
   during the period under consideration, as could be duly authenticated.
   For this we have done for several reasons: first, in order to lay
   before our readers an exact statement of facts; but secondly, in order
   that the minds of the readers might not become satiated with the
   repetition of the contentious disputes of bishops, and their insidious
   designs against one another; but more especially that it might be made
   apparent, that whenever the affairs of the state were disturbed, those
   of the Church, as if by some vital sympathy, became disordered also.
   [677] Indeed whoever shall attentively examine the subject will find,
   that the mischiefs of the state, and the troubles of the church have
   been inseparably connected; for he will perceive that they have either
   arisen together, or immediately succeeded one another. Sometimes the
   affairs of the Church come first in order; then commotions in the state
   follow, and sometimes the reverse, so that I cannot believe this
   invariable interchange is merely fortuitous, but am persuaded that it
   proceeds from our iniquities; and that these evils are inflicted upon
   us as merited chastisements, if indeed as the apostle truly says, Some
   men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men
   they follow after.' [678] For this reason we have interwoven many
   affairs of the state with our ecclesiastical history. Of the wars
   carried on during the reign of Constantine we have made no mention,
   having found no account of them that could be depended upon because of
   their iniquity: but of subsequent events, as much information as we
   could gather from those still living [679] in the order of their
   occurrence, we have passed in rapid review. We have continually
   included the emperors in these historical details; because from the
   time they began to profess the Christian religion, the affairs of the
   Church have depended on them, so that even the greatest Synods have
   been, and still are convened by their appointment. Finally, we have
   particularly noticed the Arian heresy, because it has so greatly
   disquieted the churches. Let these remarks be considered sufficient in
   the way of preface: we shall now proceed with our history.

   [677] The views here expressed show a crude conception of the vital
   relation between church and state. The very tone of apology which
   tinges their expression is based on a misconception of the idea of
   history. But Socrates was not below his age in this respect. See
   Introd., p. xiii.

   Chapter I.--After the Death of Valens the Goths again attack
   Constantinople, and are repulsed by the Citizens, aided by Some Saracen
   Auxiliaries.

   After the Emperor Valens had thus lost his life, in a manner which has
   never been satisfactorily ascertained, [680] the barbarians again
   approached the very walls of Constantinople, and laid waste the suburbs
   on every side of it. Whereat the people becoming indignant armed
   themselves with whatever weapons they could severally lay hands on, and
   sallied forth of their own accord against the enemy. The empress
   Dominica caused the same pay to be distributed out of the imperial
   treasury to such as volunteered to go out on this service, as was
   usually allowed to soldiers. A few Saracens also assisted the citizens,
   being confederates, who had been sent by Mavia their queen: the latter
   we have already mentioned. [681] In this way the people having fought
   at this time, the barbarians retired to a great distance from the city.

   Chapter II.--The Emperor Gratian recalls the Orthodox Bishops, and
   expels the Heretics from the Churches. He takes Theodosius as his
   Colleague in the Empire.

   Gratian being now in possession of the empire, together with
   Valentinian the younger, and condemning the cruel policy of his uncle
   Valens towards the [orthodox] Christians, recalled those whom he had
   sent into exile. He moreover enacted that persons of all sects, without
   distinction, might securely assemble together in their churches; and
   that only the Eunomians, [682] Photinians, [683] and Manichæans [684]
   should be excluded from the churches. Being also sensible of the
   languishing condition of the Roman empire, and of the growing power of
   the barbarians and perceiving that the state was in need of a brave and
   prudent man, he took Theodosius as his colleague in the sovereign
   power. This [Theodosius] was descended from a noble family in Spain,
   and had acquired so distinguished a celebrity for his prowess in the
   wars, that he was universally considered worthy of imperial dignity,
   even before Gratian's election of him. Having therefore proclaimed him
   emperor at Sirmium a city of Illyricum in the consulate [685] of
   Ausonius and Olybrius, on the 16th of January, he divided with him the
   care of managing the war against the barbarians.

   Chapter III.--The Principal Bishops who flourished at that Time.

   Now at this time Damasus who had succeeded Liberius then presided over
   the church at Rome. Cyril was still in possession of that at Jerusalem.
   The Antiochian church, as we have stated, was divided into three parts:
   for the Arians had chosen Dorotheus as the successor of their bishop
   Euzoïus; while one portion of the rest was under the government of
   Paulinus, and the others ranged themselves with Melitius, who had been
   recalled from exile. Lucius, although absent, having been compelled to
   leave Alexandria, yet maintained the episcopal authority among the
   Arians of that city; the Homoousians there being headed by Timothy, who
   succeeded Peter. At Constantinople Demophilus the successor of Eudoxius
   presided over the Arian faction, and was in possession of the churches;
   but those who were averse to communion with him held their assemblies
   apart. [686]

   Chapter IV.--The Macedonians, who had subscribed the Homoousian'
   Doctrine, return to their Former Error.

   After the deputation from the Macedonians to Liberius, that sect was
   admitted to entire communion with the churches in every city,
   intermixing themselves indiscriminately with those who from the
   beginning had embraced the form of faith published at Nicæa. But when
   the law of the Emperor Gratian permitted the several sects to reunite
   without restraint in the public services of religion, they again
   resolved to separate themselves; and having met at Antioch in Syria,
   they decided to avoid the word homoousios again, and in no way to hold
   communion with the supporters of the Nicene Creed. They however derived
   no advantage from this attempt; for the majority of their own party
   being disgusted at the fickleness with which they sometimes maintained
   one opinion, and then another, withdrew from them, and thenceforward
   became firm adherents of those who professed the doctrine of the
   homoousion. [687]
     __________________________________________________________________

   to the Nicene Creed, through which they prevailed upon Liberius to
   receive them into the communion of the church, see IV. 12.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter V.--Events at Antioch in Connection with Paulinus and Meletius.

   About this time a serious contest was excited at Antioch in Syria, on
   account of Melitius. We have already observed [688] that Paulinus,
   bishop of that city, because of his eminent piety was not sent into
   exile: and that Melitius after being restored by Julian, was again
   banished by Valens, and at length recalled in Gratian's reign. [689] On
   his return to Antioch, he found Paulinus greatly enfeebled by old age;
   his partisans therefore immediately used their utmost endeavors to get
   him associated with that bishop in the episcopal office. And when
   Paulinus declared that it was contrary to the canons [690] to take as a
   coadjutor one who had been ordained by the Arians,' the people had
   recourse to violence, and caused him to be consecrated in one of the
   churches without the city. When this was done, a great disturbance
   arose; but afterwards the people were brought to unite on the following
   stipulations. Having assembled such of the clergy as might be
   considered worthy candidates for the bishopric, they found them six in
   number, of whom Flavian was one. All these they bound by an oath, not
   to use any effort to get themselves ordained, when either of the two
   bishops should die, but to permit the survivor to retain undisturbed
   possession of the see of the deceased. [691] Thus pledges were given,
   and the people had peace and so no longer quarreled with one another.
   The Luciferians, [692] however, separated themselves from the rest,
   because Melitius who had been ordained by the Arians was admitted to
   the episcopate. In this state of the Antiochian church, Melitius was
   under the necessity of going to Constantinople.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [688] Cf. III. 9, and IV. 2.

   [689] See above, chap. 3.

   [690] In its eighth canon the Council of Nicæa, looking forward to the
   reconciliation of such Novatians or Cathari as might desire to return
   to the Catholic Church, enjoins that when in villages or in cities
   there are found only clergy of their own sect (Cathari), the oldest of
   these clerics shall remain among the clergy, and in their position; but
   if a Catholic priest or bishop be found among them, it is evident that
   the bishop of the Catholic Church should preserve the episcopal dignity
   whilst any one who has received the title of bishop from the so-called
   Cathari would only have a right to the honors accorded to priests,
   unless the bishop thinks it right to let him enjoy the honor of the
   title. If he does not desire to do so let him give him the place of
   rural bishop (chorepiscopus) or priest, in order that he may appear to
   be altogether a part of the clergy, and that there may not be two
   bishops in the same city.' Cf. Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Vol. I.
   p. 410; Bingham, Christ. Antiq. II. 13. 1 and 2.

   [691] Theodoret (H. E. V. 3) gives a different account of the way in
   which the dispute between Melitius and Paulinus came to an end, giving
   the glory to Melitius for the eirenic overture above described, and
   representing Paulinus as constrained to accept it against his will by
   the political head of the community.

   Chapter VI.--Gregory of Nazianzus is transferred to the See of
   Constantinople. The Emperor Theodosius falling Sick at Thessalonica,
   after his Victory over the Barbarians, is there baptized by Ascholius
   the Bishop.

   By the common suffrage of many bishops, Gregory was at this time
   translated from the see of Nazianzus to that of Constantinople, [693]
   and this happened in the manner before described. About the same time
   the emperors Gratian and Theodosius each obtained a victory over the
   barbarians. [694] And Gratian immediately set out for Gaul, because the
   Alemanni were ravaging those provinces: but Theodosius, after erecting
   a trophy, hastened towards Constantinople, and arrived at Thessalonica.
   There he was taken dangerously ill, and expressed a desire to receive
   Christian baptism. [695] Now he had been instructed in Christian
   principles by his ancestors, and professed the homoousian' faith.
   Becoming increasingly anxious to be baptized therefore, as his malady
   grew worse, he sent for the bishop of Thessalonica, and first asked him
   what doctrinal views he held? The bishop having replied, that the
   opinion of Arius had not yet invaded the provinces of Illyricum, nor
   had the novelty to which that heretic had given birth begun to prey
   upon the churches in those countries; but they continued to preserve
   unshaken that faith which from the beginning was delivered by the
   apostles, and had been confirmed in the Nicene Synod,' the emperor was
   most gladly baptized by the bishop Ascholius; and having recovered from
   his disease not many days after, he came to Constantinople on the
   twenty-fourth of November, in the fifth consulate of Gratian, and the
   first of his own. [696]

   was not thought essential to one's title to be called a Christian.
   Theodosius and Constantine were both considered Christians and
   professed the homoousian faith, and yet they both postponed their
   baptism to what they believed to be the latest moments of their lives.'

   Chapter VII.--Gregory, finding Some Dissatisfaction about his
   Appointment, abdicates the Episcopate of Constantinople. The Emperor
   orders Demophilus the Arian Bishop either to assent to the Homoousion,'
   or leave the City. He chooses the Latter.

   Now at that time Gregory of Nazianzus, after his translation to
   Constantinople, held his assemblies within the city in a small oratory,
   adjoining to which the emperors afterwards built a magnificent church,
   and named it Anastasia. [697] But Gregory, who far excelled in
   eloquence and piety all those of the age in which he lived,
   understanding that some murmured at his preferment because he was a
   stranger, after expressing his joy at the emperor's arrival, resigned
   the bishopric of Constantinople. When the emperor found the church in
   this state, he began to consider by what means he could make peace,
   effect a union, and enlarge the churches. Immediately, therefore, he
   intimated his desire to Demophilus, [698] who presided over the Arian
   party; and enquired whether he was willing to assent to the Nicene
   Creed, and thus reunite the people, and establish peace. Upon
   Demophilus' declining to accede to this proposal, the emperor said to
   him, Since you reject peace and harmony, I order you to quit the
   churches.' When Demophilus heard this, weighing with himself the
   difficulty of contending against superior power, he convoked his
   followers in the church, and standing in the midst of them, thus spoke:
   Brethren, it is written in the Gospel, [699] "If they persecute you in
   one city, flee ye into another." Since therefore the emperor needs the
   churches, take notice that we will henceforth hold our assemblies
   without the city.' Having said this he departed; not however as rightly
   apprehending the meaning of that expression in the Evangelist, for the
   real import of the sacred oracle is that such as would avoid the course
   of this world must seek the heavenly Jerusalem. [700] He therefore went
   outside the city gates, and there in future held his assemblies. With
   him also Lucius went out, who being ejected from Alexandria, as we have
   before related, [701] had made his escape to Constantinople, and there
   abode. Thus the Arians, after having been in possession of the churches
   for forty years, were in consequence of their opposition to the peace
   proposed by the emperor Theodosius, driven out of the city, in
   Gratian's fifth consulate, [702] and the first of Theodosius Angustus,
   on the 26th of November. The adherents of the homoousian' faith in this
   manner regained possession of the churches.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [697] It appears from several places in Gregory's writings (cf. Somn.
   de Anastasia, Ad Popul. Anast. and Carmen de Vita Sua, 1709) that he
   himself had used the name of Anastasia in speaking of the church, so
   that Socrates' statement that it was so called afterwards must be taken
   as inaccurate. It also appears that Gregory gave the name Anastasia to
   the house which he used as a church, and meant to signify by the name
   (Anastation = Resurrection) the resurrection of the orthodox community
   of Constantinople. It is possible, of course, that Socrates here means
   that the emperors later adopted the name given by Gregory on the
   occasion of building a large church in place of the original chapel.

   Chapter VIII.--A Synod consisting of One Hundred and Fifty Bishops
   meets at Constantinople. The Decrees passed. Ordination of Nectarius.

   The emperor making no delay summoned a Synod [703] of the prelates of
   his own faith, in order that he might establish the Nicene Creed, and
   appoint a bishop of Constantinople: and inasmuch as he was not without
   hope that he might win the Macedonians over to his own views, he
   invited those who presided over that sect to be present also. There met
   therefore on this occasion of the Homoousian party, Timothy from
   Alexandria, Cyril from Jerusalem, who at that time recognized the
   doctrine of homoousion, [704] having retracted his former opinion;
   Melitius from Antioch, he having arrived there previously to assist at
   the installation of Gregory; Ascholius also from Thessalonica, and many
   others, amounting in all to one hundred and fifty. Of the Macedonians,
   the leaders were Eleusius of Cyzicus, and Marcian of Lampsacus; these
   with the rest, most of whom came from the cities of the Hellespont,
   were thirty-six in number. Accordingly they were assembled in the month
   of May, under the consulate [705] of Eucharius and Evagrius, and the
   emperor used his utmost exertions, in conjunction with the bishops who
   entertained similar sentiments to his own, to bring over Eleusius and
   his adherents to his own side. They were reminded of the deputation
   they had sent by Eustathius to Liberius [706] then bishop of Rome; that
   they had of their own accord not long before entered into promiscuous
   communion with the orthodox; and the inconsistency and fickleness of
   their conduct was represented to them, in now attempting to subvert the
   faith which they once acknowledged, and professed agreement with the
   catholics in. But they paying little heed alike to admonitions and
   reproofs, chose rather to maintain the Arian dogma, than to assent to
   the homoousian' doctrine. Having made this declaration, they departed
   from Constantinople; moreover they wrote to their partisans in every
   city, and charged them by no means to harmonize with the creed of the
   Nicene Synod. The bishops of the other party remaining at
   Constantinople, entered into a consultation about the ordination of a
   bishop; for Gregory, as we have before said, [707] had resigned that
   see, and was preparing to return to Nazianzus. Now there was a person
   named Nectarius, of a senatorial family, mild and gentle in his
   manners, and admirable in his whole course of life, although he at that
   time bore the office of proctor. This man was seized upon by the
   people, and elected [708] to the episcopate, and was ordained
   accordingly by one hundred and fifty bishops then present. The same
   prelates moreover published a decree, [709] prescribing that the bishop
   of Constantinople should have the next prerogative of honor after the
   bishop of Rome, because that city was New Rome.' They also again
   confirmed the Nicene Creed. Then too patriarchs were constituted, and
   the provinces distributed, so that no bishop might exercise any
   jurisdiction over other churches [710] out of his own diocese: for this
   had been often indiscriminately done before, in consequence of the
   persecutions. To Nectarius therefore was allotted the great city and
   Thrace. Helladius, the successor of Basil in the bishopric of Cæsarea
   in Cappadocia, obtained the patriarchate of the diocese of Pontus in
   conjunction with Gregory Basil's brother, bishop of Nyssa [711] in
   Cappadocia, and Otreïus bishop of Melitina in Armenia. To Amphilochius
   of Iconium and Optimus of Antioch in Pisidia, was the Asiatic diocese
   assigned. The superintendence of the churches throughout Egypt was
   committed to Timothy of Alexandria. On Pelagius of Laodicea, and
   Diodorus of Tarsus, devolved the administration of the churches of the
   East; without infringement however on the prerogatives of honor
   reserved to the Antiochian church, and conferred on Melitius then
   present. They further decreed that as necessity required it, the
   ecclesiastical affairs of each province should be managed by a Synod of
   the province. These arrangements were confirmed by the emperor's
   approbation. Such was the result of this Synod.

   [703] Cf. parallel account in Sozom. VII. 7-9; Theodoret, H. E. V. 8.
   The Synod of Constantinople was the second great oecumenical or general
   council. Its title as an oecumenical council has not been disputed,
   although no Western bishop attended. Baronius, however (Annal. 381,
   notes 19, 20), attempts to prove, but unsuccessfully, that Pope Damasus
   summoned the council. For a full account of the council, see Hefele,
   History of the Councils, Vol. II. p. 340-374.

   [709] Canon 3 of the Synod; see Hefele, History of the Councils, Vol.
   II. p. 357. The canon is given by Socrates entire and in the original
   words. Valesius holds that the primacy conferred by this canon on the
   Constantinopolitan see was one of honor merely, and involved no
   prerogatives of patriarchal or metropolitan jurisdiction. For a full
   discussion of its significance, see Hefele, as above. The Council of
   Chalcedon in 451 confirmed the above action in the following words: We
   following in all things the decision of the Holy Fathers, and
   acknowledging the canon of the one hundred and fifty bishops...do also
   determine and decree the same things respecting the privileges of the
   most holy city of Constantinople, New Rome. For the Fathers properly
   gave the primacy to the throne of the elder Rome.' Canon 28.

   [710] Canon 2. The words patriarch,' however, and patriarchate' are not
   used in the canon. According to Sophocles (Greek Lexicon) the modern
   sense of these words was introduced at the close of the fourth century.
   Valesius holds that the sixth canon of the Nicene Council had given
   sanction to the principle of patriarchal authority; but Beveridge is of
   opinion that patriarchs were first constituted by the second general
   council. Hefele takes substantially the same position as Valesius. See
   discussion of the subject in Hefele, Hist. of the Councils, Vol. I. p.

   Chapter IX.--The Body of Paul, Bishop of Constantinople, is honorably
   transferred from his Place of Exile. Death of Meletius.

   The emperor at that time caused to be removed from the city of Ancyra,
   the body of the bishop Paul, whom Philip the prefect of the Prætorium
   [712] had banished at the instigation of Macedonius, and ordered to be
   strangled at Cucusus a town of Armenia, as I have already mentioned.
   [713] He therefore received the remains with great reverence and honor,
   and deposited in the church which now takes its name from him; which
   the Macedonian party were formerly in possession of while they remained
   separate from the Arians, but were expelled at that time by the
   emperor, because they refused to adopt his sentiments. About this
   period Melitius, bishop of Antioch, fell sick and died: in whose praise
   Gregory, the brother of Basil, pronounced a funeral oration. The body
   of the deceased bishop was by his friends conveyed to Antioch; where
   those who had identified themselves with his interests again refused
   subjection to Paulinus, but caused Flavian to be substituted in the
   place of Melitius, and the people began to quarrel anew. Thus again the
   Antiochian church was divided into rival factions, not grounded on any
   difference of faith, but simply on a preference of bishops.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [712] Constantine made an advance on his predecessors by dividing the
   management of the empire among four prefects of the prætorium, which
   they had committed to two officers of that name. These four were
   apportioned as follows: one to the East, a second to Illyricum, a third
   to Italy, and a fourth to Gaul. Each of these prefects had a number of
   dioceses under him, and each diocese was a combination of several
   provinces into one territory. In conformity with this model of civil
   government the church abandoned gradually and naturally its
   metropolitan administration of the provinces and adopted the diocesan.
   The exact time of the change is, of course, uncertain, it having come
   about gradually. It is safe, however, to put it between the Nicene and
   Constantinopolitan councils. The Fathers in the latter of those
   councils seem to find it in practical operation and confirm it (Cf.
   Canon 2 of the councils), decreeing explicitly that it should be
   unlawful for clerics to perform any office or transact any business in
   their official character outside of the bounds of the diocese wherein
   they were placed, just as it was unlawful for the civil officer to
   intermeddle in any affair outside the limits of his civil diocese.

   Chapter X.--The Emperor orders a Convention composed of All the Various
   Sects. Arcadius is proclaimed Augustus. The Novatians permitted to hold
   their Assemblies in the City of Constantinople: Other Heretics driven
   out.

   Great disturbances occurred in other cities also, as the Arians were
   ejected from the churches. But I cannot sufficiently admire the
   emperor's prudence in this contingency. For he was unwilling to fill
   the cities with disturbance, as far as this was dependent on him, and
   so after a very short time [714] he called together a general
   conference of the sects, thinking that by a discussion among their
   bishops, their mutual differences might be adjusted, and unanimity
   established. And this purpose of the emperor's I am persuaded was the
   reason that his affairs were so prosperous at that time. In fact by a
   special dispensation of Divine Providence the barbarous nations were
   reduced to subjection under him: and among others, Athanaric king of
   the Goths made a voluntary surrender of himself to him, [715] with all
   his people, and died soon after at Constantinople. At this juncture the
   emperor proclaimed his son Arcadius Augustus, on the sixteenth of
   January, in the second consulate [716] of Merobaudes and Saturnilus.
   Not long afterwards in the month of June, under the same consulate, the
   bishops of every sect arrived from all places: the emperor, therefore,
   sent for Nectarius the bishop, and consulted with him on the best means
   of freeing the Christian religion from dissensions, and reducing the
   church to a state of unity. The subjects of controversy,' said he,
   ought to be fairly discussed, that by the detection and removal of the
   sources of discord, a universal agreement may be effected.' Hearing
   this proposition Nectarius fell into uneasiness, and communicated it to
   Agelius bishop of the Novatians, inasmuch as he entertained the same
   sentiments as himself in matters of faith. This man, though eminently
   pious, was by no means competent to maintain a dispute on doctrinal
   points; he therefore proposed to refer the subject to Sisinnius [717]
   his reader, as a fit person to manage a conference. Sisinnius, who was
   not only learned, but possessed of great experience, and was well
   informed both in the expositions of the sacred Scriptures and the
   principles of philosophy, being convinced that disputations, far from
   healing divisions usually create heresies of a more inveterate
   character, gave the following advice to Nectarius, knowing well that
   the ancients have nowhere attributed a beginning of existence to the
   Son of God, conceiving him to be co-eternal with the Father, he advised
   that they should avoid dialectic warfare and bring forward as evidences
   of the truth the testimonies of the ancients. Let the emperor,' said
   he, demand of the heads of each sect, whether they would pay any
   deference to the ancients who flourished before schism distracted the
   church; or whether they would repudiate them, as alienated from the
   Christian faith? If they reject their authority, then let them also
   anathematize them: and should they presume to take such a step, they
   would themselves be instantly thrust out by the people, and so the
   truth will be manifestly victorious. But if, on the other hand, they
   are not willing to set aside the fathers, it will then be our business
   to produce their books, by which our views will be fully attested.'
   Nectarius having heard these words of Sisinnius, hastened to the
   palace, and acquainted the emperor with the plan which had been
   suggested to him; who at once perceiving its wisdom and propriety,
   carried it into execution with consummate prudence. For without
   discovering his object, he simply asked the chiefs of the heretics
   whether they had any respect for and would accept the teachings of
   those teachers who lived previous to the dissension in the church? As
   they did not repudiate them, but replied that they highly revered them
   as their masters; the emperor enquired of them again whether they would
   defer to them as accredited witnesses of Christian doctrine? At this
   question, the leaders of the several parties, with their logical
   champions,--for many had come prepared for sophistical debate,--found
   themselves extremely embarrassed. For a division was caused among them
   as some acquiesced in the reasonableness of the emperor's proposition
   while others shrunk from it, conscious that it was by no means
   favorable to their interests: so that all being variously affected
   towards the writings of the ancients, they could no longer agree among
   themselves, dissenting not only from other sects, but those of the same
   sect differing from one another. Accordant malice therefore, like the
   tongue of the giants of old, was confounded, and their tower of
   mischief overturned. [718] The emperor perceiving by their confusion
   that their sole confidence was in subtle arguments, and that they
   feared to appeal to the expositions of the fathers, had recourse to
   another method: he commanded every sect to set forth in writing their
   own peculiar tenets. Accordingly those who were accounted the most
   skillful among them, drew up a statement of their respective creeds,
   couched in terms the most circumspect they could devise; a day was
   appointed, and the bishops selected for this purpose presented
   themselves at the palace. Nectarius and Agelius appeared as the
   defenders of the homoousian' faith; Demophilus supported the Arian
   dogma; Eunomius himself undertook the cause of the Eunomians; and
   Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus, represented the opinions of those who were
   denominated Macedonians. The emperor gave them all a courteous
   reception; and receiving from each their written avowal of faith, he
   shut himself up alone, and prayed very earnestly that God would assist
   him in his endeavors to ascertain the truth. Then perusing with great
   care the statement which each had submitted to him, he condemned all
   the rest, inasmuch as they introduced a separation of the Trinity, and
   approved of that only which contained the doctrine of the homoousion.
   This decision caused the Novatians to flourish again, and hold their
   meetings within the city: for the emperor delighted with the agreement
   of their profession with that which he embraced, promulgated a law
   securing to them the peaceful possession of their own church buildings,
   and assigned to their churches equal privileges with those to which he
   gave his more especial sanction. But the bishops of the other sects, on
   account of their disagreement among themselves, were despised and
   censured even by their own followers: so that overwhelmed with
   perplexity and vexation they departed, addressing consolatory letters
   to their adherents, whom they exhorted not to be troubled because many
   had deserted them and gone over to the homoousian party; for they said,
   Many are called, but few chosen' [719] --an expression which they never
   used when on account of force and terror the majority of the people was
   on their side. Nevertheless the orthodox believers were not wholly
   exempt from inquietude; for the affairs of the Antiochian church caused
   divisions among those who were present at the Synod. The bishops of
   Egypt, Arabia and Cyprus, combined against Flavian, and insisted on his
   expulsion from Antioch: but those of Palestine, Phoenicia, and Syria,
   contended with equal zeal in his favor. What result issued from this
   contest I shall describe in its proper place. [720]

   Chapter XI.--The Emperor Gratian is slain by the Treachery of the
   Usurper Maximus. From Fear of him Justina ceases persecuting Ambrose.

   Nearly at the same time with the holding of these Synods at
   Constantinople, the following events occurred in the Western parts.
   Maximus, from the island of Britain, rebelled against the Roman empire,
   and attacked Gratian, who was then wearied and exhausted in a war with
   the Alemanni. [721] In Italy, Valentinian being still a minor, Probus,
   a man of consular dignity, had the chief administration of affairs, and
   was at that time prefect of the Prætorium. Justina, the mother of the
   young prince, who entertained Arian sentiments, as long as her husband
   lived had been unable to molest the Homoousians; but going to Milan
   while her son was still young, she manifested great hostility to
   Ambrose the bishop, and commanded that he should be banished. [722]
   While the people from their excessive attachment to Ambrose, were
   offering resistance to those who were charged with taking him into
   exile, intelligence was brought that Gratian had been assassinated by
   the treachery of the usurper Maximus. In fact Andragathius, a general
   under Maximus, having concealed himself in a litter resembling a couch,
   which was carried by mules, ordered his guards to spread a report
   before him that the litter contained the Emperor Gratian's wife. They
   met the emperor near the city of Lyons in France just as he had crossed
   the river: who believing it to be his wife, and not suspecting any
   treachery, fell into the hands of his enemy as a blind man into the
   ditch; for Andragathius, suddenly springing forth from the litter, slew
   him. [723] Gratian thus perished in the consulate of Merogaudes and
   Saturninus, [724] in the twenty-fourth year of his age, and the
   fifteenth of his reign. When this happened the Empress Justina's
   indignation against Ambrose was repressed. Afterwards Valentinian most
   unwillingly, but constrained by the necessity of the time, admitted
   Maximus as his colleague in the empire. Probus alarmed at the power of
   Maximus, resolved to retreat into the regions of the East: leaving
   Italy therefore, he proceeded to Illyricum, and fixed his residence at
   Thessalonica a city of Macedonia.

   Chapter XII.--While the Emperor Theodosius is engaged in Military
   Preparations against Maximus, his Son Honorius is born. He then
   proceeds to Milan in Order to encounter the Usurper.

   But the Emperor Theodosius was filled with great solicitude, and levied
   a powerful army against the usurper, fearing lest he should meditate
   the assassination of the young Valentinian also. While engaged in this
   preparation, an embassy arrived from the Persians, requesting peace
   from the emperor. Then also the empress Flaccilla bore him a son named
   Honorius, on the 9th of September, in the consulate of Richomelius and
   Clearchus. [725] Under the same consulate, and a little previously,
   Agelius bishop of the Novatians died. [726] In the year following,
   wherein Arcadius Augustus bore his first consulate in conjunction with
   Baudon, [727] Timothy bishop of Alexandria died, and was succeeded in
   the episcopate by Theophilus. About a year after this, Demophilus the
   Arian prelate having departed this life, the Arians sent for Marinus a
   leader of their own heresy out of Thrace, to whom they entrusted the
   bishopric: but Marinus did not long occupy that position, for under him
   that sect was divided into two parties, as we shall hereafter explain;
   [728] for they invited Dorotheus [729] to come to them from Antioch in
   Syria, and constituted him their bishop. Meanwhile the emperor
   Theodosius proceeded to the war against Maximus, leaving his son
   Arcadius with imperial authority at Constantinople. Accordingly
   arriving at Thessalonica he found Valentinian and those about him in
   great anxiety, because through compulsion they had acknowledged the
   usurper as emperor. Theodosius, however, gave no expression to his
   sentiments in public; he neither rejected nor admitted [730] the
   embassy of Maximus: but unable to endure tyrannical domination over the
   Roman empire, under the assumption of an imperial name, he hastily
   mustered his forces and advanced to Milan, [731] whither the usurper
   had already gone.

   this period comes within the time of Socrates' history, he does not
   mention Honorius but once again before his death.

   Chapter XIII.--The Arians excite a Tumult at Constantinople.

   At the time when the emperor was thus occupied on his military
   expedition, the Arians excited a great tumult at Constantinople by such
   devices as these. Men are fond of fabricating statements respecting
   matters about which they are in ignorance; and if at any time they are
   given occasion they swell to a prodigious extent rumors concerning what
   they wish, being ever fond of change. This was strongly exemplified at
   Constantinople on the present occasion: for each invented news
   concerning the war which was carrying on at a distance, according to
   his own caprice, always presuming upon the most disastrous results; and
   before the contest had yet commenced, they spoke of transactions in
   reference to it, of which they knew nothing, with as much assurance as
   if they had been spectators on the very scene of action. Thus it was
   confidently affirmed that the usurper had defeated the emperor's army,'
   even the number of men slain on both sides being specified; and that
   the emperor himself had nearly fallen into the usurper's hands.' Then
   the Arians, who had been excessively exasperated by those being put in
   possession of the churches within the city who had previously been the
   objects of their persecution, began to augment these rumors by
   additions of their own. But since the currency of such stories with
   increasing exaggeration, in time made even the farmers themselves
   believe them--for those who had circulated them from hearsay, affirmed
   to the authors of these falsehoods, that the accounts they had received
   from them had been fully corroborated elsewhere; then indeed the Arians
   were emboldened to commit acts of violence, and among other outrages,
   to set fire to the house of Nectarius the bishop. This was done in the
   second consulate [732] of Theodosius Augustus, which he bore with
   Cynegius.

   Chapter XIV.--Overthrow and Death of the Usurper Maximus.

   As the emperor marched against the usurper the intelligence of the
   formidable preparations made by him so alarmed the troops under
   Maximus, that instead of fighting for him, they delivered him bound to
   the emperor, who caused him to be put to death, on the twenty-seventh
   of August, under the same consulate. [733] Andragathius, who with his
   own hand had slain Gratian, understanding the fate of Maximus,
   precipitated himself into the adjacent river, and was drowned. Then the
   victorious emperors made their public entry into Rome, accompanied by
   Honorius the son of Theodosius, still a mere boy, whom his father had
   sent for from Constantinople immediately after Maximus had been
   vanquished. They continued therefore at Rome celebrating their
   triumphal festivals: during which time the Emperor Theodosius exhibited
   a remarkable instance of clemency toward Symmachus, a man who had borne
   the consular office, and was at the head of the senate at Rome. For
   this Symmachus was distinguished for his eloquence, and many of his
   orations are still extant composed in the Latin tongue: but inasmuch as
   he had written a panegyric on Maximus, and pronounced it before him
   publicly, he was afterwards impeached for high treason; wherefore to
   escape capital punishment he took sanctuary in a church. [734] The
   emperor's veneration for religion led him not only to honor the bishops
   of his own communion, but to treat with consideration those of the
   Novatians also, who embraced the homoousian' creed: to gratify
   therefore Leontius the bishop of the Novatian church at Rome, who
   interceded in behalf of Symmachus, he graciously pardoned him for that
   crime. Symmachus, after he had obtained his pardon, wrote an apologetic
   address to the Emperor Theodosius. Thus the war, which at its
   commencement threatened so seriously, was brought to a speedy
   termination.

   [733] The same account is given in substance by Zosimus, IV. 46, who
   also confirms the statements of Socrates concerning the end of
   Andragathius. Valesius, however, relying on Idatius' Fasti, asserts
   that Maximus was put to death on the 28th of July, not on the 27th of
   August.

   Chapter XV.--Of Flavian Bishop of Antioch.

   About the same period, the following events took place at Antioch in
   Syria. After the death of Paulinus, the people who had been under his
   superintendence refused to submit to the authority of Flavian, but
   caused Evagrius to be ordained bishop of their own party. [735] As he
   did not survive his ordination long, no other was constituted in his
   place, Flavian having brought this about: nevertheless those who
   disliked Flavian on account of his having violated his oath, held their
   assemblies apart. [736] Meanwhile Flavian left no stone unturned,' as
   the phrase is, to bring these also under his control; and this he soon
   after effected, when he appeased the anger of Theophilus, then bishop
   of Alexandria, by whose mediation he conciliated, Damasus bishop of
   Rome also. For both these had been greatly displeased with Flavian, as
   well for the perjury of which he had been guilty, as for the schism he
   had occasioned among the previously united people. Theophilus therefore
   being pacified, sent Isidore a presbyter to Rome, and thus reconciled
   Damasus, who was still offended; representing to him the propriety of
   overlooking Flavian's past misconduct, for the sake of producing
   concord among the people. Communion being in this way restored to
   Flavian, the people of Antioch were in the course of a little while
   induced to acquiesce in the union secured. Such was the conclusion of
   this affair at Antioch. But the Arians of that city being ejected from
   the churches, were accustomed to hold their meetings in the suburbs.
   Meanwhile Cyril bishop of Jerusalem having died about this time, [737]
   was succeeded by John.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [735] Theodoret (H. E. V. 23) says that there was a double violation of
   order in the ordination of Evagrius; first in that he was ordained by
   his predecessor, and secondly in that he was ordained by one bishop,
   whereas the canon required that not less than three should take part in
   an episcopal ordination.

   Chapter XVI.--Demolition of the Idolatrous Temples at Alexandria, and
   the Consequent Conflict between the Pagans and Christians.

   At the solicitation of Theophilus bishop of Alexandria the emperor
   issued an order at this time for the demolition of the heathen temples
   in that city; commanding also that it should be put in execution under
   the direction of Theophilus. Seizing this opportunity, Theophilus
   exerted himself to the utmost to expose the pagan mysteries to
   contempt. And to begin with, he caused the Mithreum [738] to be cleaned
   out, and exhibited to public view the tokens of its bloody mysteries.
   Then he destroyed the Serapeum, and the bloody rights of the Mithreum
   he publicly caricatured; the Serapeum also he showed full of
   extravagant superstitions, and he had the phalli of Priapus carried
   through the midst of the forum. The pagans of Alexandria, and
   especially the professors of philosophy, were unable to repress their
   rage at this exposure, and exceeded in revengeful ferocity their
   outrages on a former occasion: for with one accord, at a preconcerted
   signal, they rushed impetuously upon the Christians, and murdered every
   one they could lay hands on. The Christians also made an attempt to
   resist the assailants, and so the mischief was the more augmented. This
   desperate affray was prolonged until satiety of bloodshed put an end to
   it. Then it was discovered that very few of the heathens had been
   killed, but a great number of Christians; while the number of wounded
   on each side was almost innumerable. Fear then possessed the pagans on
   account of what was done, as they considered the emperor's displeasure.
   For having done what seemed good in their own eyes, and by their
   bloodshed having quenched their courage, some fled in one direction,
   some in another, and many quitting Alexandria, dispersed themselves in
   various cities. Among these were the two grammarians Helladius and
   Ammonius, whose pupil I was in my youth at Constantinople. [739]
   Helladius was said to be the priest of Jupiter, and Ammonius of Simius.
   [740] Thus this disturbance having been terminated, the governor of
   Alexandria, and the commander-in-chief of the troops in Egypt, assisted
   Theophilus in demolishing the heathen temples. These were therefore
   razed to the ground, and the images of their gods molten into pots and
   other convenient utensils for the use of the Alexandrian church; for
   the emperor had instructed Theophilus to distribute them for the relief
   of the poor. All the images were accordingly broken to pieces, except
   one statue of the god before mentioned, which Theophilus preserved and
   set up in a public place; Lest,' said he, at a future time the heathens
   should deny that they had ever worshiped such gods.' This action gave
   great umbrage to Ammonius the grammarian in particular, who to my
   knowledge was accustomed to say that the religion of the Gentiles was
   grossly abused in that that single statue was not also molten, but
   preserved, in order to render that religion ridiculous.' Helladius
   however boasted in the presence of some that he had slain in that
   desperate onset nine men with his own hand. Such were the doings at
   Alexandria at that time.

   Chapter XVII.--Of the Hieroglyphics found in the Temple of Serapis.

   When the Temple of Serapis was torn down and laid bare, there were
   found in it, engraven on stones, certain characters which they call
   hieroglyphics, having the forms of crosses. [741] Both the Christians
   and pagans on seeing them, appropriated and applied them to their
   respective religions: for the Christians who affirm that the cross is
   the sign of Christ's saving passion, claimed this character as
   peculiarly theirs; but the pagans alleged that it might appertain to
   Christ and Serapis in common; for,' said they, it symbolizes one thing
   to Christians and another to heathens.' Whilst this point was
   controverted amongst them, some of the heathen converts to
   Christianity, who were conversant with these hieroglyphic characters,
   interpreted the form of a cross and said that it signifies Life to
   come.' This the Christians exultingly laid hold of, as decidedly
   favorable to their religion. But after other hieroglyphics had been
   deciphered containing a prediction that When the cross should
   appear,'--for this was life to come,'--the Temple of Serapis would be
   destroyed,' a very great number of the pagans embraced Christianity,
   and confessing their sins, were baptized. Such are the reports I have
   heard respecting the discovery of this symbol in form of a cross. But I
   cannot imagine that the Egyptian priests foreknew the things concerning
   Christ, when they engraved the figure of a cross. For if the advent' of
   our Saviour into the world was a mystery hid from ages and from
   generations,' [742] as the apostle declares; and if the devil himself,
   the prince of wickedness, knew nothing of it, his ministers, the
   Egyptian priests, are likely to have been still more ignorant of the
   matter; but Providence doubtless purposed that in the enquiry
   concerning this character, there should something take place analogous
   to what happened heretofore at the preaching of Paul. For he, made wise
   by the Divine Spirit, employed a similar method in relation to the
   Athenians, [743] and brought over many of them to the faith, when on
   reading the inscription on one of their altars, he accommodated and
   applied it to his own discourse. Unless indeed any one should say, that
   the Word of God wrought in the Egyptian priests, as it did on Balaam
   [744] and Caiaphas; [745] for these men uttered prophecies of good
   things in spite of themselves. This will suffice on the subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [741] There are several cruciform signs among the Egyptian
   hieroglyphics, as e.g. the simple determinative 5, meaning to cross,'
   to multiply,' to mix' (see Birch, Egyptian Texts, p. 99); or the
   syllabic *, phonetically equivalent to am (see Birch, ibid. p. 101); or
   the cross with a ring at the head *; or the still more elaborate * (see
   Brugsh, Thesaurus Inscript. Egyptiacarum, p. 20; also Champollion,
   Grammaire Egyptienne, XII. p. 365, 440). To which of these Socrates
   refers it is impossible to say from their mere form. They occur
   commonly and we must infer that the discovery described in this passage
   is not the first bringing into light of the sign mentioned, but its
   occurrence in the Serapeum. The third of the above signs is usually
   interpreted as life' either happy' or immortal,' which agrees with the
   meaning given to the cruciform sign here mentioned.

   Chapter XVIII.--Reformation of Abuses at Rome by the Emperor
   Theodosius.

   The emperor Theodosius during his short stay in Italy, conferred the
   greatest benefit on the city of Rome, by grants on the one hand, and
   abrogations on the other. His largesses were indeed very munificent;
   and he removed two most infamous abuses which existed in the city. One
   of them was the following: there were buildings of immense magnitude,
   erected in ancient Rome in former times, in which bread was made for
   distribution among the people. [746] Those who had the charge of these
   edifices, who Mancipes [747] were called in the Latin language, in
   process of time converted them into receptacles for thieves. Now as the
   bake-houses in these structures were placed underneath, they build
   taverns at the side of each, where they kept prostitutes; by which
   means they entrapped many of those who went thither either for the sake
   of refreshment, or to gratify their lusts, for by a certain mechanical
   contrivance they precipitated them from the tavern into the bake-house
   below. This was practiced chiefly upon strangers; and such as were in
   this way kidnapped were compelled to work in the bake-houses, where
   many of them were immured until old age, not being allowed to go out,
   and giving the impression to their friends that they were dead. It
   happened that one of the soldiers of the emperor Theodosius fell into
   this snare; who being shut up in the bake-house, and hindered from
   going out, drew a dagger which he wore and killed those who stood in
   his way: the rest being terrified, suffered him to escape. When the
   emperor was made acquainted with the circumstance he punished the
   Mancipes, and ordered these haunts of lawless and abandoned characters
   to be pulled down. This was one of the disgraceful nuisances of which
   the emperor purged the imperial city: the other was of this nature.
   When a woman was detected in adultery, they punished the delinquent not
   in the way of correction but rather of aggravation of her crime. For
   shutting her up in a narrow brothel, they obliged her to prostitute
   herself in a most disgusting manner; causing little bells to be rung at
   the time of the unclean deed that those who passed might not be
   ignorant of what was doing within. This was doubtless intended to brand
   the crime with greater ignominy in public opinion. As soon as the
   emperor was apprised of this indecent usage, he would by no means
   tolerate it; but having ordered the Sistra [748] --for so these places
   of penal prostitution were denominated--to be pulled down, he appointed
   other laws for the punishment of adulteresses. [749] Thus did the
   emperor Theodosius free the city from two of its most discreditable
   abuses: and when he had arranged all other affairs to his satisfaction,
   he left the emperor Valentinian at Rome, and returned himself with his
   son Honorius to Constantinople, and entered that city of the 10th of
   November, in the consulate of Tatian and Symmachus. [750]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [746] In the earlier periods of Roman history the government undertook
   to regulate the price of corn, so as to protect the poorer classes; in
   time of scarcity the government was to purchase the grain and sell it
   at a moderate price. This provision was gradually changed into a
   dispensation of public charity, at first by the sale of the grain below
   cost, and afterwards by the gratuitous distribution of the same. Some
   time before the reign of Aurelian, 270-275 a.d., the distribution of
   grain seems to have given place to the distribution of bread. Such
   distribution was made after the reign of Constantine at Constantinople
   as well as at Rome. See Smith, Dict. of the Greek and Rom. Antiq., art.

   Chapter XIX.--Of the Office of Penitentiary Presbyters and its
   Abolition.

   At this time it was deemed requisite to abolish the office of those
   presbyters in the churches who had charge of the penitences: [751] this
   was done on the following account. When the Novatians separated
   themselves from the Church because they would not communicate with
   those who had lapsed during the persecution under Decius, the bishops
   added to the ecclesiastical canon [752] a presbyter of penitence in
   order that those who had sinned after baptism might confess their sins
   in the presence of the presbyter thus appointed. [753] And this mode of
   discipline is still maintained among other heretical institutions by
   all the rest of the sects; the Homoousians only, together with the
   Novatians who hold the same doctrinal views, have abandoned it. The
   latter indeed would never admit of its establishment: [754] and the
   Homoousians who are now in possession of the churches, after retaining
   this function for a considerable period, abrogated it in the time of
   Nectarius, in consequence of an event which occured in the
   Constantinopolitan church, which is as follows: A woman of noble family
   coming to the penitentiary, made a general confession of those sins she
   had committed since her baptism: and the presbyter enjoined fasting and
   prayer continually, that together with the acknowledgment of error, she
   might have to show works also meet for repentance. Some time after
   this, the same lady again presented herself, and confessed that she had
   been guilty of another crime, a deacon of the church having slept with
   her. When this was proved the deacon was ejected from the church: [755]
   but the people were very indignant, being not only offended at what had
   taken place, but also because the deed had brought scandal and
   degradation upon the Church. When in consequence of this, ecclesiastics
   were subjected to taunting and reproach, Eudæmon a presbyter of the
   church, by birth an Alexandrian, persuaded Nectarius the bishop to
   abolish the office of penitentiary presbyter, and to leave every one to
   his own conscience with regard to the participation of the sacred
   mysteries: [756] for thus only, in his judgment, could the Church be
   preserved from obloquy. Having heard this explanation of the matter
   from Eudæmon I have ventured to put in the present treatise: for as I
   have often remarked, [757] I have spared no pains to procure an
   authentic account of affairs from those who were best acquainted with
   them, and to scrutinize every report, lest I should advance what might
   be untrue. My observation to Eudæmon, when he first related the
   circumstance, was this: Whether, O presbyter, your counsel has been
   profitable for the Church or otherwise, God knows; but I see that it
   takes away the means of rebuking one another's faults, and prevents our
   acting upon that precept of the apostle, [758] "Have no fellowship with
   the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."' Concerning
   this affair let this suffice.

   Novatian he would have been against its institution before it was
   established, and in favor of its abolition afterwards. The Novatians
   never admitted either of penitence or of the penitentiary bishop.

   Chapter XX.--Divisions among the Arians and Other Heretics.

   I conceive it right moreover not to leave unnoticed the proceedings of
   the other religious bodies, viz. the Arians, [759] Novatians, and those
   who received their denominations from Macedonius and Eunomius. For the
   Church once being divided, rested not in that schism, but the
   separatists taking occasion from the slightest and most frivolous
   pretences, disagreed among themselves. The manner and time, as well as
   the causes for which they raised mutual dissensions, we will state as
   we proceed. But let it be observed here, that the emperor Theodosius
   persecuted none of them except Eunomius; but inasmuch as the latter, by
   holding meetings in private houses at Constantinople, where he read the
   works he had composed, corrupted many with his doctrines, he ordered
   him to be sent into exile. Of the other heretics he interfered with no
   one; nor did he constrain them to hold communion with himself; but he
   allowed them all to assemble in their own conventicles, and to
   entertain their own opinions on points of Christian faith. Permission
   to build themselves churches without the cities was granted to the
   rest: but inasmuch as the Novatians held sentiments precisely identical
   with his own as to faith, he ordered that they should be suffered to
   continue unmolested in their churches within the cities, as I have
   before noticed. [760] Concerning these I think it opportune, however,
   to give in this place some farther account, and shall therefore retrace
   a few circumstances in their history.

   Chapter XXI.--Peculiar Schism among the Novatians. [761]

   Of the Novatian church at Constantinople Agelius was the bishop for the
   space of forty years, [762] viz. from the reign of Constantine until
   the sixth year of that of the emperor Theodosius, as I have stated
   somewhere previously. [763] He perceiving his end approaching, ordained
   Sisinnius to succeed him in the bishopric. [764] This person was a
   presbyter of the church over which Agelius presided, remarkably
   eloquent, and had been instructed in philosophy by Maximus, at the same
   time as the emperor Julian. Now as the Novatian laity were dissatisfied
   with this election, and wished rather that he had ordained Marcian, a
   man of eminent piety, on account of whose influence their sect had been
   left unmolested during the reign of Valens, Agelius therefore to allay
   his people's discontent, laid his hands on Marcian also. Having
   recovered a little from his illness, he went to the church and thus of
   his own accord addressed the congregation: After my decease let Marcian
   be your bishop; and after Marcian, Sisinnius.' He survived these words
   but a short time; Marcian accordingly having been constituted bishop of
   the Novatians, a division arose in their church also, from this cause.
   Marcian had promoted to the rank of presbyter a converted Jew named
   Sabbatius, who nevertheless continued to retain many of his Jewish
   prejudices; and moreover he was very ambitious of being made a bishop.
   Having therefore confidentially attached to his interest two
   presbyters, Theoctistus and Macarius, who were cognizant of his
   designs, he resolved to defend that innovation made by the Novatians in
   the time of Valens, at Pazum a village of Phrygia, concerning the
   festival of Easter, to which I have already adverted. [765] And in the
   first place, under pretext of more ascetic austerity, he privately
   withdrew from the church, saying that he was grieved on account of
   certain persons whom he suspected of being unworthy of participation in
   the sacrament.' It was however soon discovered that his object was to
   hold assemblies apart. When Marcian understood this, he bitterly
   censured his own error, in ordaining to the presbyterate persons so
   intent on vain-glory; and frequently said, That it had been better for
   him to have laid his hands on thorns, than to have imposed them on
   Sabbatius.' To check his proceedings, he procured a Synod of Novatian
   bishops to be convened at Angarum, [766] a commercial town near
   Helenopolis in Bithynia. On assembling here they summoned Sabbatius,
   and desired him to explain the cause of his discontent. Upon his
   affirming that he was troubled about the disagreement that existed
   respecting the Feast of Easter, and that it ought to be kept according
   to the custom of the Jews, and agreeable to that sanction which those
   convened at Pazum had appointed, the bishops present at the Synod
   perceiving that this assertion was a mere subterfuge to disguise his
   desire after the episcopal chair, obliged him to pledge himself on oath
   that he would never accept a bishopric. When he had so sworn, they
   passed a canon respecting this feast, which they entitled indifferent,'
   declaring that a disagreement on such a point was not a sufficient
   reason for separation from the church; and that the council of Pazum
   had done nothing prejudicial to the catholic canon. That although the
   ancients who lived nearest to the times of the apostles differed about
   the observance of this festival, it did not prevent their communion
   with one another, nor create any dissension. Besides that the Novatians
   at imperial Rome had never followed the Jewish usage, but always kept
   Easter after the equinox; and yet they did not separate from those of
   their own faith, who celebrated it on a different day.' From these and
   many such considerations, they made the Indifferent' Canon,
   above-mentioned, concerning Easter, whereby every one was at liberty to
   keep the custom which he had by predilection in this matter, if he so
   pleased; and that it should make no difference as regards communion,
   but even though celebrating differently they should be in accord in the
   church. After this rule had been thus established, Sabbatius being
   bound by his oath, anticipated the fast by keeping it in private,
   whenever any discrepancy existed in the time of the Paschal solemnity,
   and having watched all night, he celebrated the sabbath of the
   passover; then on the next day he went to church, and with the rest of
   the congregation partook of the sacraments. He pursued this course for
   many years, so that it could not be concealed from the people; in
   imitation of which some of the more ignorant, and chiefly the Phrygians
   and Galatians, supposing they should be justified by this conduct
   imitated him, and kept the passover in secret after his manner. But
   Sabbatius afterwards disregarding the oath by which he had renounced
   the episcopal dignity, held schismatic meetings, and was constituted
   bishop of his followers, as we shall show hereafter. [767]

   Chapter XXII.--The Author's Views respecting the Celebration of Easter,
   Baptism, Fasting, Marriage, the Eucharist, and Other Ecclesiastical
   Rites.

   As we have touched the subject I deem it not unreasonable to say a few
   words concerning Easter. It appears to me that neither the ancients nor
   moderns who have affected to follow the Jews, have had any rational
   foundation for contending so obstinately about it. For they have not
   taken into consideration the fact that when Judaism was changed into
   Christianity, the obligation to observe the Mosaic law and the
   ceremonial types ceased. And the proof of the matter is plain; for no
   law of Christ permits Christians to imitate the Jews. On the contrary
   the apostle expressly forbids it; not only rejecting circumcision, but
   also deprecating contention about festival days. In his epistle to the
   Galatians [768] he writes, Tell me ye that desire to be under the law,
   do ye not hear the law?' And continuing his train of argument, he
   demonstrates that the Jews were in bondage as servants, but that those
   who have come to Christ are called into the liberty of sons.' [769]
   Moreover he exhorts them in no way to regard days, and months, and
   years.' [770] Again in his epistle to the Colossians [771] he
   distinctly declares, that such observances are merely shadows:
   wherefore he says, Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in
   respect of any holy-day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath-days;
   which are a shadow of things to come.' The same truths are also
   confirmed by him in the epistle to the Hebrews [772] in these words:
   For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change
   also of the law.' Neither the apostles, therefore, nor the Gospels,
   [773] have anywhere imposed the yoke of servitude' [774] on those who
   have embraced the truth; but have left Easter and every other feast to
   be honored by the gratitude of the recipients of grace. Wherefore,
   inasmuch as men love festivals, because they afford them cessation from
   labor: each individual in every place, according to his own pleasure,
   has by a prevalent custom celebrated the memory of the saving passion.
   The Saviour and his apostles have enjoined us by no law to keep this
   feast: nor do the Gospels and apostles threaten us with any penalty,
   punishment, or curse for the neglect of it, as the Mosaic law does the
   Jews. It is merely for the sake of historical accuracy, and for the
   reproach of the Jews, because they polluted themselves with blood on
   their very feasts, that it is recorded in the Gospels that our Saviour
   suffered in the days of unleavened bread.' [775] The aim of the
   apostles was not to appoint festival days, but to teach a righteous
   life and piety. And it seems to me that just as many other customs have
   been established in individual localities according to usage. So also
   the feast of Easter came to be observed in each place according to the
   individual peculiarities of the peoples inasmuch as none of the
   apostles legislated on the matter. And that the observance originated
   not by legislation, but as a custom the facts themselves indicate. In
   Asia Minor most people kept the fourteenth day of the moon,
   disregarding the sabbath: yet they never separated from those who did
   otherwise, until Victor, bishop of Rome, influenced by too ardent a
   zeal, fulminated a sentence of excommunication against the
   Quartodecimans [776] in Asia. Wherefore also Irenæus, bishop of Lyons
   in France, severely censured Victor by letter for his immoderate heat;
   [777] telling him that although the ancients differed in their
   celebration of Easter, they did not desist from intercommunion. Also
   that Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, who afterwards suffered martyrdom
   under Gordian, [778] continued to communicate with Anicetus bishop of
   Rome, although he himself, according to the usage of his native Smyrna,
   kept Easter on the fourteenth day of the moon, as Eusebius attests in
   the fifth book of his Ecclesiastical History. [779] While therefore
   some in Asia Minor observed the day above-mentioned, others in the East
   kept that feast on the sabbath indeed, but differed as regards the
   month. The former thought the Jews should be followed, though they were
   not exact: the latter kept Easter after the equinox, refusing to
   celebrate with the Jews; for,' said they, it ought to be celebrated
   when the sun is in Aries, in the month called Xanthicus by the
   Antiochians, and April by the Romans.' In this practice, they averred,
   they conformed not to the modern Jews, who are mistaken in almost
   everything, but to the ancients, and to Josephus according to what he
   has written in the third book of his Jewish Antiquities. [780] Thus
   these people were at issue among themselves. But all other Christians
   in the Western parts, and as far as the ocean itself, are found to have
   celebrated Easter after the equinox, from a very ancient tradition. And
   in fact these acting in this manner have never disagreed on this
   subject. It is not true, as some have pretended, that the Synod under
   Constantine altered this festival: [781] for Constantine himself,
   writing to those who differed respecting it, recommended that as they
   were few in number, they could agree with the majority of their
   brethren. His letter will be found at length in the third book of the
   Life of Constantine by Eusebius; but the passage in it relative to
   Easter runs thus: [782]

   It is a becoming order which all the churches in the Western, Southern,
   and Northern parts of the world observe, and some places in the East
   also. Wherefore all on the present occasion have judged it right, and I
   have pledged myself that it will have the acquiescence of your
   prudence, that what is unanimously observed in the city of Rome,
   throughout Italy, Africa, and the whole of Egypt, in Spain, France,
   Britain, Libya, and all Greece, the diocese of Asia and Pontus, and
   Cilicia, your wisdom also will readily embrace; considering not only
   that the number of churches in the aforesaid places is greater, but
   also that while there should be a universal concurrence in what is most
   reasonable, it becomes us to have nothing in common with the perfidious
   Jews.'

   Such is the tenor of the emperor's letter. Moreover the Quartodecimans
   affirm that the observance of the fourteenth day was delivered to them
   by the apostle John: while the Romans and those in the Western parts
   assure us that their usage originated with the apostles Peter and Paul.
   Neither of these parties however can produce any written testimony in
   confirmation of what they assert. But that the time of keeping Easter
   in various places is dependent on usage, I infer from this, that those
   who agree in faith, differ among themselves on questions of usage. And
   it will not perhaps be unseasonable to notice here the diversity of
   customs in the churches. [783] The fasts before Easter will be found to
   be differently observed among different people. Those at Rome fast
   three successive weeks before Easter, excepting Saturdays and Sundays.
   [784] Those in Illyrica and all over Greece and Alexandria observe a
   fast of six weeks, which they term The forty days' fast.' [785] Others
   commencing their fast from the seventh week before Easter, and fasting
   three five days only, and that at intervals, yet call that time The
   forty days' fast.' It is indeed surprising to me that thus differing in
   the number of days, they should both give it one common appellation;
   but some assign one reason for it, and others another, according to
   their several fancies. One can see also a disagreement about the manner
   of abstinence from food, as well as about the number of days. Some
   wholly abstain from things that have life: others feed on fish only of
   all living creatures: many together with fish, eat fowl also, saying
   that according to Moses, [786] these were likewise made out of the
   waters. Some abstain from eggs, and all kinds of fruits: others partake
   of dry bread only; still others eat not even this: while others having
   fasted till the ninth hour, [787] afterwards take any sort of food
   without distinction. And among various nations there are other usages,
   for which innumerable reasons are assigned. Since however no one can
   produce a written command as an authority, it is evident that the
   apostles left each one to his own free will in the matter, to the end
   that each might perform what is good not by constraint or necessity.
   Such is the difference in the churches on the subject of fasts. Nor is
   there less variation in regard to religious assemblies. [788] For
   although almost all churches throughout the world celebrate the sacred
   mysteries on the sabbath [789] of every week, yet the Christians of
   Alexandria and at Rome, on account of some ancient tradition, have
   ceased to do this. The Egyptians in the neighborhood of Alexandria, and
   the inhabitants of Thebaïs, hold their religious assemblies on the
   sabbath, but do not participate of the mysteries in the manner usual
   among Christians in general: for after having eaten and satisfied
   themselves with food of all kinds, in the evening making their
   offerings [790] they partake of the mysteries. At Alexandria again, on
   the Wednesday [791] in Passion week and on Good Friday, the scriptures
   are read, and the doctors expound them; and all the usual services are
   performed in their assemblies, except the celebration of the mysteries.
   This practice in Alexandria is of great antiquity, for it appears that
   Origen most commonly taught in the church on those days. He being a
   very learned teacher in the Sacred Books, and perceiving that the
   impotence of the law' [792] of Moses was weakened by literal
   explanation, gave it a spiritual interpretation; declaring that there
   has never been but one true Passover, which the Saviour celebrated when
   he hung upon the cross: for that he then vanquished the adverse powers,
   and erected this as a trophy against the devil. In the same city of
   Alexandria, readers and chanters [793] are chosen indifferently from
   the catechumens and the faithful; whereas in all other churches the
   faithful only are promoted to these offices. I myself, also, learned of
   another custom in Thessaly. If a clergyman in that country, after
   taking orders, should sleep with his wife, whom he had legally married
   before his ordination, he would be degraded. [794] In the East, indeed,
   all clergymen, and even the bishops themselves, abstain from their
   wives: but this they do of their own accord, and not by the necessity
   of any law; for there have been among them many bishops, who have had
   children by their lawful wives, during their episcopate. It is said
   that the author of the usage which obtains in Thessaly was Heliodorus
   bishop of Tricca in that country; under whose name there are love books
   extant, entitled Ethiopica, [795] which he composed in his youth. The
   same custom prevails at Thessalonica, and in Macedonia, and in Greece.
   I have also known of another peculiarity in Thessaly, which is, that
   they baptize there on the days of Easter only; in consequence of which
   a very great number of them die without having received baptism. At
   Antioch in Syria the site of the church is inverted; so that the altar
   does not face toward the east, but toward the west. [796] In Greece,
   however, and at Jerusalem and in Thessaly they go to prayers as soon as
   the candles are lighted, in the same manner as the Novatians do at
   Constantinople. At Cæsarea likewise, and in Cappadocia, and in Cyprus,
   the presbyters and bishops expound the Scriptures in the evening, after
   the candles are lighted. The Novatians of the Hellespont do not perform
   their prayers altogether in the same manner as those of Constantinople;
   in most things, however, their usage is similar to that of the
   prevailing [797] church. In short, it is impossible to find anywhere,
   among all the sects, two churches which agree exactly in their ritual
   respecting prayers. At Alexandria no presbyter is allowed to address
   the public: a regulation which was made after Arius had raised a
   disturbance in that church. At Rome they fast every Saturday. [798] At
   Cæsarea of Cappadocia they exclude from communion those who have sinned
   after baptism as the Novatians do. The same discipline was practiced by
   the Macedonians in the Hellespont, and by the Quartodecimans in Asia.
   The Novatians in Phrygia do not admit such as have twice married; [799]
   but those of Constantinople neither admit nor reject them openly, while
   in the Western parts they are openly received. This diversity was
   occasioned, as I imagine, by the bishops who in their respective eras
   governed the churches; and those who received these several rites and
   usages, transmitted them as laws to their posterity. However, to give a
   complete catalogue of all the various customs and ceremonial
   observances in use throughout every city and country would be
   difficult--rather impossible; but the instances we have adduced are
   sufficient to show that the Easter Festival was from some remote
   precedent differently celebrated in every particular province. They
   talk at random therefore who assert that the time of keeping Easter was
   altered in the Nicene Synod; for the bishops there convened earnestly
   labored to reduce the first dissenting minority to uniformity of
   practice with the rest of the people. Now that many differences existed
   even in the apostolic age of the church occasioned by such subjects,
   was not unknown even to the apostles themselves, as the book of The
   Acts testifies. For when they understood that a disturbance occurred
   among believers on account of a dissension of the Gentiles, having all
   met together, they promulgated a Divine law, giving it the form of a
   letter. By this sanction they liberated Christians from the bondage of
   formal observances, and all vain contention about these things; and
   they taught them the path of true piety, prescribing such things only
   as were conducive to its attainment. The epistle itself, which I shall
   here transcribe, is recorded in The Acts of the Apostles. [800]

   The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren
   which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. Forasmuch
   as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you
   with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and
   keep the law; to whom we gave no such commandment: it seemed good unto
   us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you, with
   our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for
   the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and
   Silas, who shall also tell you the same thing by mouth. For it seemed
   good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden
   than these necessary things: that ye abstain from meats offered to
   idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication;
   from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.'

   These things indeed pleased God: for the letter expressly says, It
   seemed good to the Holy Ghost to lay upon you no greater burden than
   these necessary things.' There are nevertheless some persons who,
   disregarding these precepts, suppose all fornication to be an
   indifferent matter; but contend about holy-days as if their lives were
   at stake, thus contravening the commands of God, and legislating for
   themselves, and making of none effect the decree of the apostles:
   neither do they perceive that they are themselves practicing the
   contrary to those things which God approved. It is possible easily to
   extend our discourse respecting Easter, and demonstrate that the Jews
   observe no exact rule either in the time or manner of celebrating the
   paschal solemnity: and that the Samaritans, who are an offshoot from
   the Jews, always celebrate this festival after the equinox. But this
   subject would require a distinct and copious treatise: I shall
   therefore merely add, that those who affect so much to imitate the
   Jews, and are so very anxious about an accurate observance of types,
   ought to depart from them in no particular. For if they have chosen to
   be so correct, they must not only observe days and months, but all
   other things also, which Christ (who was made under the law') [801] did
   in the manner of the Jews; or which he unjustly suffered from them; or
   wrought typically for the good of all men. He entered into a ship and
   taught. He ordered the Passover to be made ready in an upper room. He
   commanded an ass that was tied to be loosed. He proposed a man bearing
   a pitcher of water as a sign to them for hastening their preparations
   for the Passover. [He did] an infinite number of other things of this
   nature which are recorded in the gospels. And yet those who suppose
   themselves to be justified by keeping this feast, would think it absurd
   to observe any of these things in a bodily manner. For no doctor ever
   dreams of going to preach from a ship--no person imagines it necessary
   to go up into an upper room to celebrate the Passover there--they never
   tie, and then loose an ass again--and finally no one enjoins another to
   carry a pitcher of water, in order that the symbols might be fulfilled.
   They have justly regarded such things as savoring rather of Judaism:
   for the Jews are more solicitous about outward solemnities than the
   obedience of the heart; and therefore are they under the curse, because
   they do not discern the spiritual bearing of the Mosaic law, but rest
   in its types and shadows. Those who favor the Jews admit the
   allegorical meaning of these things; and yet they wage a deadly warfare
   against the observance of days and months, without applying to them a
   similar sense: thus do they necessarily involve themselves in a common
   condemnation with the Jews.

   But enough I think has been said concerning these things. Let us now
   return to the subject we were previously treating of, the fact that the
   Church once divided did not stay with that division, but that those
   separated were again divided among themselves, taking occasion from the
   most trivial grounds. The Novatians, as I have stated, were divided
   among themselves on account of the feast of Easter, the controversy not
   being restricted to one point only. For in the different provinces some
   took one view of the question, and some another, disagreeing not only
   about the month, but the days of the week also, and other unimportant
   matters; in some places they hold separate assemblies because of it, in
   others they unite in mutual communion.

   [784] Baronius (Ann. 57 and 391 a.d.) finds two mistakes here: first,

   and second, in the assertion that during those three weeks Saturdays
   were excepted. Cf. also Ceillier, Hist. des Auteurs Sacrés et
   Ecclesiast. Vol. VIII. p. 523, 524. Valesius, however, quotes Pope Leo
   (fourth sermon on the Lent Fast) and Venerable Beda to prove that
   Socrates' assertion concerning the exception of Saturday may be
   defended. See Quesnell, de Jejunio Sabbati; Bingham, Origin. Eccl. XXI.

   [787] Valesius rightly conjectures that very few observed this mode of
   fasting during Lent, basing his opinion on the order of worship and
   various deprecatory expressions in ancient authors with respect to it.
   It may be noted that the Mohammedan Fast of Ramadan is observed on the
   same principle and in a similar manner. The fast begins with the dawn
   of the sun and continues until sunset, being complete for that space of
   time. With the setting of the sun, however, every person is at liberty
   to eat as he may please.

   [788] ounaxeon. Sophocles (Greek Lex. of the Rom. and Byzant. Period)

   may add on the authority of Casaubon (Exercit. XVI. ad Annal. Baronii,
   No. 42) 5. The celebration of the Eucharist.' It is in the second sense
   given by Sophocles that it is used here.

   [789] i.e. Saturday. Sunday is never called the Sabbath' by the ancient
   Fathers and historians, but the Lord's day' (kuriake). Sophocles (Greek
   Lex. of the Rom. and Byzant. Period) gives three senses to the word;
   viz., 1. The Sabbath' [of the Jews] (so in the LXX and Jewish writers).
   2. The week.' 3. Saturday.' Many early Christians, however, continued
   to observe the Jewish Sabbath along with the first day of the week. Cf.

   flourished under the Emperor Hadrian.

   [796] According to the Apost. Constit. (II. 57) a church should be

   but there were exceptions. Cf. Bingham, Christ. Antiq. VIII. 3. 2.

   [797] i.e. the catholic or orthodox church; used perhaps in the same
   way as the expression established church' in modern times.

   [798] Apost. Can. 64, provides that no cleric or layman shall fast on
   the Sabbath day (Saturday, see note 22, above), the former on pain of
   being deposed, the latter, of being excommunicated. It appears,
   however, that the Roman church observed the day as a fast, while the
   Greek church held it to be a feast. Socrates, however, seems to
   contradict the statement he had made above (see note 17) that at Rome
   Saturdays and Sundays were excepted from the list of fasting days in
   Lent. From Augustine's Epistles, 36. 31 et al., it appears that he
   fasted on Saturday and regarded this the regular and proper course to
   be pursued, and actually pursued by members of the church. Hence the
   present statement of Socrates must be taken as correct to the exclusion
   of the former.

   Version. The Revised has it slightly altered. We subjoin it for

   are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:
   Forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have
   troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no
   commandment; it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to
   choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and
   Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also
   shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. For it seemed good to
   the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these
   necessary things; that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and
   from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which
   if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.'

   Chapter XXIII.--Further Dissensions among the Arians at Constantinople.
   The Psathyrians.

   But dissensions arose among the Arians [802] also on this account. The
   contentious questions which were daily agitated among them, led them to
   start the most absurd propositions. For whereas it has been always
   believed in the church that God is the Father of the Son, the Word, it
   was asked whether God could be called Father' before the Son had
   subsistence? Thus in asserting that the Word of God was not begotten of
   the Father, but was created out of nothing,' and thus falling into
   error on the chief and main point, they deservedly fell into absurd
   cavilings about a mere name. Dorotheus therefore being sent for by them
   from Antioch maintained that God neither was nor could be called Father
   before the Son existed. But Marinus whom they had summoned out of
   Thrace before Dorotheus, piqued at the superior deference which was
   paid to his rival, undertook to defend the contrary opinion. In
   consequence of these things there arose a schism among them, and being
   thus divided respecting this term, each party held separate meetings.
   Those under Dorotheus retained their original places of assembly: but
   the followers of Marinus built distinct oratories for themselves, and
   asserted that the Father had always been Father, even when the Son was
   not. This section of the Arians was denominated Psathyrians, [803]
   because one of the most zealous defenders of this opinion was
   Theoctistus, a Syrian by birth, and a cake-seller [Psathyropola] [804]
   by trade. Selenas [805] bishop of the Goths adopted the views of this
   party, a man of mixed descent; he was a Goth by his father's side, but
   by his mother's a Phrygian, by which means he taught in the church with
   great readiness in both these languages. This faction however soon
   quarreled among themselves, Marinus disagreeing with Agapius, whom he
   himself had preferred to the bishopric of Ephesus. They disputed,
   however, not about any point of religion, but in narrow-mindedness
   about precedence, in which the Goths sided with Agapius. Wherefore many
   of the ecclesiastics under their jurisdiction, abominating the
   vain-glorious contest between these two, abandoned them both, and
   became adherents to the homoousian' faith. The Arians having continued
   thus divided among themselves during the space of thirty-five years,
   were reunited in the reign of Theodosius the Younger, under the
   consulate [806] of Plintha the commander-in-chief of the army, he being
   a member of the sect of Psathyrians; these were prevailed on to desist
   from contention. They afterwards passed a resolution, giving it all the
   cogency of law, that the question which had led to their separation,
   should never be mooted again. But this reconciliation extended no
   farther than Constantinople; for in other cities where any of these two
   parties were found, they persisted in their former separation. So much
   respecting the division among the Arians.

   Chapter XXIV.--The Eunomians divide into Several Factions.

   But neither did the followers of Eunomius remain without dissensions:
   for Eunomius [807] himself had long before this separated from Eudoxius
   who ordained him bishop of Cyzicus, taking occasion from that bishop's
   refusal to restore to communion his master Aëtius who had been ejected.
   But those who derived their name from him were subsequently divided
   into several factions. For first Theophronius a Cappadocian, who had
   been instructed in the art of disputation by Eunomius, and had acquired
   a smattering of Aristotle's Categories, and his Book of Interpretation,
   composed some treatises which he entitled, On the Exercise of the Mind.
   Having, however, drawn down upon himself the reprobation of his own
   sect, he was ejected as an apostate. He afterwards held assemblies
   apart from them, and left behind him a heresy which bore his own name.
   Furthermore at Constantinople a certain Eutychius from some absurd
   dispute, withdrew from the Eunomians, and still continues to hold
   separate meetings. The followers of Theophronius are denominated
   Eunomiotheophronians'; and those of Eutychius have the appellation of
   Eunomieutychians.' What those nonsensical terms were about which they
   differed I consider unworthy of being recorded in this history, lest I
   should go into matters foreign to my purpose. I shall merely observe
   that they adulterated baptism: for they do not baptize in the name of
   the Trinity, but into the death of Christ. [808] Among the Macedonians
   also there was for some time a division, when Eutropius a presbyter
   held separate assemblies, and Carterius did not agree with him. There
   are possibly in other cities sects which have emanated from these: but
   living at Constantinople, where I was born and educated, I describe
   more particularly what has taken place in that city; both because I
   have myself witnessed some of these transactions, and also because the
   events which have there occurred are of pre-eminent importance, and are
   therefore more worth of commemoration. Let it however be understood
   that what I have here related happened at different periods, and not at
   the same time. But if any one should be desirous of knowing the names
   of the various sects, he may easily satisfy himself, by reading a book
   entitled Ancoratus, [809] composed by Epiphanius, bishop of Cyprus: but
   I shall content myself with what I have already stated. The public
   affairs were again thrown into agitation from a cause I shall now refer
   to.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [807] Cf. IV. 7 and 13.

   [808] Apost. Can.50 reads: If any bishop or presbyter does not perform
   the one initiation with three immersions, but with one immersion only
   into the death of the Lord, let him be deposed.' Also the Second
   General Synod (that of Constantinople, 381) in its 7th Canon passed the
   following: But the Eunomians, who only baptize with one immersion, and
   the Montanists, who are here called Phrygians, and the Sabellians, who
   teach the doctrine of the Fatherhood of the Son...(if they wish to be
   joined to the Orthodox faith) we receive as heathen; on the first day
   we make them Christians, on the second, catechumens, &c.' See Hefele,
   Hist. of the Church Councils, Vol. II. p. 367, 368.

   [809] Epiphan. Ancoratus, 13. Photius calls the Ancoratus a synopsis of
   the treatise of Epiphanius on Heresies (Biblioth. 123). The subject
   here referred to was treated by Epiphanius in Hær. LXVI. and LXVIII.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXV.--The Usurper Eugenius compasses the Death of Valentinian
   the Younger. Theodosius obtains a Victory over him.

   There was in the Western regions a grammarian named Eugenius, [810] who
   after having for some time taught the Latin language, left his school,
   and was appointed to service at the palace, being constituted chief
   secretary to the emperor. Possessing a considerable degree of
   eloquence, and being on that account treated with greater distinction
   than others, he was unable to bear his good fortune with moderation.
   For associating with himself Arbogastes, a native of Galatia Minor, who
   then had the command of a division of the army, a man harsh in manner
   and very bloodthirsty, he determined to usurp the sovereignty. These
   two therefore agreed to murder the Emperor Valentinian, having
   corrupted the eunuchs of the imperial bed-chamber. These, on receiving
   tempting promises of promotion, strangled the emperor in his sleep.
   Eugenius immediately assuming the supreme authority in the Western
   parts of the empire, conducted himself in such a manner as might be
   expected from a usurper. When the Emperor Theodosius was made
   acquainted with these things, he was exceedingly distressed, because
   his defeat of Maximus had only prepared the way for fresh troubles. He
   accordingly assembled his military forces, and having proclaimed his
   son Honorius Augustus, on the 10th of January, in his own third
   consulate [811] which he bore with Abundantius, he again set out in
   great haste toward the Western parts, leaving both his sons invested
   with imperial authority at Constantinople. As he marched against
   Eugenius a very great number of the barbarians beyond the Danube
   volunteered their services, and followed him in this expedition. After
   a rapid march he arrived in the Gauls with a numerous army, where
   Eugenius awaited him, also at the head of an immense body of troops.
   Accordingly an engagement took place near the river Frigidus, which is
   [about thirty-six miles] distant [from Aquileia]. In that part of the
   battle where the Romans fought against their own countrymen, the
   conflict was doubtful: but where the barbarian auxiliaries of the
   Emperor Theodosius were engaged, the forces of Eugenius had greatly the
   advantage. When the emperor saw the barbarians perishing, he cast
   himself in great agony upon the ground, and invoked the help of God in
   this emergency: nor was his request unheeded; for Bacurius [812] his
   principal officer, inspired with sudden and extraordinary ardor, rushed
   with his vanguard to the part where the barbarians were hardest
   pressed, broke through the ranks of the enemy, and put to flight those
   who a little before were themselves engaged in pursuit. Another
   marvelous circumstance also occurred. A violent wind suddenly arose,
   which retorted upon themselves the darts cast by the soldiers of
   Eugenius, and at the same time drove those hurled by the imperial
   forces with increased impetus against their adversaries. [813] So
   prevalent was the emperor's prayer. The success of the struggle being
   in this way turned, the usurper threw himself at the emperor's feet,
   and begged that his life might be spared: but as he lay a prostrate
   suppliant at the feet [of the emperor] he was beheaded by the soldiers,
   on the 6th of September, in the third consulate of Arcadius, and the
   second of Honorius. [814] Arbogastes, who had been the chief cause of
   so much mischief, having continued his flight for two days after the
   battle, and seeing no chance of escape, despatched himself with his own
   sword.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [810] This account of Arbogastes and Eugenius is also given by Zosimus
   (IV. 53-58), who adds that Arbogastes was a Frank; and also by
   Philostorgius (XI. 1), who says that Eugenius was a pagan.

   Chapter XXVI.--Illness and Death of Theodosius the Elder.

   The Emperor Theodosius was in consequence of the anxiety and fatigues
   connected with this war thrown into bodily illness; and believing the
   disease which had attacked him would be fatal, he became more concerned
   about the public affairs than his own life, considering how great
   calamities often overtook the people after the death of their
   sovereign. He therefore hastily summoned his son Honorius from
   Constantinople, being principally desirous of setting in order the
   state of things in the western parts of the empire. After his son's
   arrival at Milan, he seemed to recover a little, and gave directions
   for the celebration of the games of the hippodrome on account of his
   victory. Before dinner he was pretty well, and a spectator of the
   sports; but after he had dined he became suddenly too ill to return to
   them, and sent his son to preside in his stead; when the night came on
   he died, it being the seventeenth of January, during consulate of
   Olybrius and Probus. [815] This was in the first year of the two
   hundred and ninety-fourth Olympiad. The emperor Theodosius lived sixty
   years, [816] and reigned sixteen. This book therefore comprehends the
   transactions of sixteen years and eight months.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [815] 395 a.d.

   [816] There is some doubt as to the length of Theodosius' life; most of
   the ancient historians (Sozomen, Theophanes, Cedrenus) agree with
   Socrates in giving it as sixty years. Am. Marcellinus Rerum Gestarum,
   XXIX. 6. 15, and Victor, Epit. XLVII., leave the impression that he was
   fifty.

   Book VI.

   Introduction.

   The commission with which you charged us, O holy man of God, Theodore,
   we have executed in the five foregoing books; in which to the best of
   our ability, we have comprised the history of the Church from the time
   of Constantine. Notice, however, that we have been by no means studious
   of style; for we considered that had we showed too great fastidiousness
   about elegance of expression we might have defeated the object in view.
   [817] But even supposing our purpose could still have been
   accomplished, we were wholly precluded from the exercise of that
   discretionary power of which ancient historians seem to have so largely
   availed themselves, whereby any one of them imagined himself quite at
   liberty to amplify or curtail matters of fact. Moreover, refined
   composition would by no means be edifying to the masses and illiterate
   men, who are intent merely on knowing the facts, and not on admiring
   beauty of diction. In order therefore not to render my production
   unprofitable to both classes of readers,--to the learned on the one
   hand, because no elaboration of language could satisfy them to rank it
   with the magniloquence of the writers of antiquity, and to the
   unlearned on the other, because they could not understand the facts,
   should they be clouded by a parade of words,--we have purposely adopted
   a style, divested indeed of all affectation of sublimity, but at the
   same time clear and perspicuous.

   As we begin, however, our sixth book, we must premise this, that in
   undertaking to detail the events of our own age, we are apprehensive of
   advancing such things as may be unpalatable to many: either because,
   according to the proverb, Truth is bitter;' on account of our not
   mentioning with encomium the names of those whom some may love; or from
   our not magnifying their actions. The zealots of our churches will
   condemn us for not calling the bishops Most dear to God,' Most holy,'
   and such like. Others will be litigious because we do not bestow the
   appellations Most divine,' and Lords' on the emperors, nor apply to
   them such other epithets as they are commonly assigned. But since I
   could easily prove from the testimony of ancient authors, [818] that
   among them the servant was accustomed to address his master simply by
   name, without reference to his dignity or titles, on account of the
   pressure of business, I shall in like manner obey the laws of history,
   which demand a simple and faithful narration, unobscured by a veil of
   any kind. I shall proceed to record accurately what I have either
   myself seen, or have been able to ascertain from actual observers;
   having tested the truth by the unanimity of the witnesses that spoke of
   the same affairs, and by every means I could possibly command. The
   process of ascertaining the truth was indeed laborious, inasmuch as
   many and different persons gave different accounts and some claimed to
   be eyewitnesses, while others professed to be more intimately
   acquainted with these things than any others.

   Chapter I.--On the Death of Theodosius his Two Sons divide the Empire.
   Rufinus is slain at the Feet of Arcadius.

   After the death of the Emperor Theodosius, in the consulate of Olybrius
   and Probinus or the seventeenth of January, his two sons undertook the
   administration of the Roman empire. Thus Arcadius assumed the
   government of the East, and Honorius of the West. [819] At that time
   Damasus was bishop of the church at Imperial Rome, and Theophilus of
   that of Alexandria, John of Jerusalem, and Flavian of Antioch; while
   the episcopal chair at Constantinople or New Rome was filled by
   Nectarius, as we mentioned in the foregoing book. [820] The body of the
   Emperor Theodosius was taken to Constantinople on the 8th of November
   in the same consulate, and was honorably interred by his son Arcadius
   with the usual funeral solemnities. [821] Not long afterwards on the
   28th day of the same month the army also arrived, which had served
   under the Emperor Theodosius in the war against the usurper. When
   therefore according to custom the Emperor Arcadius met the army without
   the gates, the soldiery slew Rufinus the Prætorian prefect. For he was
   suspected of aspiring to the sovereignty, and had the reputation of
   having invited into the Roman territories the Huns, [822] a barbarous
   nation, who had already ravaged Armenia, and were then making predatory
   incursions into other provinces of the East. On the very day on which
   Rufinus was killed, Marcian bishop of the Novatians died, and was
   succeeded in the episcopate by Sisinnius, of whom we have already made
   mention. [823]

   Chapter II.--Death of Nectarius and Ordination of John.

   A short time after Nectarius [824] also, bishop of Constantinople died,
   during the consulate of Cæsarius and Atticus, [825] on the 27th of
   September. A contest thereupon immediately arose respecting the
   appointment of a successor, some proposing one person, and some
   another: at length however it was determined to send for John, [826] a
   presbyter of the church at Antioch, for there was a report that he was
   very instructive, and at the same time eloquent. By the general consent
   therefore of both the clergy and laity, he was summoned very soon
   afterwards to Constantinople by the Emperor Arcadius: and to render the
   ordination more authoritative and imposing, several prelates were
   requested to be present, among whom also was Theophilus bishop of
   Alexandria. [827] This person did everything he could to detract from
   John's reputation, being desirous of promoting to that see, Isidore
   [828] a presbyter of his own church, to whom he was greatly attached,
   on account of a very delicate and perilous affair which Isidore had
   undertaken to serve his interests. What this was I must now unfold.
   While the Emperor Theodosius was preparing to attack the usurper
   Maximus, Theodosius sent Isidore with gifts giving twofold letters, and
   enjoining him to present both the gifts and the proper letters to him
   who should become the victor. In accordance with these injunctions
   Isidore on his arrival at Rome awaited there the event of the war. But
   this business did not long remain a secret: for a reader who
   accompanied him privately sequestered the letters; upon which Isidore
   in great alarm returned to Alexandria. This was the reason why
   Theophilus so warmly favored Isidore. The court however gave the
   preference to John: and inasmuch as many had revived the accusations
   against Theophilus, and prepared for presentation to the bishops then
   convened memorials of various charges, Eutropius [829] the chief
   officer of the imperial bed-chamber collected these documents, and
   showed them to Theophilus, bidding him choose between ordaining John,
   and undergoing a trial on the charges made against him.' Theophilus
   terrified at this alternative, consented to ordain John. Accordingly
   John was invested with the episcopal dignity on the 26th of February,
   under the following consulate, [830] which the Emperor Honorius
   celebrated with public games at Rome, and Eutychian, then Prætorian
   prefect, at Constantinople. But since the man is famous, both for the
   writings he has left, and the many troubles he fell into, it is proper
   that I should not pass over his affairs in silence, but to relate as
   compendiously as possible whence he was, and from what ancestry; also
   the particulars of his elevation to the episcopate, and the means by
   which he was subsequently degraded; and finally how he was more honored
   after his death, than he had been during his life.

   Chapter III.--Birth and Education of John Bishop of Constantinople.

   John was a native of Antioch in Syria-Coele, son of Secundus and
   Anthusa, and scion of a noble family in that country. He studied
   rhetoric under Libanius the sophist, and philosophy under Andragathius
   the philosopher. [831] Being on the point of entering the practice of
   civil law, and reflecting on the restless and unjust course of those
   who devote themselves to the practice of the forensic courts, he was
   turned to the more tranquil mode of life, which he adopted, following
   the example of Evagrius. [832] Evagrius himself had been educated under
   the same masters, and had some time before retired to a private mode of
   life. Accordingly he laid aside his legal habit, and applied his mind
   to the reading of the sacred scriptures, frequenting the church with
   great assiduity. He moreover induced Theodore and Maximus, who had been
   his fellow-students under Libanius the sophist, to forsake a profession
   whose primary object was gain, and embrace a life of greater
   simplicity. Of these two persons, Theodore afterwards became bishop of
   Mopsuestia [833] in Cilicia, and Maximus of Seleucia in Isauria. At
   that time being ardent aspirants after perfection, they entered upon
   the ascetic life, under the guidance of Diodorus [834] and Carterius,
   who then presided over a monastic institution. The former of these was
   subsequently elevated to the bishopric of Tarsus, and wrote many
   treatises, in which he limited his attention to the literal sense of
   scripture, avoiding that which was mystical. [835] But enough
   respecting these persons. Now John was then living on the most intimate
   terms with Basil, [836] at that time constituted a deacon by Meletius,
   but afterwards ordained bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia. Accordingly
   Zeno [837] the bishop on his return from Jerusalem, appointed him a
   reader in the church at Antioch. While he continued in the capacity of
   a reader he composed the book Against the Jews. Meletius having not
   long after conferred on him the rank of deacon, he produced his work On
   the Priesthood, [838] and those Against Stagirius; and moreover those
   also On the Incomprehensibility of the Divine Nature, and On the Women
   [839] who lived with the Ecclesiastics. Afterwards, upon the death of
   Meletius at Constantinople,--for there he had gone on account of
   Gregory Nazianzen's ordination,--John separated himself from the
   Meletians, without entering into communion with Paulinus, and spent
   three whole years in retirement. Later, when Paulinus was dead, he was
   ordained a presbyter by Evagrius the successor of Paulinus. Such is a
   brief outline of John's career previous to his call to the episcopal
   office. It is said that on account of his zeal for temperance he was
   stern and severe; and one of his early friends has said that in his
   youth he manifested a proneness to irritability, rather than to
   modesty.' Because of the rectitude of his life, he was free from
   anxiety about the future, and his simplicity of character rendered him
   open and ingenuous; nevertheless the liberty of speech he allowed
   himself was offensive to very many. In public teaching he was powerful
   in reforming the morals of his auditors; but in private conversation he
   was frequently thought haughty and assuming by those who did not know
   him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [831] Sozomen (VIII. 2) also says that Chrysostom went from the school
   of Libanius to a private life instead of the legal profession as was
   expected of him, but from some utterances of Libanius, as well as from
   Chrysostom's own representation, de Sacerdot. I. 1. 4, it appears that
   he had spent some time in the practice of the law.

   [832] It is not certain who this Evagrius was. Valesius thinks he was
   the presbyter of that name mentioned by Jerome, de Scriptor. Eccl.

   [833] It has been supposed by some that this was the Theodore addressed
   in II. 1, VI. Int. and VII. 47; but not with good reason. Cf. note 4,
   p. xii. of Int. On Theodore of Mopsuestia, the great Exegete' and
   theologian, see Smith & Wace; also Sieffert, Theodor. Mopsuestenus Vet.
   Test. Sobrie Interpret. Vindex and H. B. Swete, Theodori Episc.
   Mopsuestiæ in Epp. B. Pauli. Commentarii.

   [834] Sozomen also attests the simplicity of Diodorus' interpretations
   of the Old Testament. The principle which he adopted, of seeking for a
   literal and historical meaning in preference to the allegorical and
   mystical interpretations attached to the Old Testament by Origen and
   the Alexandrians, became the corner-stone of the Antiochian system of
   interpretation as elaborated by his pupils Theodore of Mopsuestia and
   Theodoret.

   [835] theorias lit. speculations' by which are evidently meant the
   allegorical and subjective or contemplative explanations of the
   Alexandrians.

   [836] Socrates and Kurtz (in the tenth edition of his
   Kirchengeschichte, I. 223) confound this Basil with Basil the Great of
   Cappadocia, who was eighteen years older than Chrysostom, and died in
   379. Chrysostom's friend was probably (as Baronius and Montfaucon
   conjecture) identical with Basil, bishop of Raphanea in Syria, near
   Antioch, who attended the Council of Constantinople in 381.' Comp.
   Venables in Smith and Wace; Schaff in Prolegomena to Vol. IX. of The
   Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, p. 6, note 2. The conjecture of
   Baronius is assented to also by Valesius.

   [837] According to Baronius, this Zeno was bishop of Tyre, but Valesius
   makes an ingenious objection to this view, and asserts that some other
   city must have been the real see of Zeno.

   [838] This treatise, commonly termed de Sacerdotio, and the Homilies
   are the most famous of Chrysostom's works; for a full account, as well
   as translation, of these works, see Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers,
   Vol. IX.

   [839] These were women who lived in the houses of the clergy as
   sisters, and exercised themselves in works of piety and charity. At a
   very early period, however, scandal seems to have arisen from this
   practice, and strong measures were repeatedly adopted by the Church for
   their suppression. Paul of Samosata was, according to Eusebius (H. E.
   VII. 30), deposed partly for keeping these sisters in his house. They
   were called Syneisactæ (Suneisaktoi ). Cf. Bingham, Christ. Antiq.
   XVII. 5. 20, and Council of Nicæa, Can. 3. Hefele, Hist. of Ch.
   Councils, Vol. I. p. 379.

   Chapter IV.--Of Serapion the Deacon on whose Account John becomes
   Odious to his Clergy.

   Being such in disposition and manners, and promoted to the episcopacy,
   John was led to conduct himself toward his clergy with more than proper
   superciliousness, designing to correct the morals of the clergy under
   him. Having thus chafed the temper of the ecclesiastics, he was
   disliked by them; and so many of them stood aloof from him as a
   passionate man, and others became his bitter enemies. Serapion, a
   deacon of his retinue, led him to alienate their minds still more from
   him; and once in presence of the whole assembled clergy he cried out
   with a loud voice to the bishop--You will never be able to govern these
   men, my lord, unless you drive them all with a rod.' This speech of his
   excited a general feeling of animosity against the bishop; the bishop
   also not long after expelled many of them from the church, some for one
   cause, and some for another. And, as it usually happens when persons in
   office adopt such violent measures, those who were thus expelled by him
   formed combinations and inveighed against him to the people. What
   contributed greatly to gain credence for these complaints was the fact
   that the bishop was not willing to eat with any one else, and never
   accepted an invitation to a feast. On account of this the plot against
   him became widespread. His reasons for not eating with others no one
   knew with any certainty, [840] but some persons in justification of his
   conduct state that he had a very delicate stomach, and weak digestion,
   which obliged him to be careful in his diet, and therefore he ate
   alone; while others thought this was due to his rigid and habitual
   abstinence. Whatever the real motive may have been, the circumstance
   itself contributed not a little to the grounds of accusation by his
   calumniators. The people nevertheless continued to regard him with love
   and veneration, on account of his valuable discourses in the church,
   and therefore those who sought to traduce him, only brought themselves
   into contempt. How eloquent, convincing, and persuasive his sermons
   were, both those which were published by himself, and such as were
   noted down by short-hand writers as he delivered them, why should we
   stay to declare? Those who desire to form an adequate idea of them,
   must read for themselves, and will thereby derive both pleasure and
   profit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [840] These reasons are given by Palladius as follows: He was
   accustomed to eat alone, as I partially know, for these reasons: first,
   he drank no wine...secondly, his stomach was, on account of certain
   infirmities, irregular, so that often the food prepared for him was
   repugnant, and other food not put before him was desired. Again he at
   times neglected to eat, lengthening out his meal until evening,
   sometimes being absorbed in ecclesiastical cares and sometimes in
   contemplation;...but it is a custom with table companions if we do not
   relish the same articles of food which they do, or laugh at
   insignificant witticisms...to make this an occasion of ill-speech.'
   Palladius, de Vita S. Joannis, 12.

   Chapter V.--John draws down upon Himself the Displeasure of Many
   Persons of Rank and Power. Of the Eunuch Eutropius.

   As long as John was in conflict with the clergy only, machinations
   against him were utterly powerless; but when he proceeded to rebuke
   many of those in public office also with immoderate vehemence, the tide
   of unpopularity began to set against him with far greater impetus.
   Hence many stories were told to his disparagement. And most of these
   found attentive and believing listeners. This growing prejudice was not
   a little increased by an oration which he pronounced at that time
   against Eutropius. For Eutropius was the chief eunuch of the imperial
   bed-chamber, and the first of all eunuchs that was admitted to the
   dignity of consul. He, desiring to inflict vengeance on certain persons
   who had taken refuge in the churches, induced the emperors to make a
   law [841] excluding delinquents from the privilege of sanctuary, and
   authorizing the seizure of those who had sought the shelter of the
   sacred edifices. But its author was punished for this almost
   immediately; for scarcely had the law been promulgated, before
   Eutropius himself, having incurred the displeasure of the emperor, fled
   for protection to the church. [842] The bishop therefore, while
   Eutropius trembling with fear lay under the table of the altar,
   mounting the pulpit [843] from which he was accustomed to address the
   people in order to be the more distinctly heard, uttered an invective
   against him: wherefore he seemed to create greater displeasure in some,
   as he not only denied compassion to the unfortunate, but added insult
   to cruelty. By the emperor's order however, for certain offences
   committed by him, Eutropius, though bearing the consulate, was
   decapitated, and his name effaced from the list of consuls, that of
   Theodore his colleague being alone suffered to remain as in office for
   that year. [844] It is said that John afterwards used the same license
   towards Gaïnas also, who was then commander-in-chief of the army;
   treating him with characteristic rudeness, because he had presumed to
   request the emperor to assign the Arians, with whom he agreed in
   sentiment, one of the churches within the city. Many others also of the
   higher orders, for a variety of causes, he censured with the same
   unceremonious freedom, so that by these means he created many powerful
   adversaries. Wherefore Theophilus bishop of Alexandria, immediately
   after his ordination, was plotting his overthrow; and concerted
   measures for this purpose in secret, both with the friends who were
   around him, and by letter with such as were at a distance. For it was
   not so much the boldness with which John lashed whatever was obnoxious
   to him, that affected Theophilus, as his own failure to place his
   favorite presbyter Isidore in the episcopal chair of Constantinople. In
   such a state were the affairs of John the bishop at that time; mischief
   thus threatened him at the very commencement of his episcopate. But we
   shall enter into these things more at large as we proceed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [841] Sozomen (VIII. 7) says that this law was rescinded very soon
   afterwards.

   [842] See also Chrysostom, Orat. in Eutropium, 1. 3 (Nicene and
   Post-Nicene Fathers, Vol. IX. p. 251). From these statements it appears
   that Zosimus is in error when he says (V. 18) that Eutropius was seized
   in violation of the law of sanctuary and taken out of the church.
   Chrysostom assigns his seizure to a time when he had left the church
   for some purpose or other.

   accustomed to preach from the steps of the altar (cf. Bingham Christ.
   Antiq. VIII. 4. 5); but Chrysostom, on account of his little stature,
   as some say, used the ambôn' as a pulpit.

   Chapter VI.--Gaïnas the Goth attempts to usurp the Sovereign Power;
   after filling Constantinople with Disorder, he is slain.

   I shall now narrate some memorable circumstances that occurred at that
   period, in which it will be seen how Divine Providence interposed by
   extraordinary agencies for the preservation of the city and Roman
   empire from the utmost peril. Gaïnas was a barbarian by extraction but
   after becoming a Roman subject, and having engaged in military service,
   and risen by degrees from one rank to another, he was at length
   appointed general-in-chief both of the Roman horse and foot. When he
   had obtained this lofty position, he forgot his position and relations,
   and was unable to restrain himself and on the other hand according to
   the common saying left no stone unturned' in order to gain control of
   the Roman government. To accomplish this he sent for the Goths out of
   their own country, and gave the principal commissions in the army to
   his relations. Then when Tribigildus, one of his kinsmen who had the
   command of the forces in Phrygia, had at the instigation of Gaïnas
   broken out into open revolt, and was filling the people of Phrygia with
   confusion and dismay, he managed to have deputed to him the oversight
   of matters in the disturbed province. Now the Emperor Arcadius not
   suspecting [any harm] committed the charge of these affairs to him.
   Gaïnas therefore immediately set out at the head of an immense number
   of the barbarous Goths, apparently on an expedition against
   Tribigildus, but with the real intention of establishing his own unjust
   domination. On reaching Phrygia he began to subvert everything.
   Consequently the affairs of the Romans were immediately thrown into
   great consternation, not only on account of the vast barbarian force
   which Gaïnas had at his command, but also because the most fertile and
   opulent regions of the East were threatened with desolation. In this
   emergency the emperor, acting with much prudence, sought to arrest the
   course of the barbarian by address: he accordingly sent him an embassy
   with instructions to appease him for the present by every kind of
   concession. Gaïnas having demanded that Saturninus and Aurelian, two of
   the most distinguished of the senatorial order, and men of consular
   dignity, whom he knew to be unfavorable to his pretensions, should be
   delivered up to him, the emperor most unwillingly yielded to the
   exigency of the crisis; and these two persons, prepared to die for the
   public good, nobly submitted themselves to the emperor's disposal. They
   therefore proceeded to meet the barbarian, at a place used for
   horse-racing some distance from Chalcedon, being resolved to endure
   whatever he might be disposed to inflict; but however they suffered no
   harm. The usurper simulating dissatisfaction, advanced to Chalcedon,
   whither the emperor Arcadius also went to meet him. Both then entered
   the church where the body of the martyr Euphemia is deposited, and
   there entered into a mutual pledge on oath that neither would plot
   against the other. The emperor indeed kept his engagement, having a
   religious regard to an oath, and being on that account beloved of God.
   But Gaïnas soon violated it, and did not swerve from his original
   purpose; on the contrary he was intent on carnage, plunder, and
   conflagration, not only against Constantinople, but also against the
   whole extent of the Roman empire, if he could by any means carry it
   into effect. The city was accordingly quite inundated by the
   barbarians, and its residents were reduced to a condition equivalent to
   that of captives. Moreover so great was the danger of the city that a
   comet of prodigious magnitude, reaching from heaven even to the earth,
   such as was never before seen, gave forewarning of it. [845] Gaïnas
   first most shamelessly attempted to make a seizure of the silver
   publicly exposed for sale in the shops: but when the proprietors,
   advised beforehand by report of his intention, abstained from exposing
   it on their counters, his thoughts were diverted to another object,
   which was to send an immense body of barbarians at night for the
   purpose of burning down the palace. Then indeed it appeared distinctly
   that God had providential care over the city: for a multitude of angels
   appeared to the rebels, in the form of armed men of gigantic stature,
   before whom the barbarians, imagining them to be a large army of brave
   troops, turned away with terror and departed. When this was reported to
   Gaïnas, it seemed to him quite incredible--for he knew that the
   greatest part of the Roman army was at a distance, dispersed as a
   garrison over the Eastern cities--and he sent others on the following
   night and repeatedly afterwards. Now as they constantly returned with
   the same statement--for the angels of God always presented themselves
   in the same form--he came with a great multitude, and at length became
   himself a spectator of the prodigy. Then supposing that what he saw was
   really a body of soldiers, and that they concealed themselves by day,
   and baffled his designs by night, he desisted from his attempt, and
   took another resolution which he conceived would be detrimental to the
   Romans; but the event proved it to be greatly to their advantage.
   Pretending to be under demoniacal possession, he went forth as if for
   prayer to the church of St. John the Apostle, which is seven miles
   distant from the city. Together with him went barbarians who carried
   out arms, having concealed them in casks and other specious coverings.
   And when the soldiers who guarded the city gates detected these, and
   would not suffer them to pass, the barbarians drew their swords and put
   them to death. A fearful tumult thence arose in the city, and death
   seemed to threaten every one; nevertheless the city continued secure at
   that time, its gates being every where well defended. The emperor with
   timely wisdom proclaimed Gaïnas a public enemy, and ordered that all
   the barbarians who remained shut up in the city should be slain. Thus
   one day after the guards of the gates had been killed, the Romans
   attacked the barbarians within the walls near the church of the
   Goths--for thither such of them as had been left in the city had
   betaken themselves--and after destroying a great number of them they
   set the church on fire, and burnt it to the ground. Gaïnas being
   informed of the slaughter of those of his party who did not manage to
   get out of the city, and perceiving the failure of all his artifices,
   left St. John's church, and advanced rapidly towards Thrace. On
   reaching the Chersonnese he endeavored to pass over from thence and
   take Lampsacus, in order that from that place he might make himself
   master of the Eastern parts. As the emperor had immediately dispatched
   forces in pursuit both by land and by sea, another wonderful
   interposition of Divine Providence occurred. For while the barbarians,
   destitute of ships, hastily put together rafts and were attempting to
   cross on them, suddenly the Roman fleet appeared, and the west wind
   began to blow hard. This afforded an easy passage to the Romans; but
   the barbarians with their horses, tossed up and down in their frail
   barks by the violence of the gale, were at length overwhelmed by the
   waves; many of them also were destroyed by the Romans. In this manner
   during the passage a vast number of the barbarians perished; but Gaïnas
   departing thence fled into Thrace, where he fell in with another body
   of the Roman forces and was slain by them together with the barbarians
   that attended him. [846] Let this cursory notice of Gaïnas suffice
   here.

   Those who may desire more minute details of the circumstances of that
   war, should read The Gaïnea of Eusebius Scholasticus, [847] who was at
   that time a pupil of Troïlus the sophist; and having been a spectator
   of the war, related the events of it in an heroic poem consisting of
   four books; and inasmuch as the events alluded to had but recently
   taken place, he acquired for himself great celebrity. The poet Ammonius
   has also very lately composed another description in verse of the same
   transactions, which he recited before the emperor in the sixteenth
   consulate [848] of Theodosius the younger, which he bore with Faustus.

   This war was terminated under the consulate of Stilicho and Aurelian.
   [849] The year following, [850] the consulate was celebrated by
   Fravitus also a Goth by extraction, who was honored by the Romans, and
   showed great fidelity and attachment to them, rendering important
   services in this very war. For this reason he attained to the dignity
   of consul. In that year on the tenth of April there was born a son to
   the Emperor Arcadius, the good Theodosius.

   But while the affairs of the state were thus troubled, the dignitaries
   of the Church refrained not in the least from their disgraceful cabals
   against each other, to the great reproach of the Christian religion;
   for during this time the ecclesiastics incited tumults against each
   other. The source of the mischief originated in Egypt in the following
   manner.

   Chapter VII.--Dissension between Theophilus Bishop of Alexandria and
   the Monks of the Desert. Condemnation of Origen's Books.

   The question had been started a little before, [851] whether God is a
   corporeal existence, and has the form of man; or whether he is
   incorporeal, and without human or, generally speaking, any other bodily
   shape? From this question arose strifes and contentions among a very
   great number of persons, some favoring one opinion on the subject, and
   others patronizing the opposite. Very many of the more simple ascetics
   asserted that God is corporeal, and has a human figure: but most others
   condemn their judgment, and contended that God is incorporeal, and free
   of all form whatever. With these latter Theophilus bishop of Alexandria
   agreed so thoroughly that in the church before all the people he
   inveighed against those who attributed to God a human form, expressly
   teaching that the Divine Being is wholly incorporeal. When the Egyptian
   ascetics were apprised of this, they left their monasteries and came to
   Alexandria; where they excited a tumult against the bishop, accusing
   him of impiety, and threatening to put him to death. Theophilus
   becoming aware of his danger, after some consideration had recourse to
   this expedient to extricate himself from the threatened death. Going to
   the monks, he in a conciliatory tone thus addressed them: In seeing
   you, I behold the face of God.' The utterance of this saying moderated
   the fury of these men and they replied: If you really admit that God's
   countenance is such as ours, anathematize Origen's book; [852] for some
   drawing arguments from them oppose themselves to our opinion. If you
   will not do this, expect to be treated by us as an impious person, and
   the enemy of God.' But as far as I am concerned,' said Theophilus, I
   will readily do what you require: and be ye not angry with me, for I
   myself also disapprove of Origen's works, and consider those who
   countenance them deserving of censure.' Thus he succeeded in appeasing
   and sending away the monks at that time; and probably the whole dispute
   respecting this subject would have been set at rest, had it not been
   for another circumstance which happened immediately after. Over the
   monasteries in Egypt there were four devout persons as superintendents
   named Dioscorus, Ammonius, Eusebius, and Euthymius: these men were
   brothers, and had the appellation of the Tall Monks' given them on
   account of their stature. They were moreover distinguished both for the
   sanctity of their lives, and the extent of their erudition, and for
   these reasons their reputation was very high at Alexandria. Theophilus
   in particular, the prelate of that city, loved and honored them
   exceedingly: insomuch that he constituted one of them, Dioscorus,
   bishop of Hermopolis [853] against his will, having forcibly drawn him
   from his retreat. Two of the others he entreated to continue with him,
   and with difficulty prevailed upon them to do so; still by the exercise
   of his authority as bishop he accomplished his purpose: when therefore
   he had invested them with the clerical office, he committed to their
   charge the management of ecclesiastical affairs. They, constrained by
   necessity, performed the duties thus imposed on them successfully;
   nevertheless they were dissatisfied because they were unable to follow
   philosophical pursuits and ascetic exercises. And as in process of
   time, they thought they were being spiritually injured, observing the
   bishop to be devoted to gain, and greedily intent on the acquisition of
   wealth, and according to the common saying leaving no stone unturned'
   for the sake of gain, they refused to remain with him any longer,
   declaring that they loved solitude, and greatly preferred it to living
   in the city. As long as he was ignorant of the true motive for their
   departure, he earnestly begged them to abide with him; but when he
   perceived that they were dissatisfied with his conduct, he became
   excessively irritated, and threatened to do them all kinds of mischief.
   But they making little account of his menaces retired into the desert;
   upon which Theophilus, who was evidently of a hasty and malignant
   temperament, raised not a small clamor against them, and by every
   contrivance earnestly sought to do them injury. He also conceived a
   dislike against their brother Dioscorus, bishop of Hermopolis. He was
   moreover extremely annoyed at the esteem and veneration in which he was
   held by the ascetics. Being aware, however, that he would be able to do
   no harm to these persons unless he could stir up hostility in the minds
   of the monks against them, he used this artifice to effect it. He well
   knew that these men in their frequent theological discussions with him,
   had maintained that the Deity was incorporeal, and by no means had a
   human form; because [they argued] such a constitution would involve the
   necessary accompaniment of human passions. Now this has been
   demonstrated by the ancient writers and especially Origen. Theophilus,
   however though entertaining the very same opinion respecting the Divine
   nature, yet to gratify his vindictive feelings, did not hesitate to
   pervert what he and they had rightly taught: but imposed upon the
   majority of the monks, men who were sincere but rude in speech,' [854]
   the greater part of whom were quite illiterate. Sending letters to the
   monasteries in the desert, he advised them not to give heed either to
   Dioscorus or to his brothers, inasmuch as they affirmed that God had
   not a body. Whereas,' said he, according to the sacred Scripture God
   has eyes, ears, hands, and feet, as men have; but the partisans of
   Dioscorus, being followers of Origen, introduce the blasphemous dogma
   that God has neither eyes, ears, feet, nor hands.' By this sophism he
   took advantage of the simplicity of these monks and thus a hot
   dissension was stirred up among them. Such as had a cultivated mind
   indeed were not beguiled by this plausibility, and therefore still
   adhere to Dioscorus and Origen; but the more ignorant who greatly
   exceeded the others in number, inflamed by an ardent zeal without
   knowledge, immediately raised an outcry against their brethren. A
   division being thus made, both parties branded each other as impious;
   and some listening to Theophilus called their brethren Origenists,' and
   impious' and the others termed those who were convinced by Theophilus
   Anthropomorphitæ.' On this account violent altercation arose, and an
   inextinguishable war between the monks. Theophilus on receiving
   intimation of the success of his device, went to Nitria where the
   monasteries are, accompanied by a multitude of persons, and armed the
   monks against Dioscorus and his brethren; who being in danger of losing
   their lives, made their escape with great difficulty.

   While these things were in progress in Egypt John bishop of
   Constantinople was ignorant of them, but flourished in eloquence and
   became increasingly celebrated for his discourses. Moreover he first
   enlarged the prayers contained in the nocturnal hymns, for the reason I
   am about to assign.

   Chapter VIII.--The Arians and the Supporters of the Homoousion' hold
   Nocturnal Assemblies and sing Antiphonal Hymns, a Species of
   Composition ascribed to Ignatius, surnamed Theophorus. [855] Conflict
   between the Two Parties.

   The Arians, as we have said, held their meetings without the city. As
   often therefore as the festal days occurred--I mean Saturday [856] and
   Lord's day--in each week, on which assemblies are usually held in the
   churches, they congregated within the city gates about the public
   squares, and sang responsive verses adapted to the Arian heresy. This
   they did during the greater part of the night: and again in the
   morning, chanting the same songs which they called responsive, they
   paraded through the midst of the city, and so passed out of the gates
   to go to their places of assembly. But since they did not desist from
   making use of insulting expressions in relation to the Homoousians,
   often singing such words as these: Where are they that say three things
   are but one power?'--John fearing lest any of the more simple should be
   drawn away from the church by such kind of hymns, opposed to them some
   of his own people, that they also employing themselves in chanting
   nocturnal hymns, might obscure the effort of the Arians, and confirm
   his own party in the profession of their faith. John's design indeed
   seemed to be good, but it issued in tumult and dangers. For as the
   Homoousians performed their nocturnal hymns with greater display,--for
   there were invented by John silver crosses for them on which lighted
   wax-tapers were carried, provided at the expense of the empress
   Eudoxia,--the Arians who were very numerous, and fired with envy,
   resolved to revenge themselves by a desperate and riotous attack upon
   their rivals. For from the remembrance of their own recent domination,
   they were full of confidence in their ability to overcome, and of
   contempt for their adversaries. Without delay therefore, on one of
   these nights, they engaged in a conflict; and Briso, one of the eunuchs
   of the empress, who was at that time leading the chanters of these
   hymns, was wounded by a stone in the forehead, and also some of the
   people on both sides were killed. Whereupon the emperor being angered,
   forbade the Arians to chant their hymns any more in public. Such were
   the events of this occasion.

   We must now however make some allusion to the origin of this custom in
   the church of responsive singing. Ignatius [857] third bishop of
   Antioch in Syria from the apostle Peter, who also had held intercourse
   with the apostles themselves, saw a vision of angels hymning in
   alternate chants the Holy Trinity. Accordingly he introduced the mode
   of singing he had observed in the vision into the Antiochian church;
   whence it was transmitted by tradition to all the other churches. Such
   is the account [we have received] in relation to these responsive
   hymns.

   made him the very child whom the Saviour took up in his arms,' and set

   [857] There has been some difference of opinion as to whether Socrates
   is correct in here ascribing the institution of responsive chants to
   Ignatius. Valesius doubts Socrates' accuracy, but other authorities are

   ascribes their origin, simply developed them. Cf. Bingham, Christ.

   Chapter IX.--Dispute between Theophilus and Peter leading to an Attempt
   on the Part of the Former to depose John Bishop of Constantinople.

   Not long after this, the monks of the desert, together with Dioscorus
   and his brothers, came to Constantinople. There was also with them
   Isidore, [858] formerly the most intimate friend of the bishop
   Theophilus, but then become his bitterest enemy, on account of the
   following circumstance: A certain man named Peter was at that time the
   archpresbyter [859] of the Alexandrian church; Theophilus being
   irritated against this person, determined to eject him from the church;
   and as the ground of expulsion, he brought the charge against him of
   having admitted to a participation of the sacred mysteries, a woman of
   the Manichæan sect, without first compelling her to renounce her
   Manichæan heresy. As Peter in his defence declared, that not only had
   the errors of this woman been previously abjured, but that Theophilus
   himself had sanctioned her admission to the eucharist, Theophilus
   became indignant, as if he had been grievously calumniated; whereupon
   he affirmed that he was altogether unacquainted with the circumstance.
   Peter therefore summoned Isidore to bear witness to the bishop's
   knowledge of the facts concerning the woman. Now Isidore happened to be
   then at Rome, on a mission from Theophilus to Damasus the prelate of
   the imperial city, for the purpose of affecting a reconciliation
   between him and Flavian bishop of Antioch; for the adherents of
   Meletius had separated from Flavian in detestation of his perjury, as
   we have already observed. [860] When Isidore had returned from Rome,
   and was cited as a witness by Peter, he deposed that the woman was
   received by consent of the bishop; and that he himself had administered
   the sacrament to her. Upon this Theophilus became enraged and in anger
   ejected them both. This furnished the reason for Isidore's going to
   Constantinople with Dioscorus and his brethren, in order to submit to
   the cognizance of the emperor, and John the bishop, the injustice and
   violence with which Theophilus had treated them. John, on being
   informed of the facts, gave the men an honorable reception, and did not
   exclude them from communion at prayers, but postponed their communion
   of the sacred mysteries, until their affairs should be examined into.
   Whilst matters were in this posture, a false report was brought to
   Theophilus' ears, that John had both admitted them to a participation
   of the mysteries, and was also ready to give them assistance; wherefore
   he resolved not only to be revenged on Isidore and Dioscorus, but also
   if possible to cast John out of his episcopal chair. With this design
   he wrote to all the bishops of the various cities, and concealing his
   real motive, ostensibly condemned therein the books of Origen merely:
   which Athanasius, [861] his predecessor, had used in confirmation of
   his own faith, frequently appealing to the testimony and authority of
   Origen's writings, in his orations against the Arians.

   Chapter X.--Epiphanius Bishop of Cyprus convenes a Synod to condemn the
   Books of Origen.

   He moreover renewed his friendship with Epiphanius [862] bishop of
   Constantia in Cyprus, with whom he had formerly been at variance. For
   Theophilus accused Epiphanius of entertaining low thoughts of God, by
   supposing him to have a human form. [863] Now although Theophilus was
   really unchanged in sentiment, and had denounced those who thought that
   the divinity was human in form, yet on account of his hatred of others,
   he openly denied his own convictions; and he now professed to be
   friendly with Epiphanius, as if he had altered his mind and agreed with
   him in his views of God. He then managed it so that Epiphanius by
   letter should convene a Synod of the bishops in Cyprus, in order to
   condemn the writings of Origen. Epiphanius being on account of his
   extraordinary piety a man of simple mind and manners was easily
   influenced by the letters of Theophilus: having therefore assembled a
   council of bishops in that island, he caused a prohibition to be
   therein made of the reading of Origen's works. He also wrote to John,
   exhorting him to abstain from the study of Origen's books, and to
   convoke a Synod for decreeing the same thing as he had done.
   Accordingly when Theophilus had in this way deluded Epiphanius, who was
   famous for his piety, seeing his design prosper according to his wish,
   he became more confident, and himself also assembled a great number of
   bishops. In that convention, pursuing the same course as Epiphanius, he
   caused a like sentence of condemnation to be pronounced on the writings
   of Origen, who had been dead nearly two hundred years: not having this
   as his first object, but rather his purpose of revenge on Dioscorus and
   his brethren. John paying but little attention to the communications of
   Epiphanius and Theophilus, was intent on instructing the churches; and
   he flourished more and more as a preacher, but made no account of the
   plots which were laid against him. As soon, however, as it became
   apparent to every body that Theophilus was endeavoring to divest John
   of his bishopric, then all those who had any ill-will against John,
   combined in calumniating him. And thus many of the clergy, and many of
   those in office, and of those who had great influence at the court,
   believing that they had found an opportunity now of avenging themselves
   upon John, exerted themselves to procure the convocation of a Grand
   Synod at Constantinople, partly by sending letters and partly by
   dispatching messengers in all directions for that purpose.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [862] There were thirty-five bishops, besides several presbyters and
   laymen of some distinction in the ancient church, who bore the name of
   Epiphanius. The bishop here mentioned is the most illustrious of them
   all, being the author of the well-known treatise de Hæres. His
   see--that of Constantia in Cyprus--was the old Salamis' of Acts xiii.
   5.

   [863] It seems strange that Epiphanius should be classed with the
   Anthropomorphitæ as Epiphanius himself repudiates their views according
   to the testimony of Jerome. Cf. Jerome, ad Pammachium, 2 et seq.
   Socrates must have been imposed upon by some Origenist, as the
   Origenists were accustomed to call all who condemned their views
   Anthropomorphitæ. Cf. above, chap. 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XI.--Of Severian and Antiochus: their Disagreement from John.

   The odium against John Chrysostom was considerably increased by another
   additional event as follows: two bishops flourished at that time,
   Syrians by birth, named Severian and Antiochus; Severian presided over
   the church at Gabala, a city of Syria, and Antiochus over that of
   Ptolemaïs in Phoenicia. They were both renowned for their eloquence;
   but although Severian was a very learned man, he did not succeed in
   using the Greek language perfectly; and so while speaking Greek he
   betrayed his Syrian origin. Antiochus came first to Constantinople, and
   having preached in the churches for some time with great zeal and
   ability, and having thus amassed a large sum of money, [864] he
   returned to his own church. Severian hearing that Antiochus had
   collected a fortune by his visit to Constantinople, determined to
   follow his example. He therefore exercised himself for the occasion,
   and having composed a number of sermons, set out for Constantinople.
   Being most kindly received by John, to a certain point, he soothed and
   flattered the man, and was himself no less beloved and honored by him:
   meanwhile his discourses gained him great celebrity, so that he
   attracted the notice of many persons of rank, and even of the emperor
   himself. And as it happened at that time that the bishop of Ephesus
   died, John was obliged to go to Ephesus for the purpose of ordaining a
   successor. On his arrival at that city, as the people were divided in
   their choice, some proposing one person, and some another, John
   perceiving that both parties were in a contentious mood, and that they
   did not wish to adopt his counsel, he resolved without much ado to end
   their dispute by preferring to the bishopric a certain Heraclides, a
   deacon of his own, and a Cypriot by descent. And thus both parties
   desisting from their strife with each other had peace. [865] Now as
   this detention [at Ephesus] was lengthened, Severian continued to
   preach at Constantinople, and daily grew in favor with his hearers. Of
   this John was not left ignorant, for he was promptly made acquainted
   with whatever occurred, Serapion, of whom we have before spoken, [866]
   communicating the news to him and asserting that the church was being
   troubled by Severian; thus the bishop was aroused to a feeling of
   jealousy. Having therefore among other matters deprived many of the
   Novatians and Quartodecimans of their churches, he returned to
   Constantinople. [867] Here he resumed himself the care of the churches
   under his own especial jurisdiction. But Serapion's arrogance no one
   could bear; for thus having won John's unbounded confidence and regard,
   he was so puffed up by it that he treated every one with contempt. And
   on this account also animosity was inflamed the more against the
   bishop. On one occasion when Severian passed by him, Serapion neglected
   to pay him the homage due to a bishop, but continued seated [instead of
   rising], indicating plainly how little he cared for his presence.
   Severian, unable to endure patiently this [supposed] rudeness and
   contempt, said with a loud voice to those present, If Serapion should
   die a Christian, Christ has not become incarnate.' Serapion, taking
   occasion from this remark, publicly incited Chrysostom to enmity
   against Severian: for suppressing the conditional clause of the
   sentence, If Serapion die a Christian,' and saying that he had made the
   assertion that Christ has not become incarnate,' he brought several
   witnesses of his own party to sustain this charge. But on being
   informed of this the Empress Eudoxia severely reprimanded John, and
   ordered that Severian should be immediately recalled from Chalcedon in
   Bithynia. He returned forthwith; but John would hold no intercourse
   whatever with him, nor did he listen to any one urging him to do so,
   until at length the Empress Eudoxia herself, in the church called The
   Apostles, placed her son Theodosius, who now so happily reigns, but was
   then quite an infant, before John's knees, and adjuring [868] him
   repeatedly by the young prince her son, with difficulty prevailed upon
   him to be reconciled to Severian. In this manner then these men were
   outwardly reconciled; but they nevertheless continued cherishing a
   rancorous feeling toward each other. Such was the origin of the
   animosity [of John] against Severian.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [864] The offerings of the congregations seem to have been divided
   usually among the officiating clergymen. Cf. Bingham, Christ. Antiq. V.
   4. 1.

   [865] In another version of this eleventh chapter of the sixth book,
   appended at the end of the sixth book in the Greek text of Bright,
   instead of the sentence beginning And thus both parties,' &c. is found
   the following more consistent statement: Inasmuch, however, as on this
   account a tumult arose at Ephesus, on the ground that Heraclides was
   not worthy of the bishopric, it became necessary for John to remain in
   Ephesus for a long time.'

   [866] The alternative version inserts here the following sentence: And
   who was very much beloved by John and had been intrusted with the whole
   care of the episcopal administration, on account of his piety and
   faithfulness and watchfulness in respect to details of every sort, and
   diligence in matters pertaining to the interests of the bishop.'

   [867] From this point to within one or two sentences of the end of the
   chapter the parallel version is so different at times that it will be
   well to insert it entire here for the purpose of comparison. It runs
   thus: Not long afterward John came to Constantinople and assumed
   himself the churches which belonged to his jurisdiction. But between
   Serapion, the deacon, and Severian there had arisen a certain coolness;
   Serapion was opposed to Severian because the latter seemed desirous of
   excelling John in public speaking, and Severian was jealous of Serapion
   because the bishop John favored him, and the care of the bishopric had
   been intrusted to him. They being thus disposed toward one another, it
   happened that the evil of hatred was increased from the following
   cause. As Severian was passing by on one occasion Serapion did not
   render him the homage due to a bishop, but he continued sitting;
   whether because he had not noticed him, as he afterwards affirmed upon
   oath before a council, or because he cared little for him, being
   himself the vicegerent of a bishop, as Severian asserted, I am unable
   to say; God only knows. At the time, however, Severian did not tolerate
   the contempt; but immediately, and in anticipation of a public
   investigation before a council, he condemned Serapion upon oath, and
   not only declared him deposed from the dignity of the diaconate, but
   also put him out of the church. John upon learning this was very much
   grieved. As the matter afterwards was investigated by a council and
   Serapion defended himself declaring that he had not perceived [the
   approach of the bishop], and summoned witnesses to the fact, the common
   verdict of the assembled bishops was in favor of acquitting him and
   urging Severian to accept the apology of Serapion. The Bishop John, for
   his part, to satisfy Severian, suspended Serapion from the diaconate
   for a week; although he used him in all his affairs as his right hand,
   because he was very keen and diligent in ecclesiastical disputation.
   Severian however was not satisfied with these measures, but used all
   means to effect the permanent deposition of Serapion from the diaconate
   and his excommunication. John was extremely grieved at these words and
   arose from the council, leaving the adjudication of the case to the
   bishops present, saying to them, "Do you examine the matter in hand and
   render judgment according to your own conclusions; as for me I resign
   my part in the arbitration between them." These things having been said
   by John as he arose, the council likewise arose and left the case, as
   it stood, blaming Severian the more for not yielding to the request of
   the Bishop John. After this John never received Severian into a private
   interview; but advised him to return to his own country, communicating
   to him the following message: "It is not expedient, Severian," said he,
   "that the parish intrusted to you should remain for so long without
   care and bereft of a bishop; wherefore hasten and take charge of your
   churches, and do not neglect the gift which is in you." As he now
   prepared for his journey and started, the Empress Eudoxia, on being
   informed of the facts,' &c. From this point the variations are few,
   verbal, and unimportant.

   [868] The ancients often swore by their children, especially when they
   wished to entreat others most earnestly. Cf. Vergil, Æneid, VI. 364,
   Per caput hoc juro, per spem surgentis Juli.' The form of abjuration
   used by Eudoxia was probably this: By this little child of mine, and
   your spiritual son, whom I brought forth and whom you received out of
   the sacred font, be reconciled to Severian.' Valesius, however, doubts
   the reality of this affair.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XII.--Epiphanius, in order to gratify Theophilus, performs
   Ordinations at Constantinople without John's Permission.

   Not long after this, at the suggestion of Theophilus, the bishop
   Epiphanius again came from Cyprus to Constantinople; he brought also
   with him a copy of the synodical decree in which they did not
   excommunicate Origen himself but condemned his books. On reaching St.
   John's church, which is seven miles distant from the city, he
   disembarked, and there celebrated a service; then after having ordained
   a deacon, [869] he again entered the city. In complaisance to
   Theophilus he declined John's courtesy, and engaged apartments in a
   private house. He afterwards assembled those of the bishops who were
   then in the capital, and producing his copy of the synodical decree
   condemnatory of Origen's works, recited it before them; not being able
   to assign any reason for this judgment, than that it seemed fit to
   Theophilus and himself to reject them. Some indeed from a reverential
   respect for Epiphanius subscribed the decree; but many refused to do so
   among whom was Theotimus bishop of Scythia, who thus addressed
   Epiphanius:--I neither choose, Epiphanius,' said he, to insult the
   memory of one who ended his life piously long ago; nor dare I be guilty
   of so impious an act, as that of condemning what our predecessors did
   not reject: and especially when I know of no evil doctrine contained in
   Origen's books.' Having said this, he brought forward one of that
   author's works, and reading a few passages therefrom, showed that the
   sentiments propounded were in perfect accordance with the orthodox
   faith. He then added, Those who speak evil of these writings are
   unconsciously casting dishonor upon the sacred volume whence their
   principles are drawn.' Such was the reply which Theotimus, a bishop
   celebrated for his piety and rectitude of life, made to Epiphanius.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [869] It was contrary to the canons of the church for a bishop to
   ordain a presbyter or a deacon in another's diocese. Cf. Apostol. Can.
   35. Let not a bishop dare to ordain beyond his own limits in cities and
   places not subject to him. But if he be convicted of doing so without
   the consent of those persons who have authority over such cities and
   places, let him be deposed, and those also whom he has ordained.' Also
   Can. 16 of the Council of Nicæa; If any one should dare to steal, as it
   were, a person who belongs to another [bishop], and to ordain him for
   his own church, without permission of the bishop from whom he was
   withdrawn, the ordination shall be void.'

   Chapter XIII.--The Author's Defence of Origen. [870]

   But since carping detractors have imposed upon many persons and have
   succeeded in deterring them from reading Origen, as though he were a
   blasphemous writer, I deem it not unseasonable to make a few
   observations respecting him. Worthless characters, and such as are
   destitute of ability to attain eminence themselves, often seek to get
   into notice by decrying those who excel them. And first Methodius,
   bishop of a city in Lycia named Olympus, labored under this malady;
   next Eustathius, who for a short time presided over the church at
   Antioch; after him Apollinaris; and lastly Theophilus. This quaternion
   of revilers has traduced Origen, but not on the same grounds, one
   having found one cause of accusation against him, and another another;
   and thus each has demonstrated that what he has taken no objection to,
   he has fully accepted. For since one has attacked one opinion in
   particular, and another has found fault with another, it is evident
   that each has admitted as true what he has not assailed, giving a tacit
   approbation to what he has not attacked. Methodius indeed, when he had
   in various places railed against Origen, afterwards as if retracting
   all he had previously said, expresses his admiration of the man, in a
   dialogue which he entitled Xenon. [871] But I affirm that from the
   censure of these men, greater commendation accrues to Origen. For those
   who have sought out whatever they deemed worthy of reprobation in him,
   and yet have never charged him with holding unsound views respecting
   the holy Trinity, are in this way most distinctly shown to bear witness
   to his orthodox piety: and by not reproaching him on this point, they
   commend him by their own testimony. But Athanasius the defender of the
   doctrine of consubstantiality, in his Discourses against the Arians
   [872] continually cites this author as a witness of his own faith,
   interweaving his words with his own, and saying, The most admirable and
   assiduous Origen,' says he, by his own testimony confirms our doctrine
   concerning the Son of God, affirming him to be co-eternal with the
   Father.' Those therefore who load Origen with opprobrium, overlook the
   fact that their maledictions fall at the same time on Athanasius, the
   eulogist of Origen. So much will be enough for the vindication of
   Origen; we shall now return to the course of our history.

   [870] The views of Origen met with opposition from the very outset.
   During his own lifetime he was condemned at Alexandria, and after his
   death repeatedly until 541 a.d., and perhaps also by the fifth general
   council held at Constantinople in 553. For a full account of the
   Origenistic Controversy, see Smith and Wace, Dict. of Christ. Biog. and

   Chapter XIV.--Epiphanius is asked to meet John; on refusing he is
   admonished concerning his Anticanonical Proceedings; alarmed at this he
   leaves Constantinople.

   John was not offended because Epiphanius, contrary to the
   ecclesiastical canon, had made an ordination in his church; [873] but
   invited him to remain with him at the episcopal palace. He, however,
   replied that he would neither stay nor pray with him, unless he would
   expel Dioscorus and his brethren from the city, and with his own hand
   subscribe the condemnation of Origen's books. Now as John deferred the
   performance of these things, saying that nothing ought to be done
   rashly before investigation by a general council, John's adversaries
   led Epiphanius to adopt another course. For they contrived it so that
   as a meeting was in the church named The Apostles, Epiphanius came
   forth and before all the people condemned the books of Origen,
   excommunicated Dioscorus with his followers, and charged John with
   countenancing them. These things were reported to John; whereupon on
   the following day he sent the appended message to Epiphanius just as he
   entered the church:

   You do many things contrary to the canons, Epiphanius. In the first
   place you have made an ordination in the churches under my
   jurisdiction: then without my appointment, you have on your own
   authority officiated in them. Moreover, when heretofore I invited you
   hither, you refused to come, and now you take that liberty yourself.
   Beware therefore, lest a tumult being excited among the people, you
   yourself should also incur danger therefrom.'

   Epiphanius becoming alarmed on hearing these admonitions, left the
   church; and after accusing John of many things, he set out on his
   return to Cyprus. Some say that when he was about to depart, he said to
   John, I hope that you will not die a bishop': to which John replied,
   Expect not to arrive at your own country.' I cannot be sure that those
   who reported these things to me spoke the truth; but nevertheless the
   event was in the case of both as prophesied above. For Epiphanius did
   not reach Cyprus, having died on board the ship during his voyage; and
   John a short time afterwards was driven from his see, as we shall show
   in proceeding.

   Chapter XV.--John is expelled from his Church by a Synod held at
   Chalcedon on account of his Dispraise of Women.

   When Epiphanius was gone, John was informed by some person that the
   Empress Eudoxia had stimulated Epiphanius against him. And being of a
   fiery temperament, and of a ready utterance, he soon after pronounced a
   public invective against women in general. The people readily took this
   as uttered indirectly against the empress and so the speech was laid
   hold of by evil-disposed persons, and reported to those in authority.
   At length on being informed of it the empress immediately complained to
   her husband, telling him that the insult offered to herself was equally
   an insult against him. The emperor therefore authorized Theophilus to
   convoke a Synod without delay against John; Severian also co-operated
   in promoting this, for he still retained his grudge against Chrysostom.
   Not long time accordingly intervened before Theophilus arrived, having
   induced several bishops from different cities to accompany him; these
   however had been summoned by the emperor's orders also. Many of the
   bishops in Asia John had deposed when he went to Ephesus and ordained
   Heraclides. Accordingly they all by previous agreement assembled at
   Chalcedon in Bithynia. Cyrinus was at that time bishop of Chalcedon, an
   Egyptian by birth, who said many things to the bishops in disparagement
   of John, denouncing him as the impious,' the haughty,' the inexorable.'
   They indeed were very much satisfied at these denunciations. But
   Maruthas bishop of Mesopotamia having involuntarily trod on Cyrinus'
   foot, he was severely hurt by it and was unable to embark with the rest
   for Constantinople, but remained behind at Chalcedon. The rest crossed
   over. Now Theophilus had so openly avowed his hostility to John, that
   none of the clergy would go forth to meet him, or pay him the least
   honor; but some Alexandrian sailors happening to be on the spot--for at
   that time the grain transporting vessels were there--greeted him with
   joyful acclamations. He excused himself from entering the church, and
   took up his abode at one of the imperial mansions called The
   Placidian.' Then on this account a torrent of accusations began to be
   poured forth against John; for no mention was now made of Origen, but
   all were intent on urging a variety of criminations, many of which were
   ridiculous. Preliminary matters being thus settled, the bishops were
   convened in one of the suburbs of Chalcedon, a place called The Oak,'
   [874] and immediately cited John to answer the charges which were
   brought against him. He also summoned Serapion the deacon; Tigris the
   eunuch presbyter, and Paul the reader, were likewise summoned to appear
   there with him, for these men were included in the impeachments, as
   participators in his guilt. And since John taking exception to those
   who had cited him, on the ground of their being his enemies, refused to
   attend, [875] and demanded a general council, without delay they
   repeated their citation four times in succession; and as he persisted
   in his refusal to meet them as his judges, always giving the same
   answer, they condemned him, and deposed him without assigning any other
   cause for his deposition but that he refused to obey the summons. This
   decision on being announced towards evening, incited the people to a
   most alarming sedition; insomuch that they kept watch all night, and
   would by no means suffer him to be removed from the church, but cried
   out that his cause ought to be determined in a larger assembly. A
   decree of the emperor, however, commanded that he should be immediately
   expelled, and sent into exile; which as soon as John was apprised of,
   he voluntarily surrendered himself about noon unknown to the populace,
   on the third day after his condemnation: for he dreaded any
   insurrectionary movement on his account, and was accordingly led away.

   Chapter XVI.--Sedition on Account of John Chrysostom's Banishment. He
   is recalled.

   The people then became intolerably tumultuous; and as it frequently
   happens in such cases, many who before were adversely disposed against
   him, now changed their hostility into compassion, and said of him whom
   they had so recently desired to see deposed, that he had been traduced.
   By this means therefore they became very numerous who exclaimed against
   both the emperor and the Synod of bishops; but the origin of the
   intrigue they more particularly referred to Theophilus. For his
   fraudulent conduct could no longer be concealed, being exposed by many
   other indications, and especially by the fact of his having held
   communion with Dioscorus, and those termed the Tall Monks,' [876]
   immediately after John's deposition. But Severian preaching in the
   church, and thinking it a suitable occasion to declaim against John,
   said: If John had been condemned for nothing else, yet the haughtiness
   of his demeanor was a crime sufficient to justify his deposition. Men
   indeed are forgiven all other sins: but "God resisteth the proud,"
   [877] as the Divine Scriptures teach us.' These reproaches made the
   people still more inclined to opposition; so that the emperor gave
   orders for his immediate recall. Accordingly Briso a eunuch in the
   service of the empress [878] was sent after him, who finding him at
   Prænetum--a commercial town situated over against Nicomedia--brought
   him back toward Constantinople. And as he had been recalled, John
   refused to enter the city, declaring he would not do so until his
   innocence had been admitted by a higher tribunal. Thus he remained at a
   suburb called Marianæ. Now as he delayed at that place the commotion
   increased, and caused the people to break forth into very indignant and
   opprobrious language against their rulers, wherefore to check their
   fury John was constrained to proceed. On his way a vast multitude, with
   veneration and honor, conducted him immediately to the church; there
   they entreated him to seat himself in the episcopal chair, and give
   them his accustomed benediction. When he sought to excuse himself,
   saying that this ought to be brought about by an order from his judges,
   and that those who condemned him must first revoke their sentence,'
   they were only the more inflamed with the desire of seeing him
   reinstated, and of hearing him address them again. The people finally
   prevailed on him to resume his seat, and pray as usual for peace upon
   them; after which, acting under the same constraint, he preached to
   them. This compliance on John's part afforded his adversaries another
   ground of crimination; but respecting this they took no action at that
   time.

   Chapter XVII.--Conflict between the Constantinopolitans and
   Alexandrians on Account of Heraclides; Flight of Theophilus and the
   Bishops of his Party.

   In the first place, then, Theophilus attempted to investigate the case
   of the ordination of Heraclides, [879] that thereby he might if
   possible find occasion of again deposing John. Heraclides was not
   present at this scrutiny. He was nevertheless judged in his absence, on
   the charge of having unjustly beaten some persons, and afterwards
   dragged them in chains through the midst of the city of Ephesus. As
   John and his adherents remonstrated against the injustice of passing
   sentence upon an absent person, the Alexandrians contended that they
   ought to hear the accusers of Heraclides, although he was not present.
   A sharp contest therefore ensued between the Alexandrians and the
   Constantinopolitans, and a riot arose whereby many persons were
   wounded, and some were killed. Theophilus, seeing what was done, fled
   to Alexandria without ceremony; and the other bishops, except the few
   who supported John, followed his example, and returned to their
   respective sees. After these transactions, Theophilus was degraded, in
   every one's estimation: but the odium attached to him was exceedingly
   increased by the shameless way in which he continued to read Origen's
   works. And when he was asked why he thus countenanced what he had
   publicly condemned, he replied, Origen's books are like a meadow
   enameled with flowers of every kind. If, therefore, I chance to find a
   beautiful one among them, I cull it: but whatever appears to me to be
   thorny, I step over, as that which would prick.' But Theophilus gave
   this answer without reflecting on the saying of the wise Solomon, [880]
   that the words of the wise are as goads'; and those who are pricked by
   the precepts they contain, ought not to kick against them. For these
   reasons then Theophilus was held in contempt by all men. Dioscorus
   bishop of Hermopolis, one of those termed the Tall Monks,' died a short
   time after the flight of Theophilus, and was honored with a magnificent
   funeral, being interred in the church at The Oak,' where the Synod was
   convened on John's account. John meanwhile was sedulously employed in
   preaching. He ordained Serapion bishop of Heraclea in Thrace, on whose
   account the odium against himself had been raised. Not long after the
   following events occurred.

   Chapter XVIII.--Of Eudoxia's Silver Statue. On account of it John is
   exiled a Second Time.

   At this time a silver statue of the Empress Eudoxia covered with a long
   robe was erected [881] upon a column of porphyry supported by a lofty
   base. And this stood neither near nor far from the church named Sophia,
   but one-half the breadth of the street separated them. At this statue
   public games were accustomed to be performed; these John regarded as an
   insult offered to the church, and having regained his ordinary freedom
   and keenness of tongue, he employed his tongue against those who
   tolerated them. Now while it would have been proper to induce the
   authorities by a supplicatory petition to discontinue the games, he did
   not do this, but employing abusive language he ridiculed those who had
   enjoined such practices. The empress once more applied his expressions
   to herself as indicating marked contempt toward her own person: she
   therefore endeavored to procure the convocation of another council of
   bishops against him. When John became aware of this, he delivered in
   the church that celebrated oration commencing with these words: [882]
   Again Herodias raves; again she is troubled; she dances again; and
   again desires to receive John's head in a charger.' This, of course,
   exasperated the empress still more. Not long after the following
   bishops arrived: Leontius bishop of Ancyra in Asia, Ammonius of
   Laodicea in Pisidia, Briso of Philippi in Thrace, Acacius of Beroea in
   Syria, and some others. John presented himself fearlessly before them,
   and demanded an investigation of the charges which were made against
   him. But the anniversary of the birth of our Saviour having recurred,
   the emperor would not attend church as usual, but sent Chrysostom a
   message to the effect that he should not partake of the communion with
   him until he had cleared himself of the crimes with which he stood
   impeached. Now as John maintained a bold and ardent bearing, and his
   accusers seemed to grow faint-hearted, the bishops present, setting
   aside all other matters, said they would confine themselves to this
   sole consideration, that he had on his own responsibility, after his
   deposition, again seated himself in the episcopal chair, without being
   authorized by an ecclesiastical council. As he alleged that sixty-five
   bishops who had held communion with him had reinstated him, the
   partisans of Leontius objected, saying: A larger number voted against
   you, John, in the Synod.' But although John then contended that this
   was a canon of the Arians, and not of the catholic church, and
   therefore it was inoperative against him--for it had been framed in the
   council convened against Athanasius at Antioch, for the subversion of
   the doctrine of consubstantiality [883] --the bishops would not listen
   to his defence, but immediately condemned him, without considering that
   by using this canon they were sanctioning the deposition of Athanasius
   himself. This sentence was pronounced a little before Easter; the
   emperor therefore sent to tell John that he could not go to the church,
   because two Synods had condemned him. Accordingly Chrysostom was
   silenced, and went no more to the church; but those who were of his
   party celebrated Easter in the public baths which are called
   Constantianæ, and thenceforth left the church. Among them were many
   bishops and presbyters, with others of the clerical order, who from
   that time held their assemblies apart in various places, and were from
   him denominated Johannites.' For the space of two months, John
   refrained from appearing in public; after which a decree of the emperor
   sent him into exile. Thus he was led into exile by force, and on the
   very day of his departure, some of the Johannites set fire to the
   church, which by means of a strong easterly wind, communicated with the
   senate-house. This conflagration happened on the 20th of June, under
   the sixth consulate of Honorius, which he bore in conjunction with
   Aristænetus. [884] The severities which Optatus, the prefect of
   Constantinople, a pagan in religion, and a hater of the Christians,
   inflicted on John's friends, and how he put many of them to death on
   account of this act of incendiarism, I ought, I believe, to pass by in
   silence. [885]

   Chapter XIX.--Ordination of Arsacius as John's Successor. Indisposition
   of Cyrinus Bishop of Chalcedon.

   After the lapse of a few days, Arsacius was ordained bishop of
   Constantinople; he was a brother of Nectarius who so ably administered
   the see before John, although he was then very aged, being upwards of
   eighty years old. While he very mildly and peacefully administered the
   episcopate, Cyrinus bishop of Chalcedon, upon whose foot Maruthas
   bishop of Mesopotamia had inadvertently trodden, became so seriously
   affected by the accident, that mortification ensued, and it became
   necessary to amputate his foot. Nor was this amputation performed once
   only, but was required to be often repeated: for after the injured limb
   was cut off, the evil so permeated his whole system, that the other
   foot also having become affected by the disease had to submit to the
   same operation. [886] I have alluded to this circumstance, because many
   have affirmed that what he suffered was a judgment upon him for his
   calumnious aspersions of John, whom he so often designated as arrogant
   and inexorable, [887] as I have already said. [888] Furthermore as on
   the 30th of September, in the last-mentioned consulate, [889] there was
   an extraordinary fall of hail of immense size at Constantinople and its
   suburbs, it also was declared to be an expression of Divine indignation
   on account of Chrysostom's unjust deposition: and the death of the
   empress tended to give increased credibility to these reports, for it
   took place four days after the hail-storm. Others, however, asserted
   that John had been deservedly deposed, because of the violence he had
   exercised in Asia and Lydia, in depriving the Novatians and
   Quartodecimans of many of their churches, when he went to Ephesus and
   ordained Heraclides. But whether John's deposition was just, as his
   enemies declare, or Cyrinus suffered in chastisement for his slanderous
   revilings; whether the hail fell, or the empress died on John's
   account, or whether these things happened for other reasons, or for
   these in connection with others, God only knows, who is the discerner
   of secrets, and the just judge of truth itself. I have simply recorded
   the reports which were current at that time.

   Chapter XX.--Death of Arsacius, and Ordination of Atticus.

   But Arsacius did not long survive his accession to the bishopric; for
   he died on the 11th of November under the following consulate, which
   was Stilicho's second, and the first of Anthemius. [890] In consequence
   of the fact that the bishopric became desirable and many aspired to the
   vacant see, much time elapsed before the election of a successor: but
   at length in the following consulate, which was the sixth of Arcadius,
   and the first of Probus, [891] a devout man named Atticus was promoted
   to the episcopate. He was a native of Sebastia in Armenia, and had
   followed an ascetic life from an early age: moreover in addition to a
   moderate share of learning, he possessed a large amount of natural
   prudence. But I shall speak of him more particularly a little later.

   Chapter XXI.--John dies in Exile.

   John taken into exile died in Comana on the Euxine, on the 14th of
   September, in the following consulate, which was the seventh of
   Honorius, and the second of Theodosius. [893] A man, as we have before
   observed, [894] who on account of zeal for temperance was inclined
   rather to anger than forbearance: and his personal sanctity of
   character led him to indulge in a latitude of speech which to others
   was intolerable. Indeed, it is most inexplicable to me, how with a zeal
   so ardent for the practice of self-control and blamelessness of life,
   he should in his sermons appear to teach a loose view of temperance.
   For whereas by the Synod of bishops repentance was accepted but once
   from those who had sinned after baptism; he did not scruple to say,
   Approach, although you may have repented a thousand times.' [895] For
   this doctrine, many even of his friends censured him, but especially
   Sisinnius bishop of the Novatian; who wrote a book condemnatory of the
   above quoted expression of Chrysostom's, and severely rebuked him for
   it. But this occurred long before. [896]

   [895] These words are not found in any of Chrysostom's extant homilies.
   There is no reason, however, for thinking that they were not uttered by

   attitude made here are among the considerations which have led some to
   think that he was a Novatian. Cf. Introd. p. x.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXII.--Of Sisinnius Bishop of the Novatians. His Readiness at
   Repartee.

   It will not be out of place here, I conceive, to give some account of
   Sisinnius. He was, as I have often said, [897] a remarkably eloquent
   man, and well-instructed in philosophy. But he had particularly
   cultivated logic, and was profoundly skilled in the interpretation of
   the holy Scriptures; insomuch that the heretic Eunomius often shrank
   from the acumen which his reasoning displayed. As regards his diet he
   was not simple; for although he practised the strictest moderation, yet
   his table was always sumptuously furnished. He was also accustomed to
   indulge himself by wearing white garments, and bathing twice a day in
   the public baths. And when some one asked him why he, a bishop, bathed
   himself twice a day?' he replied, Because it is inconvenient to bathe
   thrice.' Going one day from courtesy to visit the bishop Arsacius, he
   was asked by one of the friends of that bishop, why he wore a garment
   so unsuitable for a bishop? and where it was written that an
   ecclesiastic should be clothed in white?' Do you tell me first,' said
   he, where it is written that a bishop should wear black?' When he that
   made the inquiry knew not what to reply to this counter-question: You
   cannot show,' rejoined Sisinnius, that a priest should be clothed in
   black. But Solomon is my authority, whose exhortation is, "Let thy
   garments be white." [898] And our Saviour in the Gospels appears
   clothed in white raiment: [899] moreover he showed Moses and Elias to
   the apostles, clad in white garments.' His prompt reply to these and
   other questions called forth the admiration of those present. Again
   when Leontius bishop of Ancyra in Galatia Minor, who had taken away a
   church from the Novatians, was on a visit to Constantinople, Sisinnius
   went to him, and begged him to restore the church. But he received him
   rudely, saying, Ye Novatians ought not to have churches; for ye take
   away repentance, and shut out Divine mercy.' As Leontius gave utterance
   to these and many other such revilings against the Novatians, Sisinnius
   replied: No one repents more heartily than I do.' And when Leontius
   asked him Why do you repent?' That I came to see you,' said he. On one
   occasion John the bishop having a contest with him, said, The city
   cannot have two bishops.' [900] Nor has it,' said Sisinnius. John being
   irritated at this response, said, You see you pretend that you alone
   are the bishop.' I do not say that,' rejoined Sisinnius; but that I am
   not bishop in your estimation only, who am such to others.' John being
   still more chafed at this reply, said, I will stop your preaching; for
   you are a heretic.' To which Sisinnius good-humoredly replied, I will
   give you a reward, if you will relieve me from so arduous a duty.' John
   being softened a little by this answer, said, I will not make you cease
   to preach, if you find speaking so troublesome.' So facetious was
   Sisinnius, and so ready at repartee: but it would be tedious to dwell
   further on his witticisms. Wherefore by means of a few specimens we
   have illustrated what sort of a person he was, deeming these as
   sufficient. I will merely add that he was celebrated for erudition, and
   on account of it all the bishops who succeeded him loved and honored
   him; and not only they but all the leading members of the senate also
   esteemed and admired him. He is the author of many works: but they are
   characterized by too great an affectation of elegance of diction, and a
   lavish intermingling of poetic expressions. On which account he was
   more admired as a speaker than as a writer; for there was dignity in
   his countenance and voice, as well as in his form and aspect, and every
   movement of his person was graceful. On account of these features he
   was loved by all the sects, and he was in especial favor with Atticus
   the bishop. But I must conclude this brief notice of Sisinnius.

   city. Thus when Constantius proposed that Liberius and Felix should sit
   as co-partners in the Roman see and govern the church in common, the
   people with one accord rejected the proposal, crying out "One God, one
   Christ, one bishop." The rule, however, did not apply to the case of
   coadjutors, where the bishop was too old or infirm to discharge his
   episcopal duties.' See Bingham, Christ. Antiq. II. 13.

   Not long after the death of John, the Emperor Arcadius died also. This
   prince was of a mild and gentle disposition, and toward the close of
   his life was esteemed to be greatly beloved of God, from the following
   circumstance. There was at Constantinople an immense mansion called
   Carya; for in the court of it there is a walnut tree on which it is
   said Acacius suffered martyrdom by hanging; on which account a chapel
   was built near it, which the Emperor Arcadius one day thought fit to
   visit, and after having prayed there, left again. All who lived near
   this chapel ran in a crowd to see the emperor; and some going out of
   the mansion referred to, endeavored to preoccupy the streets in order
   to get a better view of their sovereign and his suite, while others
   followed in his train, until all who inhabited it, including the women
   and children, had wholly gone out of it. No sooner was this vast pile
   emptied of its occupants, the buildings of which completely environed
   the church, than the entire building fell. On which there was a great
   outcry, followed by shouts of admiration, because it was believed the
   emperor's prayer had rescued so great a number of persons from
   destruction. This event occurred in that manner. On the 1st of May,
   Arcadius died, leaving his son Theodosius only eight years old, under
   the consulate of Bassus and Philip, in the second year of the 297th
   Olympiad. [901] He had reigned thirteen years with Theodosius his
   father, and fourteen years after his death, and had then attained the
   thirty-first year of his age. This book includes the space of twelve
   years and six months. [902]

   Chapter I.--Anthemius the Prætorian Prefect administers the Government
   of the East in Behalf of Young Theodosius.

   After the death of Arcadius on the first of May, during the consulate
   of Bassus and Philip, [903] his brother Honorius still governed the
   Western parts of the empire; but the administration of the East
   devolved on his son Theodosius the Younger, then only eight years old.
   The management of public affairs was therefore intrusted to Anthemius
   the Prætorian prefect, grandson of that Philip who in the reign of
   Constantius ejected Paul from the see of Constantinople, and
   established Macedonius in his place. By his directions Constantinople
   was surrounded with high walls. [904] He was esteemed and actually was
   the most prudent man of his time, and seldom did anything unadvisedly,
   but consulted with the most judicious of his friends respecting all
   practical matters, and especially with Troïlus [905] the sophist, who
   while excelling in philosophical attainments, was equal to Anthemius
   himself in political wisdom. Wherefore almost all things were done with
   the concurrence of Troïlus.

   [904] This was done, according to Cedrenus, several years later by
   another prefect. For this reason and because of the grammatical
   construction in the original, Valesius rightly conjectures that the
   phrase is a gloss introduced from the margin, and should be expunged
   from the text.

   [905] Troïlus was a sophist of distinction who taught at Constantinople
   under Arcadius and Honorius at the beginning of the fifth century a.d.,
   a native of Side and author of a treatise entitled Logoi politikoi. See

   Chapter II.--Character and Conduct of Atticus Bishop of Constantinople.

   When Theodosius the emperor was in the eighth year of his age, Atticus
   was in the third year of his presidency over the church at
   Constantinople, a man as we have by anticipation said [906]
   distinguished alike for his learning, piety, and discretion, wherefore
   it came about that the churches under his episcopate attained a very
   flourishing condition. For he not only united those of the household of
   faith,' [907] but also by his prudence called forth the admiration of
   the heretics, whom indeed he by no means desired to harass; but if he
   sometimes was obliged to impress them with the fear of himself, he soon
   afterward showed himself mild and clement toward them. But indeed he
   did not neglect his studies; for he assiduously labored in perusing the
   writings of the ancients, and often spent whole nights in the task; and
   thus he could not be confused by the reasonings of the philosophers,
   and the fallacious subtleties of the sophists. Besides this he was
   affable and entertaining in conversation, and ever ready to sympathize
   with the afflicted: and in a word, to sum up his excellences in the
   apostle's saying, He was made all things to all men.' [908] Formerly
   while a presbyter, he had been accustomed, after composing his sermons,
   to commit them to memory, and then recite them in the church: but by
   diligent application he acquired confidence and made his instruction
   extemporaneous and eloquent. His discourses however were not such as to
   be received with much applause by his auditors, nor to deserve to be
   committed to writing. Let these particulars respecting his talents,
   erudition, and manners suffice. We must now proceed to relate such
   things as are worthy of record, that happened in his time.

   Chapter III.--Of Theodosius and Agapetus Bishops of Synada.

   A certain Theodosius was bishop of Synada in Phrygia Pacata; he
   violently persecuted the heretics in that province--and there was a
   great number of them--and especially those of the Macedonian sect; he
   drove them out not only from the city, but also out of the country.
   This course he pursued not from any precedent in the orthodox church,
   nor from the desire of propagating the true faith; but being enslaved
   by the love of filthy lucre, he was impelled by the avaricious motive
   of amassing money, by extorting it from the heretics. To this end he
   made all sorts of attempts upon the Macedonians, putting arms into the
   hands of his clergy; and employing innumerable stratagems against them;
   nor did he refrain from delivering them up to the secular tribunals.
   [909] But he especially annoyed their bishop whose name was Agapetus:
   and finding the governors of the province were not invested with
   sufficient authority to punish heretics according to his wish, he went
   to Constantinople and petitioned for edicts of a more stringent nature
   from the Prætorian prefect. While Theodosius was absent on this
   business, Agapetus who, as I have said, presided over the Macedonian
   sect, came to a wise and prudent conclusion. Communicating with his
   clergy, he called all the people under his guidance together, and
   persuaded them to embrace the homoousian' faith. On their acquiescing
   in this proposition, he proceeded immediately to the church attended
   not merely by his own adherents, but by the whole body of the people.
   There having offered prayer, he took possession of the episcopal chair
   in which Theodosius was accustomed to seat himself; and preaching
   thenceforth the doctrine of consubstantiality, he reunited the people,
   and made himself master of the churches in the diocese of Synada. Soon
   after these transactions, Theodosius returned to Synada, bringing with
   him extended powers from the prefect, and knowing nothing of what had
   taken place, he proceeded to the church just as he was. Being forthwith
   unanimously expelled, he again betook himself to Constantinople; upon
   his arrival at that place he complained to Atticus, the bishop, of the
   treatment he had met with, and the manner in which he had been deprived
   of his bishopric. Atticus perceiving that this movement had resulted
   advantageously to the church, consoled Theodosius as well as he could;
   recommending him to embrace with a contented mind a retired life, and
   thus sacrifice his own private interests to the public good. He then
   wrote to Agapetus authorizing him to retain the episcopate, and bidding
   him be under no apprehension of being molested in consequence of
   Theodosius' grievance.

   Chapter IV.--A Paralytic Jew healed by Atticus in Baptism.

   This was one important improvement in the circumstances of the Church,
   which happened during the administration of Atticus. Nor were these
   times without the attestation of miracles and healings. For a certain
   Jew being a paralytic had been confined to his bed for many years; and
   as every sort of medical skill, and the prayers of his Jewish brethren
   had been resorted to but had availed nothing, he had recourse at length
   to Christian baptism, trusting in it as the only true remedy to be
   used. [910] When Atticus the bishop was informed of his wishes, he
   instructed him in the first principles of Christian truth, and having
   preached to him to hope in Christ, directed that he should be brought
   in his bed to the font. The paralytic Jew receiving baptism with a
   sincere faith, as soon as he was taken out of the baptismal font found
   himself perfectly cured of his disease, and continued to enjoy sound
   health afterwards. This miraculous power Christ vouchsafed to be
   manifested even in our times; and the fame of it caused many heathens
   to believe and be baptized. But the Jews although zealously seeking
   after signs,' [911] not even the signs which actually took place
   induced to embrace the faith. Such blessings were thus conferred by
   Christ upon men.

   Chapter V.--The Presbyter Sabbatius, formerly a Jew, separates from the
   Novatians.

   Many, however, making no account of these events yielded to their own
   depravity; for not only did the Jews continue in unbelief after this
   miracle, but others also who love to follow them were shown to hold
   views similar to theirs. Among these was Sabbatius, of whom mention has
   before been made; [912] who not being content with the dignity of
   presbyter to which he had attained, but aiming at a bishopric from the
   beginning, separated himself from the church of the Novatians, making a
   pretext of observing the Jewish Passover. [913] Holding therefore
   schismatic assemblies apart from his own bishop Sisinnius, in a place
   named Xerolophus, where the forum of Arcadius now is, he ventured on
   the performance of an act deserving the severest punishments. Reading
   one day at one of these meetings that passage in the Gospel where it is
   said, [914] Now it was the Feast of the Jews called the Passover,' he
   added what was never written nor heard of before: Cursed be he that
   celebrates the Passover out of the days of unleavened bread.' When
   these words were reported among the people, the more simple of the
   Novatian laity, deceived by this artifice, flocked to him. But his
   fraudulent fabrication was of no avail to him; for his forgery issued
   in most disastrous consequences. For shortly afterwards he kept this
   feast in anticipation of the Christian Easter; and many according to
   their custom flocked to him. While they were passing the night in the
   accustomed vigils, a panic as if caused by evil spirits fell upon them,
   as if Sisinnius their bishop were coming with a multitude of persons to
   attack them. From the perturbation that might be expected in such a
   case, and their being shut up at night in a confined place, they trod
   upon one another, insomuch that above seventy of them were crushed to
   death. On this account many deserted Sabbatius: some however, holding
   his ignorant prejudice, remained with him. In what way Sabbatius, by a
   violation of his oath, afterwards managed to get himself ordained a
   bishop, we shall relate hereafter. [915]

   Chapter VI.--The Leaders of Arianism at this Time.

   Dorotheus bishop of the Arians, who, as we have said, [916] was
   translated by that sect from Antioch to Constantinople, having attained
   the age of one hundred and nineteen years, died on the 6th of November,
   in the seventh consulate of Honorius, and the second of Theodosius
   Augustus. [917] After him Barbas presided over the Arian sect, in whose
   time the Arian faction was favored by possessing two very eloquent
   members, both having the rank of presbyter, one of whom was named
   Timothy, and the other George. Now George excelled in Grecian
   literature; Timothy, on the other hand, was proficient in the sacred
   Scriptures. George indeed constantly had the writings of Aristotle and
   Plato in his hands: Timothy found his inspiration in Origen; he also
   evinced in his public expositions of the holy Scriptures no
   inconsiderable acquaintance with the Hebrew language. Now Timothy had
   formerly identified himself with the sect of the Psathyrians; [918] but
   George had been ordained by Barbas. I have myself conversed with
   Timothy, and was exceedingly struck by the readiness with which he
   would answer the most difficult questions, and clear up the most
   obscure passages in the Divine oracles; he also invariably quoted
   Origen as an unquestionable authority in confirmation of his own
   utterances. But it is astonishing to me that these two men should
   continue to uphold the heresy of the Arians; the one being so
   conversant with Plato, and the other having Origen so frequently on his
   lips. For Plato does not say that the second and third cause, as he
   usually terms them, had a beginning of existence: [919] and Origen
   everywhere acknowledges the Son to be co-eternal [920] with the Father.
   Nevertheless although they remained connected with their own church,
   still they unconsciously changed the Arian sect for the better, and
   displaced many of the blasphemies of Arius by their own teachings. But
   enough of these persons. Sisinnius bishop of the Novatians dying under
   the same consulate, Chrysanthus was ordained in his place, of whom we
   shall have to speak by and by.

   Chapter VII.--Cyril succeeds Theophilus Bishop of Alexandria.

   Shortly afterwards Theophilus bishop of Alexandria having fallen into a
   lethargic state, died on the 15th of October, [921] in the ninth
   consulate of Honorius, and the fifth of Theodosius. A great contest
   immediately arose about the appointment of a successor, some seeking to
   place Timothy the archdeacon in the episcopal chair; and others
   desiring Cyril, who was a nephew of Theophilus. A tumult having arisen
   on this account among the people, Abundantius, the commander of the
   troops in Egypt, took sides with Timothy. [Yet the partisans of Cyril
   triumphed.] [922] Whereupon on the third day after the death of
   Theophilus, Cyril came into possession of the episcopate, with greater
   power than Theophilus had ever exercised. For from that time the
   bishopric of Alexandria went beyond the limits of its sacerdotal
   functions, and assumed the administration of secular matters. [923]
   Cyril immediately therefore shut up the churches of the Novatians at
   Alexandria, and took possession of all their consecrated vessels and
   ornaments; and then stripped their bishop Theopemptus of all that he
   had.

   Chapter VIII.--Propagation of Christianity among the Persians by
   Maruthas Bishop of Mesopotamia.

   About this same time it happened that Christianity was disseminated in
   Persia, by reason of the following causes. Frequent embassies were sent
   to and fro between the sovereigns of Persia and the Roman empire, for
   which there were continual occasions. Necessity brought it about at
   that time that the Roman emperor thought proper to send Maruthas bishop
   of Mesopotamia, who has been before mentioned, [924] on a mission to
   the king of the Persians. The king discovering great piety in the man
   treated him with great honor, and gave heed to him as one who was
   indeed beloved of God. This excited the jealousy of the magi, [925]
   whose influence is considerable over the Persian monarch, for they
   feared lest he should persuade the king to embrace Christianity. For
   Maruthas had by his prayers cured the king of a violent headache to
   which he had been long subject, and which the magi had been unable to
   relieve. The magicians therefore had recourse to this deception. As the
   Persians worship fire, and the king was accustomed to pay his
   adorations in a certain edifice to the fire which was kept perpetually
   burning, they concealed a man underneath the sacred hearth, ordering
   him to make this exclamation at the time of day when the king was
   accustomed to perform his devotion! The king should be thrust out
   because he is guilty of impiety, in imagining a Christian priest to be
   loved by the Deity.' When Isdigerdes--for that was the king's
   name--heard these words, he determined to dismiss Maruthas,
   notwithstanding the reverence with which he regarded him. But Maruthas
   being truly a God-loving man, by the earnestness of his prayers,
   detected the imposition of the magi. Going to the king therefore he
   addressed him thus: Be not deluded, O king,' said he, but when you
   again enter that edifice and hear the same voice, explore the ground
   below, and you will discover the fraud. For it is not the fire that
   speaks, but human contrivance does this.' The king received the
   suggestion of Maruthas and went as usual to the little house where the
   ever-burning fire was. When he again heard the same voice, he ordered
   the hearth to be dug up; whereupon the impostor, who uttered the
   supposed words of the Deity, was discovered. Becoming indignant at the
   deception thus attempted the king commanded that the tribe of the magi
   should be decimated. When this was effected he permitted Maruthas to
   erect churches wherever he wished; and from that time the Christian
   religion was diffused among the Persians. Then Maruthas being recalled
   went to Constantinople; not long afterwards however, he was again sent
   as ambassador to the Persian court. Again the magi devised contrivances
   so as by all possible means to prevent the king from giving him
   audience. One of their devices was to cause a most disgusting smell
   where the king was accustomed to go, and then accuse the Christians of
   being the authors of it. The king however having already had occasion
   to suspect the magi, very diligently and closely scrutinized the
   matter; and again the authors of the nuisance were detected. Wherefore
   he punished several of them, and held Maruthas in still higher honor.
   For the Romans as a nation he had much regard, and prized good feeling
   on their part very highly. Nay, he almost embraced the Christian faith
   himself, as Maruthas in conjunction with Abdas bishop of Persia gave
   another experimental proof of its power: for these two by giving
   themselves to much fasting and prayer, had cast out a demon with which
   the king's son was possessed. But the death of Isdigerdes [926]
   prevented his making an open profession of Christianity. The kingdom
   then devolved on Vararanes his son, in whose time the treaty between
   the Romans and Persians was broken as we shall have occasion to narrate
   a little later. [927]

   During this period upon the death of Flavian [928] Porphyry received

   years Siricius succeeded him; [930] and Siricius having presided there
   fifteen years, Anastasius held sway over the church for three years;
   after Anastasius Innocent [was promoted to the same see]. He was the
   first persecutor of the Novatians at Rome, and many of their churches
   he took away.

   Chapter X.--Rome taken and sacked by Alaric.

   About this same time [931] it happened that Rome was taken by the
   barbarians; for a certain Alaric, a barbarian who had been an ally of
   the Romans, and had served as an ally with the emperor Theodosius in
   the war against the usurper Eugenius, having on that account been
   honored with Roman dignities, was unable to bear his good fortune. He
   did not choose to assume imperial authority, but retiring from
   Constantinople went into the Western parts, and arriving at Illyricum
   immediately laid waste the whole country. As he marched, however, the
   Thessalians opposed him at the mouths of the river Peneus, whence there
   is a pass over Mount Pindus to Nicopolis in Epirus; and coming to an
   engagement, the Thessalians killed about three thousand of his men.
   After this the barbarians that were with him destroying everything in
   their way, at last took Rome itself, which they pillaged, burning the
   greatest number of the magnificent structures and other admirable works
   of art it contained. The money and valuable articles they plundered and
   divided among themselves. Many of the principal senators they put to
   death on a variety of pretexts. Moreover, Alaric in mockery of the
   imperial dignity, proclaimed one Attalus [932] emperor, whom he ordered
   to be attended with all the insignia of sovereignty on one day, and to
   be exhibited in the habit of a slave on the next. After these
   achievements he made a precipitate retreat, a report having reached him
   that the emperor Theodosius had sent an army to fight him. Nor was this
   report a fictitious one; for the imperial forces were actually on their
   way; but Alaric, not waiting for the materialization of the rumor,
   decamped and escaped. It is said that as he was advancing towards Rome,
   a pious monk exhorted him not to delight in the perpetuation of such
   atrocities, and no longer to rejoice in slaughter and blood. To whom
   Alaric replied, 'I am not going on in this course of my own will; but
   there is a something that irresistibly impels me daily, saying, Proceed
   to Rome, and desolate that city.' Such was the career of this person.

   Chapter XI.--The Bishops of Rome.

   After Innocent, Zosimus governed the Roman church for two years: and
   after him Boniface [933] presided over it for three years. He was
   succeeded by Celestinus. And this Celestinus took away the churches
   from the Novatians at Rome also, and obliged Rusticula their bishop to
   hold his meetings secretly in private houses. Until this time the
   Novatians had flourished exceedingly in Rome, possessing many churches
   there, which were attended by large congregations. But envy attacked
   them also, as soon as the Roman episcopate, like that of Alexandria,
   extended itself beyond the limits of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and
   degenerated into its present state of secular domination. For
   thenceforth the bishops would not suffer even those who agreed with
   them in matters of faith to enjoy the privilege of assembling in peace,
   but stripped them of all they possessed, praising them merely for these
   agreements in faith. The bishops of Constantinople kept themselves free
   from this [sort of conduct]; inasmuch as in addition to tolerating them
   and permitting them to hold their assemblies within the city, as I have
   already stated, [934] they treated them with every mark of Christian
   regard.

   Chapter XII.--Of Chrysanthus Bishop of the Novatians at Constantinople.

   After the death of Sisinnius, Chrysanthus was constrained to take upon
   him the episcopal office. He was the son of Marcian the predecessor of
   Sisinnius, and having had a military appointment in the palace at an
   early age, he was subsequently under Theodosius the Great made governor
   [935] of Italy, and after that lord-lieutenant [936] of the British
   Isles, in both which capacities he elicited for himself the highest
   admiration. Returning to Constantinople at an advanced age, earnestly
   desiring to be constituted prefect of that city, he was made bishop of
   the Novatians against his will. For as Sisinnius, when at the point of
   death, had referred to him as a most suitable person to occupy the see,
   the people regarding this declaration as law, sought to have him
   ordained forthwith. Now as Chrysanthus attempted to avoid having this
   dignity forced upon him, Sabbatius imagining that a seasonable
   opportunity was now afforded him of making himself master of the
   churches, and making no account of the oath by which he had bound
   himself, [937] procured his own ordination at the hands of a few
   insignificant bishops. [938] Among these was Hermogenes, who had been
   excommunicated with curses by [Sabbatius] himself on account of his
   blasphemous writings. But this perjured procedure of Sabbatius was of
   no avail to him: for the people disgusted with his obstreperousness,
   used every effort to discover the retreat of Chrysanthus; and having
   found him secluded in Bithynia, they brought him back by force, and
   invested him with the bishopric. He was a man of unsurpassed modesty
   and prudence; and thus he established and enlarged the churches of the
   Novatians at Constantinople. Moreover he was the first to distribute
   gold among the poor out of his own private property. Furthermore he
   would receive nothing from the churches but two loaves of the
   consecrated bread [939] every Lord's day. So anxious was he to promote
   the advantage of his own church, that he drew Ablabius, the most
   eminent orator of that time from the school of Troïlus, and ordained
   him a presbyter; whose sermons are in circulation being remarkably
   elegant and full of point. But Ablabius was afterwards promoted to the
   bishopric of the church of the Novatians at Nicæa, where he also taught
   rhetoric at the same time.

   Chapter XIII.--Conflict between the Christians and Jews at Alexandria:
   and breach between the Bishop Cyril and the Prefect Orestes.

   About this same time it happened that the Jewish inhabitants were
   driven out of Alexandria by Cyril the bishop on the following account.
   The Alexandrian public is more delighted with tumult than any other
   people: and if at any time it should find a pretext, breaks forth into
   the most intolerable excesses; for it never ceases from its turbulence
   without bloodshed. It happened on the present occasion that a
   disturbance arose among the populace, not from a cause of any serious
   importance, but out of an evil that has become very popular in almost
   all cities, viz. a fondness for dancing exhibitions. [940] In
   consequence of the Jews being disengaged from business on the Sabbath,
   and spending their time, not in hearing the Law, but in theatrical
   amusements, dancers usually collect great crowds on that day, and
   disorder is almost invariably produced. And although this was in some
   degree controlled by the governor of Alexandria, nevertheless the Jews
   continued opposing these measures. And although they are always hostile
   toward the Christians they were roused to still greater opposition
   against them on account of the dancers. When therefore Orestes the
   prefect was publishing an edict--for so they are accustomed to call
   public notices--in the theatre for the regulation of the shows, some of
   the bishop Cyril's party were present to learn the nature of the orders
   about to be issued. There was among them a certain Hierax, a teacher of
   the rudimental branches of literature, and one who was a very
   enthusiastic listener of the bishop Cyril's sermons, and made himself
   conspicuous by his forwardness in applauding. When the Jews observed
   this person in the theatre, they immediately cried out that he had come
   there for no other purpose than to excite sedition among the people.
   Now Orestes had long regarded with jealousy the growing power of the
   bishops, because they encroached on the jurisdiction of the authorities
   appointed by the emperor, especially as Cyril wished to set spies over
   his proceedings; he therefore ordered Hierax to be seized, and publicly
   subjected him to the torture in the theatre. Cyril, on being informed
   of this, sent for the principal Jews, and threatened them with the
   utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the
   Christians. The Jewish populace on hearing these menaces, instead of
   suppressing their violence, only became more furious, and were led to
   form conspiracies for the destruction of the Christians; one of these
   was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from
   Alexandria; this I shall now describe. Having agreed that each one of
   them should wear a ring on his finger made of the bark of a palm
   branch, for the sake of mutual recognition, they determined to make a
   nightly attack on the Christians. They therefore sent persons into the
   streets to raise an outcry that the church named after Alexander was on
   fire. Thus many Christians on hearing this ran out, some from one
   direction and some from another, in great anxiety to save their church.
   The Jews immediately fell upon and slew them; readily distinguishing
   each other by their rings. At daybreak the authors of this atrocity
   could not be concealed: and Cyril, accompanied by an immense crowd of
   people, going to their synagogues--for so they call their house of
   prayer--took them away from them, and drove the Jews out of the city,
   permitting the multitude to plunder their goods. Thus the Jews who had
   inhabited the city from the time of Alexander the Macedonian were
   expelled from it, stripped of all they possessed, and dispersed some in
   one direction and some in another. One of them, a physician [941] named
   Adamantius, fled to Atticus bishop of Constantinople, and professing
   Christianity, some time afterwards returned to Alexandria and fixed his
   residence there. But Orestes the governor of Alexandria was filled with
   great indignation at these transactions, and was excessively grieved
   that a city of such magnitude should have been suddenly bereft of so
   large a portion of its population; he therefore at once communicated
   the whole affair to the emperor. Cyril also wrote to him, describing
   the outrageous conduct of the Jews; and in the meanwhile sent persons
   to Orestes who should mediate concerning a reconciliation: for this the
   people had urged him to do. And when Orestes refused to listen to
   friendly advances, Cyril extended toward him the book of gospels, [942]
   believing that respect for religion would induce him to lay aside his
   resentment. When, however, even this had no pacific effect on the
   prefect, but he persisted in implacable hostility against the bishop,
   the following event afterwards occurred.

   Chapter XIV.--The Monks of Nitria come down and raise a Sedition
   against the Prefect of Alexandria.

   Some of the monks inhabiting the mountains of Nitria, of a very fiery
   disposition, whom Theophilus some time before had unjustly armed
   against Dioscorus and his brethren, being again transported with an
   ardent zeal, resolved to fight in behalf of Cyril. About five hundred
   of them therefore quitting their monasteries, came into the city; and
   meeting the prefect in his chariot, they called him a pagan idolater,
   and applied to him many other abusive epithets. He supposing this to be
   a snare laid for him by Cyril, exclaimed that he was a Christian, and
   had been baptized by Atticus the bishop at Constantinople. As they gave
   but little heed to his protestations, and a certain one of them named
   Ammonius threw a stone at Orestes which struck him on the head and
   covered him with the blood that flowed from the wound, all the guards
   with a few exceptions fled, plunging into the crowd, some in one
   direction and some in another, fearing to be stoned to death. Meanwhile
   the populace of Alexandria ran to the rescue of the governor, and put
   the rest of the monks to flight; but having secured Ammonius they
   delivered him up to the prefect. He immediately put him publicly to the
   torture, which was inflicted with such severity that he died under the
   effects of it: and not long after he gave an account to the emperors of
   what had taken place. Cyril also on the other hand forwarded his
   statement of the matter to the emperor: and causing the body of
   Ammonius to be deposited in a certain church, he gave him the new
   appellation of Thaumasius, [943] ordering him to be enrolled among the
   martyrs, and eulogizing his magnanimity in church as that of one who
   had fallen in a conflict in defence of piety. But the more
   sober-minded, although Christians, did not accept Cyril's prejudiced
   estimate of him; for they well knew that he had suffered the punishment
   due to his rashness, and that he had not lost his life under the
   torture because he would not deny Christ. And Cyril himself being
   conscious of this, suffered the recollection of the circumstance to be
   gradually obliterated by silence. But the animosity between Cyril and
   Orestes did not by any means subside at this point, but was kindled
   [944] afresh by an occurrence similar to the preceding.

   [944] The original here has apesbese, quenched,' extinguished,' but the

   Chapter XV.--Of Hypatia the Female Philosopher.

   There was a woman at Alexandria named Hypatia, [945] daughter of the
   philosopher Theon, who made such attainments in literature and science,
   as to far surpass all the philosophers of her own time. Having
   succeeded to the school of Plato and Plotinus, she explained the
   principles of philosophy to her auditors, many of whom came from a
   distance to receive her instructions. On account of the self-possession
   and ease of manner, which she had acquired in consequence of the
   cultivation of her mind, she not unfrequently appeared in public in
   presence of the magistrates. Neither did she feel abashed in coming to
   an assembly of men. For all men on account of her extraordinary dignity
   and virtue admired her the more. Yet even she fell a victim to the
   political jealousy which at that time prevailed. For as she had
   frequent interviews with Orestes, it was calumniously reported among
   the Christian populace, that it was she who prevented Orestes from
   being reconciled to the bishop. Some of them therefore, hurried away by
   a fierce and bigoted zeal, whose ringleader was a reader named Peter,
   waylaid her returning home, and dragging her from her carriage, they
   took her to the church called Cæsareum, where they completely stripped
   her, and then murdered her with tiles. [946] After tearing her body in
   pieces, they took her mangled limbs to a place called Cinaron, and
   there burnt them. This affair brought not the least opprobrium, not
   only upon Cyril, [947] but also upon the whole Alexandrian church. And
   surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the
   allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort. This
   happened in the month of March during Lent, in the fourth year of
   Cyril's episcopate, under the tenth consulate of Honorius, and the
   sixth of Theodosius. [948]

   [945] The following incident has been popularized by Charles Kingsley
   in his well-known novel of Hypatia, which has, however, the accessory
   aim of antagonizing the over-estimation of early Christianity by Dr.

   Hypatia, besides the present chapter, are the letters of her pupil
   Synesius, and Philostorgius, VIII. 9. Cf. also Wernsdoff, de Hypatia,

   [947] The responsibility of Cyril in this affair has been variously
   estimated by different historians. Walch, Gibbon, and Milman incline to
   hold him guilty. J. C. Robertson ascribes him indirect responsibility,
   asserting that the perpetrators of the crime were mostly officers of
   his church, and had unquestionably drawn encouragement from his earlier
   proceedings.' Hist. of the Christ. Ch. Vol. I. p. 401. W. Bright says,
   Cyril was no party to this hideous deed, but it was the work of men
   whose passions he had originally called out. Had there been no
   onslaught on the synagogues, there would doubtless have been no murder
   of Hypatia.' Hist. of the Church from 313 to 451, pp. 274, 275. See

   Chapter XVI.--The Jews commit Another Outrage upon the Christians and
   are punished.

   Soon afterwards the Jews renewed their malevolent and impious practices
   against the Christians, and drew down upon themselves deserved
   punishment. At a place named Inmestar, situated between Chalcis and
   Antioch in Syria, the Jews were amusing themselves in their usual way
   with a variety of sports. In this way they indulged in many
   absurdities, and at length impelled by drunkenness they were guilty of
   scoffing at Christians and even Christ himself; and in derision of the
   cross and those who put their trust in the Crucified One, they seized a
   Christian boy, and having bound him to a cross, began to laugh and
   sneer at him. But in a little while becoming so transported with fury,
   they scourged the child until he died under their hands. This conduct
   occasioned a sharp conflict between them and the Christians; and as
   soon as the emperors were informed of the circumstance, they issued
   orders to the governor of the province to find out and punish the
   delinquents. And thus the Jewish inhabitants of this place paid the
   penalty for the wickedness they had committed in their impious sport.

   Chapter XVII.--Miracle performed by Paul Bishop of the Novatians at the
   Baptism of a Jewish Impostor.

   About this time Chrysanthus bishop of the Novatians, after presiding
   over the churches of his own sect seven years, died on the 26th of
   August, under the consulate of Monaxius and Plintha. [949] He was
   succeeded in the bishopric by Paul, who had formerly been a teacher of
   the Latin language: but afterwards, setting aside the Latin language,
   had devoted himself to an ascetic course of life; and having founded a
   monastery of religious men, he adopted a mode of living not very
   different from that pursued by the monks in the desert. In fact I
   myself found him just such a person as Evagrius [950] says the monks
   dwelling in the deserts ought to be; imitating them in continued
   fastings, silence, abstinence from animal food, and for the most part
   abstaining also from the use of oil and wine. He was, moreover,
   solicitous about the wants of the poor to as great an extent as any
   other man; he untiringly visited those who were in prison, and in
   behalf of many criminals interceded with the judges, who readily
   attended to him on account of his eminent piety. But why should I
   lengthen my account of him? For I am about to mention a deed done by
   him which is well worthy of being recorded in writing. A certain Jewish
   impostor, pretending to be a convert to Christianity, was in the habit
   of being baptized often [951] and by that artifice he amassed a good
   deal of money. After having deceived many of the Christian sects by
   this fraud--for he received baptism from the Arians and Macedonians--as
   there remained no others to practise his hypocrisy upon, he at length
   came to Paul bishop of the Novatians, and declaring that he earnestly
   desired baptism, requested that he might obtain it at his hand. Paul
   commended the determination of the Jew, but told him he could not
   perform that rite for him, until he had been instructed in the
   fundamental principles of the faith, and given himself to fasting and
   prayer for many days. [952] The Jew compelled to fast against his will
   became the more importunate in his request for baptism; now as Paul did
   not wish to discourage him by longer delays, since he was so urgent,
   consented to grant his request, and made all the necessary preparations
   for the baptism. Having purchased a white vestment for him, he ordered
   the font to be filled with water, and then led the Jew to it in order
   to baptize him. But a certain invisible power of God caused the water
   suddenly to disappear. The bishop, of course, and those present, had
   not the least suspicion of the real cause, but imagined that the water
   had escaped by the channels underneath, by means of which they are
   accustomed to empty the font; these passages were therefore very
   carefully closed, and the font filled again. Again, however, as the Jew
   was taken there a second time, the water vanished as before. Then Paul
   addressing the Jew, said, Either you are an evil-doer, wretched man, or
   an ignorant person who has already been baptized.' The people having
   crowded together to witness this miracle, one among them recognized the
   Jew, and identified him as having been baptized by Atticus, the bishop,
   a little while before. Such was the portent wrought by the hands of
   Paul bishop of the Novatians.

   Chapter XVIII.--Renewal of Hostilities between the Romans and Persians
   after the Death of Isdigerdes King of the Persians.

   Isdigerdes king of the Persians, who had in no way molested the
   Christians in his dominions, having died, [953] his son Vararanes by
   name succeeded him in the kingdom. This prince yielding to the
   influence of the magi, persecuted the Christians there with rigor, by
   inflicting on them a variety of Persian punishments and tortures. They
   were therefore on account of the oppression obliged to desert their
   country and seek refuge among the Romans, entreating them not to suffer
   them to be completely extirpated. Atticus the bishop received these
   suppliants with great benignity, and did his utmost to help them in
   whatsoever way it was possible: accordingly he made the emperor
   Theodosius acquainted with the facts. It happened at the same time that
   another grievance of the Romans against Persians came to light. The
   Persians, that is to say, would not send back the laborers in the gold
   mines who had been hired from among the Romans; and they also plundered
   the Roman merchants. The bad feeling which these things produced was
   greatly increased by the flight of the Persian Christians into the
   Roman territories. For the Persian king immediately sent an embassy to
   demand the fugitives. But the Romans were by no means disposed to
   deliver them up; not only as desirous of defending their suppliants,
   but also because they were ready to do anything for the sake of the
   Christian religion. For which reason they chose rather to renew the war
   with the Persians, than to suffer the Christians to be miserably
   destroyed. The league was accordingly broken, and a fierce war
   followed. [954] Of which war I deem it not unseasonable to give some
   brief account. The Roman emperor first sent a body of troops under the
   command of the general Ardaburius; [955] who making an irruption
   through Armenia into Persia, ravaged one of its provinces called
   Azazene. Narsæus the Persian general marched against him with the
   Persian army; but on coming to an engagement he was defeated, and
   obliged to retreat. Afterwards he judged it advantageous to make an
   unexpected irruption through Mesopotamia into the Roman territories
   there unguarded, thinking by this means to be revenged on the enemy.
   But this design of Narsæus did not escape the observation of the Roman
   general. Having therefore plundered Azazene, he then himself also
   hastily marched into Mesopotamia. Wherefore Narsæus, although furnished
   with a large army, was prevented from invading the Roman provinces; but
   arriving at Nisibis--a city in the possession of the Persians situated
   on the frontiers of both empires--he sent Ardaburius desiring that they
   might make mutual arrangements about carrying on the war, and appoint a
   time and place for an engagement. But he said to the messengers, Tell
   Narsæus that the Roman emperors will not fight when it pleases him.'
   The emperor perceiving that the Persian was mustering his whole force,
   made additional levies to his army, and put his whole trust in God for
   the victory: and that the king was not without immediate benefit from
   this pious confidence the following circumstance proves. As the
   Constantinopolitans were in great consternation, and apprehensive
   respecting the issue of the war, angels from God appeared to some
   persons in Bithynia who were travelling to Constantinople on their own
   affairs, and bade them tell the people not to be alarmed, but pray to
   God and be assured that the Romans would be conquerors. For they said
   that they themselves were appointed by God to defend them. When this
   message was circulated it not only comforted the residents of the city,
   but rendered the soldiers more courageous. The seat of war being
   transferred, as we have said, from Armenia to Mesopotamia, the Romans
   shut up the Persians in the city of Nisibis, which they besieged; and
   having constructed wooden towers which they advanced by means of
   machines to the walls, they slew great numbers of those who defended
   them, as well as of those who ran to their assistance. When Vararanes
   the Persian monarch learned that his province of Azazene on the one
   hand had been desolated, and that on the other his army was closely
   besieged in the city of Nisibis, he resolved to march in person with
   all his forces against the Romans: but dreading the Roman valor, he
   implored the aid of the Saracens, who were then governed by a warlike
   chief named Alamundarus. This prince accordingly brought with him a
   large reinforcement of Saracen auxiliaries, exhorted the king of the
   Persians to fear nothing, for that he would soon reduce the Romans
   under his power, and deliver Antioch in Syria into his hands. But the
   event did not realize these promises; for God infused into the minds of
   the Saracens a terrible panic; and imagining that the Roman army was
   falling upon them, and finding no other way of escape, they
   precipitated themselves, armed as they were, into the river Euphrates,
   wherein nearly one hundred thousand of them were drowned. Such was the
   nature of the panic.

   The Romans besieging Nisibis, understanding that the king of Persia was
   bringing with him a great number of elephants, became alarmed in their
   turn, burnt all the machines they had used in carrying on the siege,
   and retired into their own country. What engagements afterwards took
   place, and how Areobindus another Roman general killed the bravest of
   the Persians in single combat, and by what means Ardaburius destroyed
   seven Persian commanders in an ambuscade, and in what manner Vitian
   another Roman general vanquished the remnant of the Saracen forces, I
   believe I ought to pass by, lest I should digress too far from my
   subject.

   Chapter XIX.--Of Palladius the Courier.

   How the Emperor Theodosius received intelligence of what was done in an
   incredibly short space of time, and how he was quickly informed of
   events taking place far away, I shall attempt to explain. For he had
   the good fortune to possess among his subjects a man endowed with
   extraordinary energy both of body and mind, named Palladius; who rode
   so vigorously that he would reach the frontiers of the Roman and
   Persian dominions in three days, [956] and again return to
   Constantinople in as many more. The same individual traversed other
   parts of the world on missions from the emperor with equal celerity: so
   that an eloquent man once said not unaptly, This man by his speed
   proves the vast expanse of the Roman Empire to be little.' The king of
   the Persians himself was astonished at the expeditious feats which were
   related to him of this courier: but we must be content with the above
   details concerning him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [956] Much, of course, depends, in estimating the rate of speed here
   recorded, on the exact distance between Constantinople and the rather
   indefinite limits of the Persian empire. But even if the minimum of 500
   miles be taken as a basis, the speed seems almost incredible.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XX.--A Second Overthrow of the Persians by the Romans.

   Now the emperor of the Romans dwelling in Constantinople being fully
   aware that God had plainly given him the victory was so benevolent that
   although those under him had been successful in war nevertheless he
   desired to make peace; and to that end he dispatched Helion, a man in
   whom he placed the greatest confidence, with a commission to enter into
   a pacific treaty with the Persians. Helion having arrived in
   Mesopotamia, at the place where the Romans for their own security had
   formed a trench, sent before him as his deputy Maximin an eloquent man
   who was the associate of Ardaburius the commander-in-chief of the army,
   to make preliminary arrangements concerning the terms of peace. Maximin
   on coming into the presence of the Persian king, said he had been sent
   to him on this matter, not by the Roman emperor, but by his generals;
   for he said this war was not even known to the emperor, and if known
   would be considered insignificant by him. And as the sovereign of
   Persia had gladly decided to receive the embassy,--for his troops were
   suffering from want of provisions,--there came to him that corps among
   them which is distinguished by the name of the Immortals.' [957] This
   is a body of brave men numbering about ten thousand--and counselled the
   king not to listen to any overtures for peace, until they should have
   made an attack upon the Romans, who, they said, were now become
   extremely incautious. The king approving their advice, ordered the
   ambassador to be imprisoned and a guard set over him, and permitted the
   Immortals to put their design upon the Romans into execution. They
   therefore, on arriving at the place appointed, divided themselves into
   two bands, with a view to surround some portion of the Roman army. The
   Romans observing but one body of Persians approaching them, prepared
   themselves to receive it, not having seen the other division, in
   consequence of their suddenly rushing forth to battle. But just as the
   engagement was about to commence, Divine Providence so ordered it, that
   another division of the Roman army under Procopius a general emerged
   from behind a certain hill and perceiving their comrades in danger,
   attacked the Persians in the rear. Thus were they, who but a little
   before had surrounded the Romans, themselves encompassed. Having
   utterly destroyed these in a short time, the Romans turned upon those
   who broke forth from their ambuscade and in like manner slew every one
   of them with darts. In this way those who by the Persians were termed
   the Immortals' were all of them shown to be mortal, Christ having
   executed this vengeance upon the Persians because they had shed the
   blood of so many of his pious worshippers. The king of the Persians on
   being informed of the disaster, pretended to be ignorant of what had
   taken place, and ordered the embassy to be admitted, he thus addressing
   the ambassador: I agree to the peace, not as yielding to the Romans,
   but to gratify you, whom I have found to be the most prudent of all the
   Romans.' Thus was that war concluded which had been undertaken on
   account of the suffering Christians in Persia, under the consulate of
   the two Augusti, [958] being the thirteenth of Honorius, and the tenth
   of Theodosius, in the fourth year of the 300th Olympiad: and with it
   terminated the persecution which had been excited in Persia against the
   Christians.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [957] A Persian body-guard called 'Athanatoi, Immortals,' existed
   during the period of the invasion of Greece by the Persians (cf.
   Herodotus, VII. 31). The organization and discipline of the later body
   must have been, of course, very different.

   Chapter XXI.--Kind Treatment of the Persian Captives by Acacius Bishop
   of Amida.

   A noble action of Acacius bishop of Amida, at that time greatly
   enhanced his reputation among all men. As the Roman soldiery would on
   no consideration restore to the Persian king the captives whom they had
   taken, these captives, about seven thousand in number, were being
   destroyed by famine in devastating Azazene, and this greatly distressed
   the king of the Persians. Then Acacius thought such a matter was by no
   means to be trifled with; having therefore assembled his clergy, he
   thus addressed them: Our God, my brethren, needs neither dishes nor
   cups; for he neither eats nor drinks, nor is in want of anything. Since
   then, by the liberality of its faithful members the church possesses
   many vessels both of gold and silver, it behooves us to sell them, that
   by the money thus raised we may be able to redeem the prisoners and
   also supply them with food.' Having said these things and many others
   similar to these, he ordered the vessels to be melted down, and from
   the proceeds paid the soldiers a ransom for their captives, whom he
   supported for some time; and then furnishing them with what was needful
   for their journey, sent them back to their sovereign. This benevolence
   on the part of the excellent Acacius, astonished the king of the
   Persians, as if the Romans were accustomed to conquer their enemies as
   well by their beneficence in peace as their prowess in war. They say
   also that the Persian king wished that Acacius should come into his
   presence, that he might have the pleasure of beholding such a man; a
   wish which by the emperor Theodosius' order was soon gratified. So
   signal a victory having through Divine favor been achieved by the
   Romans, many who were illustrious for their eloquence, wrote panegyrics
   in honor of the emperor, and recited them in public. The empress
   herself also composed a poem in heroic verse: for she had excellent
   literary taste; being the daughter of Leontius the Athenian sophist,
   she had been instructed in every kind of learning by her father;
   Atticus the bishop had baptized her a little while previous to her
   marriage with the emperor, and had then given her the Christian name of
   Eudocia, [959] instead of her pagan one of Athenaïs. [960] Many, as I
   have said, produced eulogiums on this occasion. Some, indeed, were
   stimulated by the desire of being noticed by the emperor; while others
   were anxious to display their talents to the masses, being unwilling
   that the attainments they had made by dint of great exertion should lie
   buried in obscurity.

   [959] Eudokia, Benevolence.'

   [960] The Chronicon Paschale gives a different account of Eudocia. It
   says that her father's name was Heraclitus. When he died her brothers
   Gesius and Valerian refused to give her her share of the inheritance.
   She came to Constantinople to plead for her rights through Pulcheria,
   the sister of Theodosius, and impressed the latter so favorably that
   Pulcheria persuaded Theodosius to make her his wife (cf. Chronic.
   Pasch. year 420). Her brothers on hearing of her elevation to the
   throne fled to Greece, but she sent for them and persuaded Theodosius
   to appoint them to high offices, on the ground that she was indebted to
   them for her good fortune (cf. Chronic. Pasch. year 421). Besides her
   ode commemorating the victory of the imperial forces over the Persians,
   several other works of hers are mentioned, viz. paraphrases of the
   Pentateuch, Joshua, and Judges into Greek hexameters, a version of the
   prophecies of Zachariah and Daniel, and a poem in three books on St.
   Cyprian and St. Justina; to these Zonaras adds that she completed the
   Centones Homerici of Patricius. Her later years were clouded by a
   misunderstanding between her husband and herself, which is variously
   given by the contemporaneous historians and altogether passed over by
   Socrates. Cf. Evagrius, H. E. I. 20, 22, and Zonaras Ann. XIII.

   Chapter XXII.--Virtues of the Emperor Theodosius the Younger.

   But although I am neither eager for the notice of the emperor, nor wish
   to make an exhibition of my oratorical powers, yet have I felt it my
   duty to record plainly the singular virtues with which the emperor is
   endowed: for I am persuaded that silence concerning them, as they are
   so excellent, would be injustice to those who should come after us. In
   the first place then, this prince though born and nurtured to empire,
   was neither stultified nor effeminated by the circumstances of his
   birth and education. He evinced so much prudence, that he appeared to
   those who conversed with him to have acquired wisdom from experience.
   Such was his fortitude in undergoing hardships, that he would
   courageously endure both heat and cold; fasting very frequently,
   especially on Wednesdays and Fridays; [961] and this he did from an
   earnest endeavor to observe with accuracy all the prescribed forms of
   the Christian religion. He rendered his palace little different from a
   monastery: for he, together with his sisters, rose early in the
   morning, and recited responsive hymns in praise of the Deity. By this
   training he learnt the holy Scriptures by heart; and he would often
   discourse with the bishops on scriptural subjects, as if he had been an
   ordained priest of long standing. He was a more indefatigable collector
   of the sacred books and of the expositions which had been written on
   them, than even Ptolemy Philadelphus [962] had formerly been. In
   clemency and humanity he far surpassed all others. For the emperor
   Julian although he professed to be a philosopher, could not moderate
   his rage against the Antiochians who derided him, but inflicted upon
   Theodore the most agonizing tortures. [963] Theodosius on the contrary,
   bidding farewell to Aristotle's syllogisms, exercised philosophy in
   deeds, by getting the mastery over anger, grief, and pleasure. Never
   has he revenged himself on any one by whom he has been injured; nor has
   any one ever even seen him irritated. And when some of his most
   intimate friends once asked him, why he never inflicted capital
   punishment upon offenders, his answer was, Would that it were even
   possible to restore to life those that have died.' To another making a
   similar inquiry he replied, It is neither a great nor a difficult thing
   for a mortal to be put to death but it is God only that can resuscitate
   by repentance a person that has once died.' So habitually indeed did he
   practice mercy, that if any one were guilty and sentence of death was
   passed upon him, and he was conducted toward the place of execution, he
   was never suffered to reach the gates of the city before a pardon was
   issued, commanding his immediate return. Having once exhibited a show
   of hunting wild beasts in the Amphitheatre at Constantinople, the
   people cried out, Let one of the boldest bestiarii [964] encounter the
   enraged animal.' But he said to them, Do ye not know that we are wont
   to view these spectacles with feelings of humanity?' By this expression
   he instructed the people to be satisfied in future with shows of a less
   cruel description. His piety was such that he had a reverential regard
   for all who were consecrated to the service of God; and honored in an
   especial manner those whom he ascertained to be eminent for their
   sanctity of life. It is said that the bishop of Chebron [965] having
   died at Constantinople, the emperor expressed a wish to have his
   cassock of sackcloth of hair; which, although it was excessively
   filthy, he wore as a cloak, hoping that thus he should become a
   partaker in some degree of the sanctity of the deceased. In a certain
   year, during which the weather had been very tempestuous, he was
   obliged by the eagerness of the people to exhibit the usual sports in
   the Hippodrome; and when the circus was filled with spectators, the
   violence of the storm increased, and there was a heavy fall of snow.
   Then the emperor made it very evident how his mind was affected towards
   God; for he caused the herald to make a proclamation to the people to
   this effect: It is far better and fitter to desist from the show, and
   unite in common prayer to God, that we may be preserved unhurt from the
   impending storm.' Scarcely had the herald executed his commission, when
   all the people, with the greatest joy, began with one accord to offer
   supplication and sing praises to God, so that the whole city became one
   vast congregation; and the emperor himself in official garments, went
   into the midst of the multitude and commenced the hymns. Nor was he
   disappointed in his expectation, for the atmosphere began to resume its
   wonted serenity: and Divine benevolence bestowed on all an abundant
   harvest, instead of an expected deficiency of corn. If at any time war
   was raised, like David he had recourse to God, knowing that he is the
   arbiter of battles, and by prayer brought them to a prosperous issue.
   At this point therefore, I shall relate, how a little after the war
   against the Persians, by placing his confidence in God he vanquished
   the usurper John, after Honorius had died on the 15th of August, in the
   consulate of Asclepiodotus and Marian. [966] For I judge what then
   occurred worthy of mention, inasmuch as there happened to the emperor's
   generals who were dispatched against the tyrant, something analogous to
   what took place when the Israelites crossed the Red Sea under the
   guidance of Moses. These things however, I shall set forth very
   briefly, leaving to others the numerous details which would require a
   special treatise.

   Chapter XXIII.--After the Death of the Emperor Honorius John usurps the
   Sovereignty at Rome. He is destroyed through the Prayers of Theodosius
   the Younger.

   When the Emperor Honorius died Theodosius--now sole ruler--having
   received the news concealed the truth as long as possible, misleading
   the people sometimes with one report, and then with another. But he
   privately dispatched a military force to Salonæ, a city of Dalmatia,
   that in the event of any revolutionary movement in the West there might
   be resources at hand to check it; and after making these provisional
   arrangements, he at length openly announced his uncle's death. In the
   meantime John, the superintendent of the emperor's secretaries, [967]
   not content with the dignity to which he had already attained, seized
   upon the sovereign authority; and sent an embassy to the emperor
   Theodosius, requesting that he might be recognized as his colleague in
   the empire. But that prince first caused the ambassadors to be
   arrested, then sent off Ardaburius, the commander-in-chief of the army,
   who had greatly distinguished himself in the Persian war. [968] He, on
   arriving at Salonæ, set sail from thence for Aquileia. And he was
   fortunate as was thought, but fortune was adverse to him as it
   afterwards appeared. For a contrary wind having arisen, he was driven
   into the usurper's hand. The latter having seized him became more
   sanguine in his hope that the emperor would be induced by the urgency
   of the case to elect and proclaim him emperor, in order to preserve the
   life of his general-in-chief. And the emperor was in fact greatly
   distressed when he heard of it, as was also the army which had been
   sent against the usurper, lest Ardaburius should be subjected to evil
   treatment by the usurper. Aspar the son of Ardaburius, having learnt
   that his father was in the usurper's power, and aware at the same time
   that the party of the rebels was strengthened by the accession of
   immense numbers of barbarians, knew not what course to pursue. Then
   again at this crisis the prayer of the pious emperor prevailed. For an
   angel of God, under the appearance of a shepherd, undertook the
   guidance of Aspar and the troops which were with him, and led him
   through the lake near Ravenna--for in that city the usurper was then
   residing--and there detained the military chief. Now, no one had ever
   been known to have forded that lake before; but God then rendered that
   passable, which had hitherto been impassable. Having therefore crossed
   the lake, as if going over dry ground, they found the gates of the city
   open, and overpowered the usurper. This event afforded that most devout
   emperor an opportunity of giving a fresh demonstration of his piety
   towards God. For the news of the usurper's being destroyed, having
   arrived while he was engaged at the exhibition of the sports of the
   Hippodrome, he immediately said to the people: Come now, if you please,
   let us leave these diversions, and proceed to the church to offer
   thanksgivings to God, whose hand has overthrown the usurper.' Thus did
   he address them; and the spectacles were immediately forsaken and
   neglected, the people all passing out of the circus singing praises
   together with him, as with one heart and one voice. And arriving at the
   church, the whole city again became one congregation; and once in the
   church they passed the remainder of the day in these devotional
   exercises.

   Chapter XXIV.--Valentinian a Son of Constantius and Placidia, Aunt of
   Theodosius, is proclaimed Emperor.

   After the usurper's death, the emperor Theodosius became very anxious
   as to whom he should proclaim emperor of the West. He had a cousin then
   very young named Valentinian; the son of his aunt Placidia, daughter of
   Theodosius the Great, and sister of the two Augusti Arcadius and
   Honorius and of that Constantius who had been proclaimed emperor by
   Honorius, [969] and had died after a short reign with him. This cousin
   he created Cæsar, and sent into the Western parts, committing the
   administration of affairs to his mother Placidia. He himself also
   hastened towards Italy, that he might in person both proclaim his
   cousin emperor, and also being present among them, endeavor to
   influence the natives and residents by his counsels not to submit to
   usurpers readily. But when he reached Thessalonica he was prevented
   from proceeding further by sickness; he therefore sent forward the
   imperial crown to his cousin by Helion the patrician, and he himself
   returned to Constantinople. But concerning these matters I deem the
   narrative here given sufficient.

   Chapter XXV.--Christian Benevolence of Atticus Bishop of
   Constantinople. He registers John's Name in the Diptychs. His
   Fore-knowledge of his Own Death.

   Meanwhile Atticus the bishop caused the affairs of the church to
   flourish in an extraordinary manner; administering all things with
   prudence, and inciting the people to virtue by his instruction.
   Perceiving that the church was on the point of being divided inasmuch
   as the Johannites [970] assembled themselves apart, he ordered that
   mention of John should be made in the prayers, as was customary to be
   done of the other deceased [971] bishops; by which means he trusted
   that many would be induced to return to the Church. And he was so
   liberal that he not only provided for the poor of his own parishes, but
   transmitted contributions to supply the wants and promote the comfort
   of the indigent in the neighboring cities also. On one occasion as he
   sent to Calliopius a presbyter of the church at Nicæa, three hundred
   pieces [972] of gold he also dispatched the following letter.

   Atticus to Calliopius--salutations in the Lord.

   I have been informed that there are in your city ten thousand
   necessitous persons whose condition demands the compassion of the
   pious. And I say ten thousand, designating their multitude rather than
   using the number precisely. As therefore I have received a sum of money
   from him, who with a bountiful hand is wont to supply faithful
   stewards; and since it happens that some are pressed by want, that
   those who have may be proved, who yet do not minister to the
   needy--take, my friend, these three hundred pieces of gold, and dispose
   of them as you may think fit. It will be your care, I doubt not, to
   distribute to such as are ashamed to beg, and not to those who through
   life have sought to feed themselves at others' expense. In bestowing
   these alms make no distinction on religious grounds; but feed the
   hungry whether they agree with us in sentiment, or not.'

   Thus did Atticus consider even the poor who were at a distance from
   him. He labored also to abolish the superstitions of certain persons.
   For on being informed that those who had separated themselves from the
   Novatians, on account of the Jewish Passover, had transported the body
   of Sabbatius [973] from the island of Rhodes--for in that island he had
   died in exile--and having buried it, were accustomed to pray at his
   grave, he caused the body to be disinterred at night, and deposited in
   a private sepulchre; and those who had formerly paid their adorations
   at that place, on finding his tomb had been opened, ceased honoring
   that tomb thenceforth. Moreover he manifested a great deal of taste in
   the application of names to places. To a port in the mouth of the
   Euxine sea, anciently called Pharmaceus, [974] he gave the appellation
   of Therapeia; [975] because he would not have a place where religious
   assemblies were held, dishonored by an inauspicious name. Another
   place, a suburb of Constantinople, he termed Argyropolis, [976] for
   this reason. Chrysopolis [977] is an ancient port situated at the head
   of the Bosphorus, and is mentioned by several of the early writers,
   especially Strabo, Nicolaus Damascenus, and the illustrious Xenophon in
   the sixth book of his Anabasis of Cyrus; [978] and again in the first
   of his Hellenica [979] he says concerning it, that Alcibiades having
   walled it round, established a toll in it; for all who sailed out of
   Pontus were accustomed to pay tithes there.' Atticus seeing the former
   place to be directly opposite to Chrysopolis, and very delightfully
   situated, declared that it was most fitting it should be called
   Argyropolis; and as soon as this was said it firmly established the
   name. Some persons having said to him that the Novatians ought not to
   be permitted to hold their assemblies within the cities: Do you not
   know,' he replied, that they were fellow-sufferers with us in the
   persecution under Constantius and Valens? [980] Besides,' said he, they
   are witnesses to our creed: for although they separated from the church
   a long while ago, they have never introduced any innovations concerning
   the faith.' Being once at Nicæa on account of the ordination of a
   bishop, and seeing there Asclepiades bishop of the Novatians, then very
   aged, he asked him, How many years have you been a bishop?' When he was
   answered fifty years: You are a happy man,' said he, to have had charge
   of so "good a work" [981] for such a length of time.' To the same
   Asclepiades he observed: I commend Novatus; but can by no means approve
   of the Novatians.' And when Asclepiades, surprised at this strange
   remark, said, What is the meaning of your remark, bishop?' Atticus gave
   him this reason for the distinction. I approve of Novatus for refusing
   to commune with those who had sacrificed, for I myself would have done
   the same: but I cannot praise the Novatians, inasmuch as they exclude
   laymen from communion for very trivial offenses.' Asclepiades answered,
   There are many other "sins unto death," [982] as the Scriptures term
   them, besides sacrificing to idols; on account of which even you
   excommunicate ecclesiastics only, but we laymen also, reserving to God
   alone the power of pardoning them.' [983] Atticus had moreover a
   presentiment of his own death; for at his departure from Nicæa, he said
   to Calliopius a presbyter of that place: Hasten to Constantinople
   before autumn if you wish to see me again alive; for if you delay
   beyond that time, you will not find me surviving.' Nor did he err in
   this prediction; for he died on the 10th of October, in the 21st year
   of his episcopate, under the eleventh consulate of Theodosius, and the
   first of Valentinian Cæsar. [984] The Emperor Theodosius indeed, being
   then on his way from Thessalonica, did not reach Constantinople in time
   for his funeral, for Atticus had been consigned to the grave one day
   before the emperor's arrival. Not long afterwards, on the 23d of the
   same month, October, the young Valentinian was proclaimed Augustus.

   Chapter XXVI.--Sisinnius is chosen to succeed Atticus.

   After the decease of Atticus, there arose a strong contest about the
   election of a successor, some proposing one person, and some another.
   One party, they say, was urgent in favor of a presbyter named Philip;
   another wished to promote Proclus who was also a presbyter; but the
   general desire of the people was that the bishopric should be conferred
   on Sisinnius. This person was also a presbyter but held no
   ecclesiastical office within the city, having been appointed to the
   sacred ministry in a church at Elæa, a village in the suburbs of
   Constantinople. This village is situated across the harbor from the
   city, and in it from an ancient custom the whole population annually
   assembled for the celebration of our Saviour's ascension. All of the
   laity were warmly attached to the man because he was famous for his
   piety, and especially because he was diligent in the care of the poor
   even beyond his power.' [986] The earnestness of the laity thus
   prevailed, and Sisinnius was ordained on the twenty-eighth day of
   February, under the following consulate, which was the twelfth of
   Theodosius, and the second of Valentinian. [987] The presbyter Philip
   was so chagrined at the preference of another to himself, that he even
   introduced the subject into his Christian History, [988] making some
   very censorious remarks, both about the person ordained and those who
   had ordained him, and much more severely on the laity. But he said such
   things as I cannot by any means commit to writing. Since I do not
   approve of his unadvised action in committing them to writing, I do not
   deem it unseasonable, however, to give some notice here of him and of
   his works.

   Chapter XXVII.--Voluminous Productions of Philip, a Presbyter of Side.

   Philip was a native of Side; Side is a city of Pamphylia. From this
   place also Troïlus the sophist came, to whom Philip boasted himself to
   be nearly related. He was a deacon and thus admitted to the privilege
   of familiar intercourse with John Chrysostom, the bishop. He labored
   assiduously in literature, and besides making very considerable
   literary attainments, formed an extensive collection of books in every
   branch of knowledge. Affecting the Asiatic style, [989] he became the
   author of many treatises, attempting among others a refutation of the
   Emperor Julian's treatises against the Christians, and compiled a
   Christian History, which he divided into thirty-six books; each of
   these books occupied several volumes, so that they amounted altogether
   to nearly one thousand, and the mere argument [990] of each volume
   equalled in magnitude the volume itself. This composition he has
   entitled not an Ecclesiastical, but a Christian History, and has
   grouped together in it abundance of very heterogeneous materials,
   wishing to show that he is not ignorant of philosophical and scientific
   learning: for it contains a medley of geometrical theorems,
   astronomical speculations, arithmetical calculations, and musical
   principles, with geographical delineations of islands, mountains,
   forests, and various other matters of little moment. By forcing such
   irrelevant details into connection with his subject, he has rendered
   his work a very loose production, useless alike, in my opinion, to the
   ignorant and the learned; for the illiterate are incapable of
   appreciating the loftiness of his diction, and such as are really
   competent to form a just estimate, condemn his wearisome tautology. But
   let every one exercise his own judgment concerning these books
   according to his taste. All I have to add is, that he has confounded
   the chronological order of the transactions he describes: for after
   having related what took place in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius,
   he immediately goes back to the times of the bishop Athanasius; and
   this sort of thing he does frequently. But enough has been said of
   Philip: we must now mention what happened under the episcopate of
   Sisinnius.

   Chapter XXVIII.--Proclus ordained Bishop of Cyzicus by Sisinnius, but
   rejected by the People.

   The bishop of Cyzicus having died, Sisinnius ordained Proclus to the
   bishopric of that city. But while he was preparing to depart thither,
   the inhabitants anticipated him, by electing an ascetic named
   Dalmatius. This they did in disregard of a law which forbade their
   ordination of a bishop without the sanction of the bishop of
   Constantinople; [991] but they pretended that this was a special
   privilege granted to Atticus personally. Proclus therefore continued
   destitute of the presidency over his own church, but acquired celebrity
   for his discourses in the churches of Constantinople. We shall however
   speak of him more particularly in an appropriate place. Sisinnius
   having survived his appointment to the bishopric by barely two entire
   years, was removed by death on the 24th of December, in the consulate
   of Hierius and Ardaburius. [992] For his temperance, integrity of life,
   and benignity to the poor, he was deservedly eminent; he was moreover
   singularly affable and guileless in disposition, and this rendered him
   rather averse to business, so that by men of active habits he was
   accounted indolent.

   [991] The Council in its 6th Canon declared that no one should be

   bishop of Constantinople was the metropolitan of the Cyzicenes does not
   appear unless the decree of the (Canon 3d) Council of Constantinople
   making the latter a patriarchate is to be understood as rendering the
   see of Cyzicus subordinate to that of Constantinople, as an individual
   church is to the metropolitan. Cf. Bingham, Christ. Antiq. II. 16. 12.

   Chapter XXIX.--Nestorius of Antioch promoted to the See of
   Constantinople. His Persecution of the Heretics.

   After the death of Sisinnius, on account of the spirit of ambitious
   rivalry displayed by the ecclesiastics of Constantinople, the emperors
   resolved that none of that church should fill the vacant bishopric,
   notwithstanding the fact that many eagerly desired to have Philip
   ordained, and no less a number were in favor of the election of
   Proclus. They therefore sent for a stranger [993] from Antioch, whose
   name was Nestorius, [994] a native of Germanicia, [995] distinguished
   for his excellent voice and fluency of speech; qualifications which
   they judged important for the instruction of the people. After three
   months had elapsed therefore, Nestorius was brought from Antioch, being
   greatly lauded by some for his temperance: but what sort of a
   disposition he was of in other respects, those who possessed any
   discernment were able to perceive from his first sermon. Being ordained
   on the 10th of April, under the consulate of Felix and Taurus, [996] he
   immediately uttered those famous words, before all the people, in
   addressing the emperor, Give me, my prince, the earth purged of
   heretics, and I will give you heaven as a recompense. Assist me in
   destroying heretics, and I will assist you in vanquishing the
   Persians.' [997] Now although these utterances were extremely
   gratifying to some of the multitude, who cherished a senseless
   antipathy to the very name of heretic; yet those, as I have said, who
   were skillful in predicating a man's character from his expressions,
   did not fail to detect his levity of mind, and violent and vainglorious
   temperament, inasmuch as he had burst forth into such vehemence without
   being able to contain himself for even the shortest space of time; and
   to use the proverbial phrase, before he had tasted the water of the
   city,' showed himself a furious persecutor. Accordingly on the fifth
   day after his ordination, having determined to demolish a chapel in
   which the Arians were accustomed to perform their devotions privately,
   he drove these people to desperation; for when they saw the work of
   destruction going forward in their chapel, they threw fire into it, and
   the fire spreading on all sides reduced many of the adjacent buildings
   also to ashes. A tumult accordingly arose on account of this throughout
   the city, and the Arians burning to revenge themselves, made
   preparations for that purpose: but God the Guardian of the city
   suffered not the mischief to gather to a climax. From that time,
   however, they branded Nestorius as an incendiary,' and it was not only
   the heretics who did this, but those also of his own faith. For he
   could not rest, but seeking every means of harassing those who embraced
   not his own sentiments, he continually disturbed the public
   tranquillity. He annoyed the Novatians also, being incited to jealousy
   because Paul their bishop was everywhere respected for his piety; but
   the emperor by his admonitions checked his fury. With what calamities
   he visited the Quartodecimans throughout Asia, Lydia, and Caria, and
   what multitudes perished in a popular tumult of which he was the cause
   at Miletus and Sardis, I think proper to pass by in silence. What
   punishment he suffered for all these enormities, and for that unbridled
   license of speech in which he indulged himself, I shall mention
   somewhat later. [998]

   Chapter XXX.--The Burgundians embrace Christianity under Theodosius the
   Younger.

   I must now relate an event well worthy of being recorded, which
   happened about this time. There is a barbarous nation dwelling beyond
   the Rhine, denominated Burgundians; they lead a peaceful life; for
   being almost all artisans, they support themselves by the exercise of
   their trades. The Huns, by making continual irruptions on this people,
   devastated their country, and often destroyed great numbers of them. In
   this perplexity, therefore, the Burgundians resolved to have recourse
   not to any human being, but to commit themselves to the protection of
   some god: and having seriously considered that the God of the Romans
   mightily defended those that feared him, they all with common consent
   embraced the faith of Christ. Going therefore to one of the cities of
   Gaul, they requested the bishop to grant them Christian baptism: who
   ordering them to fast seven days, and having meanwhile instructed them
   in the elementary principles of the faith, on the eighth day baptized
   and dismissed them. Accordingly becoming confident thenceforth, they
   marched against their invaders; nor were they disappointed in their
   hope. For the king of the Huns, Uptar [999] by name, having died in the
   night from the effects of a surfeit, the Burgundians attacked that
   people then without a commander-in-chief; and although they were few in
   numbers and their opponents very many, they obtained a complete
   victory; for the Burgundians were altogether but three thousand men,
   and destroyed no less than ten thousand of the enemy. From that period
   this nation became zealously attached to the Christian religion. About
   the same time Barbas bishop of the Arians died, on the 24th of June,
   under the thirteenth consulate of Theodosius, [1000] and the third of
   Valentinian, and Sabbatius was constituted his successor. Enough has
   been said of these matters.

   Chapter XXXI.--Nestorius harasses the Macedonians.

   Nestorius indeed acted contrary to the usage of the Church, and caused
   himself to be hated in other ways also, [1001] as is evident from what
   happened during his episcopate. For Anthony bishop of Germa, a city of
   the Hellespont, actuated by the example of Nestorius in his intolerance
   of heretics, began to persecute the Macedonians, under the pretext of
   carrying out the intentions of the patriarch. The Macedonians for some
   time endured his annoyance; but when Anthony proceeded to farther
   extremities, unable any longer to bear his harsh treatment, they were
   led to a sad desperation, and suborning two men, who put right in a
   secondary place and profit first, they assassinated their tormenter.
   When the Macedonians had perpetrated this crime, Nestorius took
   occasion from it to increase his violence of conduct against them, and
   prevailed on the emperor to take away their churches. They were
   therefore deprived of not only those which they possessed at
   Constantinople, before the old walls of the imperial city, but of those
   also which they had at Cyzicus, and many others that belonged to them
   in the rural districts of the Hellespont. Many of them therefore at
   that time came over to the Catholic church, and professed the
   homoousian' faith. But as the proverb says, drunkards never want wine,
   nor the contentious strife': and so it fell out with regard to
   Nestorius, who after having exerted himself to expel others from the
   church, was himself ejected on the following account.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1001] By a slight change in the Greek text Valesius renders this
   phrase but caused others also to imitate him,' alleging that the
   conduct of Anthony of Germa was in imitation of Nestorius; but the
   emendation seems unnecessary. Socrates means that Nestorius made
   himself odious in other ways, perhaps through other persons such as
   Anthony, &c.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXXII.--Of the Presbyter Anastasius, by whom the Faith of
   Nestorius was perverted.

   Nestorius had an associate whom he had brought from Antioch, a
   presbyter named Anastasius; for this man he had the highest esteem, and
   consulted him in the management of his most important affairs. This
   Anastasius preaching one day in the church said, Let no one call Mary
   Theotocos: [1002] for Mary was but a woman; [1003] and it is impossible
   that God should be born of a woman.' These words created a great
   sensation, and troubled many both of the clergy and laity; they having
   been heretofore taught to acknowledge Christ as God, and by no means to
   separate his humanity from his divinity on account of the economy of
   incarnation, heeding the voice of the apostle when he said, Yea, though
   we have known Christ after the flesh; yet now henceforth know we him no
   more.' [1004] And again, Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning
   of Christ, let us go on unto perfection.' [1005] While great offense
   was taken in the church, as we have said, at what was thus propounded,
   Nestorius, eager to establish Anastasius' proposition--for he did not
   wish to have the man who was esteemed by himself found guilty of
   blasphemy--delivered several public discourses on the subject, in which
   he assumed a controversial attitude, and totally rejected the epithet
   Theotocos. Wherefore the controversy on the subject being taken in one
   spirit by some and in another by others, the discussion which ensued
   divided the church, and resembled the struggle of combatants in the
   dark, all parties uttering the most confused and contradictory
   assertions. Nestorius thus acquired the reputation among the masses of
   asserting the blasphemous dogma that the Lord is a mere man, and
   attempting to foist on the Church the dogmas of Paul of Samosata and
   Photinus; and so great a clamor was raised by the contention that it
   was deemed requisite to convene a general council to take cognizance of
   the matter in dispute. Having myself perused the writings of Nestorius,
   I have found him an unlearned man and shall candidly express the
   conviction of my own mind concerning him: and as in entire freedom from
   personal antipathies, I have already alluded to his faults, I shall in
   like manner be unbiassed by the criminations of his adversaries, to
   derogate from his merits. I cannot then concede that he was either a
   follower of Paul of Samosata or of Photinus, or that he denied the
   Divinity of Christ: but he seemed scared at the term Theotocos, as
   though it were some terrible phantom. [1006] The fact is, the causeless
   alarm he manifested on this subject just exposed his extreme ignorance:
   for being a man of natural fluency as a speaker, he was considered well
   educated, but in reality he was disgracefully illiterate. In fact he
   contemned the drudgery of an accurate examination of the ancient
   expositors: and, puffed up with his readiness of expression, he did not
   give his attention to the ancients, but thought himself the greatest of
   all. Now he was evidently unacquainted with the fact that in the First
   Catholic epistle of John it was written in the ancient copies, [1007]
   Every spirit that separates Jesus, is not of God.' The mutilation of
   this passage [1008] is attributable to those who desired to separate
   the Divine nature from the human economy: or to use the very language
   of the early interpreters, some persons have corrupted this epistle,
   aiming at separating the manhood of Christ from his Deity.' But the
   humanity is united to the Divinity in the Saviour, so as to constitute
   not two persons but one only. Hence it was that the ancients,
   emboldened by this testimony, scrupled not to style Mary Theotocos. For
   thus Eusebius Pamphilus in his third book of the Life of Constantine
   [1009] writes in these terms:

   And in fact "God with us" submitted to be born for our sake; and the
   place of his nativity is by the Hebrews called Bethlehem. Wherefore the
   devout empress Helena adorned the place of accouchement of the
   God-bearing virgin with the most splendid monuments, decorating that
   sacred spot with the richest ornaments.'

   Origen also in the first volume of his Commentaries on the apostle's
   epistle to the Romans, [1010] gives an ample exposition of the sense in
   which the term Theotocos is used. It is therefore obvious that
   Nestorius had very little acquaintance with the treatises of the
   ancients, and for that reason, as I observed, objected to the word
   only: for that he does not assert Christ to be a mere man, as Photinus
   did or Paul of Samosata, his own published homilies fully demonstrate.
   In these discourses he nowhere destroys the proper personality [1011]
   of the Word of God; but on the contrary invariably maintains that he
   has an essential and distinct personality and existence. Nor does he
   ever deny his subsistence as Photinus and the Samosatan did, and as the
   Manichæans and followers of Montanus have also dared to do. Such in
   fact I find Nestorius, both from having myself read his own works, and
   from the assurances of his admirers. But this idle contention of his
   has produced no slight ferment in the religious world.

   Chapter XXXIII.--Desecration of the Altar of the Great Church by
   Runaway Slaves.

   While matters were in this state it happened that an outrage was
   perpetrated in the church. For the domestics of a man of quality who
   were foreigners, having experienced harsh treatment from their master,
   fled from him to the church; and thus they ran up to the very altar
   with their swords drawn. [1012] Nor could they be prevailed upon by any
   entreaties to withdraw; so that they impeded the performance of the
   sacred services; but inasmuch as they obstinately maintained their
   position for several days, brandishing their weapons in defiance of any
   one who dared to approach them--and in fact killed one of the
   ecclesiastics, and wounded another--they were finally compelled to slay
   themselves. A person who was present at this desecration of the
   sanctuary, remarked that such a profanation was an ominous presage, and
   in support of his view of the matter, quoted the two following iambics
   of an ancient poet:--

   "For such prognostics happen at a time

   When temples are defiled by impious crime."

   Nor was he who made the prediction disappointed in these inauspicious
   forebodings: for they signified as it seems a division among the
   people, and the deposition of the author of it.

   Chapter XXXIV.--Synod at Ephesus against Nestorius. His Deposition.

   Not long time elapsed before a mandate from the emperor directed the
   bishops in all places to assemble at Ephesus. [1013] Immediately after
   the festival of Easter therefore Nestorius, escorted by a great crowd
   of his adherents, repaired to Ephesus, and found many of the bishops
   already there. Cyril bishop of Alexandria making some delay, did not
   arrive till near Pentecost. Five days after Pentecost, Juvenal bishop
   of Jerusalem arrived. While John of Antioch was still absent, those who
   were now congregated entered into the consideration of the question;
   and Cyril of Alexandria began a sharp skirmish of words, with the
   design of terrifying Nestorius, for he had a strong dislike for him.
   When many had declared that Christ was God, Nestorius said: I cannot
   term him God who was two and three months old. I am therefore clear of
   your blood, and shall in future come no more among you.' Having uttered
   these words he left the assembly, and afterwards held meetings with the
   other bishops who entertained sentiments similar to his own.
   Accordingly those present were divided into two factions. That section
   which supported Cyril, having constituted themselves a council,
   summoned Nestorius: but he refused to meet them, and put them off until
   the arrival of John of Antioch. The partisans of Cyril therefore
   proceeded to the examination of the public discourses of Nestorius
   which he had preached on the subject in dispute; and after deciding
   from a repeated perusal of them that they contained distinct blasphemy
   against the Son of God, they deposed him. This being done, the
   partisans of Nestorius constituted themselves another council apart,
   and therein deposed Cyril himself, and together with him Memnon bishop
   of Ephesus. Not long after these events, John bishop of Antioch made
   his appearance; and being informed of what had taken place, he
   pronounced unqualified censure on Cyril as the author of all this
   confusion, in having so precipitately proceeded to the deposition of
   Nestorius. Upon this Cyril combined with Juvenal to revenge themselves
   on John, and they deposed him also. When affairs reached this confused
   condition, Nestorius saw that the contention which had been raised was
   thus tending to the destruction of communion, in bitter regret he
   called Mary Theotocos, and cried out: Let Mary be called Theotocos, if
   you will, and let all disputing cease.' But although he made this
   recantation, no notice was taken of it; for his deposition was not
   revoked, and he was banished to the Oasis, where he still remains.
   [1014] Such was the conclusion of this Synod. These things were done on
   the 28th of June, under the consulate of Bassus and Antiochus. [1015]
   John when he had returned to his bishopric, having convened several
   bishops, deposed Cyril, who had also returned to his see: but soon
   afterwards, having set aside their enmity and accepting each other as
   friends, they mutually reinstated each other in their episcopal chairs.
   But after the deposition of Nestorius a mighty agitation prevailed
   through the churches of Constantinople. For the people was divided on
   account of what we have already called his unfortunate utterances; and
   the clergy unanimously anathematized him. For such is the sentence
   which we Christians are accustomed to pronounce on those who have
   advanced any blasphemous doctrines, when we set up their impiety that
   it may be publicly exposed, as it were, on a pillar, to universal
   execration.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1013] This was the third of the Ecumenical or General Synods; it was
   convened in 431 and dealt with the Nestorian controversy. Cf. Hefele,
   Hist. of the Councils of the Ch. Vol. III. p. 1; also Evagrius, H. E.
   I. 2, 3, 4.

   [1014] After his deposition Nestorius was banished to the Oasis, as
   above stated. This Oasis was a miserable place exposed to the wild
   nomad tribes; all around were shifting sands, forming a pathless
   solitude. He...employed himself in writing a defense of the opinions
   for which he had lost all. The Blemmyes at length invaded the Oasis,
   and took Nestorius, among others, captive; then, by what he calls a
   most unexpected act of compassion, released him, and bade him hurry
   away. He thought it best to proceed to Panopolis in the Thebaid, and
   voluntarily reported himself to the governor, who, unmoved by his
   pathetic entreaty that the imperial authorities would not be less
   merciful than the barbarians, ordered some soldiers to convey him to
   Elephantine. The journey under such circumstances exhausted the old
   man; a fall severely hurt his hand and side; and before he could reach
   Elephantine, a mandate came for his return to Panopolis. Two more
   compulsory changes of abode were added to sufferings which remind us
   perforce of the last days of S. John Chrysostom; and then the unhappy
   Nestorius was no more. The exact year of his death cannot be
   ascertained.'--W. Bright, Hist. of the Church from a.d. 313 to 451, p.

   Chapter XXXV.--Maximian elected to the Episcopate of Constantinople,
   though Some wished Proclus to take that Place.

   After this there was another debate concerning the election of a bishop
   of Constantinople. Many were in favor of Philip, of whom we have
   already made mention; but a still greater number advocated the claims
   of Proclus. And the candidacy of Proclus would have succeeded, had not
   some of the most influential persons interfered, on the ground of its
   being forbidden by the ecclesiastical canon that a person nominated to
   one bishopric should be translated to that of another city. [1016] The
   people believing this assertion, were thereby restrained; and about
   four months after the deposition of Nestorius, a man named Maximian was
   promoted to the bishopric, who had lived an ascetic life, and was also
   ranked as a presbyter. He had acquired a high reputation for sanctity,
   on account of having at his own expense constructed sepulchral
   depositaries for the reception of the pious after their decease, but
   was rude in speech' [1017] and inclined to live a quiet life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1016] The canon referred to is probably the fifteenth of Nicæa, as
   follows: On account of the numerous troubles and divisions which have
   taken place, it has been thought good that...no bishop, priest, or
   deacon should remove from one city to another. If any one should
   venture, even after this ordinance of the holy and great Synod, to act
   contrary to this present rule, and should follow the old custom, the
   translation shall be null, and he shall return to the church to which
   he had been ordained bishop or priest.' Cf. also Apostol. Can. 14 and
   15, and the twenty-first of the Council of Antioch given by Hefele,
   Hist. of the Ch. Councils, Vol. II. p. 72.

   Chapter XXXVI.--The Author's Opinion of the Validity of Translations
   from One See to Another.

   But since some parties by appealing to a prohibition in the
   ecclesiastical canon, prevented the election of Proclus, because of his
   previous appointment to the see of Cyzicus, I wish to make a few
   remarks on this subject. Those who then presumed to interpose such a
   cause of exclusion do not appear to me to have stated the truth; but
   they were either influenced by prejudice against Proclus, or at least
   have been themselves completely ignorant both of the canons, and of the
   frequent and often advantageous precedents that had been established in
   the churches. Eusebius Pamphilus relates in the sixth book of his
   Ecclesiastical History, [1018] that Alexander bishop of a certain city
   in Cappadocia, coming to Jerusalem for devotional purposes, was
   detained by the inhabitants of that city, and constituted bishop, as
   the successor of Narcissus; and that he continued to preside over the
   churches there during the remainder of his life. So indifferent a thing
   was it amongst our ancestors, to transfer a bishop from one city to
   another as often as it was deemed expedient. But if it is necessary to
   place beyond a doubt the falsehood of the statement of those who
   prevented the ordination of Proclus, I shall annex to this treatise the
   canon bearing on the subject. It runs thus: [1019]

   If any one after having been ordained a bishop should not proceed to
   the church unto which he has been appointed, from no fault on his part,
   but either because the people are unwilling to receive him, or for some
   other reason arising from necessity, let him be partaker of the honor
   and functions of the rank with which he has been invested, provided he
   intermeddles not with the affairs of the church wherein he may
   minister. It is his duty however to submit to whatever the Synod of the
   province may see fit to determine, after it shall have taken cognizance
   of the matter.'

   Such is the language of the canon. That many bishops have been
   transferred from one city to another to meet the exigencies of peculiar
   cases, I shall now prove by giving the names of those bishops who have
   been so translated. [1020] Perigenes was ordained bishop of Patræ: but
   inasmuch as the inhabitants of that city refused to admit him, the
   bishop of Rome directed that he should be assigned to the metropolitan
   see of Corinth, which had become vacant by the decease of its former
   bishop; here he presided during the rest of his days. Gregory was first
   made bishop of Sasima, one of the cities of Cappadocia, but was
   afterwards transferred to Nazianzus. Melitius after having presided
   over the church at Sebastia, subsequently governed that of Antioch.
   Alexander bishop of Antioch transferred Dositheus bishop of Seleucia,
   to Tarsus in Cilicia. Reverentius was removed from Arca in Phoenicia,
   and afterwards to Tyre. John was transferred from Gordum a city of
   Lydia, to Proconnesus, and presided over the church there. Palladius
   was transferred from Helenopolis to Aspuna; and Alexander from the same
   city to Adriani. Theophilus was removed from Apamea in Asia, to
   Eudoxiopolis anciently called Salambria. Polycarp was transferred from
   Sexantaprista a city of Mysia, to Nicopolis in Thrace. Hierophilus from
   Trapezopolis in Phrygia to Plotinopolis in Thrace. Optimus from Agdamia
   in Phrygia to Antioch in Pisidia; and Silvanus from Philippopolis in
   Thrace to Troas. This enumeration of bishops who have passed from one
   see to another is sufficient for the present; concerning Silvanus who
   was removed from Philippopolis in Thrace to Troas I deem it desirable
   here to give a concise account.

   Chapter XXXVII.--Miracle performed by Silvanus Bishop of Troas formerly
   of Philippopolis.

   Silvanus was formerly a rhetorician, and had been brought up in the
   school of Troïlus the sophist; but aiming at perfection in his
   Christian course, he entered on the ascetic mode of life, and set aside
   the rhetorician's pallium. Atticus bishop of Constantinople having
   taken notice of him afterwards ordained him bishop of Philippopolis.
   [1021] Thus he resided three years in Thrace; but being unable to
   endure the cold of that region--for his constitution was delicate and
   sickly--he begged Atticus to appoint some one else in his place,
   alleging that it was for no other reason but the cold that he resigned
   residence in Thrace. This having been done, Silvanus resided at
   Constantinople, where he practiced so great austerities that, despising
   the luxurious refinements of the age, he often appeared in the crowded
   streets of that populous city shod with sandals made of hay. Some time
   having elapsed, the bishop of Troas died; on which account the
   inhabitants of that city came to Atticus concerning the appointment of
   a successor. While he was deliberating whom he should ordain for them,
   Silvanus happened to pay him a visit, which at once relieved him from
   further anxiety; for addressing Silvanus, he said: You have now no
   longer any excuse for avoiding the pastoral administration of a church;
   for Troas is not a cold place: so that God has considered your
   infirmity of body, and provided you a suitable residence. Go thither
   then, my brother, without delay.' Silvanus therefore removed to that
   city.

   Here a miracle was performed by his instrumentality, which I shall now
   relate. An immense ship for carrying burdens, such as they term float,'
   [1022] intended for the conveyance of enormous pillars, had been
   recently constructed on the shore at Troas. This vessel it was
   necessary to launch. But although many strong ropes were attached to
   it, and the power of a vast number of persons was applied, the vessel
   was in no way moved. When these attempts had been repeated several days
   successively with the like result, the people began to think that a
   devil detained the ship; they therefore went to the bishop Silvanus,
   and entreated him to go and offer a prayer in that place. For thus only
   they thought it could be launched. He replied with his characteristic
   lowliness of mind that he was but a sinner, and that the work pertained
   to some one who was just and not to himself. Being at length prevailed
   on by their continued entreaties, he approached the shore, where after
   having prayed, he touched one of the ropes, and exhorting the rest to
   vigorous exertion, the ship was by the first pull instantly set in
   motion, and ran swiftly into the sea. This miracle wrought by the hands
   of Silvanus, stirred up the whole population of the province to piety.
   But the uncommon worth of Silvanus was manifested in various other
   ways. Perceiving that the ecclesiastics made a merchandise of the
   contentions of those engaged in law-suits, he would never nominate any
   one of the clergy as judge: but causing the documents of the litigants
   to be delivered to himself, he summoned to him some pious layman in
   whose integrity he had confidence; and committing to him the
   adjudication of the case, he soon equitably settled all the differences
   of the litigants; and by this procedure Silvanus acquired for himself
   great reputation from all classes of persons.

   We have indeed digressed pretty much from the course of our history in
   giving this account of Silvanus; but yet it will not, we imagine, be
   unprofitable. Let us now however return to the place from which we
   departed. Maximian, having been ordained on the 25th of October, under
   the consulate of Bassus and Antiochus, [1023] the affairs of the church
   were reduced to a better ordered and more tranquil condition.

   [1021] Another indication that the patriarchal functions of the bishop
   of Constantinople were at this time exercised and recognized. The
   Council of Chalcedon somewhat later (in 451 a.d.) formally ordered in
   its twenty-eighth canon that the metropolitans of the Thracian Pontic,
   and Asian dioceses should be ordained by the bishop of Constantinople,
   their election being first secured by the clergy and laity of the
   dioceses, and referred to the patriarch afterwards.

   Chapter XXXVIII.--Many of the Jews in Crete embrace the Christian
   Faith.

   About this period a great number of Jews who dwelt in Crete were
   convened to Christianity, through the following disastrous
   circumstance. A certain Jewish impostor pretended that he was Moses,
   and had been [1024] sent from heaven to lead out the Jews inhabiting
   that island, and conduct them through the sea: for he said that he was
   the same person who formerly preserved the Israelites by leading them
   through the Red Sea. During a whole year therefore he perambulated the
   several cities of the island, and persuaded the Jews to believe such
   assurances. He moreover bid them renounce their money and other
   property, pledging himself to guide them through a dry sea into the
   land of promise. Deluded by such expectations, they neglected business
   of every kind, despising what they possessed, and permitting any one
   who chose to take it. When the day appointed by this deceiver for their
   departure had arrived, he himself took the lead, and all followed with
   their wives and children. He led them therefore until they reached a
   promontory that overhung the sea, from which he ordered them to fling
   themselves headlong into it. Those who came first to the precipice did
   so, and were immediately destroyed, some of them being dashed in pieces
   against the rocks, and some drowned in the waters: and more would have
   perished, had not the Providence of God led some fishermen and
   merchants who were Christians to be present. These persons drew out and
   saved some that were almost drowned, who then in their perilous
   situation became sensible of the madness of their conduct. The rest
   they hindered from casting themselves down, by telling them of the
   destruction of those who had taken the first leap. When at length the
   Jews perceived how fearfully they had been duped, they blamed first of
   all their own indiscreet credulity, and then sought to lay hold of the
   pseudo-Moses in order to put him to death. But they were unable to
   seize him, for he suddenly disappeared which induced a general belief
   that it was some malignant fiend, [1025] who had assumed a human form
   for the destruction of their nation in that place. In consequence of
   this experience many of the Jews in Crete at that time abandoning
   Judaism attached themselves to the Christian faith.

   Chapter XXXIX.--Preservation of the Church of the Novatians from Fire.

   A little while after this, Paul bishop of the Novatians acquired the
   reputation of a man truly beloved of God in a greater measure than he
   had before. For a terrible conflagration having broken out at
   Constantinople, such as had never happened before,--for the fire
   destroyed the greater part of the city,--as the largest of the public
   granaries, the Achillean bath, [1026] and everything else in the way of
   the fire were being consumed, it at length approached the church of the
   Novatians situated near Pelargus. When the bishop Paul saw the church
   endangered, he ran upon the altar, where he commended to God the
   preservation of the church and all it contained; nor did he cease to
   pray not only for it, but also for the city. And God heard him, as the
   event clearly proved: for although the fire entered this oratory
   through all its doors and windows, it did no damage. And while many
   adjacent edifices fell a prey to the devouring element, the church
   itself was seen unscathed in the midst of the whole conflagration
   triumphing over its raging flames. This went on for two days and two
   nights, when the fire was extinguished, after it had burnt down a great
   part of the city: but the church remained entire, and what is more
   marvelous still, there was not the slightest trace even of smoke to be
   observed either on its timbers or its walls. This occurred on the 17th
   of August, in the fourteenth consulate of Theodosius, which he bore
   together with Maximus. [1027] Since that time the Novatians annually
   celebrate the preservation of their church, on the 17th of August, by
   special thanksgivings to God. And almost all men, Christians and most
   of the pagans from that time forth continue to regard that place with
   veneration as a peculiarly consecrated spot, because of the miracle
   which was wrought for its safeguard. So much concerning these affairs.

   Chapter XL.--Proclus succeeds Maximian Bishop of Constantinople.

   Maximian, having peacefully governed the church during two years and
   five months, died on the 12th of April, in the consulate of Areobindus
   and Aspar. [1028] This happened to be on the fifth day of the week of
   fasts which immediately precedes Easter. The day of the week was
   Thursday. Then the Emperor Theodosius wishing to prevent the
   disturbances in the church which usually attend the election of a
   bishop, made a wise provision for this affair; for in order that there
   might be no dispute again about the choice of a bishop and tumult thus
   arise, without delaying, before the body of Maximian was interred, he
   directed the bishops who were then in the city to place Proclus in the
   episcopal chair. For he had received already letters from Cælestinus
   bishop of Rome approving of this election, which he had forwarded to
   Cyril of Alexandria, John of Antioch, and Rufus of Thessalonica; in
   which he assured them that there was no impediment to the translation
   to another see, of a person who had been nominated and really was the
   bishop of some one church. Proclus, being thus invested with the
   bishopric, performed the funeral obsequies of Maximian: but it is now
   time briefly to give some account of him also.

   Chapter XLI.--Excellent Qualities of Proclus.

   Proclus was a reader at a very early age, and assiduously frequenting
   the schools, became devoted to the study of rhetoric. On attaining
   manhood he was in the habit of constant intercourse with Atticus the
   bishop, having been constituted his secretary. When he had made great
   progress, his patron promoted him to the rank of deacon; subsequently
   being elevated to the presbyterate, as we have before stated, he was
   ordained by Sisinnius to be bishop of Cyzicus. [1029] But all these
   things were done long before. At this time he was allotted the
   episcopal chair of Constantinople. He was a man of moral excellence
   equal to any other; for having been trained by Atticus, he was a
   zealous imitator of all that bishop's virtues. Patience, however, he
   exercised to a greater degree than his master, who occasionally
   practiced severities upon the heretics; for Proclus was gentle towards
   everybody, being convinced that kindness is far more effective than
   violence in advancing the cause of truth. Resolving therefore to
   vexatiously interfere with no heresy whatever, he restored in his own
   person to the church that mild and benign dignity of character, which
   had so often before been unhappily violated. In this respect he
   followed the example of the Emperor Theodosius; for as the latter had
   determined never to exercise his imperial authority against criminals,
   so had Proclus likewise purposed not to disquiet those who entertained
   other sentiments on divine subjects than those which he cherished
   himself.

   Chapter XLII.--Panegyric of the Emperor Theodosius Younger. [1030]

   For these reasons the emperor had the highest esteem for Proclus. For
   in fact he himself was a pattern to all true clergymen, and never
   approved of those who attempted to persecute others. Nay I may venture
   to affirm, that in meekness he surpassed all those who have ever
   faithfully borne the sacerdotal office. And what is recorded of Moses
   in the book of Numbers, [1031] Now the man Moses was very meek, above
   all the men which were upon the face of the earth'--may most justly be
   applied at this day; for the Emperor Theodosius is meek above all the
   men which are upon the face of the earth.' It is because of this
   meekness that God subdued his enemies without martial conflicts, as the
   capture of the usurper John, [1032] and the subsequent discomfiture of
   the barbarians clearly demonstrate. For the God of the universe has
   afforded this most devout emperor in our times supernatural aid of a
   similar kind to what was vouchsafed to the righteous heretofore. I
   write not these things from adulation, but truthfully narrate facts
   such as everybody can attest.

   Chapter XLIII.--Calamities of the Barbarians who had been the Usurper
   John's Allies.

   After the death of the usurper, the barbarians whom he had called to
   his assistance against the Romans, made preparations for ravaging the
   Roman provinces. The emperor being informed of this, immediately, as
   his custom was, committed the management of the matter to God; and
   continuing in earnest prayer, he speedily obtained what he sought; for
   it is worth while to give attention to disasters which befell the
   barbarians. [1033] For their chief, whose name was Rougas, was struck
   dead with a thunderbolt. Then a plague followed which destroyed most of
   the men who were under him: and as if this was not sufficient, fire
   came down from heaven, and consumed many of the survivors. This filled
   the barbarians with the utmost terror; not so much because they had
   dared to take up arms against a nation of such valor as the Romans
   possessed, as that they perceived them to be assisted by a mighty God.
   On this occasion, Proclus the bishop preached a sermon in the church in
   which he applied a prophecy out of Ezekiel to the deliverance effected
   by God in the late emergency, and was in consequence much admired. This
   is the language of the prophecy: [1034]

   And thou, son of man, prophesy against Gog the prince of Rhos, Mosoch,
   and Thobel. For I will judge him with death, and with blood, and with
   overflowing rain, and with hail-stones. I will also rain fire and
   brimstone upon him, and upon all his bands, and upon many nations that
   are with him. And I will be magnified, and glorified, and I will be
   known in the eyes of many nations: and they shall know that I am the
   Lord.'

   This application of the prophecy was received with great applause, as I
   have said, and enhanced the estimation in which Proclus was held.
   Moreover the providence of God rewarded the meekness of the emperor in
   various other ways, one of which was the following.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1033] Who these barbarians were it is impossible to find out
   precisely, and that not because no mention is made of barbarian inroads
   on the imperial territories, but because so many are mentioned by the
   chronographers and the historians of the Goths (Jornandes, Prosper
   Aquitanus, Marcellinus, &c.) that it is impossible to identify this
   with any of them to the exclusion of the rest. Rougas also appears in
   these historians as Rouas (in Priscus), Roas (in Jornandes), Rugilas
   (in Prosper Aquitanus), and is said to be related to Attila; but
   nothing certain can be drawn from the accounts.

   [1034] Ezek. xxxviii. 2, 22, 23. Ambrose has also used this prophecy,
   applying it to the Goths, and exhorted Gratian to make war against
   them. Cf. Ambrose, de Fide, 2. 16. The quotation here is from the LXX.

   Chapter XLIV.--Marriage of the Emperor Valentinian with Eudoxia the
   Daughter of Theodosius.

   He had by the empress Eudocia, his wife, a daughter named Eudoxia. Her
   his cousin Valentinian, appointed by him emperor of the West, demanded
   for himself in marriage. When the emperor Theodosius had given his
   assent to this proposal, and they had consulted with each other as to
   the place on the frontiers of both empires, where it would be desirable
   that the marriage should be celebrated, it was decided that both
   parties should go to Thessalonica (which is about half-way) for this
   purpose. But Valentinian sent a message to the effect that he would not
   give him the trouble of coming, for that he himself would go to
   Constantinople. Accordingly, having secured the Western parts with a
   sufficient guard, he proceeded thither on account of his nuptials,
   which were celebrated in the consulate of Isidore and Sinator; [1035]
   after which he returned with his wife into the West. This auspicious
   event took place at that time.

   Chapter XLV.--The Body of John Chrysostom transferred to
   Constantinople, and placed in the Church of the Apostles by the Emperor
   at the Instigation of Proclus.

   Not long after this, Proclus the bishop brought back to the Church
   those who had separated themselves from it on account of Bishop John's
   deposition, he having soothed the irritation by a prudent expedient.
   What this was we must now recount. Having obtained the emperor's
   permission, he removed the body of John from Comana, where it was
   buried, to Constantinople, in the thirty-fifth year after his
   deposition. And when he had carried it in solemn procession through the
   city, he deposited it with much honor in the church termed The
   Apostles. By this means the admirers of that prelate were conciliated,
   and again associated in communion with the [catholic] Church. This
   happened on the 27th of January, in the sixteenth consulate of the
   Emperor Theodosius. [1036] But it astonishes me that envy, which has
   been vented against Origen since his death, has spared John. For the
   former was excommunicated by Theophilus about two hundred years after
   his decease; while the latter was restored to communion by Proclus in
   the thirty-fifth year after his death! So different was Proclus from
   Theophilus. And men of observation and intelligence cannot be deceived
   in reference to how these things were done and are continually being
   done.

   Chapter XLVI.--Death of Paul Bishop of the Novatians, and Election of
   Marcian as his Successor.

   A little while after the removal of John's body, Paul bishop of the
   Novatians died, on the 21st of July, under the same consulate: [1037]
   who at his own funeral united, in a certain sense, all the different
   sects into one church. For all parties attended his body to the tomb,
   chanting psalms together, inasmuch as even during his lifetime by his
   rectitude he was in universal esteem by all. But as Paul just before
   his death performed a memorable act, I deem it advantageous to insert
   it in this history as it may be interesting to the readers of this work
   to be acquainted with it. And lest the brilliancy of that important
   deed should be obscured by dwelling on circumstantial details of minor
   consequence, I shall not stay to expatiate on the strictness with which
   he maintained his ascetic discipline as to diet even throughout his
   illness, without the least departure from the course he had prescribed
   for himself, or the omission of any of the ordinary exercises of
   devotion with his accustomed fervor. But what was this deed? Conscious
   that his departure was at hand, he sent for all the presbyters of the
   churches under his care, and thus addressed them: Give your attention
   while I am alive to the election of a bishop to preside over you, lest
   the peace of your churches should hereafter be disturbed.' They having
   answered that this affair had better not be left to them: For
   inasmuch,' said they, as some of us have one judgment about the matter,
   and some another, we would by no means nominate the same individual. We
   wish therefore that you would yourself designate the person you would
   desire to succeed you.' Give me then,' said Paul, this declaration of
   yours in writing, that you will elect him whom I should appoint.' When
   they had written this pledge, and ratified it by their signatures,
   Paul, rising in his bed and sitting up, wrote the name of Marcian in
   the paper, without informing any of those present what he had inserted.
   This person had been promoted to the rank of presbyter, and instructed
   in the ascetic discipline by him, but was then gone abroad. Having
   folded this document and put his own seal on it, he caused the
   principal presbyters to seal it also; after which he delivered it into
   the hands of Marcus a bishop of the Novatians in Scythia, who was at
   that time staying at Constantinople, to whom he thus spake, If it shall
   please God that I should continue much longer in this life, restore me
   this deposit, now entrusted to your safe keeping. But should it seem
   fit to him to remove me, you will herein discover whom I have chosen as
   my successor in the bishopric.' Soon after this he died; and on the
   third day after his death, the paper having been unfolded in the
   presence of a great number of persons, Marcian's name was found within
   it, when they all cried out that he was worthy of the honor. Messengers
   were therefore sent off without delay to bring him to Constantinople.
   These, by a pious fraud, finding him residing at Tiberiopolis in
   Phrygia, brought him back with them; whereupon he was ordained and
   placed in the episcopal chair on the 21st of the same month. [1038]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1037] As above, 438 a.d.

   [1038] This seems hardly probable when compared with the opening
   sentence of the chapter, and so Valesius with Christophorson and others
   change it into August. The emendation suggested in the Greek is not a
   difficult one; it simply adds between au- and tou of the word autou
   (above translated the same'), the syllable gous- making it thus,
   augoustou menos, month of August.' The emendation, or something
   equivalent to it, must be accepted, otherwise we are compelled to place
   the death of Paul and the ordination of Marcian together with the
   intervening events on the same day.

   Chapter XLVII.--The Empress Eudocia goes to Jerusalem; sent there by
   the Emperor Theodosius.

   Moreover the Emperor Theodosius offered up thanksgivings to God for the
   blessings which had been conferred upon him; at the same time
   reverencing Christ with the most special honors. He also sent his wife
   Eudocia to Jerusalem, [1039] she having bound herself by a vow to go
   thither, should she live to see the marriage of her daughter. The
   empress therefore, on her visit to the sacred city, adorned its
   churches with the most costly gifts; and both then, and after her
   return, decorated all the churches in the other cities of the East with
   a variety of ornaments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1039] On this visit of the empress to Jerusalem, see Evagrius, H. E.
   I. 20-23. During this visit for some reason or other--variously stated
   by the authors of the period--an alienation occurred between the
   emperor and Eudocia. See above, chap. 21, note 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XLVIII.--Thalassius is ordained Bishop of Cæsarea in
   Cappadocia.

   About this same time, under the seventeenth consulate of Theodosius,
   [1040] Proclus the bishop undertook the performance of an act, such as
   no one among the ancients had done. Firmus bishop of Cæsarea in
   Cappadocia being dead, the inhabitants of that place came to
   Constantinople to consult Proclus about the appointment of a bishop.
   While Proclus was considering whom he should prefer to that see, it so
   happened that all the senators came to the church to visit him on the
   sabbath day; among whom was Thalassius also, a man who had administered
   the government of the nations and cities of Illyricum. And as it was
   reported that the emperor was about to entrust the government of the
   Eastern parts to him, Proclus laid his hands on him, and ordained him
   bishop of Cæsarea, instead of Prætorian Prefect.

   In such a flourishing condition were the affairs of the Church at this
   time. But we shall here close our history, praying that the churches
   everywhere, with the cities and nations, may live in peace; for as long
   as peace continues, those who desire to write histories will find no
   materials for their purpose. And we ourselves, O holy man of God,
   Theodore, should have been unable to accomplish in seven books the task
   we undertook at your request, had the lovers of seditions chosen to be
   quiet.

   This last book contains an account of the transactions of thirty-two
   years: and the whole history which is comprised in seven books,
   comprehends a period of 140 years. [1041] It commences from the first
   year of the 271st Olympiad, in which Constantine was proclaimed
   emperor; and ends at the second year of the 305th Olympiad, in which
   the Emperor Theodosius bore his seventeenth consulate. [1042]

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   Salaminius Hermias Sozomen

   ------------------------

   Part I.--The Life.

   The name is an unusual and difficult one. It seems desirable to give
   preference to the order which Photius adopts, but to preserve the
   spelling in Nicephorus Callistus, and in the captions of the chief
   manuscripts, and therefore to call him Salaminius Hermias Sozomen. What
   the term Salaminius indicates, cannot yet be accurately determined.
   There are no data to show any official connection of Sozomen with
   Salamis opposite Athens, or Salamis (Constantia) in Cyprus; certainly
   there is no record of any naval service. In vi. 32, where he speaks of
   the greater lights of monasticism in Palestine, Hilarion, Hesychas, and
   Epiphanius, he remarks, "At the same period in the monasteries,
   Salamines, Phuscon, Malachion, Crispion, four brethren, were highly
   distinguished." In the tart controversy between Epiphanius and the
   empress, the latter had said, "You have not power to revive the dead;
   otherwise your archdeacon would not have died." Sozomen explains, "She
   alluded to Crispion, the archdeacon, who had died a short time
   previously; he was brother to Phuscon and Salamanus, monks whom I had
   occasion to mention when detailing the history of events under the
   reign of Valens" (viii. 15). The readings in the first citation
   fluctuate between the forms Salamines and Salamanes. Since these monks
   were of the family of Alaphion, intimate friends and neighbors of the
   grandfather of Sozomen (v. 15), it might be conjectured that Salamines
   stood in some relationship with Sozomen, such as sponsor or teacher,
   and that the cognomen might have its origin from such a connection. It
   seems strange in such a case that he would not have dwelt upon the
   bond, or at least have emphasized the life of this particular brother
   by a special note; but he simply avers, "Some good men belonging to
   this family have flourished even in our own days; and in my youth I saw
   some of them, but they were then very aged." Nor in the other passages
   (vi. 32, viii. 15) is there any hint of intimacy. At the same time,
   this seems as yet the most warranted explanation of the epithet.
   Hermias was quite a common name even among Christians. It was
   originally connected with the household or local worship of Hermes, as
   the giver of an unexpected gift, or it may be as the utterance of a
   parental wish for the future success of the newcomer. Although it
   contained a heathen reminiscence, it was probably conferred in this
   case because it was ancestral. The name Sozomen itself is documentarily
   a very unusual one; and was probably bestowed upon the child by the
   father as a devout recognition of deliverance for himself and his boy,
   and in contrast with the family surname. A certain præfectus domestico,
   to whom Isidore of Pelusium addresses a letter (i. 300), was also so
   called; he must have been a cotemporary. It would be a pleasant
   surprise could he be identified with the historian; and it would not be
   at all impossible, for Evagrius, the advocate and historian, was so
   promoted (H. E. vi. 24). The biographical hints in Sozomen's surviving
   work are of the smallest; and outside tradition has preserved
   absolutely nothing. His ancestors were apparently from early times
   inhabitants of the village of Bethelia, in the territory of Gaza, and
   near to that important city. By race, they were probably of Philistine
   rather than Jewish descent; for they were pagans (Hellenists) up to the
   time of Hilarion, in the second quarter of the fourth century, and our
   historian contrasts them with the Hebrews. The family was one of
   distinction, belonging to a sort of village patricianate. That of
   Alaphion was of still greater dignity. The village of Bethelia was
   populous with a mixture of Gentiles and Jews; the former, however,
   largely predominating. Its name appears to have been derived from the
   Pantheon, erected on an artificial acropolis, and so overlooking the
   whole community, whose universalistic religious zeal was thus
   symbolized. The term Bethel was first given to the temple, and then was
   transferred to the town as Bethelia; and the use of such a form
   indicates that the prevailing dialect was a variation of Syriac or
   Aramaic. It is also spelled Bethelea (vi. 32). Hilarion was born in
   Thabatha, another village near Gaza, to the south, on a wady of the
   same name. He became a student in Alexandria, but adopted the monastic
   discipline, through the example of Antony; on returning to his home, he
   found his parents dead. He distributed his share of the patrimony to
   his family and the poor, and then withdrew to a desert by the sea,
   twenty stadia from his native village, and began his career of monastic
   activity as the founder of that ethical system in Palestine. Before his
   flight to other and distant seclusions, he came in contact with
   Alaphion, the head of a noble family in Bethelia, seemingly on very
   friendly footing with Sozomen's grandfather. Alaphion was possessed of
   a demon; neither pagan formularies nor Jewish exorcists could relieve
   him; Hilarion had but to invoke the name of Christ, and the malignant
   agent was expelled. [1043] The healed man became at once a Christian;
   the grandfather of Sozomen was won to the same profession by the care
   of his friend. The father, too, adopted the new faith; many other
   relatives joined the ranks of the believers, in this intensely pagan
   community and region; for Gaza, as the chief city, displayed a decided
   hostility to the Gospel. The grandfather was a man of native
   intelligence, and had moderate cultivation in general studies, and was
   not without some knowledge of arithmetic. His earlier social and
   intellectual position made him at once prominent among the converts,
   especially as an interpreter of the Scriptures. He won the affections
   of the Christians in Ascalon and Gaza and their outlying regions. In
   the estimation of his grandson, he was a necessary figure in the
   religious life of the Christian communities, and people carried
   doubtful points of holy writ to him for solution; yet it does not
   appear that he held any clerical function.

   While the ancestor of Sozomen was conspicuous as the religious teacher
   of Southwestern Palestine, the old Philistine region, Alaphion and his
   family were distinguished for works of a practical quality: they
   founded churches and monasteries; they were active in the relief of
   strangers and the poor; some adopted the new philosophy; and out of
   their ranks came martyrs and bishops. Sozomen says nothing of his
   father, excepting that he was originally a pagan, and therefore born
   before Hilarion's mission. The edicts of Julian caused a sudden revival
   of the old state religion, and led to many local persecutions, where
   the pagans were the stronger party: Gaza and its dependencies were of
   this number, and some of the tragedies of that unhappy time are
   recorded by our historian. The families of Alaphion and of Sozomen were
   compelled to flee, to what place is not told us; probably the
   southernmost monastic retreats: the exiles certainly returned (v. 15),
   not unlikely after the accession of Jovian. We can only guess at the
   date of Sozomen's birth, and somewhat in this wise. Hilarion's activity
   in Palestine was after the council of Nice, and before the accession of
   Julian; we may say about a.d. 345. The grandfather at his conversion
   may have been about forty, since he had become a conspicuous local
   figure; the father, in all likelihood, was but a lad when this change
   came over the domestic worship. The exile under Julian took place very
   nearly in 362, and the return in 364, when the patrician of Bethelia
   was verging on sixty, and the lad had become a young man. We may place
   the date of Sozomen's birth somewhere between 370 and 380. Hilarion
   passed away about 371: Ephraim Syrus, in 378; Gratian was emperor of
   the West; Theodosius the Great was just about to succeed Valens in the
   East. Ambrose was the most imposing ecclesiastic of the Occident;
   Gregory Nazianzen and Epiphanius were the leaders of orthodoxy in the
   Orient.

   There are but few details concerning his education. That it was
   directed by the monks is sure; in fact, the only form of Christian life
   known in that region was of the ascetic type; the very bishops and
   clerical functionaries were selected from the ranks of the practical
   philosophers. There was a succession of pious men in the line of
   Alaphion, and with the elders of the second generation, Sozomen, as a
   youth, was more or less acquainted. The names of some of them have
   already been mentioned: [1044] all had been pupils of Hilarion. The
   fourth of the brothers, Melachion by name, must have already passed
   away, and legends had speedily transfigured his memory. The influence
   of Epiphanius throughout Palestine, and particularly in its southern
   slopes and shepheloth, was dominant in shaping the quality of
   devotional thought and feeling: its force was scarcely spent when
   Sozomen was a boy.

   This accounts for the exaggerated value he puts upon the monastic
   discipline as the true philosophy, and why he desires not to appear
   ungrateful to its cultivators, in the writing of his history; for he
   purposes to keep in mind that tremendous movement, and to commemorate
   its eminent leaders under different reigns; in fact, he decides to make
   it a feature of his treatment of church life and history. There is no
   warrant, however, for stating that he himself became a monk. With all
   his admiration for their spiritual superiority, he does not lay claim
   to any direct fellowship, but rather denies his right or competency to
   invade their domain. We may be sure that he received the ordinary
   education imparted in the monastic schools of the time, approximating
   that of similar institutions near Alexandria. In a degree it was
   narrow, and growingly hostile to pagan literature; moreover, it was apt
   to be provincial, if patriotic in its tone. This will account for his
   desire to elevate the importance of Palestine over against the
   supercilious tendency which centralized all culture in Constantinople.
   The main body of his studies was conducted in the Greek language, of
   which he is no slight master; indeed, he became one of the best
   imitative stylists of his time, according to so good a judge as
   Photius. His familiarity with the Syriac and Aramaic names, the
   exactness of their transliteration, and his larger acquaintance with
   the history of the Syrian church, point to a likely knowledge of at
   least a dialect of that widely diffused speech; indeed, he could hardly
   have escaped the patois, which seems to have predominated over the
   Greek in Bethelia. In iii. 16, he allows for the loss of force and
   original grace in every translation, but states that in Ephraim's
   works, the Greek rendition made in Ephraim's own day, suffered nothing
   by the change, and he institutes such a comparison between the original
   and its version, that one is inclined to think he could read both. So
   his effort to keep a balance in writing between the central and border
   lands of the empire, and indeed outside of it, would indicate a broader
   linguistic sympathy. In vi. 34, he speaks familiarly of Syrian monks,
   who had survived to his own period; the wider range of his knowledge
   may have been due also to the practice of his profession, or to Syrian
   cases brought to Constantinople, each of which would involve a
   comprehension of the language; nor less his use of the records written
   by the Christians of Persia, Syria, and particularly Edessa, to
   preserve the story of the Persian church and its many martyrs, whose
   material he used so copiously (ii. 9-14). It is difficult to be sure of
   his proficiency in Latin; on the one hand, as an advocate it would be
   absolutely necessary for him to understand that language of
   jurisprudence; for all edicts, laws, rescripts, were written therein:
   the Theodosian code itself was so compiled in his own day. On the other
   hand, where he quotes Latin documents, he invariably does it from
   translations into Greek made by other hands; thus in iii. 2, of
   Constantine's letter to the Alexandrians, he says, "I have met with a
   copy translated from the Latin into the Greek; I shall insert it
   precisely as I find it." So in iv. 18, the letter of the Synod of
   Ariminum to Constantius; and in viii. 26, the two epistles of Innocent.
   Probably his second-hand report about Hilary of Pictavium, v. 13, leans
   the same way. But on the whole we must allow his profession, which
   necessitated a knowledge of the law language, to outweigh the lack of
   original versions in his book.

   It is difficult to judge from a solitary work what the degree of an
   author's general culture is. Clemens Alexandrinus has multitudinous
   quotations; it would be easy to conclude that he was a scholar of
   universal reading, and a genuine polyhistor; but their inaccuracy and
   frequent infelicity make them rather appear as the excerpts from some
   florilegium or some rhetorical hand-book. The classical allusions in
   Sozomen are not very many; and he might well have considered it out of
   place to indulge in overmuch reference in such a record as he presents;
   the quality of what appears would not compel a wide range of reading;
   the dedication is most fertile in familiar illustrations, poetical,
   historical, and mythological. In i. 6, because of his mentioning
   Aquilis, he drags the Argonauts in by the ears, hardly from Pisander,
   but rather from Zosimus, who does the same in mentioning the progress
   of Alaric. [1045] When he describes Constantine's tentative search for
   a favorable site on which to rear his new capital, the mention of the
   plain of Ilium moves the historian to relate a little tradition about
   the Trojan town (ii. 3). He mentions Aristotle, in whose philosophy
   Aëtius was versed (iii. 15); and to whose dialectic work Theophronius
   composed an introduction (vii. 17). When he dwells on the imitative
   literature produced by Apolinarius, he alludes indirectly to the
   Homeric poems, and mentions outright his writing "comedies in imitation
   of Menander, tragedies resembling those of Euripides, and odes on the
   model of Pindar" (v. 18). In narrating the history of Daphne under
   Julian (v. 19), he gives the myth of Apollo and Daphne. Such hints and
   others are no proof or disproof of any extensive reading, and yet the
   way in which he alludes to some is more after a cyclopædic fashion than
   any profound study of the authors themselves. In fact, his confession
   in the instance of the Apollo and Daphne myth is naive, "I leave this
   subject to those who are more accurately acquainted with mythology."
   This acknowledgment is not born of any puritanic hesitancy,--for he had
   ventured into the sensual bog a little way already,--but is rather a
   genuine declaration of his ignorance, and that in the capital where
   Anthemius and Synesius were authorities. Probably we have a little
   light in the limitations and illiberality of his early training, by
   recalling his attitude toward the imitative writings of Apolinarius,
   which sprang up to countervail the Julian edict, which the Christians
   interpreted as a prohibition to their enjoyment of the Hellenic
   culture. While Socrates whole-souledly and forcibly advocates the
   humanizing effect of the ancient literature (iii. 16), Sozomen says,
   "Were it not for the extreme partiality with which the productions of
   antiquity are regarded, I doubt not but that the writings of
   Apolinarius would be held in as much estimation as those of the
   ancients," and he rather sides with the monks in their contempt for
   classic studies (i. 12). He does not wholly commit himself; he is a bit
   hesitant,--a characteristic of his make-up. This was an absorbing
   question in that and previous days, as it has continued to agitate the
   church, more or less, until our own time. In his time the influence of
   the monks and the clergy, who were pervaded with the ascetic spirit,
   was more and more against the humanities; the court fluctuated, while
   the training of the Valentinian and Theodosian succession had been
   decidedly monastic, and its sympathies were mainly with the intolerant
   tendency, the necessities of their position, and the splendid and
   overshadowing political abilities of men like Libanius, Themistius,
   Anthemius, Troïlus, could not be set aside. Some of them, too, had
   proved themselves to be the saviours and uplifters of the state. The
   learning and grace of Eudocia, the empress, the spirit of her early
   training as the daughter of an Athenian philosopher, and her own poetic
   gifts, were persuasive agents in sustaining a classical survival among
   the Christians at the court, before she fell under the blight of her
   husband's jealousy. Cyrus, the restorer of Constantinople, filled his
   verses with the same antique flavor. The clergy, whose preliminary
   training had been in the schools of the sophists, or at the
   Universities, could not wholly bury their sympathy, although they went
   through casuistic struggles such as that of Jerome. The Arians, too,
   were frequently of a larger culture, and on the Germanic side, of
   signal military skill and political sagacity, whose services the state
   could not dispense with. The University which even the monastically
   drilled Theodosius the Younger organized in Constantinople, while
   seeking to give a Christian tone to the higher education, previously
   controlled by Athens, made very liberal provision for the languages, if
   not so much for philosophy. Sozomen, as we see, inclined to a less
   generous view, and thought Apolinarius had such a universal genius,
   that his numerous originals might be dispensed with; Homer, Menander,
   Euripides, Pindar, but for an affectation, need not have been missed.
   This shows the thin quality of his reading, if not the restricted
   quantity of it, and lays bare the impotence of his critical faculty.
   These limitations were doubtless due in large measure to the shrunken
   ideals of his Palestinian education: it savored of Epiphanius' temper
   and impress.

   His education on the religious side was in the Nicene faith as
   professed by the Catholic Church in the East, to which the monks
   remained, not always thoughtfully faithful, in all that stormy period.
   As Sozomen says, the people were unable to follow the refinements of
   theological discussion, and took their cue from those whose lives
   seemed better than that of the ordinary clergy. He had, however, no
   close drill in the arguments pro and con, judging from his own
   declarations of inability to follow the various aspects of Arian
   discussion. After citing the letter of Gregory Nazianzen to Nectarius,
   in which the distinctive features of the heresy of Apolinarius are
   given, he supplements: "What I have said, may, I think, suffice to show
   the nature of the sentiments maintained by Apolinarius and Eunomius. If
   any one desire more detailed information, I can only refer him to the
   works on the subject, written either by them or by others, concerning
   these men. I do not profess easily to understand or to expound these
   matters" (epei emoi oute sunienai ta toiauta, oute metaphrazein
   eupetes, vi. 27). And when he enumerates the causes of rupture among
   the Eunomians, "I should be prolix were I to enter into further
   particulars; and indeed the subject would be by no means an easy one to
   me, since I have no such dialectic skill" (epei mede empeiros echo ton
   toiouton dialexeon, vii. 17). It would seem, then, that his logical
   training had not been of a very deep quality, and yet it must be said
   that such definitions and arguments as he does state in the history of
   controversy are orderly and lucid. Metaphysics also seems to have had
   no large place in his earlier studies; but he certainly did become
   familiar with its later theological terms and distinctions, and he
   draws a clear line between the various contestants who warred for and
   against consubstantiality. His reading also covered some philosophical
   speculations, as one gathers from a sentence in v. 6, "For it is not
   true, as some assert, that as is the body, so is the soul." He probably
   also early learned to distinguish between ontology and ethics, by the
   practical lines drawn between the clerical disputant and the monastic
   philosopher. A sentence in his history of Meletius, bishop of Antioch
   (iv. 28), emphasizes this difference as we seldom find it in early
   Christian literature: "In his first discourse he confines himself to
   instructing the people in what we call ethics (tous kaloumenous
   ethikous logous), and then openly declared the Son to be of the same
   substance as the Father."

   His spirit was taught to enslave itself with legalistic fetters, and
   where he does rise above them, it is with trembling misgivings; he had
   a side for larger things, like Socrates, due probably to his
   profession, but he was afraid to venture quite so far, and yet he is
   magnanimous as compared with the better educated and clerical
   Theodoret.

   To those early school years we must also attribute his statement, that
   he was a witness to the fidelity of Zeno, bishop of Majuma, the seaport
   of Gaza. "It is said, and I myself am witness of the truth of the
   assertion, that when he was bishop of the church in Majuma, he was
   never absent at morning or evening hymns, or any other worship of God,
   unless attacked by some malady; and yet he was at this period an old
   man, being nearly a hundred years of age" (vii. 28). The patriarch's
   self-support and industry were in like manner the object of his
   youthful admiration. The struggle of the bishop of Gaza to assert his
   jurisdiction over Majuma, the seaport which had its own episcopate, and
   desired to retain its ecclesiastical autonomy, after it had lost its
   civil independence, Sozomen speaks of as happening in his day, and was
   one of the news of his youth; and one catches in his statement an inner
   satisfaction with the decision of the council which recognized the
   freedom of the Christian community by the sea (v. 3). In connection
   with public worship, he had very likely heard in those earlier days the
   reading of the Apocalypse of Peter. He says in vii. 19, "Thus the book
   entitled the Apocalypse of Peter, which was considered altogether
   spurious by the ancients, is still read in some of the churches of
   Palestine, on the day of preparation, when the people observe a fast in
   memory of the passion of the Saviour." And a favorite book he saw in
   the hands of the monks of his native land, was the Apocalypse of Paul,
   "although unrecognized by the ancients" (vii. 19). A familiarity with
   such books gives a key to his later attitude toward prophecy.

   There is no evidence as to what persuaded him to study law, nor do we
   know when he was enrolled as a student. The fact that he mentions the
   school of Berytus as the place where Bishop Triphyllius had prosecuted
   jurisprudence for so long a while (i. 11) can hardly be taken as a
   suggestion of Sozomen's own residence there. It would have been more
   likely for him to have attended lectures at the University of
   Alexandria or Antioch, with which cities he shows a considerable
   acquaintance. His studies were probably based on the Codex Gregorianus,
   with its supplement, the Codex Hermogenianus; for it was in his own
   day, and during the writing of his history, that the Codex Theodosianus
   was begun, and one is sorry to miss his name from the list of its
   compilers; and it was not until a.d. 439, that it was proclaimed as the
   text-book of imperial law. That he was admitted to the practice of that
   profession, we have direct evidence, as in the case of Evagrius, (H. E.
   vi. 7) while as to Socrates, it is simply an uncertified tradition.
   Sozomen speaks of his afflicted friend Aquilinus (ii. 3), "who is even
   at the present time residing with us, and is an advocate in the same
   courts of justice as that to which we belong." From the tenor of the
   legal notices in his history it is likely that he practiced in the
   episcopal courts as well; for these had assumed form, and the function
   of an advocate is regulated in several synodical canons. He is more
   careful and systematic in stating the course of important legislation
   with regard to religion and the Church, than any other historian. Thus
   under Constantine, i. 3, 5, 8, 9, 21, 23, ii. 32; under Constantius,
   iii. 17, iv. 15; under Julian, v. 5, 15, 17; under Jovian, vi. 3;
   Valens, vi. 12, 19; Gratian, vii. 1; Gratian and Theodosius, vii. 4;
   under Theodosius, vii. 9, 12, 16, 20, 25, viii. 4; Valentinian, ii.
   (Justina), vii. 13; Arcadius, viii. 7, 24. There is no instance of his
   own practice such as Evagrius gives (H. E. vi. 7).

   We can only guess at the time of his settlement in Constantinople. One
   would judge from his narrative, that he was not there during the riots
   excited by the deposition of Chrysostom, a.d. 404. He may have arrived
   a little after the elevation of Atticus to the see, as successor to
   Arsacius, who had followed John, somewhere about 406, a year before the
   death of the orator, and two years before the decease of the Emperor
   Arcadius. Under the sage Anthemius, he was finding his way in his
   profession. Under Pulcheria, one is inclined to suppose that he
   obtained some recognition. The capital thereafter remained the center
   of his practice, and he appears to be still in connection with the
   dikasteries while he is writing the second book of his history (ii. 3).
   There are a few personal points in his life at the imperial city which
   he hints at. Thirty five stadia overland from the city, toward the
   Pontus, was Hestiæ; owing to an appearance of the Archangel Michael, a
   temple was built there, and, as a consequence, called Michaelium. It
   became noted for its curative properties, both for physical and mental
   disorders. Sozomen himself had been afflicted, how, he does not tell
   us,--whether by reverses, or dangers, or disease, or other
   suffering,--but he resorted thither and testifies to the benefit he
   received (ii. 3). There is another personal incident which he records
   in ix. 2. He was a spectator of the splendid ceremonials connected with
   the discovery and transfer of the remains of the Forty Martyrs: he saw
   the costly caskets, the festival, and the procession; he heard the
   music of the commemorative odes, and beheld the deposit of the relics
   by the body of St. Thyrsus. A number of other spectators whom he knew
   were there, the greater part of whom were living at the writing of his
   record. This celebration took place much later, under the episcopate of
   Proclus; therefore after the year 434. A final personal hint is given
   in his statements of the overthrow of Uldis. Concerning the remnant of
   the Sciri, who as a result of that campaign were scattered as slaves
   over Asia Minor, he remarks, "I have seen many in Bithynia, near Mt.
   Olympus, living apart from one another, and cultivating the hills and
   valleys of that region" (ix. 5). As to the nature of this tour, we know
   nothing. He must have been active in many of the later ecclesiastical
   and secular matters which he narrates, for the first endeavor of his
   history is to mention the affairs in which he was concerned (memnesomai
   de pragmaton hois paretuchon, i. I). We can only deplore that he makes
   no sign, in the unfolding story, possibly some might have been
   indicated had he completed his ninth book.

   The influential circles of the Eastern and Western capital were divided
   into parties on a variety of themes. One such, on the lines of culture,
   we have already considered. A second and very decisive one, was the
   question whether the foreigners, especially the Goths and the Persians,
   should be admitted into the service of the state. The stronger body
   believed in the use and incorporation of these new elements. What
   before was a variable matter, became a fixed policy under Theodosius
   the Great, and in all directions. His weak sons were controlled by both
   factions alternately. Anthemius, Pulcheria, and Theodosius II. adhered
   in the main to the liberal view. Yet the presence of a cry, Rome for
   the Romans, could overthrow such a man as Stilicho, and elevate such a
   weakling as Olympius. Sozomen, from his handling of the events, allied
   himself with the illiberal cabal; and while he sought room for a
   representation of foreign Christianity in his book, nevertheless
   opposed the intrusion of at least the northern element into the offices
   of the empire.

   There was a third line of cleavage among the people and the court. A
   very strong and persistent faction set itself against the admission of
   pagans and Arians into political position. These two, dying elements
   often combined to save themselves from extinction. The court itself
   fluctuated, because the Germanic politicians were mostly Arian, and the
   best scholars of political science were pagans. Exigencies compelled
   the recognition of masters like Anthemius and Troïlus. Sozomen threw in
   his lot with the narrower clique. He does not condescend to mention the
   best statesman of his time, or the wisest political thinker. Socrates
   does, and with admiration. The portrayal of Alaric is from the estimate
   of him as a leader in whom the hopes of pagans and Arians revived.
   Gaïnas is traduced, because he was the rallying-point of expiring
   Arianism in the East.

   Sozomen, as we have seen, sided also with the majority in honoring the
   monastic life, which was bitterly opposed by many politicians and
   ecclesiastics. Naturally, therefore, he regarded life from a more
   pietistic standpoint, than did the court under the leadership either of
   Eudoxia or Eudocia. He responded to the puritanism of Chrysostom and
   Pulcheria.

   He is a defender of Chrysostom, and answers such criticisms as Socrates
   has made. We can scarcely doubt that his heart was with the Johnites,
   although he may not have entered their separatist communion.

   We can gather from intimations in his history that Sozomen had traveled
   somewhat. He shows a better knowledge of Palestine, than even
   Epiphanius; he must have kept up his connection with his native land to
   have been so well informed as to its traditions, places, and customs.
   Naturally the greater part of this interest centers in Gaza and its
   neighborhood, as his old home. In ii. 1, 2, his story of the invention
   of the Cross and the holy buildings erected by Helena, improves on the
   original, by local detail and color. In ii. 4, he enlarges upon the
   Eusebian account of Constantine's purgation of Mamre or Terebinthus, as
   one familiar with the spot and with its fair. In ii. 5, he gives a bit
   of history of Gaza and Majuma under Constantine. In ii. 20, he narrates
   the election of Maximus as bishop of Jerusalem, from a source which no
   one else has used. In iii. 14, his biographical notices of Hilarion,
   Hesychas, and others, indicate an exact topographical knowledge. The
   Julian edict gives occasion to state the dissensions between Gaza and
   its seaport (vii. 3). Quite graphic is the martyrology of Gaza and its
   vicinity, given in v. 9. In discussing Julian's outrage on the image of
   Christ at Paneas (v. 27), and the miraculous well at Nicopolis,
   formerly Emmaus, we see signs of local acquaintanceship. In v. 22,
   Julian is said to write to the patriarchs, and rulers, and people,
   asking for their prayers for himself and his empire; here is a distinct
   reference to the then existing patriarchate; so all the details of the
   attempted restoration betray a well-informed hand, as well as state the
   fact of direct communication with the witnesses of the phenomena. The
   biographies in vi. 32 are bound up with Southern Palestine, and
   particularly with Bethelia and Gerar. Similarities in vii. 28, of those
   more closely related to him, easily prove that he was near home. In
   viii. 13, Scythopolis is selected by the fugitive Egyptian monks,
   because its many palms afforded them their customary means of
   support,--a circumstance narrated by no one else. Nor are local hints
   wanting in the story of the finding of Zachariah's body (ix. 17), with
   its legends. There is in one sense a disproportionate mention of
   Palestine, and designedly, not only from patriotic motives, but from a
   desire to vindicate its historic position in the development of Church
   history, and to rebuke the prevailing tendency of churchmen and
   historians to press it into the background. It is a curious
   juxtaposition, that the councils of Chalcedon should so soon after have
   vindicated the primacy of Jerusalem. There is also a better
   acquaintance with the facts and purposes of Jewish history, the
   relation of Judaism to Christianity (i. 1); the genesis of the
   Saracens, and their association with the covenant people (vi. 38); the
   regulations of the paschal season, especially in vii. 18; as well as a
   greater accuracy in the transliteration of names of places.

   It was no inconsiderable journey from Gaza to his school, and from his
   school to Constantinople. The hints concerning Palestine, already
   mentioned, indicate personal observation. Beyond these we have
   suggestions that may look to his having been in Arabia and Cyprus, as,
   when he speaks (vii. 19) of knowing the custom in both places, to have
   a chorepiscopus at the head of a local church. So, too, in Alexandria,
   he was struck with the strange position of the bishop in not rising
   when the Gospels were read, something he had never known or heard of in
   other communities,--words which point to familiarity with that city.
   One would be glad to think of his having visited Tarsus, since he was
   acquainted with Cilix, a presbyter of that city, whom he consulted
   about the origin of the Apocalypse of Paul (vii. 19). That he knew
   Bithynia from the sight of it, we have already seen (ix. 5). He
   describes or alludes to architectural or topographic features of
   Alexandria, Antioch, and possibly Edessa, in a way that scarcely leaves
   a doubt of his having seen those cities; we may suppose that his
   clientelage would compel journeys to and fro.

   His work abounds with allusions to structures and regions of
   Constantinople, to say nothing of its vicinity. The general description
   of the building of the city by Constantine (ii. 3) already gives some
   of its principal features. Of the churches, he mentions the first of
   those dedicated to the Archangel St. Michael (ii. 3), at some remove
   from the city (Hestiæ, Michaelium), and to be distinguished from a
   later structure on the opposite shore, and one in the city, erected to
   the same patron angel; [1046] --the church of the Apostles, which
   became the place of sepulture for emperors and even bishops (ii. 34,
   iv. 21, viii. 10);--the church of Acacius the martyr (iv. 21), to which
   Macedonius endeavored to remove the coffin of Constantine;--the church
   of Sophia (iv. 26), begun by Constantine, and dedicated under
   Constantius,--with which was connected a baptistery (viii. 21); this
   great edifice was burned in the tumult which arose after the second
   exile of Chrysostom was announced (viii. 22);--the house of prayer
   begun by Chrysostom and completed by Sisinnius, containing the tomb of
   the martyred Notaries; this was outside the walls, in a spot previously
   devoted to the execution of criminals, and an object of dread, because
   of frequenting ghosts (iv. 3);--the church of the Novatians, situated
   in a part of the city called Pelargum; this was taken down by them and
   transferred to a suburb named Sycæ, hence the edifice was entitled
   Anastasia; it was restored to its original spot under Julian (iv.
   20);--the little dwelling which was converted into a house of prayer
   for Gregory Nazianzen, and so became a church, also called Anastasia
   (vii. 5);--the church reared by Macedonius, which received the name of
   Paul, bishop of Constantinople, when Theodosius removed the confessor's
   body to that building; it is described as a spacious and distinguished
   temple (vii. 10); when Theodosius the Great conveyed the head of John
   the Baptist to Hebdomas, in the suburbs, where was the seventh
   milestone, he erected on that site a spacious and magnificent temple,
   which became a center of imperial devotion and miraculous cures (vii.
   21, 24, viii. 4, 14);--the church reared in honor of St. Stephen, the
   proto-martyr (viii. 24);--the church dedicated to the memory of St.
   Mocus the Martyr, where Dioscorus was buried (viii. 17);--the place
   where the body of Thyrsus the Martyr reposed, and whither the relics of
   the forty soldiers were transferred (ix. 2); this was a temple,
   according to Procopius. [1047] In Chalcedon, he mentions the church of
   St. Euphemia, so glowingly described by Evagrius, and that of SS. Peter
   and Paul in the Oak (Ruffinum).

   While he speaks of the number of monks and nuns, in and about
   Constantinople (iv. 2, viii. 9), and alludes in a general way to their
   dwellings (iv. 20), he mentions no particular establishment except that
   founded by Marathonius, which stood in Sozomen's time. He also refers
   to the Xenodochia, the Nosocomia, the Cherotrophia, and the
   Ptochotrophia (iv. 20, 27, viii. 9), but he does not specialize, not
   even concerning the group of institutions founded and endowed by
   Pulcheria (ix. 8). There were residences for the bishops and clergy,
   but these are only hinted at (vii. 14, viii. 14). The palaces and the
   forums are mentioned only in a general way, but the splendid council
   chamber (megistos oikos tes sunkletou boules), which was burned with
   the Sophia, is described as south of that edifice. He refers to the
   Hippodrome in the third region, with a little description of its early
   form and place (vi. 39, viii. 21). Certain of the eight public baths
   are mentioned, the commodious thermæ called after Zeuxippus (iii. 9) is
   set forth as a conspicuous and large structure, and the palace as
   adjoining it near the sea-side. This was in the second region. He
   speaks correctly of baths bearing the names of Anastasia and Carosa,
   daughters of Valens, standing in his own time (vi. 9). The baths of
   Constantius are characterized as very spacious when he tells us how the
   followers of John resorted thither for the paschal feast (viii. 21).

   We have some brief notices of a few friends outside the earlier circles
   in Bethelia and Gaza. By the advice of some pious acquaintances, who
   were versed in the mysteries, he decided not to publish the Nicene
   symbol (i. 20). Among those who experienced relief at the Michaelium,
   was a fellow-advocate, Aquilinus; the story of his cure is told us from
   Sozomen's own observation, and from the statements made by his
   colleague (ii. 3). He was on good terms with Cilix, the venerable
   presbyter of Tarsus (vii. 19). He had a friend or friends, who were
   cognizant of affairs under Theophilus (viii. 12); and similarly with
   some who had been intimate with Chrysostom (viii. 9). It is not
   unlikely that he knew Nicarete in her old age, a lady of Bithynia
   remarkable for her sacrificial life, whose memory is preserved by him
   alone (viii. 23). The facts which he brings to light concerning
   Pulcheria, and the submission of his work to the younger Theodosius,
   shows that he was received graciously by both.

   Part II.--Sozomen as Author.

   When seized with a desire to write history, Sozomen says: "I at first
   felt strongly inclined to trace the course of events from the very
   commencement, but on reflecting that similar records of the past, up to
   their own time, had been compiled by those wisest of men, Clemens and
   Hegesippus, successors of the Apostles, by Africanus, the historian,
   and by Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, a man intimately acquainted with
   Sacred Scriptures and the writings of the Greek poets and historians, I
   merely drew up an epitome in two books, of all that is recorded to have
   happened to the churches, from the ascension of Christ to the
   deposition of Licinius." This work is unfortunately lost. It was not a
   simple chronicle, but an abbreviated account of these events; the
   abridgment was probably from the authors mentioned above. The habit of
   succinct narration is quite in his later vein. He doubtless commingled
   secular with the sacred detail. It may be suggestingly asked, whether
   his words in ix. 1 do not give a hint of another work: "But I willingly
   for awhile pass over the many separate manifestations of divine favor,
   that were granted to the sister of the emperor, as proofs that she was
   loved of God, lest anybody should blame me, for having set out to do
   other things, and yet had turned to the use of encomiums." This sudden
   arrest could not be owing to an intended resumption of such matters at
   a later portion of the history; for the method was already regarded as
   irrelevant, and the very reason for citing no more in that vein; is it
   not likely that he at least purposed an encomium of Pulcheria?

   The attempt of Hieronymus, Wolf, Lambec, and Fenzel to ascribe Hermias'
   Diasurmos ton exo philosophon (Irrisio gentilium philosophorum) to
   Sozomen, because of identity of name, is now held by none. [1048] The
   work by which we know him, is the Ecclesiastical History in nine Books.
   When did he write it? In trying to determine the time of its
   production, let us look at the data suggested in his work.

   (1) In the dedication, the delineation of the emperor's culture and
   character discloses a man of fixity and repose; these qualities could
   not be ascribed to the time of his imperial majority, in his fifteenth
   year, nor to the time of his marriage (421); they are rather the
   features of settled experience; hence we would expect in general a
   period nearer the end of his reign, than one in the beginning or
   middle; certainly somewhere beyond his thirtieth year, and therefore
   beyond a.d. 438.

   (2) Sozomen says that poets and authors, even those of prefectural
   dignity, as well as other subjects, celebrated the emperor. The usual
   literary incense was burned. Olympiodorus dedicated his history to him.
   Socrates was magniloquent; and more particularly did Cyrus, the friend
   of Eudocia, who attained the highest offices of the state from 439-441,
   write epigrams in praise of his monarch. [1049] This would make a date
   after 441. [1050]

   (3) In illustration of the practiced self-control of his sovereign, he
   narrates an incident of the royal journey in the summer heat, through
   Bithynia, to the fallen city of Heraclea, in Pontus, [1051] with the
   view of restoring it. This journey took place in June of a.d. 443.
   [1052] This incident is introduced with proen, which would place the
   writing quite definitely as not very soon after June 443.

   (4) The reign of Theodosius is described as above all others bloodless
   and pure from slaughter. This could only be moderately just, before the
   judicial murders connected with the jealous fits of Theodosius, from
   442 on, and the united movement of outlying nations upon the East and
   West, as projected by the political sagacity of Attila.

   (5) The professed terminus of his history is the seventeenth consulate
   of Theodosius: this was the year 439; hence the whole work was written
   after that time.

   (6) The prayer at the conclusion of the proëmium may have in it a point
   of light; he hopes that through the favor of Christ, the imperium may
   be transmitted to Theodosius' sons and grandsons. The only child born
   to Eudocia was a daughter, Eudoxia, who was married to Valentinian III.
   It was because of the lack of succession, that Pulcheria married
   General Marcianus. Eudocia withdrew from the court somewhere between
   441-443, but that would not have had to impede the succession, had
   Theodosius chosen to be divorced; and this prayer rather intimates the
   desirability of another marriage. This, therefore, must have been
   written before the hope of sons was removed; certainly, therefore,
   before the closing years of the emperor's reign.

   (7) In Book ix, Pulcheria's inclination to virginity is spoken of as
   expressed in the most solemn way, and with the consecrated gift of a
   table to signalize it. There is no hint in the work of the marriage
   with Marcian, suggested by Theodosius on his death-bed, and carried out
   after his demise. This would indicate that the work was completed
   before 450.

   (8) In ix. 1, he affirms: "That new heresies have not prevailed in our
   times, we shall find to be due especially to her, as we shall
   subsequently see." The heresies are those connected with Nestorianism,
   428-444, and possibly the return of the Johannists to full communion by
   the triumphal restoration of Chrysostom's remains in 438; these were to
   fall within the limits of his work. The Eutychean heresy in its first
   stage was hostile to Pulcheria's views, while its overthrow was not
   effected until a year after the death of Theodosius. The close of the
   Nestorian controversy through the compromise was in 444, and that date
   would suit well with the fact of mastering the heresy at the very time
   he was writing this account of Pulcheria.

   (9) In ix. 2, he recounts the transfer of the forty martyrs, after a
   public festival had been appropriately celebrated with fitting honor
   and pomp, with psalms, "at which I myself was present; and others who
   were present can also bear testimony that these things were done in the
   way described, for almost all of them still survive. And the event
   occurred much later, when Proclus governed the church of
   Constantinople." Proclus was elected 434, and continued in office until
   his death in 447. This transfer must have taken place before 439, the
   proposed terminus of the history, and very likely a little while after
   the accession of this long-tried candidate. The time of the writing was
   at some considerable remove from the event itself, because of his
   appeal to the survivors as witnesses to the truth of his portrayal, and
   yet not so far, but that the most of the participants and spectators
   could still be appealed to. This would correspond very well with the
   date connected with 443, suggested by the incident in Bithynia, if we
   allow some interval between the writing of the dedication and Book ix.

   (10) In ix. 6, the overthrow of Uldis, 406, is narrated. The settlement
   of the conquered Sciri as slaves and colonists is enlarged upon.
   Sozomen himself saw these imperial farmers at their tilling in
   Bithynia. This may connect itself, possibly, as to the time of the
   year, and place, with the emperor's progress to Heraclea Pontica. There
   is evidently an interval between the capture of the Sciri, and their
   settled work as colonists, when Sozomen visited that region, and
   between that visit and the writing of the fact. If it corresponded with
   the imperial progress, it would of course be 443. Taking all these
   points together, it would seem that the work was begun about the latter
   part of 443; and that the dedication was written first, because that
   states the plan of the whole work, including the ninth book, whose
   record does not meet the intention, there expressed; moreover, some of
   the events in Book ix. indicate a considerable interval between the
   fact and the account of it. When he finished what he wrote, it is not
   so easy to tell; it would certainly take him a few years, and the end
   was reached before any considerable outbreak of the Eutychean heresy;
   therefore probably in 447, or 448, for the reason that Pulcheria did
   not conquer that heresy until after her marriage with Marcian; this
   date is supported by the fact that the breaking of her vow was unknown
   to the writer of ix. 1, 3; also because the Emperor Theodosius was
   still alive. The work was the fruit and employment of old age; the
   style is certainly that of an elderly man, and not that of youth or
   early maturity.

   What were the main objects he had in view in his history?

   1. He desired to present the truth with regard to the facts and their
   results. In i. 1, he affirms: "I will readily transcribe fully from any
   work that may tend to the elucidation of truth." "Still, as it is
   requisite, in order to maintain historical accuracy, to pay the
   strictest attention to the means of eliciting truth, I felt myself
   bound to examine all writings of this class, according to my ability."
   This is his professed purpose; however subjective or churchly his view
   of truth may be, we must give him the credit for the intention. In i.
   1, he appeals to his readers in this wise: "Let not an impertinent or
   malignant spirit be imputed to me, for having dwelt upon the disputes
   of ecclesiastics among themselves, concerning the primacy and
   pre-eminence of their own heresy. In the first place, as I have already
   said, a historian ought to regard everything as secondary in importance
   to truth." And we shall see evidences of his fairness.

   2. His history is designed to be a demonstration of Christianity as
   from God. The vastness of the change wrought by God in the introduction
   and success of Christianity and the insignificant and mythical themes
   upon which literature had been wont to exercise itself, prompted him,
   with his confessed inefficiency, to undertake this line of evidence, in
   the conviction that God would help his believing incapacity. Hence his
   work is a record of immediate divine interventions, and extraordinary
   gifts of the Holy Spirit; it abounds in visions, miracles, and
   prophecy. The celestial agents visibly direct affairs; the flow of
   vaticination does not cease; the power to reverse the expected order of
   events is not suspended. Thus, as to epiphanies of divine, angelic, or
   sainted beings: In i. 3, is recounted the appearance of the cross unto
   Constantine; and in the night during sleep, the manifestation of Christ
   with a cross, and the instructions given to the emperor. In ii. 1, we
   have a series of divine interpositions to discover the true cross, and
   Sozomen remarks in refutation of one explanation, "I do not think that
   human information is requisite, when God thinks it best to make
   manifest the same." In ii. 3, the old name, Hestiæ, is changed to
   Michaelium, because of the reported appearance of the archangel there.
   The monks are favored with such direct counselors; Pachomius obeys an
   angel, who directs him to assemble young men for instruction; "he was
   frequently admitted to intercourse with the holy angels." Apollonius
   yielded to direct divine advice, and withdrew from the desert to a
   populous region. The cross reappeared in the days of Constantius (iv.
   5); Julian's life is filled with portents (v. 1, 20, 22; vi. 2). A
   curious bit of speculation occurs in vi. 2; in interpreting Julian's
   alleged use of his blood, he says: "I know not whether the approach of
   death, as is wont to be the case, when the soul is in the act of being
   separated from the body, and when it is enabled to behold diviner
   spectacles than is allotted to men, that Julian might then have beheld
   Christ. Few allusions have been made to this subject; and yet I dare
   not reject this hypothesis as absolutely false, for God often suffers
   still more improbable and astonishing events to take place, in order to
   prove that the religion named after Christ is not sustained by human
   energy." Of Theodore's confession (v. 20) he remarks: "It is said that
   he was afterwards asked whether he had been sensible of any pain on the
   rack; and that he replied he had not been entirely free from suffering,
   but had his pain assuaged by the attentions of a young man who had
   stood by him, and had wiped off the perspiration with the finest linen
   cloth, and supplied him with coolest water, by which he eased the
   inflammation and refreshed his labors. I am convinced that no man,
   whatever magnanimity he may possess, is capable without the special
   assistance of divine Power, of manifesting such entire indifference
   about the body." In vi. 29, Piammon sees an angel standing near the
   holy table, and writing down in a book the names of the monks who were
   present, while he erased the names of those who were absent. Mark had
   the elements of the holy table administered to him by an angel (vii.
   29). Malachion, while journeying with his brothers, was made invisible,
   and then reappeared, and pursued his way with them (vi. 32). So the
   portent at Hebdomas was a sign of divine favor to Theodosius the Great
   (vii. 24); the heavenly hosts were the real overthrowers of Gaïnas
   (viii. 4); Basiliscus the martyr appears to Chrysostom (viii. 28).
   Pulcheria's celestial directors helps her to find the forty martyrs
   (ix. 2). The appearance of Zechariah to the serf pointed out the way to
   the discovery of the prophet's remains (ix. 17). The demoniacal
   agencies are equally operant, some of which are alluded to in the above
   passages, but readily yield to prayer and exorcism, if not immediately
   overthrown by God.

   For a demonstration of the same truth, miracles are wrought to effect
   physical cures, mental troubles, threatened dangers, casting out of
   demons, silencing philosophers and wordy ecclesiastics, vindicating
   orthodoxy, reading the thoughts of hypocrites defeating enemies,
   sanctifying the sacraments' raising the dead; and they are the mighty
   agents for converting philosophers, Jews, pagans, and heretics. They
   are wrought by the hands of the eminently excellent only; the gift is
   associated with a high measure of grace; for example the bishops
   Paphnutius (i. 10) and Spyridion (i. 11) are so endowed; Alexander of
   Constantinople (i. 14), Eusebius of Emesa (iii. 6), Martin of Tours
   (iii. 14), Arsacius of Nicomedia (iv. 16), Donatus (vii. 26), Gregory
   of Neocæsarea (vii. 26), Theotimus of Scythia (vii. 26), Epiphanius of
   Salamis (vii. 27). In like manner, the monks Antony (i. 13), Amun (i.
   14), Eutychianus (i. 14), Macarius the Egyptian, Apollonius, Hilarion,
   Julian (iii. 14), John, Copres, Helles, Apelles, Eulogius (vi. 28);
   Apollos, John of Diolchus, Benjamin and Pior (vi. 29). The united
   prayer of a congregation could effect them (vii. 5). The statue of
   Christ at Paneas, the fountain at Emmaus, the tree at Hermopolis (v.
   21), were all miraculous centers. The spot where the Archangel Michael
   appeared (ii. 3), the places where the head of John the Baptist reposed
   (vii. 21), the tombs of monks, martyrs, and bishops,--as of Hilarion
   (iii. 14), Martyrius and Marcianus (iv. 3), Epiphanius (vii. 27),--were
   replete with restorative virtues. Sozomen had such a miracle wrought
   upon himself; he believed thoroughly in an uninterrupted stream of
   charismata; he deemed it necessary for the maintenance of the faith. He
   was no more credulous than Socrates, or Theodoret, or Evagrius, or
   Theodore. To criticise him for his belief in this respect is to forget
   the Christian consciousness of the age. And the historic school which
   seeks to eliminate the volume of testimony, in the assumption that
   miracles do not fall within the province of history, ignores the first
   law of that science, which requires the reproduction of all facts, in
   time and place, whatever they may be, that are affiliated with the
   evolution of the human will; that other older school which dismisses
   all ecclesiastical miracles on the a prioriassumption that these
   energies ceased at a time co-ordinate with the death of the Apostles,
   or at a point not far removed from their age, violates the spirit of
   induction. These miracles must be tested by evidence, and the laws of
   supernatural energy, and in no other way. To Sozomen and all his
   contemporaries the miracle appeared essential both to the proof of the
   divine origin of Christianity, and to offset and withstand the
   influence of the theurgic arts of the philosophers, such as Julianus
   and many of the Neoplatonists. As he remarks concerning the reply made
   by Alexander, bishop of Constantinople, when he silenced the
   philosopher by the simple authority of Christ, "It is then right to
   consider whether it is a greater miracle, that a man, and he a
   philosopher, should so easily be silenced by a word, or that a stone
   wall should be cleft by the power of a word, which miracle I have heard
   some attribute with pride to Julian, surnamed the Chaldean" (i. 18).
   The gift of prophecy is also represented as sustained throughout this
   period, and with the same logical aims in view. The monks are
   especially thus endowed: Antony (i. 13, vi. 5, 6), the two Macarii,
   Pachomius (iii. 14), Arsacius (iv. 16), John (vi. 28, vii. 22, vii.
   28), Theon (vi. 28), Isaac (vi. 40); so the bishops Athanasius (iv.
   10), Chrysostom and Epiphanius, rather abusively (viii. 15); so royal
   persons, such as the wife of Valens, passively (vi. 16), Pulcheria,
   directly and passively (ix. 3). The perpetuation of this charism was
   deemed inherently necessary for the sake of historical continuity, and
   to prove as well that the faith he loved had been established by God;
   equally was it requisite as a holy parallel whereby to gainsay the
   mantic spirit of Paganism; as is best illustrated in the silencing of
   the oracle at Daphne (v. 19), and by his reflections upon the
   philosopher's tripod devised for finding the successor of Valens (vi.
   35). Nor are Socrates, Theodoret, Evagrius, and others any more
   moderate than Sozomen in this respect.

   3. Another aim of his history is to prove that Providence or the divine
   government is promoting the Christian faith directly. The universal
   order must be interpreting itself distinctly through the Church. The
   Father must be vindicating the good and punishing the wicked, according
   to the orthodox category. Sozomen's history is as insistent in this
   regard as Eliphaz and his philosophic confreres. One must be able to
   decide infallibly in each case as to cause and effect; it is a very
   realistic pragmatism, and is not the exclusive property of Sozomen; it
   is a characteristic of all these Church historians.

   There is properly enough a recognition of God in history; the sovereign
   will and the human will are jointly working out the world's order, but
   it is the attempt to trace the cause and effect immediately and in each
   case, which is so repulsive and absurd. Some illustrations will show
   how he brings out this view. In i. 7 the comment made on Constantine's
   overthrow of Licinius: "From many facts it has often appeared to me
   that the teaching of the Christians is supported, and its advancement
   secured, by the Providence of God, and not the least from what then
   occurred; for at the very moment that Licinius was about to persecute
   all the churches under him, the war in Bithynia broke out, which ended
   in a war between him and Constantine, and in which Constantine was so
   strengthened by Divine assistance, that he was victorious over his
   enemies by land and by sea." More of detail comes out in the life of
   Athanasius. Thus in ii. 17, of his election he says: "Alexander, bishop
   of Alexandria, when about to depart this life, left Athanasius as his
   successor, in accordance, I am convinced, with the Divine will,
   directing the vote upon him." And again: "He fled to escape the honor,
   but he was discovered in his place of concealment by the help of God,
   who had forecast by Divine manifestations to his blessed predecessors,
   that the succession was to devolve upon him." His whole career is so
   viewed in v. 6. There is a large discussion of this subject in vi. 35,
   where he argues against the plan of pagan philosophers to foretell the
   future of the empire: "The philosophers, on the other hand, acted as if
   the deposition and restoration of emperors had depended solely on them;
   for if the imperial succession was to be considered dependent on the
   arrangement of the stars, what was requisite but to await the accession
   of the future emperor, whoever he might be? Or, if the succession was
   regarded as dependent on the will of God, what right had man to meddle?
   For it is not the function of human foreknowledge or zeal to understand
   God's thought; nor if it were right, would it be well for men, even if
   they be the wisest of all, to think that they can plan better than
   God." He persists in tracing a connection between God and every event
   in favor of mechanical goodness or orthodoxy. He follows many
   opponents, whether heretical or pagan, with the Divine wrath; all these
   historians do this,--Philostorgius, as well as Evagrius. Sozomen is not
   nearly so bitter or uncharitable as either of these. He is most
   atrabilious in the case of Julian, under whom his own family had
   suffered. As a consequence of this arbitrary pious pragmatism, the most
   deplorable incompetents are treated as the express favorites of heaven,
   while the larger-minded pagan or Arian is loaded with contempt. Under
   this law, too, the evil sides of the orthodox, and the excellences of
   the pagan, or Arians, are suppressed. The defeats of the Nicene
   emperors are not mentioned; the victories of the Anti-Nicene are passed
   by or belittled, while their humiliations are evidence of the impending
   anger of heaven. In the survey of Helena's life (ii. 2) he says: "It
   seems to me that so many holy actions demanded a recompense, and indeed
   even in this life she was raised to the summit of magnificence." As to
   Constantine, in ii. 34 he dares say: "He was more successful than any
   other sovereign in all his undertakings; for he formed no design, I am
   convinced, without God." When Bishop Felix of Rome died, and Liberius
   became sole occupant of the see, he construes the fact thus: "This
   event was no doubt ordained by God, that the seat of Peter might not be
   dishonored by the occupancy of two bishops; for such an arrangement is
   a sign of discord, and is foreign to ecclesiastical law" (iv. 15). In
   all the features of Julian's life, God is visiting him with his
   unappeasable anger (vi. 35, v. 21, 22, vi. 1, 2). The election of
   Nectarius, though it was in violation of ecclesiastical order and an
   accumulation of ignorant blunders, did not take place without the
   interposition of Divine strength (vii. 8). Theodosius is portrayed as
   the prime delight of heaven; thus his simple reliance upon God wins him
   a hopeless battle with Eugenius (vii. 24). It is so with the whole
   Theodosian line (viii. 1, ix. 1). Pulcheria has Divine love manifested
   to her in manifold ways, as does her brother, Theodosius the Younger
   (ix. 1, 3, 16). Even Alaric is driven by an inexplicable impulse to
   rebuke the luxury, debauchery, and injustice of the Romans (ix. 6). In
   ix. 1, he says of his own sovereign: "It appears to me that it was the
   design of God to show by the events of this period, that piety alone
   suffices for the salvation of princes; and that without piety, armies,
   a powerful empire, and every other resource, are of no avail. The
   Divine power, which is the guardian of the universe, foresaw that the
   emperor would be distinguished by his piety, and determined that
   Pulcheria, his sister, should be the protector of him and of the
   government." In ix. 16, he explains his secular details in the
   paragraph: "This is not the proper place to enter into details
   concerning the deaths of the tyrants; but I considered it necessary to
   allude to the circumstance in order to show, that to insure the
   stability of imperial power, it is sufficient for an emperor to serve
   God with reverence, which was the course pursued by Honorius." While of
   his patron he says: "It seems as if God openly manifested His favor
   towards the present emperor, not only by disposing of warlike affairs
   in an unexpected way, but also by revealing the sacred bodies of many
   persons who were of old most distinguished for piety." The whole
   history is full of this sort of philosophy of its personages. Similarly
   all natural calamities and the irruption of barbarians are ethically
   explained, which is correct enough as a general principle; but these
   phenomena are punitive or vindicatory of particular deeds. Constantius'
   course toward Athanasius was heralded by an invasion of the Franks, and
   by an earthquake in the East (iii. 6). Of Julian he says: "It is,
   however, very obvious that throughout the reign of this emperor, God
   gave manifest tokens of His displeasure and permitted many calamities
   to befall several of the provinces of the Roman Empire. He visited the
   earth with such fearful earthquakes, that the buildings were shaken,
   and no more safety could be found within houses than in the open air."
   Then follow the inundations of the Nile; the drought and the famine in
   the empire, and on their heels the pestilences (vi. 2). Under Valens we
   read: "In the meantime although hail-storms of extraordinary magnitude
   fell in various places, and although many cities, particularly Nicæa in
   Bithynia, were shaken by earthquakes, yet Valens the emperor and
   Eudoxius the bishop paused not in their career, but continued to
   persecute all Christians who differed from them in opinion" (vi. 10).
   He does not make the same reflection upon Constantius, when the
   earthquake at Nicomedia intercepted the meeting of a council (iv. 16);
   Gaïnas' attempted revolution is "pre-announced by the appearance of a
   comet directly over the city; this comet was of extraordinary
   magnitude, larger, it is said, than any that had previously been seen"
   (viii. 3). After Chrysostom's exile, "hailstones of extraordinary
   magnitude fell at Constantinople and in the suburbs of the city. Four
   days afterwards, the wife of the emperor died. These occurrences were
   regarded by many as indications of Divine wrath, on account of the
   persecutions that had been carried on against John" (viii. 27).

   But the earthquakes and famines and invasions that happened under
   Theodosius the Great and Theodosius Junior are not mentioned directly.
   By such unfair pragmatism Sozomen, as all his fellow-historians, sought
   to answer the allegations, now more directly affirmed, in the period of
   barbarian irruption, that the calamities were due to the desertion of
   the gods. Sulpicius Severus, Augustine, and Orosius built up a somewhat
   better apology.

   4. Another object he kept before him, we will let him state in his own
   words: "The doctrine of the Catholic Church is shown to be especially
   the most genuine, since it has been tested frequently by the plots of
   opposing thinkers; yet, the disposal of the lot being of God, the
   Catholic Church has maintained its own ascendancy, has re-assumed its
   own power, and has led all the churches and the people to the reception
   of its own truth" (i. 1). Catholicity and Orthodoxy, as defined at
   Nicæa, are synonymous. The creed of the fathers is final. The Church
   which spoke in 325 and 381 is the historic and Catholic Church, and the
   Theodosian line is the Divinely appointed instrument for laying its
   foundations immovably, the others having failed. Church and State are
   to be indissolubly wedded. This faith is made mechanically the test of
   goodness and badness, and this expresses his personal belief.

   He speaks of the Scriptures with uniform reverence, and holds to the
   theoria as the method of interpretation, as we see in v. 22, where he
   says of the Jews: "They were only acquainted with the mere letter of
   Scripture, and could not, like the Christians and a few of the wisest
   among the Hebrews, discover the hidden meaning (pros theorian)"; yet he
   speaks with respect (viii. 2) of Chrysostom's way of expounding the
   sacred records and of his "teacher Diodorus' method, employed in the
   many books of that bishop," in which he explained the significance of
   the sacred words and avoided allegory (theoria). But when bishops and
   monks are declared to be skilled in the Scriptures, it is in this
   mystical sense. His own grandfather was a solver of the amphibolies of
   the Word, doubtless by this convenient key (v. 5).

   The dogmatic standpoint, as we have seen, was traditionalism, toward
   which the Church gravitated under the dictation of the councils, the
   influence of bishops like Athanasius, the almost uniform ictus of the
   Roman see, Ambrose, the Gregories, Basil the Great, Ephraim, Eusebius,
   and Epiphanius, the majority of monks, and finally the whole force of
   the State. He opposes all shades of Arianism, as also Apolinarianism;
   had he completed his work, from what he says of Pulcheria's conquest
   over heresies, he would have opposed the Nestorian views of the
   Theotokos. But of Donatism and Cyprianism he has not a word. Of the
   anthropological struggles of the West there is not a syllable. Here is
   the place, also, to consider his attitude toward heresies. Sozomen does
   not assail any phase of Arianism with the intemperate epithets which
   Eusebius employed to condemn the earlier innovators, or such as abound
   in Theodoret and Evagrius and later historians. Indeed, he sometimes
   calls them Christians and members of the Catholic Church. His treatment
   of the Novatians, while a little offish, is yet generous as compared
   with other writers, except Socrates, from whom he obtains almost all
   their history; he devotes much space; he is generally courteous in
   tone; and when he speaks of the proposed union (iv. 2) between the
   Catholic Church and that body of believers, he omits the cause of the
   failure; viz., the reluctance of some legalistic Novatians to
   acquiesce,--a point which Socrates does not fail to expose. He mentions
   Montanism (Phrygianism) several times, but with no new facts, save that
   they were numerous in Phrygia in his day, and had peculiar Paschal
   usages (i. 6, ii. 18, 32, vii. 18, 19). Of the Gnostic sects, he
   alludes to the Valentinians only, whose conventicles were repressed by
   an edict of Constantius (ii. 32). The Manichæans are mentioned only as
   they are one of the three sects excepted from Gratian's law of
   toleration (vii. 1). Of the Pricillianists, whose attempt at a world
   religion falls so wholly within his time, he says nothing. The
   Quartodecimanians are still numerous and tenacious (vii. 18). He has a
   bare allusion to the Encratites (v. 11). Of the Origenistic
   controversy, he has no more to say than he is compelled to, in order to
   state correctly the conflict between Theophilus and Chrysostom. Over
   against the Origenists he places the Anthropomorphists (viii. 12). Of
   Lucifer's separatism, he gives only the rise (iii. 15). With all his
   emphatic adherence to the current orthodoxy, he must be regarded as the
   most charitable of historians next to Socrates. Mention has already
   been made of his kindly disposition toward the Novatians. When writing
   fully and favorably, as was his duty, about Aëtius (iii. 15), he is
   constrained to make an apology: "Let it not be accounted strange if I
   have bestowed commendations upon the leaders or enthusiasts of the
   above-mentioned heresies. I admire their eloquence and their
   impressiveness in discourse: I leave their doctrines to be judged by
   those whose prerogative it is."

   On the one hand, we find him insisting on the right of private
   judgment, as when he discusses the overruling Providence in Julian's
   life, and especially on the infatuation which led the emperor to Persia
   in spite of Sallust (vi. 1): "This observation, however, is only
   inserted lest I should be blamed for omitting it. I leave every one to
   form his own opinion." So, after discussing the use of penance, he
   remarks in the following chapter (vii. 17): "Such subjects as the
   above, however, are best left to the decision of individual judgment."
   He would also allow latitude in ceremonials (vii. 19), as we shall see.
   On the other hand, he dreads the progressive and unsettling outcome of
   the private judgment in exercise. He expresses this fear in iv. 27:
   "The spirit of innovation is self-laudatory; hence it advanced farther
   and farther, and crept along to greater novelties. With increasing
   self-conceit, and in scorn of the fathers, it enacted laws of its own.
   Nor does it honor the doctrine of the ancients concerning God, but is
   always excogitating strange dogmas and restlessly adds novelty to
   novelty, as the events now show."

   Of the threatening strategies of free thought in his own day, he
   devoutly exclaimed: "That new heresies have not prevailed in our times,
   we shall find to be due especially to her" (Pulcheria) (ix. 1).
   Consequently he deprecates the deleterious influence of polemics. On
   the accession of Jovian, he says: "The presidents of the churches now
   resumed the agitation of doctrinal questions and discussions. They had
   remained quiet during the reign of Julian, when Christianity itself was
   endangered, and had unanimously offered up their supplications for the
   mercy of God. It is thus that men, when attacked by foreign enemies,
   remain in accord among themselves; but when external troubles are
   removed, then internal dissensions creep in" (vi. 4 and in vi. 25).

   "Thus do the private animosities of the clergy from time to time
   greatly injure the Church and divide religion into many heresies! And
   this is a proof; for had George, like Theodotus, received Apolinarius,
   on his repentance, into communion, I believe that we should never have
   heard of the heresy that bears his name. Men are prone, when loaded
   with opprobrium and contempt, to resort to rivalries and innovations;
   whereas, when treated with justice, they become moderate and remain in
   the same position." More emphatic still is his protest in vi. 26:
   "Those varying dogmas are the source of innumerable troubles to
   religion, and many are deterred from embracing Christianity by the
   diversity of opinion which prevails in matters of doctrine." In the
   beginning of this same chapter, in speaking of the Eunomians, he
   delineates them thus: "They do not applaud a good course of life or
   manner of conduct, or mercy towards the needy, unless exhibited by
   persons of their own sect, so much as skill in disputation and the
   power of triumphing in debates." This is a great blow at the sectores
   cymini, and at pride in polemics; the whole tone is much more liberal
   than that of the ecclesiastic Theodoret, or even the lawyer Evagrius.
   Sozomen, like Socrates, represents a generous feeling current among the
   laymen of Constantinople in court and among the trades and professions.
   The attitude of the Catholic Church with regard to baptism he sets
   forth adequately as trivial, and argues against the Eunomian innovation
   of one baptism and a change in the formula (vi. 21): "But whether it
   was Eunomius or any other person who first made these innovations upon
   the tradition of baptism, it seems to me that such innovators, whoever
   they may have been, were alone in danger, according to their own
   representation, of quitting this life without having received Divine
   baptism." The argument here is an unusually long one; with his
   generation he held to the magical efficacy of the rite. The theory of
   the sacraments as mysteries or arcane, was one which controlled him
   throughout, and even limited his fidelity as a historian. Thus in i.
   20: "I thought it necessary to reproduce the very document (the Nicene
   Creed) concerning these matters, as an example of the truth, in order
   that posterity might possess in a fixed and clear form, the symbol of
   that faith which proved pacifying at the time; but since some pious
   friends who understood such matters, recommended that these truths
   ought to be spoken of and heard by the initiated and their initiators
   only, I agreed with their counsel: for it is not unlikely that some of
   the uninitiated may read this book: while I have concealed such of the
   prohibited material as I ought to keep silent about, I have not
   altogether left the reader ignorant of the opinions held by the Synod."
   Nor will he repeat the symbol as subjoined to the letter of the council
   of Antioch (vi. 4); and when the Macedonian commission to Liberius make
   their statement, and the text is given to show their entire acceptance
   of the Nicene view, Sozomen will not reproduce it. Again in vi. 29,
   Mark was a monk of "such eminent piety, that Macarius himself, the
   presbyter of Celliæ, declared that he had never given to him what
   priests present to the initiated at the holy table; but that an angel,
   administering it to him, whose hand up to the forearm, he declared
   himself to have seen." In viii. 5, in giving the account of a marvelous
   judgment wrought on a Macedonian wife, who pretended to be a convert to
   the Nicene views, and thus frequented the orthodox ceremony of the
   Supper, he remarks, "At the time of the celebration of the mysteries
   (the initiated will understand what I mean), this woman kept what was
   given her, and held down her head as if engaged in prayer." In reciting
   the disturbances at the Easter celebration over the decree of exile
   against Chrysostom (viii. 21), he says: "They were charged with the
   commission of such disorderly acts as can be readily conceived by those
   who have been admitted to the mysteries, but which I consider it
   requisite to pass over in silence, lest my work should fall into the
   hands of the uninitiated." Here we have a glimpse of the scope of the
   arcane as well as the weakness of the historian in submitting to the
   advice of narrow friends; no other historian felt bound to restrict
   himself in such matters. Sozomen here joined the most extreme
   sacramentarians of his day. On the weighty matter of discipline, he
   believes with the Catholic Church in receiving back the penitent into
   the Church, against Novatian and Donatistic practices. He expresses his
   opinion at some length, though not so fully as Socrates, in the chapter
   which relates to the abolition of the penitential presbyter (vii. 16):
   "Impeccability is a Divine attribute, and belongs not to human nature;
   therefore God has decreed that pardon should be extended to the
   penitent even after many transgressions. As in supplicating for pardon,
   it is requisite to confess the sin, it seems probable that the priests,
   from the beginning, considered it irksome to make this confession in
   public, before the whole assembly of the people. They appointed a
   presbyter of the utmost sanctity and the most undoubted prudence, to
   act on those occasions: the penitents went to him and confessed their
   transgressions; and it was his office to indicate the kind of penance
   adapted to each sin, and then when satisfaction had been made, to
   pronounce absolution." He deplores the abolition of the office as the
   occasion of laxity. The deterrent force of public confession was now
   lost, and that to the danger of Christian conduct. He sympathizes also
   with that form of martyrdom which wantonly and ruthlessly assails
   paganism and is slain in the attempt. The system of relic-worship, so
   characteristic of any decline of opportunity for heroic action, had set
   in overwhelmingly, and he believed in it vigorously. Our own age
   reproduces the same tendency not only in religious, but in secular
   forms, and among Protestants as well. Thus he commemorates: of Old
   Testament prophets, Micah and Habakkuk (vii. 29), Zechariah (ix. 17);
   of the preparatory period, the head of John the Baptist (vii. 21); of
   the Apostolic Church, St. Stephen (vii. 29, ix. 16); of the martyrs,
   Babylas (v. 19), Forty Soldiers (ix. 2); of the monks, Hilarion (iii.
   14), the four brothers (vii. 9). The most prominent of secondary relics
   is the cross with its inscriptions and nails (ii. 1). The discovery of
   these is mainly through prayer and heavenly signs; their possession is
   an object of imperial ambition; the removal and transportation of them
   are effected with most gorgeous and reverent pomp; and the sacred
   treasures become the agents of endless miracles.

   Sozomen, like Socrates and Chrysostom, believes in freedom as to
   old-time ceremonials. He has a chapter on the varieties of religious
   usage (vii. 19); and the record is largely the result of his own
   inquiry. He remarks in conclusion: "Many other customs are still to be
   observed in cities and villages; and those who have been brought up in
   their observance would, from respect to the great men who instituted
   and perpetuated these customs, consider it wrong to abolish them.
   Similar motives must be attributed to those who observe different
   practices in the celebration of the fast, which has led us into this
   long digression." From his point of view, uniformity may not encroach
   upon individualism beyond a certain point. He is certainly quietly and
   with dignity attacking a party of narrow uniformitarians, who are
   already pressing for a harmony of all ceremonials in Christendom.

   Another feature of the Catholic system that he traces carefully, is the
   relation between Church and Empire. He devotes more attention to this
   aspect of polity than to its internal development; this latter he
   touches upon incidentally, and not at all carefully. We have seen how
   painstakingly he cites the imperial edicts with regard to the Church.
   The state laws, which at first expressed conciliar decisions, were
   followed by independent imperial enactments. These, indeed, are at
   first sporadic, but become more and more the rule. The personal views
   of Sozomen appear in the narrative, but they are fluctuating. He
   acquiesces in the imperial convocation of councils, as do all his
   cotemporaries. On the death of Constantine, in commenting upon the
   hereafter fixed Christian character of the state, he says: "The
   sacerdotal dignity is not only equal in honor to imperial power, but in
   sacred places even takes the ascendancy" (ii. 34). With the plan of
   producing uniformity of religion in the empire, he seems to sympathize
   (iv. 11). He is indignant at Julian's indifference to the murder of
   Zeno by the inhabitants of Gaza, and at the deprivations of the
   Christians, when all their political and personal rights were taken
   from them (v. 9). To the charge of Libanius, that the man who aimed the
   dart at Julian was a Christian, and belonged to the race of habitual
   transgressors of the law, Sozomen replies by defending the regicide:
   "In the documents above quoted, Libanius clearly states that the
   emperor fell by the hand of a Christian; and this probably was the
   truth. It is not unlikely that some of the soldiers who then served in
   the Roman army might have conceived the idea, since Greeks and all men
   until this day have praised tyrannicides, for exposing themselves to
   death in the cause of liberty, and spiritedly standing by their
   country, their families, and their friends. Still less is he deserving
   of blame, who for the sake of God and of religion, performed so bold a
   deed" (vi. 2). This is the highest stand that a lawyer could take in
   support of individualism. In his view of the exalted prerogatives of
   the Church, the reply of Valentinian to the bishops, who desired to
   hold a council, would seem happy. "I am but one of the laity, and have,
   therefore, no right to interfere in these transactions; let the
   priests, to whom such matters appertain, assemble where they please"
   (vi. 7). Theodosius' compulsory course with regard to paganism and
   orthodoxy, and the choice of Nectarius, are approved. On the other
   hand, he selected two instances out of many from the life of Ambrose,
   for the purpose of illustrating how, in God's behalf, that bishop
   conducted himself towards those in power (vii. 25).

   Throughout we find him recognizing the practical headship of Rome; he
   expresses himself unconsciously in vi. 22, "The question having been
   thus decided by the Roman Church, peace was restored and the inquiry
   ended." This ignores the action of the Synod of Alexandria and that of
   Constantinople itself, for both had decreed the consubstantiality of
   the Holy Spirit and opposed the christology of Apolinarius, prior to
   the action of the Roman Synod. The power delegated to Julius by the
   council of Sardica (iii. 8), the conflict between the East and the West
   conducted in mutually arrogant epistles (iii. 10), the subordination of
   new to old Rome (vii. 9), show the drift toward concentration. Sozomen
   does not seem to understand the rival movements of Alexandria under
   Athanasius and Theophilus; nor the Eastern imperial attempts to elevate
   Constantinople to the supremacy, nor the mutterings of Antiochan
   jealousy.

   The Church's servility toward the orthodox rulers is fairly expressed,
   and yet with comparative moderation, by Sozomen. He is an apologist for
   Constantine, and reflects, as do all the historians, and especially
   Evagrius in his criticism of Zosimus, the adulations and subterfuges of
   Eusebius. The religious fluctuation of that emperor is masked; his
   crimes are suppressed; he is made to appear orthodox, even when at his
   worst Eusebian stage. No wonder that Philostorgius charged the
   Homoöusians with worshiping Constantine as a god in the ceremonies
   connected with his image! Constantius, a vacillating, cruel,
   incompetent, is also apologized for, but to the damage of his
   intelligence. Julian, for his years in some respects, one of the most
   promising and earnest rulers of ancient times, is loaded with obloquy,
   his highest motives and ideals ridiculed, his victories belittled, his
   death savagely exulted in. Jovian's and Valentinian's toleration are
   not understood, but their personal orthodoxy is in so far praised.
   Valens is looked at through the eyes of his two fierce Cappadocian
   assailants. His excellences are entirely ignored; the most inconsequent
   views are imputed to him while attempting to glorify Basil; in the sad
   story of the emperor's dying son, that bishop appears as a brute in his
   treatment of the agonized father. The stories of heroism attributed to
   the orthodox are only examples of insufferable insolence; one must
   marvel at the patience of Valens, if there be any truth in them.
   Gratian, that beau-ideal of Western orthodoxy, was really a nose of wax
   in the hands of Ambrose; he was esteemed more moderately by the East,
   and that rather for having called Theodosius to a share in the throne,
   than for any quality in himself; but his utter moral collapse, after
   the magnificent promise of his youth, is wholly veiled from sight.
   Theodosius the Great is glorified, not for his superior statecraft and
   generalship, but for his efforts to suppress paganism and heresy. The
   charges against his private life such as Eunapius and Zosimus suggest,
   are not hinted at. He is a man of prayer and visions, a
   relic-worshiper, and a persecutor of pagans and Arians. Great as he
   certainly was, his distinguishing and conspicuous qualities are passed
   by. His pitiful children, Arcadius and Honorius, the sorriest quidnuncs
   of those stormy times, are heroes of piety. Pulcheria, excellent as she
   was, was not worthy of the excessive flattery poured out upon her;
   while Anthemius, Troïlus, Valerianus, and other noble figures of the
   day are passed by. The younger Theodosius, with his good training and
   generally fair endeavor, is delineated in the dedication as the
   consummate man of all time, while he is a very third-rate soul at best.
   The eulogies by Socrates (vii. 22 and 42) are just as fulsome. This was
   the grave sin of the State Church; the Arian State Church did the same
   for Constantius and Valens; more and more as history reveals the truth
   concerning many of those idols, does the revulsion increase against a
   union of two functions which could so degrade both.

   The relation of Church and State involves the question of persecution.
   It is not the history of the endeavor to enforce uniformity, with which
   we shall concern ourselves, but rather the views Sozomen sets forth, as
   to the policy of repression. The laws of Constantine suppressing
   heretics did not affect the Novatians (ii. 32), concerning which
   justice, he remarks: "The emperor, I believe, willingly relaxed the
   rigor of the enactment in their favor, for he only desired to strike
   terror into the minds of his subjects, and had no intention of
   persecuting them." The punishments inflicted in Constantius' time on
   the orthodox in Constantinople, both by Macedonius (iv. 23) and
   Eudoxius (iv. 26), call forth this reflection: "For, if the persecution
   did not occasion such tortures to the body as preceding ones, it
   appeared more grievous to all who reflected aright, on account of its
   disgraceful nature, for both the persecutors and the persecuted
   belonged to the Church; and the one was all the more disgraceful in
   that men of the same religion treated their fellows with a degree of
   cruelty which the ecclesiastical laws prohibit to be manifested towards
   enemies and strangers." He spares himself the pain of registering all
   who were ejected from their sees (iv. 27), for no province was without
   its list of sufferers. The cruelties inflicted by George on pagan and
   orthodox, furnish a mournful narrative (iv. 30). On the elevation of
   Julian, a great dread fell upon the Christian world, intensified by the
   portents which befell him. The series of edicts soon wrought mutual
   dissension in the Christian ranks, as well as suffering from without.
   But while Sozomen attributes the refinements of cruelty to Julian, and
   lays the miseries of the saints at his door as parts of a subtle plan,
   he nevertheless cannot conceal from himself the absence of direct
   interference on the part of the State; these calamities were the
   results of a restoration of the old religion to its ancient union with
   the State; it was an imperial act; and he is compelled to confess the
   seeming magnanimity of Julian in certain cases, but even then maligns
   his motives. The imperial clemency did not arise from any feeling of
   compassion, but because persecution would only increase the number of
   Galilean adherents; because he was envious of their glory, did he
   resort to argument instead of cruelty, and manifest an unexpected
   benevolence instead of proceeding to rigorous measures (v. 4, 5). "It
   may be concluded from what has been said, that if Julian shed less
   blood than preceding persecutors of the Church, and that if he devised
   fewer punishments for the torture of the body, yet that he was severer
   in other respects." Nevertheless, this statement is followed by a
   record of suffering in all quarters of the empire and the impression of
   purposed directness is given, as if the State had inflicted them,
   especially when we read that the emperor would not listen to the
   cautions of Sallust (v. 20). He does not comment on Jovian's
   toleration, but only rejoices in the return of the Church to
   ascendancy. Unsparing is his picture of the dastardly measures of
   Valens against the professors of the faith; he regards that persecutor
   as the special victim of Divine wrath; while, on the other hand, he
   does not hesitate to call the Arian Goths, who fell under the anger of
   Athanaric, martyrs (vi. 37). He does not express an opinion as to the
   partial toleration of Gratian's edict (vii. 1); but in explanation of
   Theodosius' law forbidding heretics, i.e. all anti-Nicenists, from
   holding churches and from exercising any clerical function, he says:
   "Great as were the punishments adjudged by the laws against heretics,
   they were not always carried into execution; for the emperor had no
   desire to persecute his subjects; he only desired to enforce uniformity
   of view about God' through the medium of intimidation. Those who
   voluntarily renounced heretical opinions, received commendation from
   him." And it is true that the court practice of persecuting emperors,
   orthodox or Arian, was utterly in the teeth of their own edicts, and
   their most intimate counselors were elected without regard to religion.
   When Justina sought to revive the Arian standard in the West, her
   treatment of Ambrose is called persecution (vii. 13); but Ambrose's
   intolerant procedures against the Arians are not even noticed. No
   quizzical wrinkle disturbs the flow of his narrative in vii. 15, when
   Theodosius I. gives a heathen temple to the Christians, and the pagans
   resolve to defend their rights, and do so effectually; but the
   Christians who perish in that hateful conflict are crowned as martyrs
   by an imperial edict! For the religious tyranny of Theodosius the Great
   he is a warm apologist, and disguises the perversion of that principle
   of freedom for which he pleads most earnestly, when the Arians hold the
   reins of power, and abuse their opportunity. The contradictions are
   perfectly apparent and irreconcilable, because uniformity by force has
   always been impossible. Yet logical men will state the most
   contradictory reasons, which no quidnunc can refrain from laughing at.
   Themistius' plea for toleration (vi. 36) in matters of intellectual
   belief, on the ground of secular diversities in philosophy and from the
   incomprehensible nature of God, shows the existence of a party who
   believed in this principle. While Sozomen gives it place, and hailed
   the Gothic Arians who compelled Valens to cease his oppressions, he has
   no word of approbation for the proposition or the argument.

   5. Another design of his history is stated in i. 1: "I have had to
   deliberate whether I ought to confine myself to the recital of events
   connected with the Church under the Roman government; but it seemed
   more advisable to include, as far as possible, the record of
   transactions relative to religion among the Persians and barbarians."
   He regards Christianity as the universal and sole religion, and would
   trace its extension in all directions. Hence he is the first historian
   to give us a larger account of religion in Syria and Palestine,
   introducing us especially to some aspects of Christian life and
   suffering in Edessa; we are all the more surprised to have no mention
   of the Church in Africa, and so very little of the Church in the West,
   except when it comes into close relations with the East, as in the
   larger controversies, and especially after Arianism threatened to keep
   its hold upon the Byzantine section of the empire; and the Orient had
   to cry to the cold and unsympathetic Occident for help, and often in
   vain. He is also careful to give us some, if not a very original,
   account of the work of missions. He repeats the story of the Iberians,
   Armenians, Indians, Saracens, and Goths. He gives us a larger insight
   into Persia; the errors with which he is charged as swarming, are no
   more numerous than those of his cotemporaries. Of the large work of
   Theophilus of Dhu, or the extension of Arianism among the Germanic
   tribes, he says nothing. Chrysostom's real missionary enterprises are
   passed by, excepting his expenditure of the funds furnished by Olympias
   for the redemption and restoration of Isaurian captives (viii. 27). His
   reflections on the methods of Church extension are more interesting and
   numerous. Thus, in ii. 5, of the attempt of Constantine to abolish
   idolatry and introduce the faith, Sozomen says, "Soldiers were not
   necessary; the courtiers effected it"; he does not consider it
   advisable to give all the details as to all the lands then won to the
   state religion. The barbarians he notices as converted through the
   instrumentality of Christian captives (ii. 6, 7). Armenian influence
   carried Christianity into Persia (ii. 8). Prodigies, too, are helpful
   agents (vi. 5, v. 22). The hieroglyphs and crux-symbols discovered in
   the Egyptian temples led to the repentance of pagans (vii. 15).
   Sometimes a kingdom will solicit the instruction of an orthodox monk,
   as in the case of the Saracens (vi. 38). The legal suppressions of
   paganism facilitate a change of sentiment on the part of many (vii.
   15). The very ambitions of their clergy led numbers of the Arians to
   embrace Nicene views (vii. 17); and the doctrinal discussions among
   heretics constrain others to embrace a more uniform system of belief
   (viii. 1). The efficiency of the monks as evangelists is found in
   nearly all the biographies of them. On the other hand, he makes
   confession to the baleful effects of incessant indulgence in polemics.
   "These varying dogmas are the sources of innumerable troubles to
   religion; and many are deterred from embracing Christianity by the
   diversity of opinion which prevails in matters of doctrine" (vi. 26).
   This thought of universality, then, is a feature of his history.

   6. Another design is to dignify monasticism as the true ethical ideal
   and goal of Christianity,--as the philosophy which is to supplant all
   the ancient intellectual strivings of reason,--and he announces this
   purpose as follows: "Nor is it foreign to ecclesiastical history to
   introduce in this work an account of those who were the fathers and
   originators of what is denominated monachism, and of their immediate
   successors, whose celebrity is well known to us either by observation
   or report. For I would neither be considered ungracious towards them,
   nor willing to consign their virtue to oblivion, nor yet be thought
   ignorant of their history; but would wish to leave behind me such a
   record of their manner of life that others, led by their example, might
   attain to a blessed and happy end" (i. 1). He is here quietly resisting
   a school of Christians and politicians who were opposed to the
   absorbing and destructive qualities of this manner of life; Athanasius,
   Basil the Great, Jerome, Chrysostom, had to write in its defense for
   the same reason, and he sided with these supporters of its virtues,
   very naturally. He is a full believer in the Divine philosophy which
   nurtured him; monasticism with its practical strivings after conformity
   to the Divine-human Pattern, and its attempt to enthrone the spiritual
   over the material has a zealous defender in him, of all its rapt and
   grotesque forms. He determined therefore to make it a unique portion of
   his history. The discussion of its aims in i. 12 will give us a clue to
   his own desire to represent it as almost the resultant force in the
   progress of the Divine kingdom; one reads the historian's responsive
   feeling between the lines. This philosophy was the most useful thing
   received by man from God; it was superior to all other knowledge, and
   warranted the neglect of all worldly science; it strove to eliminate
   the adiaphora from ethics, and to make everything have a moral
   complexion; one must be doing good, or else he is doing evil. Its great
   duties are the discipline of self, the worship of the Creator, and the
   cultivation of a spirit of other-worldness. These canons and goals are
   the life of the system. It is the philosophy which is to take the place
   of the old theoretical schemes; and it is the great school to fill up
   the gap made by the decay of the Hellenic universities. The Christian
   university founded by Theodosius in Sozomen's day, was indeed a blow to
   this educational ideal. While we may have no accord with his view of
   this ethical phenomenon, we must concede him the merit of discerning
   its significance and intent, and allow that he was wise to give us so
   full an account of its elaboration, and so much detail and scrap of
   biography; for it was a dominant element in the history of this time.
   It formed men and measures. The reproach of Sozomen on this score is
   wholly a mistake; he has done us capital service in not neglecting this
   element, otherwise we could have but little conception of its
   historical setting, of its patience, its tireless devotion, and we
   would have to resort to Palladius or Rufinus and the individual
   biographies. Moreover, it is an uncritical spirit which recoils from
   dissecting the awful and often repulsive details of legalistic
   self-denial. After discoursing on the local origin of monasticism and
   the forms it assumed, we have chapters containing brief sketches of
   hermits, laurists, and coenobites (i. 12, 13, 14, iii. 14). The people
   looked to the monks for the color of their theology (iv. 10). Arianism
   felt its weakness without them and ineffectually sought their
   suppression (vi. 20). The Nicene faith uniformly received the support
   of these communities (vi. 27), to which they remained devoted under all
   persecutions. Another series of biographies follows in vi. 28-34:
   Theophilus (viii. 12) has a preliminary struggle with them to carry
   forward his plots against John. The royal court itself under
   Pulcheria's leadership reflected its severe discipline (ix. 13).
   Sozomen seems also to have studied the rules of various bodies, some of
   whose details he gives, and indulges in a sort of comparative study of
   their regulations (vi. 30). Yet with all his implied admiration of the
   heroes of this system, who went to the almost extreme of abstinence, he
   remarks in reviewing the discipline of Theotimus (vii. 26): "I consider
   it to be the part of the philosopher to yield to the demand of these
   appetites from necessity, and not from the love of sensual
   gratification." It is to be noted that he omits for the most part the
   immoral forms of monasticism, such as Evagrius gives us a highly
   rhetorical account of.

   7. A more subordinate aim is to present selected secular matters
   so-called; he does not consider these to be wholly foreign to the scope
   of his work. He handles such with considerable largeness in
   Constantine's life, and keeps up a thread under Constantius and Julian.
   He is more sparing until he reaches Arcadius and Honorius, and the
   chapters 3-15 of Book ix. are largely devoted to the Western struggles
   with usurpers.

   8. A final and subordinate aim is the development of imperial law with
   regard to the Church; he gives little of purely synodical canons, but
   remarks, "I consider it necessary, however, to mention the laws enacted
   for the honor and consolidation of religion, as they constitute a
   considerable portion of ecclesiastical history." And in the next
   chapter, "Having arrived at this point of my history, it would not be
   right to omit all mention of the laws passed in favor of those
   individuals in the churches, who had received their freedom" (i. 9). We
   have already seen how continuously this plan is sustained.

   His Method. 1. He is conscious of certain limitations, and expresses
   them frankly. (a) A modest estimate of his own powers (Proemium, i. 1).
   (b) The excess of material compels him to a constant process of
   selection (ii. 3, 5, 14, iii. 14, 15, 16, iv. 4, 27, vii. 17, 28, ix.
   1. (c) A sense of incapacity to handle some aspects of doctrine (vii.
   17). (d) An occasional insufficiency of data to state a positive
   conclusion (iv. 2, viii. 16).

   2. He acknowledges the need of research, and presents his ideal purpose
   in i. 7: "I shall record the transactions with which I have been
   connected, and also those concerning which I have heard from persons
   who knew or saw the affairs in our own day, or before our own
   generation. But I have sought for records of events of earlier date
   amongst the established laws appertaining to religion, amongst the
   proceedings of the Synods of the period, amongst the innovations that
   arose, and in the epistles of kings and priests." His recurring
   intention was to reproduce the documents just as they were, but he
   finally decided to epitomize their contents and to present the entire
   instrument, only when the state of controversy compelled it in order to
   fairness. The difficulty in the way of consulting these sources lay in
   the fact of their dispersion in palaces, churches, and the private
   libraries of the erudite. He anticipates criticism by acknowledging
   that contradictions are likely to appear in his work, not from any
   fault of his own, but because of the partisan and arbitrary nature of
   the documents; he ingenuously confesses that men's passions and
   conceptions have shaped many of these writings, and that the factious
   spirit has often been guilty of the willful omission of material, which
   was not of its side. He distinctly avers that he felt it his duty to
   examine all writings of this class according to his ability. Such was
   his intention. If now we turn to his actual methods, we can group his
   ways of accumulating material, somewhat as follows:--

   (a) His own observation by hearing or sight, and hence knowing, as in
   ii. 3; vii. 19, 28.

   (b) By obtaining a personally clear knowledge, the medium being
   undefined, as in the election of Maximus to be bishop of Jerusalem, and
   Macarius' sympathy therewith; here his better information was probably
   due to his Palestinian origin. 'Isteon mentoi hos hoi tade ekribokotes,
   kata gnomen Makariou genesthai te kai spoudasthenai to plethei tauta,
   ischurizontai (ii. 20). As to Serapion and Severianus ta men hode egnon
   (viii. 10). As to Zechariah, where the same phrase occurs (ix. 17). At
   the close of a universal review of monasticism tade egnon hos
   sunegrapsa (iii. 14). As to the Syrian and Persian monks eis gnosin
   emen elthon (vi. 34). 'Alla ta men aphegesamen eph' hoson moi mathein
   exegeneto, peri ton tote ekklesiastikon philosophon (vi. 35).

   (c) By hearing from those who knew the facts haper para akribos
   epistamenon akekoa (ii. 21). As to Arsacius: ohi para ton 'Arsakion
   auton theasamenon akekoenai ephasan (iv. 16). As to the mutual
   prophecies of Epiphanius and John kakeinon de eiseti nun pollon onta
   ton logon eputhomen (viii. 15). As to Atticus: kai ton men toionde
   genesthai phasin, hoi ge ton andra egnosan (viii. 27).

   (d) The correction of a false story by inquiring of trustworthy
   persons. Thus as to the origin of the Apocalypse of Paul. 'Eromeno de
   moi peri toutou, pseudos ephesen einai Kilix (vii. 19). As to an
   accusation against John: toutou de prophasin heteran legein ouk echo,
   plen hoti apseudes tis oimai puthanomeno peri toutou ephe, k.t.l.
   (viii. 9). The true and twofold causes of difficulty between Theophilus
   and Isadore: ton ge men sungenomenon toutois tote tois monachois andros
   hoiou pisteuesthai eputhomen, k.t.l (viii. 12).

   (e) To these may be added the very frequent usage of punthanomai as a
   means of expressing his knowledge acquired in any form whatsoever, by
   hearing, by inquiry, by tradition (i. 21, ii. 8, iii. 14, iv. 25, v. 2,
   9, vi. 2 bis, 17, 34 bis, 37, vii. 8, 15, 17, 20, 21, 25, viii. 2, 7,
   9, 19).

   (f) Also his use of akriboo, showing his effort to attain accurate
   information, and ischurizomai less frequently, to indicate the
   strongest confirmation. Both these are used with reserve, and not
   lightly. Several times he acknowledges his resort to tradition, when he
   uses the word pareilephamen, but we cannot always be sure of the form
   of transmission (iii. 15, 30, vi. 38).

   (g) Also his reference to those who had more accurate information, or
   to works whose detail he could not reproduce, or which lay without the
   province of history (iv. 3).

   We see then an ideal and actual plan of research, and a real effort at
   personal investigation; to deny his frequently iterated language, is to
   accuse him of deliberate falsehood; and this is palpably unfair; this
   his honest purpose and work must be borne in mind, in the discussion of
   his relation to Socrates.

   3. As to method in textual criticism, there is none; we find variations
   in the texts quoted from those of Socrates, Athanasius, and Theodoret,
   but no more in him than in the rest from one another. When he reports
   Constantine's speech, he treats it as Thucydides did the orations of
   his worthies, and as the high-flying Eusebius and the indiscriminating
   Theodoret do. When he copies a translation from the Greek, he simply
   says that he gives it just as he found it. On the whole, one is
   surprised at so fair an agreement in the readings of the documents.

   4. There is an entire lack of genuine analytical criticism; the love of
   allegory (i. 1, ii. 1), the credence given to the Christic sections of
   Josephus (i. 1), the unquestioning acceptance of Eusebius' turgid
   statements about Constantine's life, are proofs enough of its absence;
   and yet Sozomen was careful to present the variety of accounts, so that
   one might have all points of view, if he did not carefully sift the
   evidence. This is indeed quite a marked feature of his method. Thus
   concerning the death of Arius, he gives five different views (ii. 29,
   30). He states carefully the varying shades of opinion concerning
   Marcellus (ii. 33). The two classes of views of the election of
   Macedonius are recorded and skillfully weighed (iii. 3). The divisions
   of sentiment after the Synods of Sardica and Philippopolis are
   accurately grouped (iii. 13). Other instances occur in iii. 14, 18, 23,
   v. 2, 22, vi. 2, 12, 26, vii. 5, 22. These are but a selection of what
   is habitual with him, and show a desire to present all sides of a
   question, and to reflect the divergent convictions of his time about
   men and measures; but he does not always try to find the just opinion
   and weigh the testimony; he never tests the validity of his documents,
   and only a few times tries to decide between clashing judgments, as to
   which of them rests on a solid foundation of testimony. It is, however,
   to his credit, when he confesses that his research is baffled, as in
   iv. 2, with respect to the manner of Paul's death, or suspends his
   judgment, because the data are insufficient, as in the application to
   the empress, of Chrysostom's homily on female peccadilloes (viii. 6).
   Such language shows that he not only sought to ascertain the truth, but
   to elicit the facts out of conflicting testimony. We may not always
   think the game worth the powder, but the temper and intent are
   commendable.

   5. Sozomen has a marked zeal for interpreting the events of history;
   and we can gather these hints of histories, although they do not seem
   to have been defined as principles in his own mind.

   (a) He criticises by the rules of traditionalism and monasticism; we
   find small men given undue prominence, and large ones put far below
   their proper place (iv. 6, 9, 28, v. 7, 12, vi. 17, 26, vii. 12).

   (b) He seems to have regarded it his occasional duty to explain the
   moral intent of a period, of the lives of men, of a special incident;
   in other words, he used history reflectively and ethically (viii. 4,
   12, 17).

   (c) He is fertile in suggesting motives for which he has no documentary
   warrant. The entire history of Julian is replete with the insinuation
   of mean motives (hos sumballo). The solitary commendation of him for
   lowering the price of provisions in Antioch (v. 19) is only a ground
   for holding him up to ridicule for want of judgment (iii. 5, 15, v. 2,
   4, 5, 11, 19, 15, 22, vi. 12).

   (d) He deems it necessary to apologize for his favorites if they are in
   a questionable position (iii. 18, v. 6, viii. 1).

   (e) He thinks it right to give recognition to men or measures who have
   enlisted his admiration (vii. 10).

   (f) He traces cause and effect in a pragmatic way (vi. 16, 38).

   (g) He delights in taking prominent figures of a period as the
   remarkable men who have created a remarkable time, and are Divine
   instruments, or as objects of Divine protection on account of their
   piety (iii. 13, 19, iv. 16, v. 13, vi. 17, 26, 27, viii. 3, 4, 6).

   (h) He dwells at times on characteristics of human nature at play (vi.
   4, 26).

   (i) He gives a favorable explanation of the bad actions of the orthodox
   (iv. 16).

   (j) He sometimes introduces speculative explanations or reflections
   (vi. 2, 4, 37, viii. 5).

   6. Chronological method. (1) The imperial reigns are taken as the great
   periods for the books, and the material is distributed under them; no
   dates are given, only the names of the emperors. This is stated in the
   proëmium, and is carried out in the history. (2) He uses the
   consulates--

   (a) To mark the beginning and the end of the entire history.

   (b) Also occasionally to indicate the synchronous occupants of the
   apostolic sees (i. 2); the convocation of a council (iii. 12, 19, iv.
   6, 17, vii. 12); the enthronement of a bishop (iv. 26); the death of an
   emperor (vii. 29, ix. 1); some general but important event (vii. 5,
   viii. 4).

   (c) With this the corresponding year of the emperor is sometimes but
   rarely given.

   (d) Another conspicuous chronological system with Sozomen, as in
   Eusebius, Socrates, and the church historians in general, is to keep up
   the roll of succession in the greater sees. This had become an
   essential note of the visible and Catholic Church.

   (e) Occasionally intervals are indicated as so many years after such
   and such an event (iii. 5, 11, 12, iv. 1, ix. 1).

   (f) The length of a reign or of an episcopate, the duration of the life
   of an emperor or bishop, and of a tendential period are stated, but not
   often, and without uniformity (iv. 11, v. 1, vii. 5).

   (g) An unusual number of particles for indefinite time occur as
   substitutes for an exact method. Nevertheless, one of his main purposes
   was to narrate his history in strict chronological order, so as to
   contain the virtue of a chronicle together with a more developed
   presentation of events. This is almost entirely forgotten, except that
   the sequence of occurrences is fairly kept up. Yet he does not hesitate
   to break through even this sequence, when he thinks the collocation of
   later facts, under the head that he is writing of, may contribute to
   clearness and completeness, as he directly avers in iii. 3, 14, iv. 10,
   11, 12, v. 11, ix. 2. It is no easy task to make a Regesta of Sozomen's
   history; moreover, he often blunders in the very few dates he gives, as
   well as in the arrangement of the events themselves; these errors are
   due to the lack of a fixed system.

   7. The contributions to geography are mainly confined to Palestine.
   Passing more familiar ones, we have a list as follows: Helenopolis (ii.
   2), Majuma (ii. 5, v. 3, vii. 28), Anthedon, Bethagathon, Asalea,
   Thabatha (iii. 14), Diocæsarea (iv. 17), Bethelia (v. 15, vi. 32),
   Besanduca, Capharchobia, Gerara (vi. 32), Botolium (vii. 28), Ceila,
   Berathsabia with its tomb, Nephsameena (vii. 29), Chaphar Zacharia (ix.
   17). Most of these terms are Hebraic or Syrian. Scythopolis is
   mentioned as abundant in palms (viii. 13). There is no direct, and very
   little indirect light on the political or ecclesiastical geography of
   the time; of course the seats of the bishops and of the monks that are
   enumerated yield a few new names of places. There are equally few hints
   in the physical features of the empire; the great rains, or
   hail-storms, or earthquakes are recorded chiefly with regard to their
   special ethical bearing. The topography of Constantinople has been
   indicated previously; outside of these, details of Alexandria, Antioch,
   Cæsarea, Cappadocia are given, but none of them new.

   8. Statistics. There is of course no method in the presentation of
   statistics; there are general proportions, as in ii. 6, iv. 27, v. 15,
   vi. 20; and special detail, as in the enumeration of monks, iii. 14,
   vi. 29-34. The best illustration one finds in the account of the
   Persian martyrs, where there was a distinct effort at registration by
   Persian, Syrian, and Edessan authorities (ii. 13, 14).

   9. Biography is one of the chief constituents of his history. He gives
   us an account of most of the distinguished Christian masters in
   theology, in monasticism, martyrdom, oratory, scholarship,
   administration; and he is refreshingly fair in giving a place to those
   who were not friendly to his view of the faith. Athanasius may be a
   chief hero, but Arius is not neglected. Here we may observe that
   Sozomen makes Aëtius the second head of rationalism, and the man who
   gave it breadth of culture by building the system on the basis of
   Aristotle (iii. 15, iv. 12); he regards Eunomius as but a reflection of
   Aëtius (vi. 29). This position accorded to Aëtius is one deserving
   special note and study. Philostorgius exalted Eunomius both in his
   special encomium and in the history. Of course the two Cappadocians, as
   well as Epiphanius and Chrysostom, are liberally sketched. The imperial
   biography is fairly full, and a large space is accorded Julian. In
   every book parts are devoted to the vitæ sanctorum, as the best way to
   set before us the inner life of the Church and the fairest exhibition
   of Christian character; these monastic sketches are, for the most part,
   mere glimpses of individuals (a line or two suffices); whereas the more
   conspicuous founders and organizers, such as Antony, Hilarion,
   Pachomius, the Macarii, Evagrius, receive a larger recognition. He
   feels the need of selection in the multiplicity of illustrious
   characters, and after a sketch of Acacius, Zeno, and Ajax, he says: "I
   have mentioned these as examples of those who served as priests at this
   period. It would be a task to enumerate all, when the major part of
   them were good, and God bore testimony to their lives by readily
   hearing their prayers and by working many miracles" (vii. 28).
   Prominent as is the biographical element, and earnestly as he endeavors
   to substantiate its claims, he confesses, as to Ephraim (iii. 16), "it
   would require a more experienced hand than mine to furnish a full
   description of his character and that of the other illustrious men,
   who, about the same period, had devoted themselves to a life of
   philosophy; and it is to be regretted that Ephraim did not enter upon
   this undertaking. The attempt is beyond my powers, for I possess but
   little knowledge of those great men, or of their exploits."

   10. In ecclesiastical culture we have many and important incidental
   hints, but no direct general chapter except vii. 19; and on special
   topics, those on the Easter controversy (i. 16, 21, vi. 24, vii. 18,
   viii. 17) on the penitential presbyter (vii. 16), and on relic worship,
   are the most significant.

   11. Nor is there any methodical statement of growth in the acquisition
   and exposition of truth; his traditionalism in a measure precluded
   that, and his acknowledged incapacity to go deeply into the
   differentiation of these discussions prevented any system; there is no
   real history of dogma and ethics, except on the external side. He is
   frank to say: "I leave their doctrines to be judged by those whose
   right it is. For I have not set forth to record such matters, nor is it
   befitting in history" (iii. 15); that he does "not profess easily to
   understand or to expound these matters" (vi. 27); and again, "I should
   be prolix were I to enter into further particulars, and under the
   subject would be by no means an easy one to me, since I have no such
   dialectic skill" (vii. 17). He furnishes us only with such a statement
   of doctrine, as sprang out of polemics and councils and the variety of
   creeds.

   12. And so with the history of literature there is no such sustained
   account of Christian writers and works as in Eusebius; the second stage
   of historians did not see fit to be as complete and accurate as their
   exemplar in this particular, and Photius was left to gather up the
   fragments for us. What strikes us as peculiar is his confessed
   ignorance of the works of the greatest theologians. He passes by all
   the technical writings of Athanasius; he has no direct knowledge of the
   works of Hilary, though that might be excused. Of the purely
   theological works of Basil and Gregory Nazianzen, whom he regards as
   the pillars of the Nicene faith, he makes no mention; and indeed makes
   but the slightest use of their letters and special orations. Of the
   Arian theologians of all shades, he has no closer knowledge; he
   confesses at the outset that he had not read the Thalia (i. 21), but
   condemns it on Socrates' authority; and he speaks of Diodorus, bishop
   of Tarsus, in language that displays unfamiliarity with his treatises
   (viii. 2).

   13. There are no conceptions of the philosophy of history or of
   histories in general, other than those which have been discussed
   before.

   14. If we pass to the stylistics of Sozomen, we find the quality of the
   Greek to be excellent; the dedication is especially studied and
   rhetorical; the first chapter of the first book is scarcely inferior in
   these traits, after which the form becomes more abrupt, after the
   fashion of an epitomizer, and it is obviously affected by his
   authorities. The likeness to Xenophon is not continuous, any more than
   Socrates sustainedly imitates Thucydides, although in elevated
   conception, Socrates is more in the vein of that philosophic master of
   history, than Sozomen is a reflection of the writer of the Hellenics.
   The vocabulary, too, is quite meager; the same forms of expression
   occur again and again, yet Photius considers him superior in diction to
   Socrates, [1053] which only one who admires mere form above spirit, can
   affirm. Certainly it would not be the view of this more subjective age.
   Of course he reflects the decline of meaning in particles and
   prepositional prefixes and participial constructions. He does not begin
   his books with formal prefaces, such as Socrates indulges in; chapter 1
   of Book i. may, however, be regarded as introductory; and it serves to
   link Christianity with Judaism. In the distribution of his material
   there is no system agreeing with his own outline of aims or any other
   order that is discoverable. The main topics are: Secular affairs,
   relations of the emperor to Christianity, laws and privileges, missions
   and persecutions, polemics and irenics, biographies ; but there is no
   regular discussion of these, either under the reigns or in the books.
   None of the historians are any better in this regard.

   A characteristic of our historian is the admirable generalization and
   the summaries he pauses to make here and there. The most notable are in
   iii. 17, a generalized description of the period of the Constantines.
   iii. 18, a doctrinal summary. iv. 17-19, conciliar movement in the
   West. iv. 20-22, conciliar movement in the East. iv. 23-25, united
   results. vi. 6, a succinct comparison of Valens with Valentinian. vi.
   10, geographical centers of Nicenism. vi. 21, geographical centers of
   Arianism and Orthodoxy. vi. 22, geographical distribution of
   Macedonianism. vi. 26, genesis of Aëtianism (Eunomianism). vi. 27,
   geographical distribution of beliefs. vi. 28-34, geographical grouping
   of the monks. vii. 2, geographical supremacy of Arianism in the East.
   vii. 4, geographical survey of religion. vii. 17, divisions of
   Arianism. viii. 1, summary of Apostolic succession. The selective
   process is often alluded to (ii. 3, iii. 14, 15, iv. 3, 23, 27, vii.
   25, 28, ix. 1); and we must confess that he has kept a very just
   proportion in this way among the subjects he has elected for his
   narrative.

   The Period described.

   The work was to have covered the time from 323 to 439, a period of 116
   years; whereas, in fact, he writes continuously only to the death of
   Honorius as the latest event, 423, and the accession of Valentinian
   III. in 425; beyond that in time, but mentioned anticipatively in the
   narrative (ix. 2), is the transfer of the forty martyrs, which happened
   certainly after 434, the year of the election of Proclus, therefore
   probably not far from the proposed limit of his work, say 437 or 438;
   this would give a period of about 114 or 115 years. He divides the
   record of this time into nine books, distributed among the emperors.

   i. and ii. To Constantine, 323-337=14.

   iii. and iv. His sons, 337-361=24.

   v. and vi. Julian, Jovian, Valentinian I., Valens, 361-375=17.

   vii. and viii. Gratian and Valentinian II., Theodosius I., Arcadius
   (and Honorius), 375-408=33.

   ix. (Honorius) and Theodosius II., 408-437=25.

   A noticeable feature, save in the case of Book ix., is the grouping of
   books by twos, in which the intervals discussed vary from fourteen to
   thirty-three years. This grouping seems entirely arbitrary.

   For whom he wrote.

   The question for whom he wrote has been somewhat obscured by those who
   regard him simply as a plagiarist. He evidently turned himself to this
   task under the conviction that there was need of some such work as his.
   He addressed himself chiefly to Christians and not only to monks,
   because he defers to the narrow views of some friends about the
   mysteries,--and represses creeds and sacraments, for fear the book
   might fall into the hands of the uninitiated. He moreover designed his
   record, not for the more learned classes, but for the instruction of
   ordinary believers, since he professes uniformly a great modesty in
   treating the profounder themes of theology and the characters of the
   more eminent men. Yet he did not hesitate to submit it to the criticism
   of his emperor and invited the most erasive and final judgment. This is
   probably as far as we may go in the absence of any direct address to
   specific readers.

   There are five imperial letters, four synodical letters, seven
   episcopal letters, one presbyterial letter, making seventeen in all.
   This is not nearly so large a number as is given by Socrates, but we
   must remember the expressed purpose of Sozomen, that, as a rule, he
   would give abstracts only, and text when in his judgment fairness made
   it necessary. Of these documents, there are at least three found in no
   earlier author. In them all, there is only one symbol transcribed, and
   that is from Arius and Euzoïus!

   Unmentioned Authorities.

   Sozomen has refrained in large measure from indicating directly his
   chief authorities for political or ecclesiastical affairs; he has
   indicated, indeed, some minor springs, as we have seen, but the major
   ones are passed by. He imitated neither Eusebius, nor Socrates, nor
   Evagrius in this omission. He does abound in phrases indicative of
   authorities; thus of the forms of lego, legousi, legontai, elegon,
   elegeto are used somewhat sparingly, while legetai occurs over eighty
   times, and logos about twenty; of phemi, ephesen and pheme
   occasionally, while phesi or phasi introduces about thirty statements;
   eirestho and eiretai also appear in a few cases. One has no assurance
   of either the method or the validity of the sources from such vague
   terms, and it is this uncertain and incautious manner that has so often
   led critics to impeach his general worth, and it must be conceded with
   some degree of justice; the endless iteration of such words savors of
   gossip rather than history; this obscurity is not diminished by his
   persistent oimai and less frequent eikazo.

   1. In the discussion of his unmentioned authorities, the first to be
   considered is Socrates. He is nowhere hinted at, unless under an
   indefinite "some say," when Sozomen presents a group of opinions.

   Socrates preceded Sozomen by a few years, writing his history not long
   after 439. [1054] Sozomen undoubtedly produced his record later, as we
   have already seen, and it would be just as likely that Socrates should
   be in the hands of Sozomen as that Philip of Side's contemporary
   Christian History should have been open to the criticism of Socrates;
   indeed, the predecessor's work was quite probably an incentive to the
   task proposed by Sozomen to himself. The internal evidence makes the
   use sure. We have only to note how Socrates derived his statements
   about the Novatians from members connected with that body of believers;
   these very facts are reproduced by Sozomen as Socrates gives them, with
   the slightest of differences; there is no refutation of this possible.
   Socrates, therefore, manifestly preceded, and Sozomen employed the
   material thus amassed.

   There are three views of the connection: (1) that Sozomen, excepting a
   few and not very valuable additions of his own, plagiarized Socrates;
   (2) that he used the same authorities as Socrates independently, and
   the points of identity arose from the language of the original in the
   hands of both; (3) that Socrates was his guide to the chief writers
   from whom he drew directly with more or less freedom; and when no other
   light presented itself or was to be found, he would use his
   path-finder. There is scarcely a more fascinating and genuine field for
   analytical criticism than this. It should be remarked at the outset
   that we cannot justly apply this term plagiarism, in its modern sense,
   to the use of material current in these earlier days of history. There
   was no more intention to appropriate the work of another in Sozomen,
   than there was in Socrates, when he fails to note his authority, and
   yet very evidently has followed him closely; or when Theodoret has
   taken his stuff from Sozomen, and says nothing about the original. To
   assail Sozomen as if he were a deliberate thief, and stigmatize him as
   a feeble reviser of Socrates, is wholly unfair and unwarranted by the
   general usage of his day and by the facts of the case. In no way can it
   be proved that Sozomen was a general plagiarist in the opprobrium and
   iniquity conveyed by the modern use of that term. That Socrates was the
   finer mind, that he had larger sympathies, that he was concerned to
   reproduce documents in an ampler degree, that he follows the
   development of the Church with a sharper and brighter criticism, no one
   can doubt; he is conspicuously superior in almost every quality of a
   historian, and confined himself more nearly to the modern idea of which
   the science should aim to do; but that does not set aside the distinct
   and supplemental value of Sozomen and his fullness in lines, however
   zigzag, which had been neglected by others. The acknowledged precedence
   of Socrates does not warrant us in assailing the fidelity of the lesser
   light. Since the notes are designed to indicate the relationship
   between the two, the passages need not be anticipated here. (2) The
   second view, that Sozomen made an independent use of the same source
   which Holzhausen revived, Stäudlin supported, Hefele and Nolte have
   espoused, seems less tenable than the first. The Novatian material
   cannot, under any possible conditions, be so explained; the arrangement
   of the details in eight of the books will not permit view. The very
   corrections of that arrangement require us to be convinced that
   Socrates was in the corrector's eye; the close resemblance of language
   in many places where he might easily have expanded from the originals,
   but preferred to confine himself to the equally meagre tracings of his
   predecessor, leave no basis for this solution. (3) The third
   explanation of the interrelation seems thus far the most accurate.
   [1055] Sozomen took Socrates for a guide in the main, (a) as to
   consecution of events, (b) as to sources, much as students would use a
   Church history to base their own studies upon. Socrates was a director
   to the authorities; these Sozomen would use freely; when they failed
   him, he would take the facts given by Socrates, precisely as he did
   those which Eusebius or Sabinus furnished, because he had nothing
   better, and in spite probably of his own inquiries; for let us remember
   how he insists that he has investigated the originals, and that he had
   been conscientious in his researches. Now it must be said in further
   modification of this statement:

   (a) That some of the sources obviously consulted by both were doubtless
   known to Sozomen without Socrates to point them out. Rufinus and
   Eusebius and Sabinus were known to everybody. In all such cases we may
   concede an independent reading of those authors, and yet the order in
   which the subject-matter is arranged is at times more that of his
   guide-book than of his original.

   (b) Moreover, he introduces many new outlines and abstracts,
   particularly in the transactions of the synods.

   (c) He also has independent sources of biography.

   (d) His ninth book is wholly unique and entirely out of the
   leading-strings of the master, for unexplained reasons.

   The notes also try to indicate in a measure these more independent
   traits.

   2. The next unmentioned source is Rufinus, in his continuation of
   Eusebius in two books; this Sozomen certainly read independently of
   Socrates, very likely in a Greek translation. That author's Historia
   Monachorum also was sifted for a few of the monastic biographies; in
   these cases there is a closer resemblance to Rufinus than to the
   parallel sketches of Palladius.

   3. Eusebius' Life of Constantine is a primary source for Books i. and
   ii. In all the events pertaining to that emperor, it is drawn upon
   freely, just as freely as Socrates employs it, or as Sozomen handles
   Socrates.

   4. Athanasius is also used independently, although in collocating the
   events, Socrates is followed. There is direct reference to one work
   only (v. 12), as we have seen. The unmentioned are as follows:--

   The Life of St. Antony: Antonii Vita.

   Epistola de Synodis Arimini in Italia et Seleuciæ in Isauria
   celebratis.

   Epistola ad Serapionem, de morte Arii.

   Synodicon; lost.

   Tomus ad Antiochenses.

   Epistola ad Episcopos Ægypti et Libyæ; ep. encyclica contra Arianos.

   Epistola Encyclica ad Episcopos.

   Historia Arianorum ad Monachos.

   Apologia contra Arianos.

   Apologia ad Constantium imperatorem.

   Epistolæ heortasticæ.

   5. Philostorgius: Historia Ecclesiastica, also furnished occasional
   material, as even the excerpts remaining to us indicate.

   6. Sabinus: Collection of Synods (Sunagoge ton sunodon), which is lost;
   this book was written in the Macedonian and Arian interest; the author
   is mentioned by Socrates and criticised for his partiality. We can
   observe how Sozomen used it, where he adds to the statements of
   Socrates, which the latter had borrowed from that work. These additions
   are quite frequent in the transactions of the synods; and again a few
   records of councils, otherwise unknown, are thus preserved for us. We
   have here a proof of how Sozomen improved on his guide in the details.

   7. Philippus of Side; the Christian History (christianike historia); a
   few fragments are preserved; Socrates criticises him severely. [1056]

   8. For the laws, outside of the records alluded to, he probably used
   the Codex Gregorianus and the Codex Hermogenianus, his old text-books,
   and not unlikely the Codex Theodosianus (438).

   9. Basil the Great: the limited use is indicated by the notes.

   10. Gregory Nazianzen: Orationes contra Julianum. Other occasional
   citations are indicated in the notes.

   11. Sulpicius Severus: vita S. Martiniwas undoubtedly the source,
   possibly through a Greek translation of the same, for the summary of
   that saint's life in iii. 14.

   Historia sacra: sometimes there is a hint as if this work had been
   before him.

   12. Palladius: Historia Lausica was not so constant a companion as some
   have suggested; Sozomen has rather borrowed from the sources out of
   which the bishop of Helenopolis gathered his sketches of the monks.

   Dialogus de vita S. Joannis Chrysostomi was used in narrating the
   incidents of John's life in Book viii. There is no indication of any
   large draught of Chrysostom's own writings: they may have been used for
   a few suggestions, contained in the orations before mentioned.

   One does not feel sure that Hieronymus or Orosius came under his eye.

   He does not seem to have made any direct use of Ammianus Marcellinus
   (Res gestæ), nor of the earlier Latin chroniclers. The points of
   resemblance with Eutropius (Breviarium Historiæ Romanæ) are very
   doubtful in my judgment; Eunapius (ex historia excerpta et fragmenta)
   seems to have been used in his full form; Zosimus (Historia) pretty
   surely; and for the ninth book, hardly with a doubt the full
   Olympiodorus, of whom fragments only remain, and yet in that same ninth
   book there are entirely independent political chapters whose source
   cannot yet be determined.

   The Ninth Book.

   The most curious feature of all is Book ix., in the entire change of
   its method; even were the ecclesiastical affairs to have been
   presented, he has given here in remarkable excess the events affecting
   the Western state; he has done it nowhere else; to be sure, he proposes
   it as a demonstration of the value of imperial piety, and of the
   ever-present Divine grace, but nowhere else has he done this in so
   cumulative a form. Some wonderful change came over his purpose, whether
   that were a fuller view of the relation between state and church, or
   the desire to deepen the impression of his philosophy of history; or
   did some imperial domestic catastrophe make him reluctant to dwell upon
   the sad events which darkened the court he had so glorified?

   The grave question arises, Is anything of Book ix. lost?

   That it is unfinished cannot be doubted; for (a) In the Proëmium he
   announces his purpose to carry it to the year a.d. 439, or the
   seventeenth consulate of Theodosius; but this is not done with any of
   his ordinary fullness, although his hints reach beyond, as we have
   seen. (b) In lauding Pulcheria (ix. 1) he remarks, "That new heresies
   have not prevailed in our time, we shall find to be due especially to
   her, as we shall subsequently see." Here is the declared purpose of
   delineating the history of Nestorianism and its overthrow, but there is
   no appearance of the struggle in the record itself; he altogether
   passes by Nestorius, as bishop of Constantinople. (c) The record of the
   forty martyrs he purposely took out of its normal order, to illustrate
   the excellence of Pulcheria; a late event is anticipated, but the whole
   of what would have been its normal setting is not there. (d) One would
   naturally expect that a book which had thus far treated mainly of state
   difficulties would have the usual balance, at least, and that
   ecclesiastical affairs would have preponderated in the remaining
   chapters; but there is only an initial chapter. Seventeen chapters are
   not his usual tale for a book; there is an evident break; the
   discussion of Nestorianism is not written. Most of all would one expect
   some allusion to the restoration of Chrysostom under Proclus. (e) In
   ix. 16, he says, "Among other relics, those of Zechariah, the very
   ancient prophet, and of Stephen, who was ordained deacon by the
   Apostles, were discovered; and it seems incumbent upon me to describe
   the mode, since the discovery of each was marvelous and divine;" but he
   gives only the invention of Zechariah (c. 17). The story of Stephen
   fails us, and would doubtless have followed immediately. It was his
   purpose to narrate the story,--this story which Theophanes and
   Marcellinus mention and Lucianus wrote a book about. (f) In c. ix. 17,
   this is confirmed; for he says, "I shall first speak of the relics of
   the prophet"; to his second he does not come. (g) The close is abrupt;
   one feels instinctively that something is amiss. Hence the work, as we
   have it, is obviously not complete.

   Did he finish it, and is the conclusion lost?

   The mistake into which Gregory I. fell in ascribing to Sozomen the
   commendation of Theodore of Mopsuestia, with which Theodoret really
   closes his history, led Baronius to maintain that we did not have the
   whole of Sozomen; and others have asserted the same for reasons which
   are indeed sufficient to prove that the history is unfinished, but not
   that anything is lost. That we have all that Sozomen wrote is more
   likely, because the Tripartite History at x. 24 makes the last use of
   Sozomen at viii. 25; it would surely have gone further in its
   dependence upon him had the later controversy been treated of, since he
   had been already a chief authority. Nicephorus Callistus, Historia
   Ecclesiastica, xiv. 8, gives the account of the finding of Zechariah in
   c. 9; the story of Stephen in c. 10; then the story of the forty
   martyrs. His source beyond is Socrates, until Evagrius takes up the
   thread of affairs. If Sozomen had written the more recent events
   parallel with Socrates, Nicephorus would undoubtedly have followed him
   as before. Of Theophanes, one cannot speak so confidently. Moreover, we
   cannot help asking, since we have Socrates, Theodoret, and Evagrius
   complete, why should Sozomen, who was so admired an author, have
   suffered any loss? Now, if we have Sozomen entire so far as he wrote,
   why did he stop where he did? There are no sufficient subjective
   reasons to be offered. It could scarcely have been in any unfavorable
   criticism of his prince, for the work seems to have been accepted by
   his imperial patron; and there was certainly nothing as objectionable
   in Sozomen, as in Socrates or in Olympiodorus. Nor is it likely that
   the unhappiness which invaded the court, the domestic jealousies, which
   rent its religious as well as connubial peace, or the quarrels over
   Cyrus or Paulinus or Chrysaphius, in any way restrained him; for he was
   beyond some, if not all of these agitations, at the time of his
   writing, and he had deliberately chosen to ignore such noble personages
   as Anthemius, Troïlus, Synesius, Aurelianus, and Eudocia, so that we
   can argue little from his silence, save his manifest jealousy for
   Pulcheria, and his hostility to certain more liberal tendencies
   developed under Eudocia. The Nestorian controversy would have been a
   choice field wherein to exalt the influence of Pulcheria, as he himself
   suggested. On the whole, one is constrained to believe that Sozomen
   died before he had completed the record which he had proposed to
   himself. He must have been nearing his seventieth year when thus
   suddenly arrested in his chosen study.

   The Major uses made of his Work.

   The major uses of him subsequently were by:

   (a) Epiphanius Scholasticus, who made a translation into Latin, which
   Cassiodorus abbreviated, polished, and incorporated in the Historia
   Tripartita. [1057]

   (b) The deacon Liberatus, in his Historia Nestorianorum, used the
   Tripartita.

   (c) Theophanes, in his Chronographia.

   (d) Theodorus Lector in his Historia Tripartita.

   (e) Nicephorus Callistus, in his Historia Ecclesiastica incorporating
   Theodorus' Tripartita.

   The Errors.

   The errors are numerous, as already suggested by Possevin, on dogmatic
   grounds; Du Pin, and more recently by Harnack, for historic reasons.
   They are due to the lack of a systematic chronology, and the blind
   copying of his authority, especially Socrates, and occasionally to his
   attempts to correct the order given by his authority.

   B. Texts.

   I. Manuscripts.--It would indeed be a desirable work to have a uniform
   apparatus of the codices, not only of Sozomen, but of all the Greek
   Church historians. Admirable as is Heinchen's survey of Eusebian mss.,
   it is neither uniform nor complete. No editor of Sozomen from Stephen
   down, has deemed it necessary to work up the detail even as well as
   Heinchen. Nolte evidently had the material in hand, but the labor
   remains to be done. The numbers and positions of many codices have been
   changed since the days of Valesius, Montfaucon, and Hænelius, and it is
   impossible to bring harmony out of the differences without direct
   inspection. It would seem as if no one had consulted some of those
   mentioned by Montfaucon; e.g. in the Inventarium mss. monasterii S.
   Petri Carnutensis, the title is given without number; Socratis,
   Sozomenis et Theodoreti historia Ecclesiastica, vol. in fol. notat P.
   sæculo ix. (ii. 1246); and the two described by Hænelius (a) Socratis,
   Sozomenis historia ecclesiastica memb. fol. exemp. vetus., at Chartres
   (Fasc. i. col. 130). (b) iv. 2, Hermiæ Sozomeni Salaminis, historicæ
   ecclesiasticæ lib. ix. (Fasc. iii. c. 93) in the Escorial.

   II. Editions of Text.--1. The first printed text without translation
   was by Robert Stephen: Eusebii Pamphili, Ecclesiasticæ historiæ, libri
   x.; ejusdem de vita Constantini, libri v.; Socratis, libri vii.;
   Theodoreti episc. Cyrenensis, libri v.; Collectaneorum ex historia
   ecclesiastica Theodori lectoris, libri ii.; Hermiæ Sozomeni, libri ix.;
   Evagrii, libri vi.; Græce Excud. Rob. Steph. Lutetiæ Parisior. (pridie
   Cal. Jul.) 1544. Fol.

   The sole manuscript at the basis of this edition is the Codex Regius
   bibliothecæ Parisiensis, n. 1437 (Nolte, 1444) Possevin (App. crit.)
   says: A Græca vero edito proviget ann. 1545, but this seems a mistake.

   2. The next edition of the text was accompanied with a Latin
   translation; Græca et Latine ex interpretatione J. Christophorsoni et
   recognitione Suffredi Petri una cum variis lectionibus, J.
   Christophorsoni, Jos. Scaligeri, Jac. Cuiaci, Jan. Gruteri, Jac.
   Bongarsii, Col. All. (Geneva) 1612. 2 vols. in fol. This was the text
   of Stephen with marginal notes of the above [see Hussey, Nolte]. The
   sources of the notes are not sure.

   3. Reprint of Geneva edition: Bibliotheca magna veterum patrum et
   antiq. Scriptorum eccles. primo a Margarino de la Bigne collecta. Tom.
   v. has Soc. and Soz. with the Latin of Christophorson and Suff. Petrus.
   Colon. 1618-22.

   4. The edition of Valesius, 1659-1668, with a new translation by
   himself. Socratis Scholastici et Hermiæ Sozomeni historia
   ecclesiastica. Henricus Valesius græcum textum collatis mss. Codicibus
   emendavit, Latine vertit, et annotationibus illustravit. Adjecta est ad
   calcem disputatio Archelai Episcopi adversus Manichæum. Parisiis, 1668.
   Fol. In this edition there are the preface to the reader, explaining
   his sources; an essay on the life and writings of the historians; and
   the text is followed by annotations. This edition is conspicuous for
   the number of codices, more or less accurately collated. The Codex
   Fuketanus is his chief reliance; the previous annotations were used; he
   claims to have made no alteration without warrant.

   5. Biblioteca Maxima Veterum Patrum M. de la Bigne, Lugd. 1677. In vol.
   vii. of this series; this reproduces the Genevan edition.

   6. A reprint of Valesius. Eusebii Pamph. Ep. Cæsar. et Theodoreti,
   Evagrii, Socratis et Sozomeni Historia Ecclesiastica. Gr. Lat. cum
   notis Valesii. 3 Tomi. Paris, 1678. Fol.

   7. A reprint of Valesius. Socratis et Sozomeni historia ecclesiastica.
   Gr. et Lat. Paris 1686. Fol.

   8. A reprint of Valesius. Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ Eus. Pamph., Soc.,
   Soz., Theodore ti, et Evag. cum excerptis ex historia Philost. et
   Theod. Lec. Græc. et Lat. c. Annot. H. Valesii. 3 Tomi. Moguntiæ,
   1677-79. Fol.

   9. Another reprint of Valesius, but from the Mayence edition: Historiæ
   Ecclesiasticæ Eus., Soc., etc. Græc.-Lat. 3 Tomi. Amst. 1695. Fol.

   10. Historiæ ecclesiasticæ Scriptores Græci cum excerptis ex historia
   Philostorgi et Theodori Lect. Gr. et Lat. c. interpret. H. Valesii.
   Amst. 1699. Fol. (Georgi.)

   11. A separate edition of Socrates and Sozomen, with the usual Valesian
   apparatus, and the debate of Bishop Archelaus against the Manichæans:
   Socratis Scholastici et Hermiæ Sozomeni historia ecclesiastica græce et
   latine. Henricus Valesius Græcum textum collatis mss. codicibus
   emendavit, Latine vertit, et Annotationibus illustravit. Adjecta est ad
   calcem disputatio Archelai Episcopi adversus Manichæum. Ad novissimam
   editionem Parisiensem castigatissime recusa prostat Amstelodami apud
   Henricum Wetstenium. 1700.

   12. Valesian text as basis and apparatus, with new emendations. General
   title:

   Eusebii Pamphili, Socratis Scholastici, Hermiæ Sozomeni, Theodoreti et
   Evagrii, Item Philostorgii et Theodori Lectoris quæ extant historiæ
   ecclesiasticæ græce et latine, in tres tomos distributæ. Henricus
   Valesius græcum textum ex mss. codicibus emendavit, latine vertit et
   Annotationibus illustravit.

   Gulielmus Reading novas Elucidationes, præsertim Chronologicas, in hac
   Editione adjecit. Cantabrigiæ, 1720.

   Special title: Socratis Scholastici et Hermiæ Sozomeni historia
   ecclesiastica græce et latine. Henricus Valesius græcum textum collatis
   mss. codicibus emendavit, latine vertit et Adnotationibus illustravit.
   Adjecta est ad calcem disputatio Archelai Episcopi adversus Manichæum.
   Hanc Editionem Criticis plurium Eruditorum Observationibus locupletavit
   Gulielmus Reading. Cantabrigiæ, 1720.

   He restores readings of Stephen for some changes made by Valesius; uses
   Valesius' own manuscript annotations, suggestions of Lowth, Casaubon's
   variæ lectiones from the codex Jonesianus, and the codex Jonesianus
   itself. But there is no general collation.

   13. Reprint of the Reading edition. 3 vols. Augustæ Taurinorum (Turin).

   14. Valesian text as basis; partially new apparatus and emendations.

   Sozomeni ecclesiastica historia edidit Robertus Hussey, S.T.B. Oxonii:
   e typographeo academico, 1860. Three volumes, two of text, and the
   third of annotations. The Latin version is by Valesius.

   Hussey died before completing his work; the apparatus was prepared by
   John Barrow. Besides other not far-reaching collations, Hussey used a
   codex in the Bodleian, called the codex Barrocianus (B.), and a partial
   collation of codex Severniensis, which is of inferior value.

   15. Reproduction of Reading-Valesius:

   Patrologiæ Cursus Completus.

   Socratis Scholastici, Hermiæ Sozomeni Historia Ecclesiastica. Henricus
   Valesius græcum textum collatis mss. codicibus emendavit, latine vertit
   notis illustravit; cujus editionem criticis observationibus
   locupletavit Gul. Reading. Accurante et denuo recognoscente. J. P.
   Migne. Paris. 1864.

   16. The English catalogue announced in August, 1874: Sozomeni Historia
   Ecclesiastica, edited by Robert Hussey, vol. i., 8°, Macmillan; but it
   did not appear.

   C. Textual Criticism.

   We have here (1) the apparatus mentioned in the greater editions; (2)
   the marginal notes and papers of various readings by Bishop
   Christophorson, Scaliger, Casaubon, Curicius, Gurterius, etc. (3) The
   solitary work of Dr. Nolte, who, in 1860, wrote a recension of Hussey's
   edition of Sozomen. Theolog. Q. Schrift. 1861. iii. 417-451; as he had
   done for Socrates, and did later for Evagrius. He dwells especially on
   the valuable readings which could be derived from the translation of
   Epiphanius Scholasticus and from Nicephorus Callistus.

   This shows the urgency of collation de novo, and a new edition of the
   text.

   D. Analytical Criticism.

   Besides the meagre apparatus of the editions, the following works
   assist in the study, although some are not directly related.

   Theodoretus in scribenda historia sacra usi sunt, adiuncta eorum

   he translated Theodoret, Socrates, and Sozomen. This version,

   Part IV.--Conclusion.

   The original translation, with its many excellences, seems to belong to
   an earlier school. It is free both in enlargement and in compression;
   words at times, and occasionally clauses, are inverted. The editor felt
   the difficulty of recasting such a flowing style; yet, in spite of the
   resulting infelicity, he felt constrained to make every possible
   correction, and these have been very numerous and extended in caption
   and text.

   Sozomen uniformly describes the ancient heathen cult, of whatever form
   it might be, as Hellenism, and its followers, Hellenists. It seemed
   advisable to retain the rendering "paganism," which the first
   translator used toward the middle and the end of his work, although he
   had not been uniform in the beginning; any other translation would
   cause a constant confusion between nationality and religion.

   In order to give a better impression of the author and text, the
   spelling of the proper names indicated by the text has been adhered to;
   the orthography "Novatus" is not a real exception. Where the spelling
   of a proper name in the caption differs from that of the text, the
   differences of origin between the two must be borne in mind. To the
   Pseudo-Nicephorus are due the headings; these variations have been
   preserved purposely.

   The notes have been for the greater part limited to the sources,
   previous or contemporary. It has not been deemed necessary to load the
   text with references to the literature, ancient or modern, sufficiently
   indicated in the Bibliography. It is just for the editor to say, that
   while the literature is not unfamiliar to him, he does not believe in
   the modern German method of annotation and allusion to every book under
   the sun, to the grave impediment of individual study. Similarly, the
   dictionaries show the biography and archæology in a better form than
   can be compressed into a note. Nor did the editor think it best to
   introduce into the translation any technical discussion as to the
   errors of Sozomen.

   Prefatory Remarks, by Valesius,

   concerning the

   Life and Writings of Sozomen.

   ------------------------

   Hermias Sozomen practiced the law at Constantinople, at the same time
   with Socrates. His ancestors were not mean; they were originally
   natives of Palestine, being inhabitants of a village near Gaza, called
   Bethelia. This village was very populous in times past, and had most
   stately and ancient churches. But the most glorious structure of them
   all was the Pantheon, situated on an artificial hill, which was the
   tower as it were of Bethelia, as Sozomen relates in chap. xv. of his
   fifth book. The grandfather of Hermias Sozomen was born in that
   village, and first converted to the Christian faith by Hilarion the
   monk. For when Alaphion, an inhabitant of the same village, was
   possessed with a devil, and the Jews and physicians, attempting to cure
   him, could do him no good by their enchantments, Hilarion, by a bare
   invocation of the name of God, cast out the devil. Sozomen's
   grandfather, and Alaphion himself, amazed at this miracle, with their
   whole families embraced the Christian religion. The grandfather of
   Sozomen was eminent for his expositions of the Sacred Scriptures, being
   a person endowed with a polite wit, and an acuteness of understanding;
   and besides, he was well skilled in literature. Therefore he was highly
   esteemed by the Christians inhabiting Gaza, Ascalon, and the places
   adjacent, as being useful and necessary for the propagating of
   religion, and could easily unloose the knots of the Sacred Scriptures.
   But Alaphion's descendants excelled others in their sanctity of life,
   in kindness to the indigent, and in other virtues; and they were the
   first that built churches and monasteries there, as Sozomen says in the
   passage above cited, where he also adds, that some holy persons of
   Alaphion's family were surviving even in his own days, with whom he
   himself conversed when very young, and concerning whom he promises to
   speak more afterwards. Most probably he means Salamanes, Phusco,
   Malchio, and Crispio, brothers, concerning whom he speaks in chap.
   xxxii. of his sixth book. For he there says that these brethren,
   instructed in the monastic discipline by Hilarion, were, during the
   empire of Valens, eminent in the monasteries of Palestine; that they
   lived near Bethelia, a village in the country of the Gazites, and were
   descendants of a noble family in those parts. He mentions the same
   persons in the fifteenth chapter of book viii., where he says that
   Crispio was Epiphanius's archdeacon. It is evident, therefore, that the
   brothers were of Alaphion's family. Alaphion, too, was related to
   Sozomen's grandfather, as we may conjecture; first, because the
   grandfather of Sozomen is said to have been converted (together with
   his whole family) to the Christian religion, upon account of Alaphion's
   wonderful cure, whom Hilarion had healed by calling on the name of
   Almighty God. Secondly, this conjecture is confirmed by what Sozomen
   relates, viz., that when he was very young, he conversed familiarly
   with the aged monks that were of Alaphion's family. And, lastly, from
   the fact that Sozomen took his name from those persons who were either
   the sons or grandchildren of Alaphion. For he was called Salamanes
   Hermias Sozomenus (as Photius declares in his Bibliotheca), from the
   name of that Salamanes who, as we observed before, was the brother of
   Phusco, Malchio, and Crispio. Wherefore Nicephorus, and others, are
   mistaken in supposing that Sozomen had the surname of Salaminius
   because he was born at Salamis, a city of Cyprus. But we have before
   shown from Sozomen's own testimony, that he was not born in Cyprus, but
   in Palestine. For his grandfather was not only a Palestinian, as is
   above said, but Sozomen himself was also educated in Palestine, in the
   bosom (so to say) of those monks who were of Alaphion's family. From
   this education Sozomen seems to have imbibed that most ardent love of a
   monastic life and discipline, which he declares in so many places of
   his history. Hence it is, that in his books he is not content to relate
   who were the fathers and founders of monastic philosophy; but he also
   carefully relates their successors and disciples, who followed this way
   of life both in Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, and also in Pontus,
   Armenia, and Osdroëna. Hence also it is, that in the twelfth chapter of
   the first book of his history, he has proposed to be read (in the
   beginning as it were) that gorgeous account of the monastic philosophy.
   For he supposed that he should have been ungrateful, had he not after
   this manner at least made a return of thanks to those in whose
   familiarity he had lived, and from whom, when he was a youth, he had
   received such eminent examples of a good conversation, as he himself
   intimates, in the opening of his first book. It is inferred that
   Sozomen was educated at Gaza, not only from the passage above
   mentioned, but also from chap. xxviii. of his seventh book, where
   Sozomen says that he himself had seen Zeno, bishop of Majuma, for this
   Majuma is a sea-port belonging to the Gazites. Although Zeno was nearly
   a hundred years old, he was never absent from the morning and evening
   hymns, unless sickness detained him. After this Sozomen applied himself
   to the profession of the law. He was a student of the civil law at
   Berytus, a city of Phoenicia, not far distant from his own country,
   where there was a famous school of civil law. But he practiced the law
   at Constantinople, as himself asserts, book ii. chap. iii. And yet he
   seems not to have been very much employed in pleading of causes; for at
   the same time that he was an advocate in Constantinople, he wrote his
   Ecclesiastical History; as may be concluded from his own words in the
   last-mentioned passage. Before he wrote his nine books of
   Ecclesiastical History, Sozomen composed a Breviary of Ecclesiastical
   Affairs, from our Saviour's ascension to the deposition of Licinius.
   This work was comprised in two books, as himself bears witness in the
   opening of his first book; but these two books are now lost.

   In the composure of his History, Sozomen has made use of a style
   neither too low nor too high, but one between both, as is most
   agreeable to a writer of ecclesiastical affairs. Photius prefers
   Sozomen's style to that of Socrates, and we agree with him in his
   criticism. But though Sozomen is superior in the elegance of his
   expression, yet Socrates excels him in judgment. For Socrates judges
   incomparably well, both of men, and also of ecclesiastical business and
   affairs; and there is nothing in his works but what is grave and
   serious, nothing that can be expunged as superfluous. But on the
   contrary, some passages occur in Sozomen that are trivial and childish.
   Of this sort is his digression in his first book concerning the
   building of the city Hemona, and concerning the Argonauts, who carried
   the ship Argo on their shoulders some furlongs, and also his
   description of Daphne without the walls of the city Antioch, in chap.
   xix. of his sixth book; to which we must add that observation of his,
   concerning the beauty of the body, where he treats of that virgin at
   whose house the blessed Athanasius was concealed a long while. Lastly,
   his ninth book contains little else besides warlike events, which ought
   to have no place in an Ecclesiastical History. Sozomen's style,
   however, is not without its faults. For the periods of his sentences
   are only joined together by the particles de and te, than which there
   is nothing more troublesome. Should any one attentively read the
   epistle in which Sozomen dedicates his work to Theodosius junior, he
   will find it true that Sozomen was no great orator.

   It remains, that we inquire which of these two authors, Socrates or
   Sozomen, wrote first, and which of them borrowed, or rather stole, from
   the other. Certainly, since both of them wrote almost the same things
   of the same transactions, inasmuch as they both began at the same
   beginning, and concluded their history at the same point (both
   beginning from the reign of Constantine, and ending at the seventeenth
   consulate of Theodosius junior), it must needs be true, that one of
   them robbed the other's desk. This sort of theft was committed by many
   of the Grecian writers, as Porphyry testifies, Eusebius' Præparatio
   Evangelica, bk. x. But which was the plagiary, Socrates or Sozomen, it
   is hard to say, in regard both of them lived in the same times, and
   both wrote their history in the empire of Theodosius junior. Therefore,
   in the disquisition of this question, we must make use of conjecture.
   So Porphyry in the above-mentioned book, since it was uncertain whether
   Hyperides had stolen from Demosthenes, or Demosthenes from Hyperides,
   because both had lived in the same time, decided to use conjecture. Let
   us therefore see upon which of them falls the suspicion of theft.
   Indeed, this is my sentiment, I suppose that the inferior does
   frequently steal from the superior, and the junior from the senior. But
   Sozomen is in my judgment far inferior to Socrates; and he betook
   himself to writing his history when he was younger than Socrates. For
   he wrote it whilst he was yet an advocate, as I observed before. Now,
   the profession of the advocates amongst the Romans was not perpetual,
   but temporary. Lastly, he that adds something to the other, and
   sometimes amends the other, seems to have written last. But Sozomen now
   and then adds some passages to Socrates, and in some places dissents
   from him, as Photius has observed, and we have hinted in our
   annotations. Sozomen therefore seems to have written last. And this is
   the opinion of almost all modern writers, who place Socrates before
   Sozomen. So Bellarmine in his book "De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis";
   who is followed by Miræus, Labbæus, and Vossius. Amongst the ancients,
   Cassiodorus, Photius, and Nicephorus name Socrates in the first place.
   Although Cassiodorus is found to have varied; for in the preface of the
   Tripartite History, he inverts the order, and names Theodoret first,
   ranks Sozomen in the second place, and refers to Socrates as the last.
   So also Theodorus Lector recounts them in his epistle which he prefixed
   to his Tripartite History. Thus far concerning Sozomen.

   Memoir of Sozomen.

   ------------------------

   Little more than cursory allusions to Sozomen occur in the works of
   contemporary writers; and the materials for a memoir of his life are
   therefore at best but few and scanty. We should, in fact, be destitute
   of almost all knowledge as to his birth, education, mode of life, and
   private history, had not some information on these points been
   furnished by himself. In the work before us, the only one which has
   caused his name to be handed down to posterity, he draws aside the
   curtain which would otherwise have concealed his origin and parentage,
   and makes known to us a portion of his family history. He tells us
   (book v. chap. xv.) that his grandfather was a native of Palestine, and
   of Pagan parentage; that he, with all his family, was converted to
   Christianity on witnessing a miracle wrought by St. Hilarion; and that,
   being possessed of great mental endowments, he afterwards became
   eminently useful to the men of Gaza and Ascalon, by his extraordinary
   power in expounding the most obscure passages of Holy Writ.

   Our author himself seems to have been born about the beginning of the
   fifth century. He tells us that in his youth some of the founders of
   monasticism in Palestine were still living, although they had reached a
   very advanced period of life, and that he had enjoyed opportunities of
   intercourse with them. To this circumstance may probably be attributed
   the tone of reverential admiration in which Sozomen invariably speaks
   of the ascetic inhabitants of the desert.

   The education of Sozomen was conducted with a view to the legal
   profession; and he studied for some years at Berytus, then noted for
   its school of law. He afterwards established himself at Constantinople,
   and, it has been conjectured, held some office at the court of
   Theodosius the Younger. He is reputed to have possessed some skill in
   the law, but it is certain that he never attained any eminence in his
   profession. It is only in the character of an historian that he has
   rendered himself conspicuous. His first work was an abridgment of
   Ecclesiastical History, from the ascension of our Lord to the
   deposition of Licinius (a.d. 324), but this is not extant. The work
   before us seems to have been commenced about the year 443. It embraces
   a period of 117 years; namely, from a.d. 323 to a.d. 439. It is
   generally admitted to have suffered many alterations and mutilations;
   and this may, in some measure, serve to account for the frequent
   inaccuracies in point both of narrative and of chronology which pervade
   the nine books of which it is composed. It is evident, from the very
   abrupt termination of this history, that it is but a fragmentary
   portion of a larger work. The precise object of Sozomen in undertaking
   to write this history is not apparent, as exactly the same ground had
   previously been gone over by Socrates, if we except the ninth book of
   the former, which is almost entirely devoted to the political history
   of the times. The learned Photius prefers the style of Sozomen to that
   of Socrates; yet Sozomen frequently evinces great deficiency in point
   of judgment, and on many occasions enlarges upon details which are
   altogether omitted by Socrates, as unworthy of the dignity of
   Ecclesiastical History. To us, there is manifest advantage in
   possessing these separate chronicles of the same events. Facts which
   might perhaps have been doubted, if not rejected, had they rested upon
   the sole authority of a single writer, are admitted as unquestionable
   when authenticated by the combined testimony of Socrates, of Sozomen,
   and of Theodoret. And, indeed, the very discrepancies which, on several
   minor points, are discernible in the histories of these writers, are
   not without their use, inasmuch as they tend to the removal of all
   suspicion of connivance or collusion.

   Address to the Emperor Theodosius by Salaminius Hermias Sozomen, and
   Proposal for an Ecclesiastical History.

   ------------------------

   The popular saying is, that the former emperors were zealous about some
   useful matter or other; such as were fond of ornaments, cared for the
   royal purple, the crown, and the like; those who were studious of
   letters, composed some mythical work or treatise capable of fascinating
   its readers; those who were practiced in war, sought to send the weapon
   straight to the mark, to hit wild beasts, to hurl the spear, or to leap
   upon the horse. Every one who was devoted to a craft which was pleasing
   to the rulers announced himself at the palace. One brings a precious
   stone not easily susceptible of polish; another undertakes to prepare a
   more brilliant color than the purple robe; one dedicates a poem or
   treatise; another introduces an expert and strange fashion of armor.

   It is considered the greatest and a regal thing for the ruler of the
   whole people to possess, at least, one of the homely virtues; but no
   such great estimate has been made of piety, which is, after all, the
   true ornament of the empire. Thou, however, O most powerful Emperor
   Theodosius, hast in a word, by God's help, cultivated every virtue.
   Girt with the purple robe and crown, a symbol of thy dignity to
   onlookers, thou wearest within always that true ornament of
   sovereignty, piety and philanthropy. Whence it happens that poets and
   writers, and the greater part of thy officers as well as the rest of
   thy subjects, concern themselves on every occasion with thee and thy
   deeds. And when thou presidest as ruler of contests and judge of
   discourses, thou art not robbed of thy accuracy by any artificial sound
   and form, but thou awardest the prize sincerely, observing whether the
   diction is suitable to the design of the composition; so also with
   respect to the form of words, divisions, order, unity, phraseology,
   construction, arguments, thought, and narrative. Thou recompensest the
   speakers with thy favorable judgment and applause, as well as with
   golden images, erection of statues, gifts, and every kind of honor.
   Thou showest greater personal favor toward the speakers than the
   ancient Cretans did toward the much-sung Homer; or the Alevadæ did to
   Simonides; or Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily to Plato, the companion
   of Socrates; or Philip the Macedonian, to Theopompus the historian; or
   the Emperor Severus to Oppianus, who related in verse the kinds,
   nature, and catching of fish. For after the Cretans had rewarded Homer
   with a thousand nummi, they inscribed the amount of the gift on a
   public column as if to boast of their excessive munificence. The
   Alevadæ, Dionysius, and Philip were not more reserved than the Cretans,
   who boasted of their modest and philosophical government, but quickly
   imitated their column, so that they might not be inferior in their
   donative. But when Severus bestowed upon Oppianus a golden gift for
   each line of his moderate verse, he so astonished everybody with his
   liberality, that the poems of Oppianus are popularly called golden
   words to this day. Such were the donations of former lovers of learning
   and discourses. But thou, O Emperor, surpassest any of the ancients in
   thy liberality to letters, and thou seemest to me to do this not
   unreasonably. For while thou strivest to conquer all by thy virtues,
   thou dost also conduct thine own affairs successfully, according to thy
   thorough knowledge of the story of those ancient affairs, so
   prosperously directed by the Greeks and Romans. Rumor says that during
   the day, thou takest military and bodily exercise, and arrangest
   affairs of state by giving judicial decisions, and by making note of
   what is necessary, and by observation, both in public and private, of
   the things which ought to be done; and at night that thou busiest
   thyself with books. It is a saying, that there serves thee for the
   study of these works, a lamp which causes the oil to flow automatically
   into the wick, by means of some mechanism, so that not one of the
   servants in the palace should be compelled to be taxed with thy labors,
   and to do violence to nature by fighting against sleep. Thus thou art
   humane and gentle, both to those near, and to all, since thou dost
   imitate the Heavenly King who is thy pattern; in that He loves to send
   rain, and causes the sun to rise on the just and unjust, as well as to
   furnish other blessings ungrudgingly. As is natural, I hear also that
   by thy various learning, thou art no less familiar with the nature of
   stones, and the virtues of roots, and forces of remedies, than Solomon,
   the wisest son of David; while thou excellest him in virtue; for
   Solomon became the slave of his pleasures, and did not preserve to the
   end, that piety which had been for him the source of prosperity and
   wisdom. But thou, most powerful Emperor, because thou settest thy
   restraining reason in array against levity, art not only an autocrat of
   men, but also of the passions of soul and body, as one would naturally
   suppose. And this, too, ought to be remarked: I understand that thou
   dost conquer the desire for all food and drink; neither the sweeter
   figs, to speak poetically, nor any other kind of fruit in its season,
   can take thee prisoner, except the little that thou dost touch and
   taste, after thou hast returned thanks to the Maker of all things. Thou
   art wont to vanquish thirst, stifling heat, and cold by thy daily
   exercise, so that thou seemest to have self-control as a second nature.
   Lately, as is well known, thou wast anxious to visit the city of
   Heraclea in Pontus, and to restore it, prostrated by time, and thou
   tookest the way in the summer season through Bithynia. When the sun
   about midday was very fiery, one of the body-guard saw thee, heated
   with much sweat and clouds of dust, and, as if to do thee a favor, he
   anticipatingly offered to thee a bowl which reflected brilliantly the
   rays of the sun; he poured in some sweet drink, and added cold water
   thereto. But thou, most powerful Emperor, didst receive it, and didst
   praise the man for his good will, and thou didst make it obvious that
   thou wouldst soon reward him for his well-wrought deed with royal
   munificence. But when all the soldiers were wondering with open mouth
   at the dish, and were counting him blessed who should drink, thou, O
   noble Emperor, didst return the drink to him and didst command him to
   use it in whatever way he pleased. So that it seems to me that
   Alexander, the son of Philip, was surpassed by thy virtue; of whom it
   is reputed by his admirers, that while he, with the Macedonians, was
   passing through a waterless place, an anxious soldier found water, drew
   it, and offered it to Alexander; he would not drink it, but poured out
   the draught. Therefore, in a word, it is appropriate to call thee,
   according to Homer, more regal than the kings who preceded thee; for we
   have heard of some who acquired nothing worthy of admiration, and
   others who adorned their reign with scarcely one or two deeds. But
   thou, O most powerful Emperor, hast gathered together all the virtues,
   and hast excelled every one in piety, philanthropy, courage, prudence,
   justice, munificence, and a magnanimity befitting royal dignity. And
   every age will boast of thy rule as alone unstained and pure from
   murder, beyond all governments that ever existed. Thou teachest thy
   subjects to pursue serious things with pleasure, so that they show zeal
   for thee and public affairs, with good will and respect. So that for
   all these reasons, it has appeared to me, as a writer of Ecclesiastical
   History, necessary to address myself to thee. For to whom can I do this
   more appropriately, since I am about to relate the virtue of many
   devoted men, and the events of the Catholic Church; and since her
   conflicts with so many enemies lead me to thy threshhold and that of
   thy fathers? Come thou, who knowest all things and possessest every
   virtue, especially that piety, which the Divine Word says is the
   beginning of wisdom, receive from me this writing, and marshal its
   facts and purify it by thy labors, out of thy accurate knowledge,
   whether by addition or elimination. For whatever course may seem
   pleasing to thee, that will be wholly advantageous and brilliant for
   the readers, nor shall any one put a hand to it after thine approval.
   My history begins with the third consulate of the Cæsars, Crispus and
   Constantine, and stretches to thy seventeenth consulship. [1058] I
   deemed it proper to divide the whole work into nine parts: the first
   and second books will embrace the ecclesiastical affairs under
   Constantine; the third and fourth, those under his sons; the fifth and
   sixth, those under Julian, the cousin of the sons of the great
   Constantine, and Jovian, and, further, of Valentinian and Valens; the
   seventh and eighth books, O most powerful Emperor, will open up the
   affairs under the brothers Gratian and Valentinian, until the
   proclamation of Theodosius, thy divine grandfather, as far as thy
   celebrated father Arcadius, together with thy uncle, the most pious and
   godly Honorius, received the paternal government and shared in the
   regulation of the Roman world; the ninth book I have devoted to thy
   Christ-loving and most innocent majesty, which may God always preserve
   in unbroken good will, triumphing greatly over enemies, and having all
   things under thy feet and transmitting the holy empire to thy sons'
   sons with the approbation of Christ, through whom and with whom, be
   glory to God, and the Father, with the Holy Spirit forever. Amen.

   The

   ECCLESIASTICAL HistorY,

   of

   salaminius hermias sozomenus.

   ------------------------

   Book I.

   Chapter I.--The Preface of the Book, in which he investigates the
   History of the Jewish Nation; Mention of those who began such a Work;
   how and from what Sources he collected his History; how he was intent
   upon the Truth, and what other Details the History will contain.

   My mind has been often exercised in inquiring how it is that other men
   are very ready to believe in God the Word, while the Jews are so
   incredulous, although it was to them that instruction concerning the
   things of God was, from the beginning, imparted by the prophets, who
   likewise made them acquainted with the events attendant upon the coming
   of Christ, before they came to pass. [1059] Besides, Abraham, the
   founder of their nation and of the circumcision, was accounted worthy
   to be an eye-witness, and the host of the Son of God. [1060] And Isaac,
   his son, was honored as the type of the sacrifice on the cross, for he
   was led bound to the altar by his father and, as accurate students of
   the sacred Scriptures affirm, the sufferings of Christ came to pass in
   like manner. Jacob predicted that the expectation of the nations would
   be for Christ, as it now is; and he likewise foretold the time in which
   he came, when he said "the rulers of the Hebrews of the tribe of Judah,
   the tribal leader, shall fail." [1061]

   This clearly referred to the reign of Herod, who was an Idumean, on his
   father's side, and on his mother's, an Arabian, and the Jewish nation
   was delivered to him by the Roman senate and Augustus Cæsar. And of the
   rest of the prophets some declared beforehand the birth of Christ, His
   ineffable conception, the mother remaining a virgin after His birth,
   His people, and country. [1062] Some predicted His divine and marvelous
   deeds, while others foretold His sufferings, His resurrection from the
   dead, His ascension into the heavens, and the event accompanying each.
   But if any be ignorant of these facts it is not difficult to know them
   by reading the sacred books. Josephus, the son of Matthias, also who
   was a priest, and was most distinguished among Jews and Romans, may be
   regarded as a noteworthy witness to the truth concerning Christ [1063]
   ; for he hesitates to call Him a man since He wrought marvelous works,
   and was a teacher of truthful doctrines, but openly calls him Christ;
   that He was condemned to the death of the cross, and appeared alive
   again the third day. Nor was Josephus ignorant of numberless other
   wonderful predictions uttered beforehand by the holy prophets
   concerning Christ. He further testifies that Christ brought over many
   to Himself both Greeks and Jews, who continued to love Him, and that
   the people named after Him had not become extinct. It appears to me
   that in narrating these things, he all but proclaims that Christ, by
   comparison of works, is God. As if struck by the miracle, he ran,
   somehow, a middle course, assailing in no way those who believed in
   Jesus, but rather agreeing with them.

   When I consider this matter it seems reasonably remarkable to me, that
   the Hebrews did not anticipate, and, before the rest of men,
   immediately turn to Christianity; for though the Sibyl and some oracles
   announced beforehand the future of events concerning Christ we are not
   on this account to attribute unbelief to all the Greeks. For they were
   few, who, appearing superior in education, could understand such
   prophecies, which were, for the most part, in verse, and were declared
   with more recondite words to the people. Therefore in my judgment, it
   was the result of the heavenly preknowledge, for the sake of the
   agreement in future events, that the coming facts were to be made
   known, not only by his own prophets, but in part also by strangers.
   Just as a musician, under pressure of a strange melody, may treat the
   superfluous tones of the chords lightly with his plectrum, or add
   others to those already existing.

   Having now shown that the Hebrews, although in the possession of
   numerous and more distinct prophecies concerning the coming of Christ,
   were less willing than the Greeks to embrace the faith that is in Him,
   let what has been said on the subject suffice. Yet let it by no means
   be hence accounted contrary to reason that the church should have been
   mainly built up by the conversion of other nations; for in the first
   place, it is evident that, in divine and great affairs, God delights to
   bring to pass changes in a marvelous manner; and then, be it
   remembered, it was by the exercise of no common virtues that those who,
   at the very beginning, were at the head of religious affairs,
   maintained their influence. If they did not, indeed, possess a language
   sharpened for expression or for beauty of diction, nor the power of
   convincing their hearers by means of phrases or mathematical
   demonstrations, yet they did not the less accomplish the work they had
   undertaken. They gave up their property, neglected their kindred, were
   stretched upon a cross, and as if endowed with bodies not their own,
   suffered many and excruciating tortures; neither seduced by the
   adulation of the people and rulers of any city, nor terrified by their
   menaces, they clearly evidenced by their conduct, that they were
   supported in the struggle by the hope of a high reward. So that they,
   in fact needed not to resort to verbal arguments; for without any
   effort on their part, their very deeds constrained the inhabitants of
   every house and of every city to give credit to their testimony, even
   before they knew wherein it consisted.

   Since then so divine and marvelous a change has taken place in the
   circumstances of men, that ancient cults and national laws have fallen
   into contempt; since many of the most celebrated writers among the
   Greeks have tasked their powers of eloquence in describing the
   Calydonian boar, the bull of Marathon and other similar prodigies,
   which have really occurred in countries or cities, or have a mystic
   origin, why should not I rise above myself, and write a history of the
   Church? For I am persuaded that, as the topic is not the achievements
   of men, it may appear almost incredible that such a history should be
   written by me; but, with God, nothing is impossible.

   I at first felt strongly inclined to trace the course of events from
   the very commencement; but on reflecting that similar records of the
   past up to their own time had been compiled by those wisest of men,
   Clemens [1064] and Hegesippus, successors of the apostles, by Africanus
   the historian, and by Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, [1065] a man
   intimately acquainted with the sacred Scriptures and the writings of
   the Greek poets and historians, I merely draw up an epitome in two
   books of all that is recorded to have happened to the churches, from
   the ascension of Christ to the deposition of Licinius. [1066] Now,
   however, by the help of God, I will endeavor to relate the subsequent
   events as well.

   I shall record the transactions with which I have been connected, and
   also those concerning which I have heard from persons who knew or saw
   the affairs in our own day or before our own generation. But I have
   sought for records of events of earlier date, amongst the established
   laws appertaining to religion, amongst the proceedings of the synods of
   the period, amongst the innovations that arose, and in the epistles of
   kings and priests. Some of these documents are preserved in palaces and
   churches, and others are dispersed and in the possession of the
   learned. I thought frequently of transcribing the whole, but on further
   reflection I deemed it better, on account of the mass of the documents,
   to give merely a brief synopsis of their contents; yet whenever
   controverted topics are introduced, I will readily transcribe freely
   from any work that may tend to the elucidation of truth. If any one who
   is ignorant of past events should conclude my history to be false,
   because he meets with conflicting statements in other writings, let him
   know that since the dogmas of Arius and other more recent hypotheses
   have been broached, the rulers of the churches, differing in opinion
   among themselves, have transmitted in writing their own peculiar views,
   for the benefit of their respective followers; and further, be it
   remembered, these rulers convened councils and issued what decrees they
   pleased, often condemning unheard those whose creed was dissimilar to
   their own, and striving to their utmost to induce the reigning prince
   and nobles of the time to side with them. Intent upon maintaining the
   orthodoxy of their own dogmas, the partisans of each sect respectively
   formed a collection of such epistles as favored their own heresy,
   omitting all documents of a contrary tendency. Such are the obstacles
   by which we are beset in our endeavors to arrive at a conclusion on
   this subject! Still, as it is requisite, in order to maintain
   historical accuracy, to pay the strictest attention to the means of
   eliciting truth, I felt myself bound to examine all writings of this
   class according to my ability.

   Let not an impertinent or malignant spirit be imputed to me, for having
   dwelt upon the disputes of ecclesiastics among themselves, concerning
   the primacy and the pre-eminence of their own heresy. In the first
   place, as I have already said, an historian ought to regard everything
   as secondary in importance to truth; moreover, the doctrine of the
   Catholic Church is shown to be especially the most genuine, since it
   has been tested frequently by the plots of opposing thinkers; yet, the
   disposal of the lot being of God, the Catholic Church has maintained
   its own ascendancy, has reassumed its own power, and has led all the
   churches and the people to the reception of its own truth.

   I have had to deliberate whether I ought to confine myself to the
   recital of events connected with the Church under the Roman government;
   but it seemed more advisable to include, as far as possible, the record
   of transactions relative to religion among the Persians and barbarians.
   Nor is it foreign to ecclesiastical history to introduce in this work
   an account of those who were the fathers and originators of what is
   denominated monachism, and of their immediate successors, whose
   celebrity is well known to us either by observation or report. For I
   would neither be considered ungracious [1067] towards them, nor willing
   to consign their virtue to oblivion, nor yet be thought ignorant of
   their history; but I would wish to leave behind me such a record of
   their manner of life that others, led by their example, might attain to
   a blessed and happy end. As the work proceeds, these subjects shall be
   noted as far as possible.

   Invoking the help and propitiousness of God, I now proceed to the
   narration of events; the present history shall have its beginning from
   this point.

   Chapter II.--Of the Bishops of the Large Towns in the Reign of
   Constantine; and how, from fear of Licinius, Christianity was professed
   cautiously in the East as far as Libya, while in the West, through the
   Favor of Constantine, it was professed with Freedom.

   During the consulate of Constantine Cæsar and Crispus Cæsar, Silvester
   governed the Church of Rome; Alexander, that of Alexandria; and
   Macarius, that of Jerusalem. Not one, since Romanus, [1068] had been
   appointed over the Church of Antioch on the Orontes; for the
   persecution it appears, had prevented the ceremony of ordination from
   taking place. The bishops assembled at Nicæa not long after were,
   however, so sensible of the purity of the life and doctrines of
   Eustathius, that they adjudged him worthy to fill the apostolic see;
   although he was then bishop of the neighboring Beroea, they translated
   him to Antioch. [1069]

   The Christians of the East, as far as Libya on the borders of Egypt,
   did not dare to meet openly as a church; for Licinius had withdrawn his
   favor from them; but the Christians of the West, the Greeks, the
   Macedonians, and the Illyrians, met for worship in safety through the
   protection of Constantine, who was then at the head of the Roman
   Empire. [1070]

   of Eusebius' History, in Florence, his name occurs as the
   twenty-second, in order, and between Philagonius and Eustathius.

   Chapter III.--By the Vision of the Cross, and by the Appearance of
   Christ, Constantine is led to embrace Christianity.--He receives
   Religious Instruction from our Brethren.

   We have been informed that Constantine was led to honor the Christian
   religion by the concurrence of several different events, particularly
   by the appearance of a sign from heaven.

   When he first formed the resolution of entering into a war against
   Maxentius, he was beset with doubts as to the means of carrying on his
   military operations, and as to the quarter whence he could look for
   assistance. In the midst of his perplexity, he saw, in a vision, the
   sight of the cross [1071] shining in heaven. He was amazed at the
   spectacle, but some holy angels who were standing by, exclaimed, "Oh,
   Constantine! by this symbol, conquer!" And it is said that Christ
   himself appeared to him, and showed him the symbol of the cross, and
   commanded him to construct one like unto it, and to retain it as his
   help in battle, as it would insure the victory.

   Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, [1072] affirms that he heard the emperor
   declare with an oath, as the sun was on the point of inclining about
   the middle of the day, he and the soldiers who were with him saw in
   heaven the trophy of the cross composed of light, and encircled by the
   following words: "By this sign, conquer."

   This vision met him by the way, when he was perplexed as to whither he
   should lead his army. While he was reflecting on what this could mean,
   night came; and when he fell asleep, Christ appeared [1073] with the
   sign which he had seen in heaven, and commanded him to construct a
   representation of the symbol, and to use it as his help in hostile
   encounters. There was nothing further to be elucidated; for the emperor
   clearly apprehended the necessity of serving God.

   At daybreak, [1074] he called together the priests of Christ, and
   questioned them concerning their doctrines. They opened the sacred
   Scriptures, and expounded the truths relative to Christ, and showed him
   from the prophets, how the signs which had been predicted, had been
   fulfilled. The sign which had appeared to him was the symbol, they
   said, of the victory over hell; for Christ came among men, was
   stretched upon the cross, died, and returned to life the third day. On
   this account, they said, there was hope that at the close of the
   present dispensation, there would be a general resurrection of the
   dead, and entrance upon immortality, when those who had led a good life
   would receive accordingly, and those who had done evil would be
   punished. Yet, continued they, the means of salvation and of
   purification from sin are provided; namely, for the uninitiated, [1075]
   initiation according to the canons of the church; and for the
   initiated, abstinence from renewed sin. But as few, even among holy
   men, are capable of complying with this latter condition, another
   method of purification is set forth, namely, repentance; for God, in
   his love towards man, bestows forgiveness on those who have fallen into
   sin, on their repentance, and the confirmation of their repentance by
   good works.

   Chapter IV.--Constantine commands the Sign of the Cross to be carried
   before him in Battle; an Extraordinary Narrative about the Bearers of
   the Sign of the Cross.

   The emperor, amazed at the prophecies concerning Christ which were
   expounded to him by the priests, sent for some skillful artisans, and
   commanded them to remodel the standard called by the Romans Labarum,
   [1076] to convert it into a representation of the cross, and to adorn
   it with gold and precious stones. This warlike trophy was valued beyond
   all others; for it was always wont to be carried before the emperor,
   and was worshiped by the soldiery. I think that Constantine changed the
   most honorable symbol of the Roman power into the sign of Christ,
   chiefly that by the habit of having it always in view, and of
   worshiping it, the soldiers might be induced to abandon their ancient
   forms of superstition, and to recognize the true God, whom the emperor
   worshiped, as their leader and their help in battle; for this symbol
   was always borne in front of his own troops, and was, at the command of
   the emperor, carried among the phalanxes in the thickest of the fight
   by an illustrious band of spearmen, of whom each one in turn took the
   standard upon his shoulders, and paraded it through the ranks. It is
   said that on one occasion, on an unexpected movement of the hostile
   forces, the man who held the standard in terror, placed it in the hands
   of another, and secretly fled from the battle. When he got beyond the
   reach of the enemy's weapons, he suddenly received a wound and fell,
   while the man who had stood by the divine symbol remained unhurt,
   although many weapons were aimed at him; for the missiles of the enemy,
   marvelously directed by divine agency, lighted upon the standard, and
   the bearer thereof, although in the midst of danger, was preserved.

   It is also asserted that no soldier who bore this standard in battle
   ever fell, through any dark calamity, such as is wont to happen to the
   soldiery in war, or was wounded, or taken prisoner.

   Chapter V.--Refutation of the Assertion that Constantine became a
   Christian in consequence of the Murder of his son Crispus.

   I am aware that it is reported by the pagans that Constantine, after
   slaying some of his nearest relations, and particularly after assenting
   to the murder of his own son Crispus, repented of his evil deeds, and
   inquired of Sopater, [1077] the philosopher, who was then master of the
   school of Plotinus, concerning the means of purification from guilt.
   The philosopher--so the story goes--replied that such moral defilement
   could admit of no purification. The emperor was grieved at this
   repulse, but happening to meet with some bishops who told him that he
   would be cleansed from sin, on repentance and on submitting to baptism,
   he was delighted with their representations, and admired their
   doctrines, and became a Christian, and led his subjects to the same
   faith. It appears to me that this story was the invention of persons
   who desired to vilify the Christian religion. Crispus, [1078] on whose
   account, it is said, Constantine required purification, did not die
   till the twentieth year of his father's reign; he held the second place
   in the empire and bore the name of Cæsar and many laws, framed with his
   sanction in favor of Christianity, are still extant. That this was the
   case can be proved by referring to the dates affixed to these laws, and
   to the lists of the legislators. It does not appear likely that Sopater
   had any intercourse with Constantine whose government was then centered
   in the regions near the ocean and the Rhine; for his dispute with
   Maxentius, the governor of Italy, had created so much dissension in the
   Roman dominions, that it was then no easy matter to dwell in Gaul, in
   Britain, or in the neighboring countries, in which it is universally
   admitted Constantine embraced the religion of the Christians, previous
   to his war with Maxentius, and prior to his return to Rome and Italy:
   and this is evidenced by the dates of the laws which he enacted in
   favor of religion. But even granting that Sopater chanced to meet the
   emperor, or that he had epistolary correspondence with him, it cannot
   be imagined the philosopher was ignorant that Hercules, the son of
   Alcmena, obtained purification at Athens by the celebration of the
   mysteries of Ceres after the murder of his children, and of Iphitus,
   his guest and friend. That the Greeks held that purification from guilt
   of this nature could be obtained, is obvious from the instance I have
   just alleged, and he is a false calumniator who represents that Sopater
   taught the contrary.

   I cannot admit the possibility of the philosopher's having been
   ignorant of these facts; for he was at that period esteemed the most
   learned man in Greece.

   Chapter VI.--The Father of Constantine allows the Name of Christ to be
   Extended; Constantine the Great prepared it to Penetrate Everywhere.

   Under the government of Constantine the churches flourished and
   increased in numbers daily, since they were honored by the good deeds
   of a benevolent and well-disposed emperor, and otherwise God preserved
   them from the persecutions and harassments which they had previously
   encountered. When the churches were suffering from persecution in other
   parts of the world, Constantius alone, the father of Constantine,
   accorded the Christians the right of worshiping God without fear. I
   know of an extraordinary thing done by him, which is worthy of being
   recorded. He wished to test the fidelity of certain Christians,
   excellent and good men, who were attached to his palaces. He called
   them all together, and told them that if they would sacrifice to idols
   as well as serve God, they should remain in his service and retain
   their appointments; but that if they refused compliance with his
   wishes, they should be sent from the palaces, and should scarcely
   escape his vengeance. When difference of judgment had divided them into
   two parties, separating those who consented to abandon their religion
   from those who preferred the honor of God to their present welfare, the
   emperor determined upon retaining those who had adhered to their faith
   as his friends and counselors; but he turned away from the others, whom
   he regarded as unmanly and impostors, and sent them from his presence,
   judging that they who had so readily betrayed their God could never be
   true to their king. Hence it is probable that while Constantius was
   alive, it did not seem contrary to the laws for the inhabitants of the
   countries beyond Italy to profess Christianity, that is to say, in
   Gaul, in Britain, or in the region of the Pyrenean mountains as far as
   the Western Ocean. When Constantine succeeded to the same government,
   the affairs of the churches became still more brilliant; for when
   Maxentius, the son of Herculius, was slain, his share also devolved
   upon Constantine; and the nations who dwelt by the river Tiber and the
   Eridanus, which the natives call Padus, those who dwelt by the Aquilis,
   whither, it is said, the Argo was dragged, and the inhabitants of the
   coasts of the Tyrrhenian sea were permitted the exercise of their
   religion without molestation.

   When the Argonauts fled from Æetes, they returned homewards by a
   different route, crossed the sea of Scythia, sailed through some of the
   rivers there, and so gained the shores of Italy, where they passed the
   winter and built a city, which they called Emona. The following summer,
   with the assistance of the people of the country, they dragged the
   Argo, by means of machinery, the distance of four hundred stadia, and
   so reached the Aquilis, a river which falls into the Eridanus: the
   Eridanus itself falls into the Italian sea.

   After the battle of Cibalis [1079] the Dardanians and the Macedonians,
   the inhabitants of the banks of the Ister, of Hellas, and the whole
   nation of Illyria, became subject to Constantine.

   Chapter VII.--Concerning the Dispute between Constantine and Licinius
   his Brother-In-Law about the Christians, and how Licinius was conquered
   by Force and put to Death.

   After this reverse, Licinius, [1080] who had previously respected the
   Christians, changed his opinion, and ill-treated many of the priests
   who lived under his government; he also persecuted a multitude of other
   persons, but especially the soldiers. He was deeply incensed against
   the Christians on account of his disagreement with Constantine, and
   thought to wound him by their sufferings for religion, and besides, he
   suspected that the churches were praying and zealous that Constantine
   alone should enjoy the sovereign rule. In addition to all this, when on
   the eve of another battle with Constantine, Licinius, as was wont to be
   done, made a forecast of the expected war, by sacrifices and oracles,
   and, deceived by promises of conquest, he returned to the religion of
   the pagans.

   The pagans themselves, too, relate that about this period he consulted
   the oracle of Apollo Didymus at Miletus, and received an answer
   concerning the result of the war from the demon, couched in the
   following verses of Homer: [1081]

   "Much, old man, do the youths distress thee, warring against thee!

   Feeble thy strength has become, but thy old age yet shall be hardy."

   From many facts it has often appeared to me that the teaching of the
   Christians is supported, and its advancement secured, by the providence
   of God; and not least from what then occurred; for at the very moment
   that Licinius was about to persecute all the churches under him, the
   war in Bithynia broke out, which ended in a war between him and
   Constantine, and in which Constantine was so strengthened by Divine
   assistance that he was victorious over his enemies by land and by sea.
   On the destruction of his fleet and army, Licinius threw himself into
   Nicomedia, and resided for some time at Thessalonica as a private
   individual, and was eventually killed there. Such was the end of one
   who, at the beginning of his reign, had distinguished himself in war
   and in peace, and who had been honored by receiving the sister of
   Constantine in marriage.

   Chapter VIII.--List of the Benefits which Constantine conferred in the
   Freedom of the Christians and Building of Churches; and other Deeds for
   the Public Welfare.

   As soon as the sole government of the Roman empire was vested in
   Constantine, he issued a public decree [1082] commanding all his
   subjects in the East to honor the Christian religion, carefully to
   worship the Divine Being, and to recognize that only as Divine which is
   also essentially so, and which has the power that endures for ever and
   ever: for he delights to give all good things ungrudgingly to those who
   zealously embrace the truth; he meets their undertakings with the best
   hopes, while misfortunes, whether in peace or in war, whether in public
   or in private life, befall transgressors. Constantine then added, but
   without vain boasting, that, God having accounted him as a fitting
   servant, worthy to reign, he had been led from the British sea to the
   Eastern provinces in order that the Christian religion might be
   extended, and that those who, on account of the worship of God had
   remained steadfast in confessions or martyrdoms, might be advanced to
   public honors. After making these statements, he entered upon a myriad
   other details by which he thought his subjects might be drawn to
   religion. He decreed that all acts and judgments passed by the
   persecutors of the church against Christianity should be revoked; and
   commanded that all those who, on account of their confession of Christ,
   had been sent to banishment--either to the isles or elsewhere, contrary
   to their own inclination--and all those who had been condemned to labor
   in the mines, the public works, the harems, the linen factories, or had
   been enrolled as public functionaries, should be restored to liberty.
   He removed the stigma of dishonor from those upon whom it had been
   cast, and permitted those who had been deprived of high appointments in
   the army, either to reassume their former place, or with an honorable
   discharge, to enjoy a liberal ease according to their own choice; and
   when he had recalled all to the enjoyment of their former liberties and
   customary honors, he likewise restored their possessions. In the case
   of those who had been slain, and whose property had been confiscated,
   he enacted that the inheritance should be transferred to the next of
   kin, or, in default of heirs, to the church belonging to the locality
   where the estate was situated; and when the inheritance had passed into
   other hands, and had become either private or national property, he
   commanded it to be restored. He likewise promised to resort to the
   fittest and best possible arrangements when the property had been
   purchased by the exchequer, or had been received therefrom by gift.
   These measures, as it had been said, having been enacted by the
   emperor, and ratified by law, were forthwith carried into execution.
   Christians were thus placed in almost all the principal posts of the
   Roman government; the worship of false gods was universally prohibited;
   and the arts of divination, the dedication of statues, and the
   celebration of pagan festivals were interdicted. Many of the most
   ancient customs observed in the cities fell into disuse: and among the
   Egyptians the measure used to indicate the increase of the waters of
   the Nile was no longer borne into pagan temples, but into churches. The
   spectacle of gladiators was then prohibited among the Romans; and the
   custom which prevailed among the Phoenicians of Lebanon and Heliopolis
   of prostituting virgins before marriage, who were accustomed to cohabit
   in lawful marriage after the first trial of an illicit intercourse, was
   abolished. Of the houses of prayer, the emperor repaired some which
   were of sufficient magnitude; others were brilliantly restored by
   additional length and breadth, and he erected new edifices in places
   where no building of the kind had existed previously. He furnished the
   requisite supplies from the imperial treasury, and wrote to the bishops
   of the cities and the governors of the provinces, desiring them to
   contribute whatever might be wished, and enjoining submission and
   zealous obedience to the priests.

   The prosperity of religion kept pace with the increased prosperity of
   the empire. After the war with Licinius, the emperor was successful in
   battle against foreign nations; he conquered the Sarmatians and the
   people called Goths, and concluded an advantageous treaty with them.
   These people dwelt upon the Ister; and as they were very warlike, and
   always ready in arms both by the multitude and magnitude of their
   bodies, they kept the other tribes of barbarians in awe, and found
   antagonists in the Romans alone. It is said that, during this war,
   Constantine perceived clearly, by means of signs and dreams, that the
   special protection of Divine Providence had been extended to him. Hence
   when he had vanquished all those who rose up in battle against him he
   evinced his thankfulness to Christ by zealous attention to the concerns
   of religion, and exhorted the governors to recognize the one true faith
   and way of salvation. He enacted that part of the funds levied from
   tributary countries should be forwarded by the various cities to the
   bishops and clergy, wherever they might be domiciled, and commanded
   that the law enjoining this gift should be a statute forever. In order
   to accustom the soldiers to worship God as he did, he had their weapons
   marked with the symbol of the cross, and he erected a house of prayer
   in the palace. When he engaged in war, he caused a tent to be borne
   before him, constructed in the shape of a church, so that in case he or
   his army might be led into the desert, they might have a sacred edifice
   in which to praise and worship God, and participate in the mysteries.
   [1083] Priests and deacons followed the tent, who fulfilled the orders
   about these matters, according to the law of the church. From that
   period the Roman legions, which now were called by their number,
   provided each its own tent, with attendant priests and deacons. He also
   enjoined the observance of the day termed the Lord's day, [1084] which
   the Jews call the first day of the week, and which the pagans dedicate
   to the sun, as likewise the day before the seventh, and commanded that
   no judicial or other business should be transacted on those days, but
   that God should be served with prayers and supplications. He honored
   the Lord's day, because on it Christ arose from the dead, and the day
   above mentioned, because on it he was crucified. He regarded the cross
   with peculiar reverence, on account both of the power which it conveyed
   to him in the battles against his enemies, and also of the divine
   manner in which the symbol had appeared to him. He took away by law the
   crucifixion customary among the Romans, from the usage of the courts.
   He commanded that this divine symbol should always be inscribed and
   stamped whenever coins and images should be struck, and his images,
   which exist in this very form, still testify to this order. And indeed
   he strove in everything, particularly in the enactment of laws, to
   serve God. It appears, too, that he prohibited many flagitious and
   licentious connections, [1085] which till that period had not been
   forbidden; as one, who cares about it, may see at a glance from these
   few instances what the laws were, which he established about these
   points; it appears to me unreasonable now to treat them exhaustively. I
   consider it necessary, however, to mention the laws enacted for the
   honor and consolidation of religion, as they constitute a considerable
   portion of ecclesiastical history. I shall therefore proceed to the
   recital.

   Chapter IX.--Constantine enacts a Law in favor of Celibates and of the
   Clergy.

   There was an ancient Roman law, by which those who were unmarried at
   the age of twenty-five were not admitted to the same privileges as the
   married; [1086] amongst other clauses in this law, it was specified
   that those who were not the very nearest kinsmen could gain nothing
   from a will; and also, that those who were childless were to be
   deprived of half of any property that might be bequeathed to them. The
   object of this ancient Roman law was to increase the population of Rome
   and the subject people, which had been much reduced in numbers by the
   civil wars, not a long while before this law. The emperor, perceiving
   that this enactment militated against the interests of those who
   continued in a state of celibacy and remained childless for the sake of
   God, and deeming it absurd to attempt the multiplication of the human
   species by the care and zeal of man (since nature always receiving
   increase or decrease according to the fiat from on high), made a law
   enjoining that the unmarried and childless should have the same
   advantages as the married. He even bestowed peculiar privileges on
   those who embraced a life of continence and virginity, and permitted
   them, contrary to the usage which prevailed throughout the Roman
   empire, to make a will before they attained the age of puberty; for he
   believed that those who devoted themselves to the service of God and
   the cultivation of philosophy would, in all cases, judge aright. For a
   similar reason the ancient Romans permitted the vestal virgins to make
   a will as soon as they attained the age of six years. That was the
   greatest proof of the superior reverence for religion. Constantine
   exempted the clergy everywhere from taxation, and permitted litigants
   to appeal to the decision of the bishops if they preferred them to the
   state rulers. [1087] He enacted that their decree should be valid, and
   as far superior to that of other judges as if pronounced by the emperor
   himself; that the governors and subordinate military officers should
   see to the execution of these decrees: and that the definitions made by
   synods should be irreversible.

   Having arrived at this point of my history, it would not be right to
   omit all mention of the laws passed in favor of those individuals in
   the churches who had received their freedom. Owing to the strictness of
   the laws and the unwillingness of masters, there were many difficulties
   in the way of the acquisition of this better freedom; that is to say,
   of the freedom of the city of Rome. Constantine therefore made three
   laws, enacting that all those individuals in the churches, whose
   freedom should be attested by the priests, should receive the freedom
   of Rome. [1088]

   The records of these pious regulations are still extant, it having been
   the custom to engrave on tablets all laws relating to manumission. Such
   were the enactments of Constantine; in everything he sought to promote
   the honor of religion; and religion was valued, not only for its own
   sake, but also on account of the virtue of those who then participated
   in it.

   Chapter X.--Concerning the Great Confessors who survived.

   Since the persecution had recently ceased, many excellent Christians,
   and many of the confessors who had survived, adorned the churches:
   among these were Hosius, [1089] bishop of Cordova; Amphion, [1090]
   bishop of Epiphania in Cilicia; Maximus, who succeeded Macarius in the
   church of Jerusalem; and Paphnutius, [1091] an Egyptian. It is said by
   this latter God wrought many miracles, controlling demons, and giving
   him grace to heal divers kinds of sickness. This Paphnutius, and
   Maximus, whom we just mentioned, were among the number of confessors
   whom Maximinus condemned to work in the mines, after having deprived
   them of the right eye, and the use of the left leg.

   Chapter XI.--Account of St. Spyridon: His Modesty and Steadfastness.

   Spyridon, [1092] bishop of Trimythun in Cyprus, flourished at this
   period. To show his virtues, I think the fame which still prevails
   about him suffices. The wonderful works which he wrought by Divine
   assistance are, it appears, generally known by those who dwell in the
   same region. I shall not conceal the facts which have come to me.

   He was a peasant, was married, and had children; yet was not, on this
   account, deficient in spiritual attainments. It is related that one
   night some wicked men entered his sheepfold, and were in the act of
   stealing his sheep, when they were suddenly bound, and yet no one bound
   them. The next day, when he went to the fold, he found them fettered,
   and released them from their invisible bonds; but he censured them for
   having preferred to steal what it was lawful for them to win and take,
   and also for making such a great exertion by night: yet he felt
   compassion towards them, and, desirous of affording them instruction,
   so as to induce them to lead a better life, he said to them, "Go, and
   take this ram with you; for you are wearied with watching, and it is
   not just that your labor should be so blamed, that you should return
   empty-handed from my sheepfold." This action is well worthy admiration,
   but not less so is that which I shall now relate. An individual
   confided a deposit to the care of his daughter, who was a virgin, and
   was named Irene. For greater security, she buried it; and it so
   happened that she died soon after, without mentioning the circumstance
   to any one. The person to whom the deposit belonged came to ask for it.
   Spyridon knew not what answer to give him, so he searched the whole
   house for it; but not being able to find it, the man wept, tore his
   hair, and seemed ready to expire. Spyridon, moved with pity, went to
   the grave, and called the girl by name; and when she answered, he
   inquired about the deposit. After obtaining the information desired, he
   returned, found the treasure in the place that had been signified to
   him, and gave it to the owner. As I have entered upon this subject, it
   may not be amiss to add this incident also.

   It was a custom with this Spyridon to give a certain portion of his
   fruits to the poor, and to lend another portion to those who wished it
   as a gratuity; but neither in giving nor taking back did he ever
   himself distribute or receive: he merely pointed out the storehouse,
   and told those who resorted to him to take as much as they needed, or
   to restore what they had borrowed. A certain man who had borrowed in
   this way, came as though he were about to return it, and when as usual
   he was directed to replace his loan in the storehouse, he saw an
   opportunity for an injustice; imagining that the matter would be
   concealed, he did not liquidate the debt, but fraudulently pretending
   to have discharged his obligation, he went away as though he had made
   the return. This, however, could not be long concealed. After some time
   the man came back again to borrow, and was sent to the storehouse, with
   permission to measure out for himself as much as he required. Finding
   the storehouse empty, he went to acquaint Spyridon, and this latter
   said to him, "I wonder, O man, how it is that you alone have found the
   storehouse empty and unsupplied with the articles you require: reflect
   whether you have restored the first loan, since you are in need a
   second time: were it otherwise, what you seek would not be lacking. Go,
   trust, and you will find." The man felt the reproof and acknowledged
   his error. The firmness and the accuracy in the administration of
   ecclesiastical affairs on the part of this divine man are worthy of
   admiration. It is said that on one occasion thereafter, the bishops of
   Cyprus met to consult on some particular emergency. Spyridon was
   present, as likewise Triphyllius, [1093] bishop of the Ledri, a man
   otherwise eloquent, who on account of practicing the law, had lived
   alone while at Berytus. [1094]

   When an assembly had convened, having been requested to address the
   people, Triphyllius had occasion, in the middle of his discourse, to
   quote the text, "Take up thy bed and walk," [1095] and he substituted
   the word "couch" (skimpous), for the word "bed" (krabbatos ). Spyridon
   was indignant, and exclaimed, "Art thou greater than he who uttered the
   word bed,' that thou art ashamed to use his words?" When he had said
   this, he turned from the throne of the priest, and looked towards the
   people; by this act he taught them to keep the man who is proud of
   eloquence within bounds and he was fit to make such a rebuke; for he
   was reverenced and most illustrious for his works: at the same time he
   was the superior of that presbyter in age and in the priesthood.

   The reception which Spyridon gave to strangers will appear from the
   following incident. In the quadragesima, it happened that a traveler
   came upon a journey to visit him on one of those days in which it was
   his custom to keep a continuous fast with his household, [1096] and on
   the day appointed for tasting food, he would remain without nourishment
   to mid-day. Perceiving that the stranger was much fatigued, Spyridon
   said to his daughter, "Come, wash his feet and set meat before him."
   The virgin replying that there was neither bread nor barley-food in the
   house, for it would have been superfluous to provide such things at the
   time of the fast, Spyridon first prayed and asked forgiveness, and bade
   her to cook some salt pork which chanced to be in the house. When it
   was prepared, he sat down to table with the stranger, partook of the
   meat, and told him to follow his example. But the stranger declining,
   under the plea of being a Christian, he said to him, "It is for that
   very reason that you ought not to decline partaking of the meat; for
   the Divine word shows that to the pure all things are pure." [1097]
   Such are the details which I had to relate concerning Spyridon.

   Chapter XII.--On the Organization of the Monks: its Origin and
   Founders.

   Those who at this period had embraced monasticism [1098] were not the
   least in manifesting the church as most illustrious, and evidencing the
   truth of their doctrines by their virtuous line of conduct. Indeed, the
   most useful thing that has been received by man from God is their
   philosophy. [1099] They neglect many branches of mathematics and the
   technicalities of dialectics, because they regard such studies as
   superfluous, and as a useless expenditure of time, seeing that they
   contribute nothing towards correct living. They apply themselves
   exclusively to the cultivation of natural and useful science, in order
   that they may mitigate, if not eradicate, evil. They invariably refrain
   from accounting any action or principle as good, which occupies a
   middle place between virtue and vice, for they delight only in what is
   good. They regard every man as wicked, who, though he abstain from
   evil, does not do good. For they do not demonstrate virtue by argument,
   but practice it, and count as nothing the glory current among men. They
   manfully subjugate the passions of the soul, yielding neither to the
   necessities of nature, nor succumbing to the weakness of the body.
   Having possessed the power of the Divine mind, they always look away to
   the Creator of the whole, night and day worshiping him, and appeasing
   him by prayers and supplications. By purity of soul and by a life of
   good works they entered without guilt upon religious observances, and
   despised purification, lustral vessels, and such ceremonials; for they
   think that sins alone are blemishes. They are greater than the external
   casualties to which we are liable, and hold, as it were, all things
   under their control: and are not therefore diverted from the path they
   have selected by the disasters or the necessity which sway the life.
   They are not distressed when insulted, nor do they defend themselves
   when suffering from malice; nor do they lose heart when pressed by
   sickness or lack of necessaries but rather rejoice in such trials and
   endure them with patience and meekness. They inure themselves through
   the whole of life to be content with little, and approximate as nearly
   to God as is possible to human nature. They regard the present life as
   a journey only, and are not therefore solicitous about acquiring
   wealth, nor do they provide for the present beyond urgent necessities.
   They admire the beauty and simplicity of nature, but their hope is
   placed in heaven and the blessedness of the future. Wholly absorbed in
   the worship of God, they revolted from obscene language; and as they
   had banished evil practices, so they would not allow such things to be
   even named. They limited, as far as possible, the demands of nature,
   and compelled the body to be satisfied with moderate supplies. They
   overcame intemperance by temperance, injustice by justice, and
   falsehood by truth, and attained the happy medium in all things. They
   dwelt in harmony and fellowship with their neighbors. They provided for
   their friends and strangers, imparted to those who were in want,
   according to their need, and comforted the afflicted. As they were
   diligent in all things, and zealous in seeking the supreme good, their
   instructions, though clothed in modesty and prudence, and devoid of
   vain and meritricious eloquence, possessed power, like sovereign
   medicines, in healing the moral diseases of their audience; they spoke,
   too, with fear and reverence, and eschewed all strife, raillery, and
   anger. Indeed, it is but reasonable to suppress all irrational
   emotions, and to subdue carnal and natural passions. Elias the prophet
   and John the Baptist were the authors, as some say, of this sublime
   philosophy. Philo the Pythagorean [1100] relates, that in his time the
   most virtuous of the Hebrews assembled from all parts of the world, and
   settled in a tract of country situated on a hill near Lake Mareotis,
   for the purpose of living as philosophers. He describes their
   dwellings, their regimen, and their customs, as similar to those which
   we now meet with among the monks of Egypt. He says that from the moment
   they began to apply themselves to the study of philosophy, they gave up
   their property to their relatives, relinquished business and society,
   and dwelt outside of walls, in fields and in gardens. They had also, he
   informs us, sacred edifices which were called monasteries, in which
   they dwelt apart and alone, occupied in celebrating the holy mysteries,
   and in worshiping God sedulously with psalms and hymns. They never
   tasted food before sunset, and some only took food every third day, or
   even at longer intervals. Finally, he says, that on certain days they
   lay on the ground and abstained from wine and the flesh of animals;
   that their food was bread, salt, and hyssop, and their drink, water;
   and that there were women among them who had lived as virgins to old
   age, who, for the love of philosophy, and from their voluntary
   judgment, practiced celibacy. In this narrative, Philo seems to
   describe [1101] certain Jews who had embraced Christianity, and yet
   retained the customs of their nation; for no vestiges of this manner of
   life are to be found elsewhere: and hence I conclude that this
   philosophy flourished in Egypt from this period. Others, however,
   assert that this mode of life originated from the persecutions for the
   sake of religion, which arose from time to time, and by which many were
   compelled to flee to the mountains and deserts and forests, and they
   became used to this kind of living.

   Chapter XIII.--About Antony the Great and St. Paul the Simple.

   Whether the Egyptians or others are to be regarded as the founders of
   this philosophy, it is universally admitted that Antony, [1102] the
   great monk, developed this course of life, by morals and befitting
   exercises, to the summit of exactness and perfection. His fame was so
   widely spread throughout the deserts of Egypt, that the emperor
   Constantine, for the reputation of the man's virtue, sought his
   friendship, honored him with correspondence, and urged him to write
   about what he might need. He was an Egyptian by race, and belonged to
   an illustrious family of Coma, which was situated near the Heraclea
   which is on the Egyptian borders. [1103] He was but a youth when he
   lost his parents; he bestowed his paternal inheritance upon his
   fellow-villagers, sold the rest of his possessions and distributed the
   proceeds among the needy; for he was aware that philosophy does not
   merely consist in the relinquishment of property, but in the proper
   distribution of it. He obtained the acquaintance of the devoted men of
   his time, and emulated the virtues of all. Believing that the practice
   of goodness would become delightful by habit, though arduous at the
   outset, he reflected on more intense methods of asceticism, and day by
   day he augmented it by self-control just as if he were always
   recommencing his undertaking. He subdued the voluptuousness of the body
   by labor, and restrained the passions of the soul by the aid of the
   Divine wisdom. His food was bread and salt, his drink water, and he
   never broke his fast till after sunset. He often remained two or more
   days without eating. He watched, so to speak, throughout the night, and
   continued in prayer till daybreak. If at any time he indulged in sleep,
   it was but for a little while on a short mat; but generally the bare
   earth was his couch. He rejected the practice of anointing with oil,
   and the use of baths and of similar luxuries likely to relax the
   tension of the body by moisture; and it is said that he never at any
   time saw himself naked. He neither possessed nor admired learning, but
   he valued a good understanding, as being prior to letters and as being
   the very discoverer of it. He was exceedingly meek and philanthropic,
   prudent and manly; cheerful in conversation and friendly in
   disputations, even when others used the controverted topics as occasion
   for strife. By his own habit and a kind of intelligence he quieted
   contentiousness when on the increase, and restored them to moderation;
   he also tempered the ardor of those who conversed with him, and
   regulated their manners. Although on account of his extraordinary
   virtues, he had become filled with the Divine foreknowledge, he did not
   regard foreknowledge of the future as a virtue, nor did he counsel
   others to seek this gift rashly, for he considered that no one would be
   punished or rewarded according to his ignorance or knowledge of
   futurity; for true blessedness consists in the service of God, and in
   keeping his laws. "But," said he, "if any man would know the future,
   let him continually be purified in soul, for then he will have power to
   walk in the light, and to understand things that are to happen, for God
   will reveal the future to him." He never suffered himself to be idle,
   but exhorted all those who seemed disposed to lead a good life, to
   diligence in labor, to self-examination and confession of sin before
   Him who created the day and the night; and when they erred, he urged
   them to record the transgression in writing, that so they might be
   ashamed of their sins, and be fearful lest any one should find the many
   things recorded; for he would be fearful, lest if the document were
   traced to him he should become disclosed to other people as a depraved
   character. He above all others came forward spiritedly and most
   zealously for the defense of the injured, and in their cause often
   resorted to the cities; for many came out to him, and compelled him to
   intercede for them with the rulers and men in power. All the people
   felt honored in seeing him, listened with avidity to his discourses,
   and yielded assent to his arguments; but he preferred to remain unknown
   and concealed in the deserts. When compelled to visit a city, he never
   failed to return to the deserts as soon as he had accomplished the work
   he had undertaken; for, he said, that as fishes are nourished in the
   water, so the desert is the world prepared for monks; and as fishes die
   when thrown upon dry land, so monastics lose their gravity when they go
   into cities. He carried himself obediently and graciously towards all
   who saw him, and he was careful not to have, nor seem to have, a
   supercilious nature. I have given this concise account of the manners
   of Antony, in order that an idea of his philosophy may be formed, by
   analogy, from the description of his conduct in the desert.

   He had many renowned disciples, of whom some flourished in Egypt and
   Libya, others in Palestine, Syria, and Arabia; not less than their
   master, did each disciple pass his life with those among whom he dwelt,
   and regulate his conduct, and instruct many, and wed them unto kindred
   virtues and philosophy. But it would be difficult for any one to find
   the companions of Antony or their successors by going carefully through
   cities and villages to discover them, for they sought concealment more
   earnestly than many ambitious men, by means of pomp and show, now seek
   popularity and renown.

   We must relate, in chronological order, the history of the most
   celebrated disciples of Antony, and particularly that of Paul, surnamed
   the Simple. [1104] It is said that he dwelt in the country, and was
   married to a beautiful woman, and that having surprised her in the act
   of adultery, he laughed placidly and affirmed with an oath, that he
   would live with her no longer; that he left her with the adulterer, and
   went immediately to join Antony in the desert. It is further related
   that he was exceedingly meek and patient: and that, being aged and
   unaccustomed to monastic severity, Antony put his strength to the proof
   by various trials, for he was newly come, and detected nothing ignoble;
   and that, having given evidence of perfect philosophy, he was sent to
   live alone, as no longer requiring a teacher. And God himself confirmed
   the testimony of Antony; and demonstrated the man to be most
   illustrious through his deeds, and as greater than even his teacher in
   vexing and expelling demons.

   Chapter XIV.--Account of St. Ammon and Eutychius of Olympus.

   It was about this period that Ammon, [1105] the Egyptian, embraced
   philosophy. It is said that he was compelled to marry by his family,
   but that his wife never knew him carnally; for on the day of their
   marriage, when they were alone, and when he as the bridegroom was
   leading her as the bride to his bed, he said to her, "Oh, woman! our
   marriage has indeed taken place, but it is not consummated"; and then
   he showed her from the Holy Scriptures that it was her chief good to
   remain a virgin, and entreated that they might live apart. She was
   convinced by his arguments concerning virginity, but was much
   distressed by the thought of being separated from him; and therefore,
   though occupying a separate bed, he lived with her for eighteen years,
   during which time he did not neglect the monastic exercises. At the end
   of this period, the woman whose emulation had been strongly excited by
   the virtue of her husband, became convinced that it was not just that
   such a man should, on her account, live in the domestic sphere; and she
   considered that it was necessary that each should, for the sake of
   philosophy, live apart from the other; and she entreated this of her
   husband. He therefore took his departure, after having thanked God for
   the counsel of his wife, and said to her, "Do thou retain this house,
   and I will make another for myself." He retired to a desert place,
   south of the Mareotic lake between Scitis and the mountain called
   Nitria; and here, during two and twenty years, he devoted himself to
   philosophy and visited his wife twice every year. This divine man was
   the founder of the monasteries there, and gathered round him many
   disciples of note, as the registers of succession show. Many
   extraordinary events happened to him, which have been accurately fixed
   by the Egyptian monks, who did very much to commemorate carefully the
   virtues of the more ancient ascetics, preserved in a succession of
   unwritten tradition. I will relate such of them as have come to our
   knowledge.

   Ammon and his disciple Theodore, had once occasion to take a journey
   somewhere, and on the road found it requisite to cross a canal called
   Lycus. Ammon ordered Theodore to pass over backwards, lest they should
   witness each other's nudity, and as he was likewise ashamed to see
   himself naked, he was suddenly, and by a Divine impulse, seized and
   carried over, and landed on the opposite bank. When Theodore had
   crossed the water, he perceived that the clothes and feet of the elder
   were not wet, and inquired the reason; not receiving a reply, he
   expostulated strongly on the subject, and at length Ammon, after
   stipulating that it should not be mentioned during his lifetime,
   confessed the fact.

   Here follows another miracle of the same nature. Some wicked fathers,
   having brought to him a son, who had been bitten by a mad dog, and was
   nigh unto death, besought him in their lamentations to heal him. He
   said to them, "Your son does not require my healing, but if you are
   willing to restore to your masters the ox you have stolen, he will be
   healed immediately." And the result was even as had been predicted; for
   the ox was restored and the malady of the child removed. It is said
   that, when Ammon died, Antony saw his spirit ascending into heaven,
   since the heavenly powers conducted him with the singing of psalms, and
   on being questioned by his companions as to the cause of his evident
   astonishment, he did not conceal the matter from them; for he was seen
   to survey the sky intently, because of his amazement at the sight of
   the marvelous spectacle. A short time after, certain persons came from
   Scitis, and, announcing the hour of Ammon's death, the truth of
   Antony's prediction was manifested. Thus, as is testified by all good
   men, each of these holy persons was blessed in a special manner; the
   one, by being released from this life; the other, by being accounted
   worthy of witnessing so miraculous a spectacle as that which God showed
   him; for Antony and Ammon lived at a distance of many days' journey
   from each other, and the above incident is corroborated by those who
   were personally acquainted with them both.

   I am convinced that it was likewise during this reign that Eutychianus
   [1106] embraced philosophy. He fixed his residence in Bithynia, near
   Olympus. He belonged to the sect of the Novatians, [1107] and was a
   partaker of Divine grace; he healed diseases and wrought miracles, and
   the fame of his virtuous life induced Constantine to keep his intimacy
   and friendship. It so happened, that about this period, one of the
   royal body-guard, who was suspected of plotting against the sovereign,
   fled, and after search, was apprehended near Olympus. Eutychianus was
   besought by relatives of the man to intercede on his behalf with the
   emperor, and in the meantime, to direct that the prisoner's chains
   might be loosened, lest he should perish beneath their weight. It is
   related that Eutychianus accordingly sent to the officers who held the
   man in custody, desiring them to loosen the chains; and that, on their
   refusal, he went himself to the prison, when the doors, though
   fastened, opened of their own accord, and the bonds of the prisoner
   fell off. Eutychianus afterwards repaired to the emperor who was then
   residing at Byzantium, and easily obtained a pardon, for Constantine
   was not wont to refuse his requests, because he held the man in very
   great honor.

   I have now given in few words the history of the most illustrious
   professors of the monastic philosophy. If any one desires more exact
   information about these men he will find it in the biographies which
   have been written of very many of them.

   Chapter XV.--The Arian Heresy, its Origin, its Progress, and the
   Contention which it occasioned among the Bishops.

   Although, as we have shown, religion was in a flourishing condition at
   this period, yet the churches were disturbed by sore contentions; for
   under the pretext of piety and of seeking the more perfect discovery of
   God, certain questions were agitated, which had not, till then, been
   examined. Arius [1108] was the originator of these disputations. He was
   a presbyter of the church at Alexandria in Egypt, and was at first a
   zealous thinker about doctrine, and upheld the innovations of Melitius.
   Eventually, however, he abandoned this latter opinion, [1109] and was
   ordained deacon by Peter, bishop of Alexandria, who afterwards cast him
   out of the church, because when Peter anathematized the zealots of
   Melitius and rejected their baptism, Arius assailed him for these acts
   and could not be restrained in quietness. After the martyrdom of Peter,
   Arius asked forgiveness of Achillas, and was restored to his office as
   deacon, and afterwards elevated to the presbytery. Afterwards
   Alexander, also, held him in high repute, since he was a most expert
   logician; for it was said that he was not lacking in such knowledge. He
   fell into absurd discourses, so that he had the audacity to preach in
   the church what no one before him had ever suggested; namely, that the
   Son of God was made out of that which had no prior existence, that
   there was a period of time in which he existed not; that, as possessing
   free will, he was capable of vice and virtue, and that he was created
   and made: to these, many other similar assertions were added as he went
   forward into the arguments and the details of inquiry. Those who heard
   these doctrines advanced, blamed Alexander for not opposing the
   innovations at variance with doctrine. But this bishop deemed it more
   advisable to leave each party to the free discussion of doubtful
   topics, so that by persuasion rather than by force, they might cease
   from contention; hence he sat down as a judge with some of his clergy,
   and led both sides into a discussion. But it happened on this occasion,
   as is generally the case in a strife of words, that each party claimed
   the victory. Arius defended his assertions, but the others contended
   that the Son is consubstantial and co-eternal with the Father. The
   council was convened a second time, and the same points contested, but
   they came to no agreement amongst themselves. During the debate,
   Alexander seemed to incline first to one party and then to the other
   [1110] ; finally, however, he declared himself in favor of those who
   affirmed that the Son was consubstantial and co-eternal with the
   Father, and he commanded Arius to receive this doctrine, and to reject
   his former opinions. Arius, however, would not be persuaded to
   compliance, and many of the bishops and clergy considered his statement
   of doctrine to be correct. Alexander, therefore, ejected him and the
   clergy who concurred with him in sentiment from the church. Those of
   the parish of Alexandria, who had embraced his opinions, were the
   presbyters Aithalas, Achillas, Carpones, Sarmates, and Arius, [1111]
   and the deacons Euzoïus, Macarius, Julius, Menas, and Helladius. Many
   of the people, likewise, sided with them: some, because they imagined
   their doctrines to be of God; others, as frequently happens in similar
   cases, because they believed them to have been ill-treated and unjustly
   excommunicated. Such being the state of affairs at Alexandria, the
   partisans of Arius, deeming it prudent to seek the favor of the bishops
   of other cities, sent legations to them; they sent a written statement
   of their doctrines to them, requesting them that, if they considered
   such sentiments to be of God, they would signify to Alexander that he
   ought not to molest them; but that if they disapproved of the
   doctrines, they should teach them what opinions were necessary to be
   held. This precaution was of no little advantage to them; for their
   tenets became thus universally disseminated, and the questions they had
   started became matters of debate among all the bishops. Some wrote to
   Alexander, entreating him not to receive the partisans of Arius into
   communion unless they repudiated their opinions, while others wrote to
   urge a contrary line of conduct. When Alexander perceived that many who
   were revered by the appearance of good conduct, and weighty by the
   persuasiveness of eloquence, held with the party of Arius, and
   particularly Eusebius, president of the church of Nicomedia, a man of
   considerable learning and held in high repute at the palace; he wrote
   to the bishops of every church desiring them not to hold communion with
   them. This measure kindled the zeal of each party the more, and as
   might have been expected, the contest was increasingly agitated.
   Eusebius and his partisans had often petitioned Alexander, but could
   not persuade him; so that considering themselves insulted, they became
   indignant and came to a stronger determination to support the doctrine
   of Arius. A synod having been convened in Bithynia, they wrote to all
   the bishops, desiring them to hold communion with the Arians, as with
   those making a true confession, and to require Alexander to hold
   communion with them likewise. As compliance could not be extorted from
   Alexander, Arius sent messengers to Paulinas, bishop of Tyre, to
   Eusebius Pamphilus, who presided over the church of Cæsarea in
   Palestine, and to Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis, soliciting
   permission for himself and for his adherents, as they had previously
   attained the rank of presbyters, to form the people who were with them
   into a church. For it was the custom in Alexandria, as it still is in
   the present day, that all the churches should be under one bishop, but
   that each presbyter should have his own church, in which to assemble
   the people. These three bishops, in concurrence with others who were
   assembled in Palestine, granted the petition of Arius, and permitted
   him to assemble the people as before; but enjoined submission to
   Alexander, and commanded Arius to strive incessantly to be restored to
   peace and communion with him.

   Chapter XVI.--Constantine, having heard of the Strife of the Bishops,
   and the Difference of Opinion concerning the Passover, is greatly
   troubled and sends Hosius, a Spaniard, Bishop of Cordova, to
   Alexandria, to abolish the Dissension among the Bishops, and to settle
   the Dispute about the Passover.

   After there had been many synods held in Egypt, and the contest had
   still continued to increase in violence, the report of the dissension
   reached the palace, and Constantine was thereby greatly troubled; for
   just at this period, when religion was beginning to be more generally
   propagated, many were deterred by the difference in doctrines from
   embracing Christianity. The emperor [1112] openly charged Arius and
   Alexander with having originated this disturbance, and wrote to rebuke
   them for having made a controversy public which it was in their power
   to have concealed, and for having contentiously agitated a question
   which ought never to have been mooted, or upon which, at least, their
   opinion ought to have been given quietly. He told them that they ought
   not to have separated from others on account of difference of sentiment
   concerning certain points of doctrine.

   For concerning the Divine Providence men ought necessarily to hold one
   and the same belief; but the minute researches in this province,
   especially if they do not bring them to the one opinion, must be
   retained in secret according to all reason. He exhorted them to put
   away all loose talk about such points, and to be of one mind; for he
   had been not a little grieved, and on this account he had renounced his
   intention of visiting the cities of the East. It was in this strain
   that he wrote to Alexander and to Arius, reproving and exhorting them
   both.

   Constantine was also deeply grieved at the diversity of opinion which
   prevailed concerning the celebration of the Passover; [1113] for some
   of the cities in the East differed on this point, although they did not
   withhold from communion with one another; they kept the festival more
   according to the manner of the Jews, [1114] and as was natural by this
   divergence, detracted from the splendor of the festal sacrifice. The
   emperor zealously endeavored to remove both these causes of dissension
   from the church; and thinking to be able to remove the evil before it
   advanced to greater proportions, he sent one who was honored for his
   faith, his virtuous life, and most approved in those former times for
   his confessions about this doctrine, to reconcile those who were
   divided on account of doctrine in Egypt, and those who in the East
   differed about the Passover. This man was Hosius, bishop of Cordova.

   Chapter XVII.--Of the Council convened at Nicæa on Account of Arius.

   When it was found that the event did not answer the expectations of the
   emperor, but that on the contrary, the contention was too great for
   reconciliation, so that he who had been sent to make peace returned
   without having accomplished his mission, Constantine convened a synod
   at Nicæa, in Bithynia, and wrote [1115] to the most eminent men of the
   churches in every country, directing them to be there on an appointed
   day. [1116] Of those who occupied the apostolic sees, the following
   participated in this conference: Macarius of Jerusalem, Eustathius, who
   already presided over the church of Antioch on the Orontes; and
   Alexander of Alexandria near Lake Mareotis. Julius, [1117] bishop of
   Rome, was unable to attend on account of extreme old age; but his place
   was supplied by Vito and Vicentius, presbyters of his church. Many
   other excellent and good men from different nations were congregated
   together, of whom some were celebrated for their learning, their
   eloquence, and their knowledge of the sacred books, and other
   discipline; some for the virtuous tenor of their life, and others for
   the combination of all these qualifications. About three hundred and
   twenty bishops were present, accompanied by a multitude of presbyters
   and deacons. There were, likewise, men present who were skilled in
   dialectics, and ready to assist in the discussions. And as was usually
   the case on such occasions, many priests resorted to the council for
   the purpose of transacting their own private affairs; [1118] for they
   considered this a favorable opportunity for rectifying their
   grievances, and in what points each found fault with the rest, he
   presented a document to the emperor, wherein he noted the offenses
   committed against himself. As this course was pursued day after day,
   the emperor set apart one certain day on which all complaints were to
   be brought before him. When the appointed time arrived, he took the
   memorials which had been presented to him, and said, "All these
   accusations will be brought forward in their own season at the great
   day of judgment, and will there be judged by the Great Judge of all
   men; as to me, I am but a man, and it would be evil in me to take
   cognizance of such matters, seeing that the accuser and the accused are
   priests; and the priests ought so to act as never to become amenable to
   the judgment of others. Imitate, therefore, the divine love and mercy
   of God, and be ye reconciled to one another; withdraw your accusations
   against each other; let us be persuaded, and let us devote our
   attention to those subjects connected with the faith on account of
   which we are assembled." After this address, in order to make the
   document of each man nugatory, the emperor commanded the memorials to
   be burnt, and then appointed a day for solving the doubtful points. But
   before the appointed time arrived, the bishops assembled together, and
   having summoned Arius to attend, began to examine the disputed topics,
   each one amongst them advancing his own opinion. As might have been
   expected, however, many different questions started out of the
   investigation: some of the bishops spoke against the introduction of
   novelties contrary to the faith which had been delivered to them from
   the beginning. And those especially who had adhered to simplicity of
   doctrine argued that the faith of God ought to be received without
   curious inquiries; others, however, contended that ancient opinions
   ought not to be followed without examination. Many of the bishops who
   were then assembled, and of the clergy who accompanied them, being
   remarkable for their dialectic skill, and practiced in such rhetorical
   methods, became conspicuous, and attracted the notice of the emperor
   and the court. Of that number Athanasius, who was then a deacon of
   Alexandria, and had accompanied his bishop Alexander, seemed to have
   the largest share in the counsel concerning these subjects.

   Chapter XVIII.--Two Philosophers are converted to the Faith by the
   Simplicity of Two Old Men with whom they hold a Disputation.

   While these disputations were being carried on, certain of the pagan
   philosophers became desirous of taking part in them; some, because they
   wished for information as to the doctrine that was inculcated; and
   others, because, feeling incensed against the Christians on account of
   the recent suppression of the pagan religion, they wished to convert
   the inquiry about doctrine into a strife about words, so as to
   introduce dissensions among them, and to make them appear as holding
   contradictory opinions. It is related that one of these philosophers,
   priding himself on his acknowledged superiority of eloquence, began to
   ridicule the priests, and thereby roused the indignation of a simple
   old man, highly esteemed as a confessor, who, although unskilled in
   logical refinements and wordiness, undertook to oppose him. The less
   serious of those who knew the confessor, raised a laugh [1119] at his
   expense for engaging in such an undertaking; but the more thoughtful
   felt anxious lest, in opposing so eloquent a man, he should only render
   himself ridiculous; yet his influence was so great, and his reputation
   so high among them, that they could not forbid his engaging in the
   debate; and he accordingly delivered himself in the following terms:
   "In the name of Jesus Christ, O philosopher, hearken to me. There is
   one God, the maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and
   invisible. He made all things by the power of the Word, and established
   them by the holiness of His Spirit. The Word, whom we call the Son of
   God, seeing that man was sunk in error and living like unto the beasts
   pitied him, and vouchsafed to be born of woman, to hold intercourse
   with men, and to die for them. And He will come again to judge each of
   us as to the deeds of this present life. We believe these things to be
   true with all simplicity. Do not, therefore, expend your labor in vain
   by striving to disprove facts which can only be understood by faith or
   by scrutinizing the manner in which these things did or did not come to
   pass. Answer me, dost thou believe?" The philosopher, astonished at
   what had occurred, replied, "I believe"; and having thanked the old man
   for having overcome him in argument, he began to teach the same
   doctrines to others. He exhorted those who still held his former
   sentiments to adopt the views he had embraced, assuring them on oath,
   that he had been impelled to embrace Christianity by a certain
   inexplicable impulse.

   It is said that a similar miracle was performed by Alexander, who
   governed the church of Constantinople. When Constantine returned to
   Byzantium, certain philosophers came to him to complain of the
   innovations in religion, and particularly of his having introduced a
   new form of worship into the state, contrary to that followed by his
   forefathers, and by all who were formerly in power, whether among the
   Greeks or the Romans. They likewise desired to hold a disputation on
   the doctrine with Alexander the bishop; and he, although unskilled in
   such argumentative contests, and perhaps persuaded by his life, seeing
   that he was an excellent and good man, accepted the struggle at the
   command of the emperor. When the philosophers were assembled, since
   every one wished to engage in the discussion, he requested that one
   whom they esteemed worthy might be chosen as spokesman, while the
   others were to remain silent. When one of the philosophers began to
   open the debate, Alexander said to him, "I command thee in the name of
   Jesus Christ not to speak." The man was instantaneously silenced. It is
   then right to consider whether it is a greater miracle that a man, and
   he a philosopher, should so easily be silenced by a word, or that a
   stone-wall should be cleft by the power of a word, which miracle I have
   heard some attribute to Julian, surnamed the Chaldean. [1120] I have
   understood that these events happened in the way above narrated.

   the Roman soldiers were perishing from thirst. Arnuphis, an Egyptian
   philosopher, was said to have wrought a similar miracle. Suidas, s. v.

   Chapter XIX.--When the Council was assembled, the Emperor delivered a
   Public Address.

   The bishops held long consultations; and after summoning Arius before
   them, they made an accurate test of his propositions; they were
   intently on their guard, not to come to a vote on either side. When at
   length the appointed day arrived on which it had been decided to settle
   the doubtful points, they assembled together [1121] in the palace,
   because the emperor had signified his intention of taking part in the
   deliberations. When he was in the same place with the priests, he
   passed through to the head of the conference, and seated himself on the
   throne which had been prepared for him, and the synod was then
   commanded to be seated; for seats had been arranged on either side
   along the walls of the palatial rooms, for it was the largest, and
   excelled the other chambers.

   After they were seated, Eusebius Pamphilus arose and delivered an
   oration [1122] in honor of the emperor, returning thanks to God on his
   account. When he had ceased speaking, and silence was restored, the
   emperor delivered himself in the following words: "I give thanks to God
   for all things, but particularly, O friends, for being permitted to see
   your conference. And the event has exceeded my prayer, in that so many
   priests of Christ have been conducted into the same place; now, it is
   my desire that you should be of one mind and be partakers of a
   consentient judgment, for I deem dissension in the Church of God as
   more dangerous than any other evil. Therefore when it was announced,
   and I understood you were in discord, an unwholesome thing to hear, I
   was deeply pained in soul; and least of all does it profit you, since
   you are the conductors of divine worship and arbiters of peace. On this
   account it is, that I have called you together in a holy Synod, and
   being both your emperor and your fellow-physician, I seek for you a
   favor which is acceptable to our common Lord, and as honorable for me
   to receive, as for you to grant. The favor which I seek is, that you
   examine the causes of the strife, and put a consentient and peaceful
   end thereto so that I may triumph with you over the envious demon, who
   excited this internal revolt because he was provoked to see our
   external enemies and tyrants under our feet, and envied our good
   estate." The emperor pronounced this discourse in Latin, and the
   interpretation was supplied by one at his side.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1121] Eus. V. C. iii. 10-12.

   [1122] Theodoret, H. E. i. 7, places this oration in the mouth of
   Eustathius, bishop of Antioch. The variations in the speech as recorded
   by Sozomen, show his classic view of reporting. Theodoret's report of
   Constantine's address is equally divergent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XX.--After having given Audience to both Parties, the Emperor
   condemned the Followers of Arius and banished them.

   The next debate by the priests turned upon doctrine. [1123] The emperor
   gave patient attention to the speeches of both parties; he applauded
   those who spoke well, rebuked those who displayed a tendency to
   altercation, and according to his apprehension of what he heard, for he
   was not wholly unpracticed in the Greek tongue, he addressed himself
   with kindness to each one. Finally all the priests agreed with one
   another and conceded that the Son is consubstantial with the Father. At
   the commencement of the conference there were but seventeen who praised
   the opinion of Arius, but eventually the majority of these yielded
   assent to the general view. To this judgment the emperor likewise
   deferred, for he regarded the unanimity of the conference to be a
   divine approbation; and he ordained that any one who should be
   rebellious thereto, should forthwith be sent into banishment, as guilty
   of endeavoring to overthrow the Divine definitions. I had thought it
   necessary to reproduce the very document concerning the matter, as an
   example of the truth, in order that posterity might possess in a fixed
   and clear form the symbol of the faith which proved pacificatory at the
   time but since some pious friends, who understood such matters,
   recommended that these truths ought to be spoken of and heard by the
   initiated and their initiators [1124] only, I agreed with their
   council; for it is not unlikely that some of the uninitiated may read
   this book. While I have concealed such of the prohibited material as I
   ought to keep silent about, I have not altogether left the reader
   ignorant of the opinions held by the synod.

   Chapter XXI.--What the Council determined about Arius; the Condemnation
   of his Followers; his Writings are to be burnt; certain of the High
   Priests differ from the Council; the Settlement of the Passover.

   It ought to be known, that they affirmed the Son to be consubstantial
   with the Father; and that those are to be excommunicated and voted
   aliens to the Catholic Church, who assert that there was a time in
   which the Son existed not, and before He was begotten He was not, and
   that He was made from what had no existence, and that He is of another
   hypostasis or substance from the Father, and that He is subject to
   change or mutation. This decision was sanctioned by Eusebius, bishop of
   Nicomedia; by Theognis, bishop of Nicæa; by Maris, bishop of Chalcedon;
   by Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis; and by Secundus, bishop of
   Ptolemaïs in Libya. [1125] Eusebius Pamphilus, however, withheld his
   assent for a little while, but on further examination assented. [1126]
   The council excommunicated Arius and his adherents, and prohibited his
   entering Alexandria. The words in which his opinions were couched were
   likewise condemned, as also a work entitled "Thalia," which he had
   written on the subject. I have not read this book, but I understand
   that it is of a loose character, resembling in license Sotadus. [1127]
   It ought to be known that although Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, and
   Theognis, bishop of Nicæa, assented to the document of this faith set
   forth by the council, they neither agreed nor subscribed to the
   deposition of Arius. The emperor punished Arius with exile, and
   dispatched edicts to the bishops and people of every country,
   denouncing him and his adherents as ungodly, and commanding. that their
   books should be destroyed, in order that no remembrance of him or of
   the doctrine which he had broached might remain. Whoever should be
   found secreting his writings and who should not burn them immediately
   on the accusation, should undergo the penalty of death, and suffer
   capital punishment. The emperor wrote letters to every city against
   Arius and those who had received his doctrines, and commanded Eusebius
   and Theognis to quit the cities whereof they were bishops; he addressed
   himself in particular to the church of Nicomedia, urging it to adhere
   to the faith which had been set forth by the council, to elect orthodox
   bishops, to obey them, and to let the past fall into oblivion; and he
   threatened with punishment those who should venture to speak well of
   the exiled bishops, or to adopt their sentiments. In these and in other
   letters, he manifested resentment against Eusebius, because he had
   previously adopted the opinions of the tyrant, and had engaged in his
   plots. In accordance with the imperial edicts, Eusebius and Theognis
   were ejected from the churches which they held, and Amphion received
   that of Nicomedia, and Chrestus that of Nicæa. On the termination of
   this doctrinal controversy, the council decided that the Paschal feast
   should be celebrated at the same time in every place. [1128]

   Chapter XXII.--Acesius, Bishop of the Novatians, is summoned by the
   Emperor to be present at the First Council.

   It is related, that the emperor, under the impulse of an ardent desire
   to see harmony re-established among Christians, summoned Acesius,
   bishop of the church of the Novatians, [1129] to the council, placed
   before him the definition of the faith and of the feast, which had
   already been confirmed by the signatures of the bishops, and asked
   whether he could agree thereto. Acesius answered that their exposition
   defined no new doctrine, and that he accorded in opinion with the
   Synod, and that he had from the beginning held these sentiments with
   respect both to the faith and to the feast. "Why, then," said the
   emperor, "do you keep aloof from communion with others, if you are of
   one mind with them?" He replied that the dissension first broke out
   under Decius, between Novatius and Cornelius, [1130] and that he
   considered such persons unworthy of communion who, after baptism, had
   fallen into those sins which the Scriptures declare to be unto death;
   [1131] for that the remission of those sins, he thought, depended on
   the authority of God only, and not on the priests. The emperor replied,
   by saying, "O Acesius, take a ladder and ascend alone to heaven." By
   this speech I do not imagine the emperor intended to praise Acesius,
   but rather to blame him, because, being but a man, he fancied himself
   exempt from sin. [1132]

   Chapter XXIII.--Canons appointed by the Council; Paphnutius, a certain
   Confessor, restrains the Council from forming a Canon enjoining
   Celibacy to all who were about to be honored with the Priesthood.

   Zealous of reforming the life of those who were engaged about the
   churches, the Synod enacted laws which were called canons. [1133] While
   they were deliberating about this, some thought that a law ought to be
   passed enacting that bishops and presbyters, deacons and subdeacons,
   should hold no intercourse with the wife they had espoused before they
   entered the priesthood; but Paphnutius, [1134] the confessor, stood up
   and testified against this proposition; he said that marriage was
   honorable and chaste, and that cohabitation with their own wives was
   chastity, and advised the Synod not to frame such a law, for it would
   be difficult to bear, and might serve as an occasion of incontinence to
   them and their wives; and he reminded them, that according to the
   ancient tradition of the church, those who were unmarried when they
   took part in the communion of sacred orders, were required to remain
   so, but that those who were married, were not to put away their wives.
   Such was the advice of Paphnutius, although he was himself unmarried,
   and in accordance with it, the Synod concurred in his counsel, enacted
   no law about it, but left the matter to the decision of individual
   judgment, and not to compulsion. The Synod, however, enacted other laws
   regulating the government of the Church; and these laws may easily be
   found, as they are in the possession of many individuals.

   Chapter XXIV.--Concerning Melitius; the Excellent Directions made by
   the Holy Council in his Complications.

   After an investigation had been made into the conduct of Melitius when
   in Egypt, the Synod sentenced him to reside in Lycus, [1135] and to
   retain only the name of bishop; and prohibited him from ordaining any
   one either in a city or a village. Those who had previously been
   ordained by him, were permitted by this law, to remain in communion and
   in the ministry, but were to be accounted secondary in point of dignity
   to the clergy in church and parish. [1136] When by death an appointment
   became vacant, they were allowed to succeed to it, if deemed worthy, by
   the vote of the multitude, but in this case, were to be ordained by the
   bishop of the Church of Alexandria, for they were interdicted from
   exercising any power or influence in elections. This regulation
   appeared just to the Synod, for Melitius [1137] and his followers had
   manifested great rashness and temerity in administering ordination; so
   that it also deprived the ordinations which differed from those of
   Peter of all consideration. He, when he conducted the Alexandrian
   Church, fled on account of the persecution then raging, but afterwards
   suffered martyrdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1135] Lycus (Lycopolis) is not named in the letter of the Synod which
   says simply that he should reside in his own city. Soz. took the fact
   from Athan. Apol. cont. Arian. 71, where Melitius, in the brief to
   Alexander, calls himself bishop of Lycus. This is a proof of our
   historian's use of the same documents to amplify the statements of
   Socrates.

   [1137] The best text reads Melitius, not Meletius, so Athanas. and
   Soc.; usually the books write Meletius and Meletians. We follow the
   reading.

   Chapter XXV.--The Emperor prepared a Public Table for the Synod, after
   inviting its Members to Constantinople, and honoring them with Gifts,
   he exhorted all to be of One Mind, and forwarded to Alexandria and
   every other place the Decrees of the Holy Synod.

   At the very time that these decrees were passed by the council, the
   twentieth anniversary [1138] of the reign of Constantine was
   celebrated; for it was a Roman custom to have a feast on the tenth year
   of every reign. The emperor, therefore, thought it to be opportune, and
   invited the Synod to the festival, and presented suitable gifts to
   them; and when they prepared to return home, he called them all
   together, and exhorted them to be of one mind about the faith and at
   peace among themselves, so that no dissensions might henceforth creep
   in among them. After many other similar exhortations, he concluded by
   commanding them to be diligent in prayer, and always to supplicate God
   for himself, his children, and the empire, and after he had thus
   addressed those who had come to Nicæa, he bade them farewell. He wrote
   to the churches in every city, in order that he might make plain to
   those who had not been present, what had been rectified by the Synod;
   and especially to the Church of Alexandria he wrote more than this;
   urging them to lay aside all dissent, and to be harmonious in the faith
   issued by the Synod; for this could be nothing else than the judgment
   of God, since it was established by the Holy Spirit from the
   concurrence of so many and such illustrious high priests, and approved
   after accurate inquiry and test of all the doubtful points.

   Book II.

   Chapter I.--The Discovery of the Life-Bringing Cross and of the Holy
   Nails.

   When the business at Nicæa had been transacted as above related, the
   priests returned home. The emperor rejoiced exceedingly at the
   restoration of unity of opinion in the Catholic Church, and desirous of
   expressing in behalf of himself, his children, and the empire, the
   gratitude towards God which the unanimity of the bishops inspired, he
   directed that a house of prayer should be erected to God at Jerusalem
   [1139] near the place called Calvary. At the same time his mother
   Helena repaired to the city for the purpose of offering up prayer, and
   of visiting the sacred places. Her zeal for Christianity made her
   anxious to find the wood which had formed the adorable cross. But it
   was no easy matter to discover either this relic or the Lord's
   sepulchre; for the Pagans, who in former times had persecuted the
   Church, [1140] and who, at the first promulgation of Christianity, had
   had recourse to every artifice to exterminate it, had concealed that
   spot under much heaped up earth, and elevated what before was quite
   depressed, as it looks now, and the more effectually to conceal them,
   had enclosed the entire place of the resurrection and Mount Calvary
   within a wall, and had, moreover, ornamented the whole locality, and
   paved it with stone. They also erected a temple to Aphrodite, and set
   up a little image, so that those who repaired thither to worship Christ
   would appear to bow the knee to Aphrodite, and that thus the true cause
   of offering worship in that place would, in course of time, be
   forgotten; and that as Christians would not dare fearlessly to frequent
   the place or to point it out to others, the temple and statue would
   come to be regarded as exclusively appertaining to the Pagans. At
   length, however, the place was discovered, and the fraud about it so
   zealously maintained was detected; some say that the facts were first
   disclosed by a Hebrew who dwelt in the East, and who derived his
   information from some documents which had come to him by paternal
   inheritance; but it seems more accordant with truth to suppose that God
   revealed the fact by means of signs and dreams; for I do not think that
   human information is requisite when God thinks it best to make manifest
   the same. When by command of the emperor the place was excavated
   deeply, the cave whence our Lord arose from the dead was discovered;
   and at no great distance, three crosses were found and another separate
   piece of wood, on which were inscribed in white letters in Hebrew, in
   Greek, and in Latin, the following words: "Jesus of Nazareth, the king
   of the Jews." These words, as the sacred book of the gospels relates,
   were placed by command of Pilate, governor of Judæa, over the head of
   Christ. There yet, however, remained a difficulty in distinguishing the
   Divine cross from the others; for the inscription had been wrenched
   from it and thrown aside, and the cross itself had been cast aside with
   the others, without any distinction, when the bodies of the crucified
   were taken down. For according to history, the soldiers found Jesus
   dead upon the cross, and they took him down, and gave him up to be
   buried; while, in order to accelerate the death of the two thieves, who
   were crucified on either hand, they broke their legs, and then took
   down the crosses, and flung them out of the way. It was no concern of
   theirs to deposit the crosses in their first order; for it was growing
   late, and as the men were dead, they did not think it worth while to
   remain to attend to the crosses. A more Divine information than could
   be furnished by man was therefore necessary in order to distinguish the
   Divine cross from the others, and this revelation was given in the
   following manner: There was a certain lady of rank in Jerusalem who was
   afflicted with a most grievous and incurable disease; Macarius, bishop
   of Jerusalem, accompanied by the mother of the emperor and her
   attendants, repaired to her bedside. After engaging in prayer, Macarius
   signified by signs to the spectators that the Divine cross would be the
   one which, on being brought in contact with the invalid, should remove
   the disease. He approached her in turn with each of the crosses; but
   when two of the crosses were laid on her, it seemed but folly and
   mockery to her for she was at the gates of death. When, however, the
   third cross was in like manner brought to her, she suddenly opened her
   eyes, regained her strength, and immediately sprang from her bed, well.
   It is said that a dead person was, in the same way, restored to life.
   The venerated wood having been thus identified, the greater portion of
   it was deposited in a silver case, in which it is still preserved in
   Jerusalem: but the empress sent part of it to her son Constantine,
   together with the nails by which the body of Christ had been fastened.
   Of these, it is related, the emperor had a head-piece and bit made for
   his horse, according to the prophecy of Zechariah, who referred to this
   period when he said, "that which shall be upon the bit of the horse
   shall be holy to the Lord Almighty." [1141] These things, indeed, were
   formerly known to the sacred prophets, and predicted by them, and at
   length, when it seemed to God that they should be manifested, were
   confirmed by wonderful works. Nor does this appear so marvelous when it
   is remembered that, even among the Pagans, it was confessed that the
   Sibyl had predicted that thus it should be,--

   "Oh most blessed tree, on which our Lord was hung." [1142]

   Our most zealous adversaries cannot deny the truth of this fact, and it
   is hence evident that a pre-manifestation was made of the wood of the
   cross, and of the adoration (sebas) it received.

   The above incidents we have related precisely as they were delivered to
   us by men of great accuracy, by whom the information was derived by
   succession from father to son; and others have recorded the same events
   in writing for the benefit of posterity.

   Chapter II.--Concerning Helena, the Mother of the Emperor; she visited
   Jerusalem, built Temples in that City, and performed other Godly Works:
   Her Death.

   About this period, the emperor, having determined upon erecting a
   temple in honor of God, charged the governors to see that the work was
   executed in the most magnificent and costly manner possible. His mother
   Helena also erected two temples, [1143] the one at Bethlehem near the
   cave where Christ was born, the other on ridges of the Mount of Olives,
   whence He was taken up to heaven. Many other acts show her piety and
   religiousness, among which the following is not the least remarkable:
   During her residence at Jerusalem, it is related that she assembled the
   sacred virgins at a feast, ministered to them at supper, presented them
   with food, poured water on their hands, and performed other similar
   services customary to those who wait upon guests. When she visited the
   cities of the East, she bestowed befitting gifts on the churches in
   every town, enriched those individuals who had been deprived of their
   possessions, supplied ungrudgingly the necessities of the poor, and
   restored to liberty those who had been long imprisoned, or condemned to
   exile or the mines. It seems to me that so many holy actions demanded a
   recompense; and indeed, even in this life, she was raised to the summit
   of magnificence and splendor; she was proclaimed Augusta; her image was
   stamped on golden coins, and she was invested by her son with authority
   over the imperial treasury to give it according to her judgment. Her
   death, too, was glorious; for when, at the age of eighty, she quitted
   this life, she left her son and her descendants (like her of the race
   of Cæsar), masters of the Roman world. And if there be any advantage in
   such fame--forgetfulness did not conceal her though she was dead--the
   coming age has the pledge of her perpetual memory; for two cities are
   named after her, the one in Bithynia, and the other in Palestine.
   [1144] Such is the history of Helena.

   Chapter III.--Temples built by Constantine the Great; the City called
   by his Name; its Founding; the Buildings within it; the Temple of
   Michael the Archsoldier, in the Sosthenium, and the Miracles which have
   occurred there.

   The emperor, [1145] always intent on the advancement of religion,
   erected the most beautiful temples to God in every place, particularly
   in metropolises, such as Nicomedia in Bithynia, Antioch on the river
   Orontes, and Byzantium. He greatly improved this latter city, and
   constituted it the equal of Rome in power, and participation in the
   government; for, when he had settled the affairs of the empire
   according to his own mind, and had rectified foreign affairs by wars
   and treaties, he resolved upon founding a city which should be called
   by his own name, and should be equal in celebrity to Rome. With this
   intention, he repaired to a plain at the foot of Troy, near the
   Hellespont, above the tomb of Ajax, where, it is said, the Achaians had
   their naval stations and tents while besieging Troy; and here he laid
   the plan of a large and beautiful city, and built the gates on an
   elevated spot of ground, whence they are still visible from the sea to
   those sailing by. But when he had advanced thus far, God appeared to
   him by night, and commanded him to seek another spot. Led by the hand
   of God, he arrived at Byzantium in Thrace, beyond Chalcedon in
   Bithynia, and here he was desired to build his city and to render it
   worthy of the name of Constantine. In obedience to the words of God, he
   therefore enlarged the city formerly called Byzantium, and surrounded
   it with high walls. He also erected magnificent dwelling houses
   southward through the regions. Since he was aware that the former
   population was insufficient for so great a city, he peopled it with men
   of rank and their households, whom he summoned hither from the elder
   Rome and from other countries. He imposed taxes to cover the expenses
   of building and adorning the city, and of supplying its inhabitants
   with food, and providing the city with all the other requisites. He
   adorned it sumptuously with a hippodrome, fountains, porticos, and
   other structures. He named it New Rome and Constantinople, and
   constituted it the imperial capital for all the inhabitants of the
   North, the South, the East, and the shores of the Mediterranean, from
   the cities on the Ister and from Epidamnus and the Ionian gulf, to
   Cyrene and that part of Libya called Borium.

   He constructed another council house which they call senate; he ordered
   the same honors and festal days as those customary to the other Romans,
   and he did not fail studiously to make the city which bore his name
   equal in every respect to that of Rome in Italy; nor were his wishes
   thwarted; for by the assistance of God, it had to be confessed as great
   in population and wealth. I know of no cause to account for this
   extraordinary aggrandizement, unless it be the piety of the builder and
   of the inhabitants, and their compassion and liberality towards the
   poor. The zeal they manifested for the Christian faith was so great
   that many of the Jewish inhabitants and most of the Greeks were
   converted. As this city became the capital of the empire during the
   period of religious prosperity, it was not polluted by altars, Grecian
   temples, nor sacrifices; and although Julian authorized the
   introduction of idolatry for a short space of time, it soon afterwards
   became extinct. Constantine further honored this newly compacted city
   of Christ, named after himself, by adorning it with numerous and
   magnificent houses of prayer. And the Deity also co-operated with the
   spirit of the emperor, and by Divine manifestations persuaded men that
   these prayer houses in the city were holy and salvatory. According to
   the general opinion of foreigners and citizens, the most remarkable
   church was that built in a place formerly called Hestiæ. This place,
   which is now called Michaelium, lies to the right of those who sail
   from Pontus to Constantinople, and is about thirty-five stadia distant
   from the latter city by water, but if you make the circuit of the bay,
   the journey between them is seventy stadia and upwards. This place
   obtained the name which now prevails, because it is believed that
   Michael, the Divine archangel, once appeared there. And I also affirm
   that this is true, because I myself received the greatest benefits, and
   the experience of really helpful deeds on the part of many others
   proves this to be so. For some who had fallen into fearful reverses or
   unavoidable dangers, others with disease and unknown sufferings, there
   prayed to God, and met with a change in their misfortunes. I should be
   prolix were I to give details of circumstance and person. But I cannot
   omit mentioning the case of Aquilinus, who is even at the present time
   residing with us, and who is an advocate in the same court of justice
   as that to which we belong. [1146] I shall relate what I heard from him
   concerning this occurrence and what I saw. Being attacked with a severe
   fever, arising from a yellowish bile, the physicians gave him some
   foreign drug to drink. This he vomited, and, by the effort of vomiting,
   diffused the bile, which tinged his countenance with a yellow color.
   Hence he had to vomit all his food and drink. For a long time he
   remained in this state; and since his nourishment would not be quiet in
   him, the skill of the physicians was at a loss for the suffering.
   Finding that he was already half dead, he commanded his servant to
   carry him to the house of prayer; for he affirmed earnestly that there
   he would either die or be freed from his disease. While he was lying
   there, a Divine Power appeared to him by night, and commanded him to
   dip his foot in a confection made of honey, wine, and pepper. The man
   did so, and was freed from his complaint, although the prescription was
   contrary to the professional rules of the physicians, a confection of
   so very hot a nature being considered adverse to a bilious disorder. I
   have also heard that Probianus, one of the physicians of the palace,
   who was suffering greatly from a disease in the feet, likewise met with
   deliverance from sickness at this place, and was accounted worthy of
   being visited with a wonderful and Divine vision. He had formerly been
   attached to the Pagan superstitions, but afterwards became a Christian;
   yet, while he admitted in one way or another the probability of the
   rest of our doctrines, he could not understand how, by the Divine
   cross, the salvation of all is effected. While his mind was in doubt on
   this subject, the symbol of the cross, which lay on the altar of this
   church, was pointed out to him in the Divine vision, and he heard a
   voice openly declaring that, as Christ had been crucified on the cross,
   the necessities of the human race or of individuals, whatsoever they
   might be, could not be met by the ministration of Divine angels or of
   pious and good men; for that there was no power to rectify apart from
   the venerated cross. I have only recorded a few of the incidents which
   I know to have taken place in this temple, because there is not time to
   recount them all.

   Chapter IV.--What Constantine the Great effected about the Oak in
   Mamre; he also built a Temple.

   I consider it necessary to detail the proceedings of Constantine in
   relation to what is called the oak of Mamre. [1147] This place is now
   called Terebinthus, and is about fifteen stadia distant from Hebron,
   which lies to the south, but is two hundred and fifty stadia distant
   from Jerusalem. It is recorded that here the Son of God appeared to
   Abraham, with two angels, who had been sent against Sodom, and foretold
   the birth of his son. Here the inhabitants of the country and of the
   regions round Palestine, the Phoenicians, and the Arabians, assemble
   annually during the summer season to keep a brilliant feast; and many
   others, both buyers and sellers, resort thither on account of the fair.
   Indeed, this feast is diligently frequented by all nations: by the
   Jews, because they boast of their descent from the patriarch Abraham;
   by the Pagans, because angels there appeared to men; and by Christians,
   because He who for the salvation of mankind was born of a virgin,
   afterwards manifested Himself there to a godly man. This place was
   moreover honored fittingly with religious exercises. Here some prayed
   to the God of all; some called upon the angels, poured out wine, burnt
   incense, or offered an ox, or he-goat, a sheep, or a cock. Each one
   made some beautiful product of his labor, and after carefully
   husbanding it through the entire year, he offered it according to
   promise as provision for that feast, both for himself and his
   dependents. And either from honor to the place, or from fear of Divine
   wrath, they all abstained from coming near their wives, although during
   the feast these were more than ordinarily studious of their beauty and
   adornment. Nor, if they chanced to appear and to take part in the
   public processions, did they act at all licentiously. Nor did they
   behave imprudently in any other respect, although the tents were
   contiguous to each other, and they all lay promiscuously together. The
   place is open country, and arable, and without houses, with the
   exception of the buildings around Abraham's old oak and the well he
   prepared. No one during the time of the feast drew water from that
   well; for according to Pagan usage, some placed burning lamps near it;
   some poured out wine, or cast in cakes; and others, coins, myrrh, or
   incense. Hence, as I suppose, the water was rendered useless by
   commixture with the things cast into it. Once whilst these customs were
   being celebrated by the Pagans, after the aforesaid manner, and as was
   the established usage with hilarity, the mother-in-law [1148] of
   Constantine was present for prayer, and apprised the emperor of what
   was being done. On receiving this information, he rebuked the bishops
   of Palestine in no measured terms, because they had neglected their
   duty, and had permitted a holy place to be defiled by impure libations
   and sacrifices; and he expressed his godly censure in an epistle which
   he wrote on the subject to Macarius, bishop of Jerusalem, to Eusebius
   Pamphilus, and to the bishops of Palestine. He commanded these bishops
   to hold a conference on this subject with the Phoenician bishops, and
   issue directions for the demolition, from the foundations, of the altar
   formerly erected there, the destruction of the carved images by fire,
   and the erection of a church worthy of so ancient and so holy a place.
   The emperor finally enjoined, that no libations or sacrifices should be
   offered on the spot, but that it should be exclusively devoted to the
   worship of God according to the law of the Church; and that if any
   attempt should be made to restore the former rites, the bishops were to
   inform against the delinquent, in order that he might be subjected to
   the greatest punishment. The governors and priests of Christ strictly
   enforced the injunctions contained in the emperor's letter.

   Chapter V.--Constantine destroyed the Places dedicated to the Idols,
   and persuaded the People to prefer Christianity.

   As many nations and cities throughout the whole realm of his subjects
   retained a feeling of fear and veneration towards their vain idols,
   which led them to disregard the doctrines of the Christians, and to
   have a care for their ancient customs, and the manners and feasts of
   their fathers, it appeared necessary to the emperor to teach the
   governors to suppress their superstitious rites of worship. He thought
   that this would be easily accomplished if he could get them to despise
   their temples and the images contained therein. [1149] To carry this
   project into execution he did not require military aid; for Christian
   men belonging to the palace went from city to city bearing imperial
   letters. The people were induced to remain passive from the fear that,
   if they resisted these edicts, they, their children, and their wives,
   would be exposed to evil. The vergers and the priests, being
   unsupported by the multitude, brought out their most precious
   treasures, and the idols called diopete, [1150] and through these
   servitors, the gifts were drawn forth from the shrines and the hidden
   recesses in the temples. The spots previously inaccessible, and known
   only to the priests, were made accessible to all who desired to enter.
   Such of the images as were constructed of precious material, and
   whatever else was valuable, were purified by fire, and became public
   property. The brazen images which were skillfully wrought were carried
   to the city, named after the emperor, and placed there as objects of
   embellishment, where they may still be seen in public places, as in the
   streets, the hippodrome, and the palaces. Amongst them was the statue
   of Apollo which was in the seat of the oracle of the Pythoness, and
   likewise the statues of the Muses from Helicon, the tripods from
   Delphos, and the much extolled Pan, which Pausanias the Lacedæmonian
   and the Grecian cities had devoted,--after the war against the Medes.

   As to the temples, some were stripped of their doors, others of their
   roofs, and others were neglected, allowed to fall into ruin, or
   destroyed. The temple of Æsculapius in Ægis, a city of Cilicia, and
   that of Venus at Aphaca, near Mount Lebanon and the River Adonis, were
   then undermined and entirely destroyed. Both of these temples were most
   highly honored and reverenced by the ancients; as the Ægeatæ were wont
   to say, that those among them who were weakened in body were delivered
   from diseases because the demon manifested himself by night, and healed
   them. And at Aphaca, it was believed that on a certain prayer being
   uttered on a given day, a fire like a star descended from the top of
   Lebanon and sunk into the neighboring river; they affirmed that this
   was Urania, for they call Aphrodite by this name. The efforts of the
   emperor succeeded to the utmost of his anticipations; for on beholding
   the objects of their former reverence and fear boldly cast down and
   stuffed with straw and hay, the people were led to despise what they
   had previously venerated, and to blame the erroneous opinion of their
   ancestors. Others, envious at the honor in which Christians were held
   by the emperor, deemed it necessary to imitate the acts of the ruler;
   others devoted themselves to an examination of Christianity, and by
   means of signs, of dreams, or of conferences with bishops and monks,
   were convinced that it was better to become Christians. From this
   period, nations and citizens spontaneously renounced their former
   opinion. At that time a port of Gaza, called Majuma, wherein
   superstition and ancient ceremonies had been hitherto admired, turned
   unitedly with all its inhabitants to Christianity. The emperor, in
   order to reward their piety, deemed them worthy of the greatest honor,
   and distinguished the place as a city, a status it had not previously
   enjoyed, and named it Constantia: thus honoring the spot on account of
   its piety, by bestowing on it the name of the dearest of his children.
   On the same account, also, Constantine in Phoenicia is known to have
   received its name from the emperor. But it would not be convenient to
   record every instance of this kind, for many other cities about this
   time went over to religion, and spontaneously, without any command of
   the emperor, destroyed the adjacent temples and statues, and erected
   houses of prayer.

   Chapter VI.--The Reason why under Constantine, the Name of Christ was
   spread throughout the Whole World.

   The church having been in this manner spread throughout the whole Roman
   world, religion was introduced even among the barbarians themselves.
   [1151] The tribes on both sides of the Rhine were Christianized, as
   likewise the Celts and the Gauls who dwelt upon the most distant shores
   of the ocean; the Goths, too, and such tribes as were contiguous to
   them, who formerly dwelt on either of the high shores of the Danube,
   had long shared in the Christian faith, and had changed into a gentler
   and more rational observance. Almost all the barbarians had professed
   to hold the Christian doctrine in honor, from the time of the wars
   between the Romans and foreign tribes, under the government of
   Gallienus and the emperors who succeeded him. For when an unspeakable
   multitude of mixed nations passed over from Thrace into Asia and
   overran it, and when other barbarians from the various regions did the
   same things to the adjacent Romans, many priests of Christ who had been
   taken captive, dwelt among these tribes; and during their residence
   among them, healed the sick, and cleansed those who were possessed of
   demons, by the name of Christ only, and by calling on the Son of God;
   moreover they led [1152] a blameless life, and excited envy by their
   virtues. The barbarians, amazed at the conduct and wonderful works of
   these men, thought that it would be prudent on their part, and pleasing
   to the Deity, if they should imitate those whom they saw were better;
   and, like them, would render homage to God. When teachers as to what
   should be done, had been proposed to them, the people were taught and
   baptized, and subsequently were gathered into churches.

   Chapter VII.--How the Iberians received the Faith of Christ.

   It is said that during this reign the Iberians, [1153] a large and
   warlike barbarian nation, confessed Christ. [1154] They dwelt to the
   north beyond Armenia. A Christian woman, who had been taken captive,
   induced them to renounce the religion of their fathers. She was very
   faithful and godly, and did not, amongst foreigners, remit her
   accustomed routine of religious duty. To fast, to pray night and day,
   and to praise God, constituted her delight. The barbarians inquired as
   to the motives of her endurance: she simply answered, that it was
   necessary in this way to worship the Son of God; but the name of Him
   who was to be worshiped, and the manner of worshiping, appeared strange
   to them. It happened that a boy of the country was taken ill, and his
   mother, according to the custom of the Iberians, took him around from
   house to house, in hope that some one might be found capable of curing
   the disease, and the change from the suffering might be easy for the
   afflicted. As no one capable of healing him could be found, the boy was
   brought to the captive, and she said, "as to medicines, I have neither
   experience nor knowledge, nor am I acquainted with the mode of applying
   ointments or plasters; but, O woman, I believe that Christ whom I
   worship, the true and great God, will become the Saviour of thy child."
   Then she prayed for him immediately and freed him from the disease,
   although just before it was believed that he was about to die. A little
   while after, the wife of the governor of the nation was, by an
   incurable disease, brought nigh unto death; yet she too was saved in
   the same manner. And thus did this captive teach the knowledge of
   Christ, by introducing Him as the dispenser of health, and as the Lord
   of life, of empire, and of all things. The governor's wife, convinced
   by her own personal experience, believed the words of the captive,
   embraced the Christian religion, and held the woman in much honor. The
   king, astonished at the celerity of the cure, and the miraculousness
   and healing of faith, learned the cause from his wife, and commanded
   that the captive should be rewarded with gifts. "Of gifts," said the
   queen, "her estimate is very low, whatever may be their value; she
   makes much of the service she renders to her God only. Therefore if we
   wish to gratify her, or desire to do what is safe and right, let us
   also worship God, who is mighty and a Saviour, and who, at His will,
   gives continuance unto kings, casts down the high, renders the
   illustrious abject, and saves those in terrible straits." The queen
   continued to argue in this excellent manner, but the sovereign of
   Iberia remained in doubt and unconvinced, as he reflected on the
   novelty of the matters, and also respected the religion of his fathers.
   A little while after, he went into the woods with his attendants, on a
   hunting excursion; all of a sudden thick clouds arose, and a heavy air
   was everywhere diffused by them, so as to conceal the heavens and the
   sun; profound night and great darkness pervaded the wood. Since each of
   the hunters was alarmed for his own safety, they scattered in different
   directions. The king, while thus wandering alone, thought of Christ, as
   men are wont to do in times of danger. He determined that if he should
   be delivered from his present emergency, he would walk before God and
   worship Him. At the very instant that these thoughts were upon his
   mind, the darkness was dissipated, the air became serene, the rays of
   the sun penetrated into the wood, and the king went out in safety. He
   informed his wife of the event that had befallen him, sent for the
   captive, and commanded her to teach him in what way he ought to worship
   Christ. When she had given as much instruction as it was right for a
   woman to say and do, he called together his subjects and declared to
   them plainly the Divine mercies which had been vouchsafed to himself
   and to his wife, and although uninitiated, he declared to his people
   the doctrines of Christ. The whole nation was persuaded to embrace
   Christianity, the men being convinced by the representations of the
   king, and the women by those of the queen and the captive. And speedily
   with the general consent of the entire nation, they prepared most
   zealously to build a church. When the external walls were completed,
   machines were brought to raise up the columns, and fix them upon their
   pedestals. It is related, that when the first and second columns had
   been righted by these means, great difficulty was found in fixing the
   third column, neither art nor physical strength being of any avail,
   although many were present to assist in the pulling. When evening came
   on, the female captive remained alone on the spot, and she continued
   there throughout the night, interceding with God that the erection of
   the columns might be easily accomplished, especially as all the rest
   had taken their departure distressed at the failure; for the column was
   only half raised, and remained standing, and one end of it was so
   embedded in its foundations that it was impossible to move it downward.
   It was God's will that by this, as well as by the preceding miracle,
   the Iberians should be still further confirmed about the Deity. Early
   in the morning, when they were present at the church, they beheld a
   wonderful spectacle, which seemed to them as a dream. The column, which
   on the day before had been immovable, now appeared erect, and elevated
   a small space above its proper base. All present were struck with
   admiration, and confessed, with one consent, that Christ alone is the
   true God. Whilst they were all looking on, the column slipped quietly
   and spontaneously, and was adjusted as by machinery on its base. The
   other columns were then erected with ease, and the Iberians completed
   the structure with greater alacrity. The church having been thus
   speedily built, the Iberians, at the recommendation of the captive,
   sent ambassadors to the Emperor Constantine, bearing proposals for
   alliance and treaties, and requesting that priests might be sent to
   their nation. On their arrival, the ambassadors related the events that
   had occurred, and how the whole nation with much care worshiped Christ.
   The emperor of the Romans was delighted with the embassy, and after
   acceding to every request that was proffered, dismissed the
   ambassadors. Thus did the Iberians receive the knowledge of Christ, and
   until this day they worship him carefully.

   Chapter VIII.--How the Armenians and Persians embraced Christianity.

   Subsequently the Christian religion became known to the neighboring
   tribes and was very greatly disseminated. [1155] The Armenians, I have
   understood, were the first to embrace Christianity. [1156] It is said
   that Tiridates, then the sovereign of that nation, became a Christian
   by means of a marvelous Divine sign which was wrought in his own house;
   and that he issued commands to all the subjects, by a herald, to adopt
   the same religion. [1157] I think that the beginning of the conversion
   of the Persians [1158] was owing to their intercourse with the
   Osroenians and Armenians; for it is likely that they would converse
   with such Divine men and make experience of their virtue.

   Chapter IX.--Sapor King of Persia is Excited against the Christians.
   Symeon, Bishop of Persia, and Usthazanes, a Eunuch, Suffer the Agony of
   Martyrdom.

   When, in course of time, the Christians increased in number, and began
   to form churches, and appointed priests and deacons, the Magi, who as a
   priestly tribe had from the beginning in successive generations acted
   as the guardians of the Persian religion, became deeply incensed
   against them. [1159] The Jews, who through envy are in some way
   naturally opposed to the Christian religion, were likewise offended.
   They therefore brought accusations before Sapor, the reigning
   sovereign, against Symeon, who was then archbishop of Seleucia and
   Ctesiphon, royal cities of Persia, and charged him with being a friend
   of the Cæsar of the Romans, and with communicating the affairs of the
   Persians to him. Sapor believed these accusations, and at first, ground
   the Christians with excessive taxes, although he knew that the
   generality of them had voluntarily embraced poverty. He entrusted the
   exaction to cruel men, hoping that, by the want of necessaries, and the
   atrocity of the exactors, they might be compelled to abjure their
   religion; for this was his aim. Afterwards, however, he commanded that
   the priests and conductors of the worship of God should be slain with
   the sword. The churches were demolished, their vessels were deposited
   in the treasury, and Symeon was arrested as a traitor to the kingdom
   and the religion of the Persians. Thus the Magi, with the co-operation
   of the Jews, quickly destroyed the houses of prayer. Symeon, on his
   apprehension, was bound with chains, and brought before the king. There
   the man evinced his excellence and courage; for when Sapor commanded
   that he should be led away to the torture, he did not fear, and would
   not prostrate himself. The king, greatly exasperated, demanded why he
   did not prostrate himself as he had done formerly. Symeon replied,
   "Formerly I was not led away bound in order that I might abjure the
   truth of God, and therefore I did not then object to pay the customary
   respect to royalty; but now it would not be proper for me to do so; for
   I stand here in defense of godliness and of our opinion." When he
   ceased speaking, the king commanded him to worship the sun, promising,
   as an inducement, to bestow gifts upon him, and to hold him in honor;
   but on the other hand, threatening, in case of non-compliance, to visit
   him and the whole body of Christians with destruction. When the king
   found that he neither frightened him by menaces, nor caused him to
   relax by promises, and that Symeon remained firm and refused to worship
   the sun, or to betray his religion, he commanded him to be put in bonds
   for a while, probably imagining that he would change his mind.

   When Symeon was being conducted to prison, Usthazanes, an aged eunuch,
   the foster-father of Sapor and superintendent of the palace, who
   happened to be sitting at the gates of the palace, arose to do him
   reverence. Symeon reproachfully forbade him in a loud and haughty
   voice, averted his countenance, and passed by; for the eunuch had been
   formerly a Christian, but had recently yielded to authority, and had
   worshiped the sun. This conduct so affected the eunuch that he wept
   aloud, laid aside the white garment with which he was robed, and
   clothed himself, as a mourner, in black. He then seated himself in
   front of the palace, crying and groaning, and saying, "Woe is me! What
   must not await me since I have denied God; and on this account Symeon,
   formerly my familiar friend, does not think me worthy of being spoken
   to, but turns away and hastens from me." When Sapor heard of what had
   occurred, he called the eunuch to him, and inquired into the cause of
   his grief, and asked him whether any calamity had befallen his family.
   Usthazanes replied and said, "O king, nothing has occurred to my
   family; but I would rather have suffered any other affliction
   whatsoever than that which has befallen me, and it would have been easy
   to bear. Now I mourn because I am alive, and ought to have been dead
   long ago; yet I still see the sun which, not voluntarily, but to please
   thee, I professed to worship. Therefore, on both accounts, it is just
   that I should die, for I have been a betrayer of Christ, and a deceiver
   of thee." He then swore by the Maker of heaven and earth, that he would
   never swerve from his convictions. Sapor, astonished at the wonderful
   conversion of the eunuch, was still more enraged against the
   Christians, as if they had effected it by enchantments. Still, he
   spared the old man, and strove with all his strength, by alternate
   gentleness and harshness, to bring him over to his own sentiments. But
   finding that his efforts were useless, and that Usthazanes persisted in
   declaring that he would never be so foolish as to worship the creature
   instead of the creator, he became inflamed with passion, and commanded
   that the eunuch's head should be struck off with a sword. When the
   executioners came forward to perform their office, Usthazanes requested
   them to wait a little, that he might communicate something to the king.
   He then called one of the most faithful eunuchs, and bade him say to
   Sapor, "From my youth until now I have been well affected, O king, to
   your house, and have ministered with fitting diligence to your father
   and yourself. I need no witnesses to corroborate my statements; these
   facts are well established. For all the matters wherein at divers times
   I have gladly served you, grant me this reward; let it not be imagined
   by those who are ignorant of the circumstances, that I have incurred
   this punishment by acts of unfaithfulness against the kingdom, or by
   the commission of any other crime; but let it be published and
   proclaimed abroad by a herald, that Usthazanes loses his head for no
   knavery that he has ever committed in the palaces, but for being a
   Christian, and for refusing to obey the king in denying his own God."
   The eunuch delivered this message, and Sapor, according to the request
   of Usthazanes, commanded a herald to make the desired proclamation; for
   the king imagined that others would be easily deterred from embracing
   Christianity, by reflecting that he who sacrificed his aged
   foster-father and esteemed household servant, would assuredly spare no
   other Christian. Usthazanes, however, believed that as by his timidity
   in consenting to worship the sun, he had caused many Christians to
   fear, so now, by the diligent proclamation of the cause of his
   sufferings, many might be edified by learning that he died for the sake
   of religion, and so became imitators of his fortitude.

   Chapter X.--Christians slain by Sapor in Persia.

   In this manner the honorable life of Usthazanes was terminated, and
   when the intelligence was brought to Symeon in the prison, he offered
   thanksgiving to God on his account. The following day, which happened
   to be the sixth day of the week, and likewise the day on which, as
   immediately preceding the festival of the resurrection, the annual
   memorial of the passion of the Saviour is celebrated, the king issued
   orders for the decapitation of Symeon; for he had again been conducted
   to the palace from the prison, had reasoned most nobly with Sapor on
   points of doctrine, and had expressed a determination never to worship
   either the king or the sun. On the same day a hundred other prisoners
   were ordered to be slain. Symeon beheld their execution, and last of
   all he was put to death. Amongst these victims were bishops,
   presbyters, and other clergy of different grades. As they were being
   led out to execution, the chief of the Magi approached them, and asked
   them whether they would preserve their lives by conforming to the
   religion of the king and by worshiping the sun. As none of them would
   comply with this condition, they were conducted to the place of
   execution, and the executioners applied themselves to the task of
   slaying these martyrs. Symeon, standing by those who were to be slain,
   exhorted them to constancy, and reasoned concerning death, and the
   resurrection, and piety, and showed them from the sacred Scriptures
   that a death like theirs is true life; whereas to live, and through
   fear to deny God, is as truly death. He told them, too, that even if no
   one were to slay them, death would inevitably overtake them; for our
   death is a natural consequence of our birth. The things after those of
   this life are perpetual, and do not happen alike to all men; but as if
   measured by some rule, they must give an accurate account of the course
   of life here. Each one who did well, will receive immortal rewards and
   will escape the punishments of those who did the opposite. He likewise
   told them that the greatest and happiest of all good actions is to die
   for the cause of God. While Symeon was pursuing such themes, and like a
   household attendant, was exhorting them about the manner in which they
   were to go into the conflicts, each one listened and spiritedly went to
   the slaughter. After the executioner had despatched a hundred, Symeon
   himself was slain; and Abedechalaas and Anannias, two aged presbyters
   of his own church, who had been his fellow-prisoners, suffered with
   him. [1160]

   Chapter XI.--Pusices, Superintendent of the Artisans of Sapor.

   Pusices, the superintendent of the king's artisans, was present at the
   execution; perceiving that Anannias trembled as the necessary
   preparations for his death were being made, he said to him, "O old man,
   close your eyes for a little while and be of good courage, for you will
   soon behold the light of Christ." No sooner had he uttered these words
   than he was arrested and conducted before the king; and as he frankly
   avowed himself a Christian, and spoke with great freedom to the king
   concerning his opinion and the martyrs, he was condemned to an
   extraordinary and most cruel death, because it was not lawful to
   address the king with such boldness. The executioners pierced the
   muscles of his neck in such a manner as to extract his tongue. On the
   charge of some persons, his daughter, who had devoted herself to a life
   of holy virginity, was arraigned and executed at the same time. The
   following year, on the day on which the passion of Christ was
   commemorated, and when preparations were being made for the celebration
   of the festival commemorative of his resurrection from the dead, Sapor
   issued a most cruel edict throughout Persia, condemning to death all
   those who should confess themselves to be Christians. It is said that a
   greater number of Christians suffered by the sword; for the Magi sought
   diligently in the cities and villages for those who had concealed
   themselves; and many voluntarily surrendered themselves, lest they
   should appear, by their silence, to deny Christ. Of the Christians who
   were thus unsparingly sacrificed, many who were attached to the palace
   were slain, and amongst these was Azades, [1161] a eunuch, who was
   especially beloved by the king. On hearing of his death, Sapor was
   overwhelmed with grief, and put a stop to the general slaughter of the
   Christians; and he directed that the teachers of religion should alone
   be slain.

   [1161] Assemanus, Bibl. Orient. t. i. 189, speaks of Azades as the
   eunuch of Artascirus, ruler of Adiabene, who was a cousin of Sapor.

   Chapter XII.--Tarbula, the Sister of Symeon, and her Martyrdom.

   About the same period, the queen was attacked with a disease, and
   Tarbula, the sister of Symeon the bishop, a holy virgin, was arrested
   with her servant, who shared in the same mode of life, as likewise a
   sister of Tarbula, who, after the death of her husband, abjured
   marriage, and led a similar career. The cause of their arrest was the
   charge of the Jews, who reported that they had injured the queen by
   their enchantments, on account of their rage at the death of Symeon. As
   invalids easily give credit to the most repulsive representations, the
   queen believed the charge, and especially because it emanated from the
   Jews, since she had embraced their sentiments, and lived in the
   observance of the Jewish rites, for she had great confidence in their
   veracity and in their attachment to herself. The Magi having seized
   Tarbula and her companions, condemned them to death; and after having
   sawn them asunder, they fastened them up to poles and made the queen
   pass through the midst of the poles as a medium for turning away the
   disease. It is said that this Tarbula was beautiful and very stately in
   form, and that one of the Magi, having become deeply enamored with her,
   secretly sent a proposal for intercourse, and promised as a reward to
   save her and her companions if she would consent. But she would give no
   ear to his licentiousness, and treated the Magi with scorn, and rebuked
   his lust. She would rather prefer courageously to die than to betray
   her virginity.

   As it was ordained by the edict of Sapor, which we mentioned above,
   that the Christians should not be slaughtered indiscriminately, but
   that the priests and teachers of the opinions should be slain, the Magi
   and Arch-Magi traversed the whole country of Persia, studiously
   maltreating the bishops and presbyters. They sought them especially in
   the country of Adiabene, a part of the Persian dominions, because it
   was wholly Christianized.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XIII.--Martyrdom of St. Acepsimas and of his Companions.

   About this period they arrested Acepsimas the bishop, and many of his
   clergy. After having taken counsel together, they satisfied themselves
   with the hunt after the leader only; they dismissed the rest after they
   had taken away their property. James, however, who was one of the
   presbyters, voluntarily followed Acepsimas, obtained permission from
   the Magi to share his prison, and spiritedly ministered to the old man,
   lightened his misfortunes as far as he was able, and dressed his
   wounds; for not long after his apprehension, the Magi had injuriously
   tortured him with raw thongs in forcing him to worship the sun; and on
   his refusal to do so had retained him again in bonds. Two presbyters
   named Aithalas and James, and two deacons, by name Azadanes and
   Abdiesus, after being scourged most injuriously by the Magi, were
   compelled to live in prison, on account of their opinions. After a long
   time had elapsed, the great Arch-Magi communicated to the king the
   facts about them to be punished; and having received permission to deal
   with them as he pleased, unless they would consent to worship the sun,
   he made known this decision of Sapor's to the prisoners. They replied
   openly, that they would never betray the cause of Christ nor worship
   the sun; he tortured them unsparingly. Acepsimas persevered in the
   manly confession of his faith, till death put an end to his torments.
   Certain Armenians, whom the Persians retained as hostages, secretly
   carried away his body and buried it. The other prisoners, although not
   less scourged, lived as by a miracle, and as they would not change
   their judgment, were again put in bonds. Among these was Aithalas, who
   was stretched out while thus beaten, and his arms were torn out of his
   shoulders by the very great wrench; and he carried his hands about as
   dead and swinging loosely, so that others had to convey food to his
   mouth. Under this rule, an innumerable multitude of presbyters,
   deacons, monks, holy virgins, and others who served the churches and
   were set apart for its dogma, terminated their lives by martyrdom. The
   following are the names of the bishops, so far as I have been able to
   ascertain: Barbasymes, Paulus, Gaddiabes, Sabinus, Mareas, Mocius,
   John, Hormisdas, Papas, James, Romas, Maares, Agas, Bochres, Abdas,
   Abdiesus, John, Abramins, Agdelas, Sapores, Isaac, and Dausas. The
   latter had been made prisoner by the Persians, and brought from a place
   named Zabdæus. [1162] He died about this time in defense of the dogma;
   and Mareabdes, a chorepiscopus, and about two hundred and fifty of his
   clergy, who had also been captured by the Persians, suffered with him.

   Chapter XIV.--The Martyrdom of Bishop Milles and his Conduct. Sixteen
   Thousand Distinguished Men in Persia suffer Martyrdom under Sapor,
   besides Obscure Individuals.

   About this period Milles suffered martyrdom. He originally served the
   Persians in a military capacity, but afterwards abandoned that
   vocation, in order to embrace the apostolical mode of life. It is
   related that he was ordained bishop over a Persian city, and he
   underwent a variety of sufferings, and endured wounds and drawings; and
   that, failing in his efforts to convert the inhabitants to
   Christianity, he uttered imprecations against the city, and departed.
   Not long after, some of the principal citizens offended the king, and
   an army with three hundred elephants was sent against them; the city
   was utterly demolished and its land was ploughed and sown. Milles,
   taking with him only his wallet, in which was the holy Book of the
   Gospels, repaired to Jerusalem in prayer; thence he proceeded to Egypt
   in order to see the monks. The extraordinary and admirable works which
   we have heard that he accomplished, are attested by the Syrians, who
   have written an account of his actions and life. For my own part, I
   think that I have said enough of him and of the other martyrs who
   suffered in Persia during the reign of Sapor; for it would be difficult
   to relate in detail every circumstance respecting them, such as their
   names, their country, the mode of completing their martyrdom, and the
   species of torture to which they were subjected; for they are
   innumerable, since such methods are jealously affected by the Persians,
   even to the extreme of cruelty. I shall briefly state that the number
   of men and women whose names have been ascertained, and who were
   martyred at this period, have been computed to be sixteen thousand;
   while the multitude outside of these is beyond enumeration, and on this
   account to reckon off their names appeared difficult to the Persians
   and Syrians and to the inhabitants of Edessa, who have devoted much
   care to this matter.

   Chapter XV.--Constantine writes to Sapor to stay the Persecution of the
   Christians.

   Constantine the Roman emperor was angry, and bore it ill when he heard
   of the sufferings to which the Christians were exposed in Persia. He
   desired most anxiously to render them assistance, yet knew not in what
   way to effect this object. About this time some ambassadors from the
   Persian king arrived at his court, and after granting their requests
   and dismissing them, he thought it would be a favorable opportunity to
   address Sapor in behalf of the Christians in Persia, and wrote to him,
   [1163] confessing that it would be a very great and forever
   indescribable favor, if he would be humane to those who admired the
   teaching of the Christians under him. "There is nothing in their
   religion," said he, "of a reprehensible nature; by bloodless prayers
   alone do they offer supplication to God, for he delighteth not in the
   outpouring of blood, but taketh pleasure only in a pure soul devoted to
   virtue and to religion; so that they who believe these things are
   worthy of commendation." The emperor then assured Sapor that God would
   be propitious to him if he treated the Christians with lenity, and
   adduced the example of Valerian and of himself in proof thereof. He had
   himself, by faith in Christ, and by the aid of Divine inclination, come
   forth from the shores of the Western ocean, and reduced to obedience
   the whole of the Roman world, and had terminated many wars against
   foreigners and usurpers; and yet had never had recourse to sacrifices
   or divinations, but had for victory used only the symbol of the Cross
   at the head of his own armies, and prayer pure from blood and
   defilement. The reign of Valerian was prosperous so long as he
   refrained from persecuting the Church; but he afterwards commenced a
   persecution against the Christians, and was delivered by Divine
   vengeance into the hands of the Persians, who took him prisoner and put
   him to a cruel death."

   It was in this strain that Constantine wrote to Sapor, urging him to be
   well-disposed to this religion; for the emperor extended his watchful
   care over all the Christians of every region, whether Roman or foreign.

   Christians. As usual, Soz. quotes briefly, and with no regard to the

   Chapter XVI.--Eusebius and Theognis who at the Council of Nice had
   assented to the Writings of Arius restored to their own Sees.

   Not long after the council of Nice, Arius was recalled from exile; but
   the prohibition to enter Alexandria was unrevoked. It shall be related
   in the proper place how he strove to obtain permission to return to
   Egypt. Not long after, Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, and Theognis,
   bishop of Nicæa, regained possession of their churches after expelling
   Amphion and Chrestos who had been ordained in their stead. [1164] They
   owed their restoration to a document which they had presented to the
   bishops, containing a retractation: "Although we have been condemned
   without a trial by your piety, we deemed it right to remain silent
   concerning the judgment passed by your piety. But as it would be absurd
   to remain longer silent, when silence is regarded as a proof of the
   truth of the calumniators, we now declare to you that we too agree in
   this faith, and after a diligent examination of the thought in the word
   consubstantial,' we are wholly intent upon preserving peace, and that
   we never pursued any heresy. Having proposed for the safety of the
   churches such argument [1165] as occurred to us, and having been fully
   convinced, and fully convincing those who ought to have been persuaded
   by us, we undersigned the creed; but we did not subscribe to the
   anathema, not because we impugned the creed, but because we did not
   believe the accused to be what he was represented to us; the letters we
   had received from him, and the arguments he had delivered in our
   presence, fully satisfying us that he was not such an one. Would that
   the holy Synod were convinced that we are not bent on opposing, but are
   accordant with the points accurately defined by you, and by this
   document, we do attest our assent thereto: and this is not because we
   are wearied of exile, but because we wish to avert all suspicion of
   heresy; for if you will condescend to admit us now into your presence,
   you will find us in all points of the same sentiments as yourselves,
   and obedient to your decisions, and then it shall seem good to your
   piety to be merciful to him who was accused on these points and to have
   him recalled. If the party amenable to justice has been recalled and
   has defended himself from the charge made, it would be absurd, were we
   by our silence to confirm the reports that calumny had spread against
   us. We beseech you then, as befits your piety, dear to Christ, that you
   memorialize our emperor, most beloved of God, and that you hand over
   our petition, and that you counsel quickly, what is agreeable to you
   concerning us." It was by these means that Eusebius and Theognis, after
   their change of sentiment, were reinstated in their churches.

   [1165] The facts (as we learn from the Epistle of Eusebius of Cæsarea,
   which is given by Soc. i. 8, and Theodoret, H. E. i. 12) are as
   follows: The bishops, who demurred to the term homoousion, as defined
   in the Nicene symbol, proposed another alleged older Antiochan form to
   the Synod. But the Nicene Fathers rejected it, and refused to depart
   from their own definition. Eusebius Pamphilus and his party then signed
   the Catholic and Orthodox creed, for fear of the emperor and other
   motives.

   Chapter XVII.--On the Death of Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, at his
   Suggestion, Athanasius receives the Throne; and an Account of his
   Youth; how he was a Self-Taught Priest, and beloved by Antony the
   Great.

   About this period [1166] Alexander, bishop of Alexandria, when about to
   depart this life, left Athanasius as his successor, in accordance, I am
   convinced, with the Divine will directing the vote upon him. It is said
   that Athanasius at first sought to avoid the honor by flight, but that
   he, although unwilling, was afterwards constrained by Alexander to
   accept the bishopric. This is testified by Apolinarius, the Syrian,
   [1167] in the following terms: "In all these matters much disturbance
   was excited by impiety, but its first effects were felt by the blessed
   teacher of this man, who was at hand as an assistant, and behaved as a
   son would to his father. Afterwards this holy man himself underwent the
   same experience, for when appointed to the episcopal succession he fled
   to escape the honor; but he was discovered in his place of concealment
   by the help of God, who had forecast by Divine manifestations to his
   blessed predecessor, that the succession was to devolve upon him. For
   when Alexander was on the point of death, he called upon Athanasius,
   who was then absent. One who bore the same name, and who happened to be
   present, on hearing him call this way, answered him; but to him
   Alexander was silent, since he was not summoning this man. Again he
   called, and as it often happens, the one present kept still, and so the
   absent one was disclosed. Moreover, the blessed Alexander prophetically
   exclaimed, O Athanasius, thou thinkest to escape, but thou wilt not
   escape'; meaning that Athanasius would be called to the conflict." Such
   is the account given by Apolinarius respecting Athanasius.

   The Arians assert that after the death of Alexander, the respective
   followers of that bishop and of Melitius held communion together, and
   fifty-four bishops from Thebes, and other parts of Egypt, assembled
   together, and agreed by oath to choose by a common vote, the man who
   could advantageously administer the Church of Alexandria; but that
   seven [1168] of the bishops, in violation of their oath, and contrary
   to the opinion of all, secretly ordained Athanasius; and that on this
   account many of the people and of the Egyptian clergy seceded from
   communion with him. For my part, I am convinced that it was by Divine
   appointment that Athanasius succeeded to the high-priesthood; for he
   was eloquent and intelligent, and capable of opposing plots, and of
   such a man the times had the greatest need. He displayed great aptitude
   in the exercise of the ecclesiastical functions and fitness for the
   priesthood, and was, so to speak, from his earliest years, self-taught.
   It is said that the following incident occurred to him in his youth.
   [1169] It was the custom of the Alexandrians to celebrate with great
   pomp an annual festival in honor of one of their bishops named Peter,
   who had suffered martyrdom. Alexander, who then conducted the church,
   engaged in the celebration of this festival, and after having completed
   the worship, he remained on the spot, awaiting the arrival of some
   guests whom he expected to breakfast. In the meantime he chanced to
   cast his eyes towards the sea, and perceived some children playing on
   the shore, and amusing themselves by imitating the bishop and the
   ceremonies of the Church. At first he considered the mimicry as
   innocent, and took pleasure in witnessing it; but when they touched
   upon the unutterable, he was troubled, and communicated the matter to
   the chief of the clergy. The children were called together and
   questioned as to the game at which they were playing, and as to what
   they did and said when engaged in this amusement. At first they through
   fear denied; but when Alexander threatened them with torture, they
   confessed that Athanasius was their bishop and leader, and that many
   children who had not been initiated had been baptized by him. Alexander
   carefully inquired what the priest of their play was in the habit of
   saying or doing, and what they answered or were taught. On finding that
   the exact routine of the Church had been accurately observed by them,
   he consulted the priests around him on the subject, and decided that it
   would he unnecessary to rebaptize those who, in their simplicity, had
   been judged worthy of the Divine grace. He therefore merely performed
   for them such offices as it is lawful only for those who are
   consecrated to initiating the mysteries. He then took Athanasius and
   the other children, who had playfully acted as presbyters and deacons,
   to their own relations under God as a witness that they might be
   brought up for the Church, and for leadership in what they had
   imitated. Not long after, he took Athanasius as his table companion and
   secretary. He had been well educated, was versed in grammar and
   rhetoric, and already when he came to man's estate, and before he
   attained the bishopric, he gave proof to those conversing with him of
   his being a man of wisdom and intellectuality. But when, [1170] on the
   death of Alexander, the succession devolved upon him, his reputation
   was greatly increased, and was sustained by his own private virtues and
   by the testimony of the monk, Antony the Great. This monk repaired to
   him when he requested his presence, visited the cities, accompanied him
   to the churches, and agreed with him in opinion concerning the Godhead.
   He evinced unlimited friendship towards him, and avoided the society of
   his enemies and opponents.

   Chapter XVIII.--The Arians and Melitians confer Celebrity on
   Athanasius; concerning Eusebius, and his Request of Athanasius to admit
   Arius to Communion; concerning the Term "Consubstantial"; Eusebius
   Pamphilus and Eustathius, Bishop of Antioch, create Tumults above all
   the rest.

   The reputation of Athanasius was, however, especially increased by the
   Arians and Melitians; [1171] although always plotting, they never
   appeared rightly to catch and make him a prisoner. In the first place,
   Eusebius wrote to urge him to receive the Arians into communion, and
   threatened, without writing it, to ill-treat him should he refuse to do
   so. But as Athanasius would not yield to his representation, but
   maintained that those who had devised a heresy in innovating upon the
   truth, and who had been condemned by the council of Nice, ought not to
   be received into the Church, Eusebius contrived to interest the emperor
   in favor of Arius, and so procured his return. I shall state a little
   further on how all these events came to pass. [1172]

   At this period, the bishops had another tumultuous dispute among
   themselves, concerning the precise meaning of the term
   "consubstantial." [1173] Some thought that this term could not be
   admitted without blasphemy; that it implied the non-existence of the
   Son of God; and that it involved the error of Montanus and Sabellius.
   Those, on the other hand, who defended the term, regarded their
   opponents as Greeks (or pagans), and considered that their sentiments
   led to polytheism. Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, and Eustathius, bishop
   of Antioch, took the lead in this dispute. They both confessed the Son
   of God to exist hypostatically, and yet they contended together as if
   they had misunderstood each other. Eustathius accused Eusebius of
   altering the doctrines ratified by the council of Nicæa, while the
   latter declared that he approved of all the Nicæan doctrines, and
   reproached Eustathius for cleaving to the heresy of Sabellius.

   Chapter XIX.--Synod of Antioch; Unjust Deposition of Eustathius;
   Euphronius receives the Throne; Constantine the Great writes to the
   Synod and to Eusebius Pamphilus, who refuses the Bishopric of Antioch.

   A synod having been convened at Antioch, Eustathius was deprived of the
   church of that city. [1174] It was most generally believed that he was
   deposed merely on account of his adherence to the faith of the council
   of Nicæa, and on account of his having accused Eusebius, Paulinus,
   bishop of Tyre, and Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis (whose
   sentiments were adopted by the Eastern priests), of favoring the heresy
   of Arius. The pretext resorted to for his deposition, however, was,
   that he had defiled the priesthood by unholy deeds. His deposition
   excited so great a sedition at Antioch, that the people were on the
   point of taking up arms, and the whole city was in a state of
   commotion. This greatly injured him in the opinion of the emperor; for
   when he understood what had happened, and that the people of that
   church were divided into two parties, he was much enraged, and regarded
   him with suspicion as the author of the tumult. The emperor, however,
   sent an illustrious officer of his palace, invested with full
   authority, to calm the populace, and put an end to the disturbance,
   without having recourse to violence or injury.

   Those who had deposed Eustathius, and who on this account were
   assembled in Antioch, imagining that their sentiments would be
   universally received, if they could succeed in placing over the Church
   of Antioch one of their own opinion, who was known to the emperor, and
   held in repute for learning and eloquence, and that they could obtain
   the obedience of the rest, fixed their thoughts upon Eusebius Pamphilus
   for that see. They wrote to the emperor upon this subject, and stated
   that this course would be highly acceptable to the people. He had, in
   fact, been sought by all the clergy and laity who were inimical to
   Eustathius. Eusebius, however, wrote to the emperor refusing the
   dignity. The emperor approved of his refusal with praise; for there was
   an ecclesiastical law prohibiting the removal of a bishop from one
   bishopric to another. He wrote to the people and to Eusebius, adopting
   his judgment and calling him happy, because he was worthy to hold the
   bishopric not only of one single city, but of the world. The emperor
   also wrote to the people of the Church of Antioch concerning
   like-mindedness, and told them that they ought not to desire the
   bishops of other regions, even as they ought not to covet the
   possessions of others. In addition to these, he despatched another
   epistle to the Synod, in private session, and similarly commended
   Eusebius as in the letter to him for having refused the bishopric; and
   being convinced that Euphronius, a presbyter of Cappadocia, and George
   of Arethusa were men approved in creed, he commanded the bishops to
   decide for one or other of them, or for whomsoever might appear worthy
   of the honor, and to ordain a president for the Church of Antioch. On
   the receipt of these letters from the emperor, Euphronius was ordained;
   and I have heard that Eustathius bore this unjust calumny calmly,
   judging it to be better, as he was a man who, besides his virtues and
   excellent qualities, was justly admired on account of his fine
   eloquence, as is evidenced by his transmitted works, which are highly
   approved for their choice of words, flavor of expression, temperateness
   of sentiments, elegance and grace of narration.

   Chapter XX.--Concerning Maximus, who succeeded Macarius in the See of
   Jerusalem.

   About this time Mark, [1175] who had succeeded Silvester, and who had
   held the episcopal sway during a short period, died, and Julius was
   raised to the see of Rome. Maximus succeeded Macarius in the bishopric
   of Jerusalem. [1176] It is said that Macarius had ordained him bishop
   over the church of Diospolis, but that the members of the church of
   Jerusalem insisted upon his remaining among them. For since he was a
   confessor, and otherwise excellent, he was secretly chosen beforehand
   in the approbation of the people for their bishopric, after that
   Macarius should die. The dread of offending the people and exciting an
   insurrection led to the election of another bishop over Diospolis, and
   Maximus remained in Jerusalem, and exercised the priestly functions
   conjointly with Macarius; and after the death of this latter, he
   governed that church. It is, however, well known to those who are
   accurately acquainted with these circumstances, that Macarius concurred
   with the people in their desire to retain Maximus; for it is said that
   he regretted the ordination of Maximus, and thought that he ought
   necessarily to have been reserved for his own succession on account of
   his holding right views concerning God and his confession, which had so
   endeared him to the people. He likewise feared that, at his death, the
   adherents of Eusebius and Patrophilus, who had embraced Arianism, would
   take that opportunity to place one of their own views in his see; for
   even while Macarius was living, they had attempted to introduce some
   innovations, but since they were to be separated from him, they on this
   account kept quiet.

   Chapter XXI.--The Melitians and the Arians agree in Sentiment; Eusebius
   and Theognis endeavor to inflame anew the Disease of Arius.

   In the meantime the contention which had been stirred in the beginning
   among the Egyptians, could not be quelled. [1177] The Arian heresy had
   been positively condemned by the council of Nice, while the followers
   of Melitius had been admitted into communion under the stipulations
   above stated. When Alexander returned to Egypt, Melitius delivered up
   to him the churches whose government he had unlawfully usurped, and
   returned to Lycus. Not long after, finding his end approaching, he
   nominated John, one of his most intimate friends, as his successor,
   contrary to the decree of the Nicæan Council, and thus fresh cause of
   discord in the churches was produced. When the Arians perceived that
   the Melitians were introducing innovations, they also harassed the
   churches. For, as frequently occurs in similar disturbances, some
   applauded the opinion of Arius, while others contended that those who
   had been ordained by Melitius ought to govern the churches. These two
   bodies of sectarians had hitherto been opposed to each other, but on
   perceiving that the priests of the Catholic Church were followed by the
   multitude, they became jealous and formed an alliance together, and
   manifested a common enmity to the clergy of Alexandria. Their measures
   of attack and defense were so long carried on in concert, that in
   process of time the Melitians were generally called Arians in Egypt,
   although they only dissent on questions of the presidency of the
   churches, while the Arians hold the same opinions concerning God as
   Arius. Although they individually denied one another's tenets, yet they
   dissimulated in contradiction of their own view, in order to attain an
   underhanded agreement in the fellowship of their enmity; at the same
   time each one expected to prevail easily in what he desired. From this
   period, however, the Melitians after the discussion on those topics,
   received the Arian doctrines, and held the same opinion as Arius
   concerning God. This revived the original controversy concerning Arius,
   and some of the laity and clergy seceded from communion with the
   others. The dispute concerning the doctrines of Arius was rekindled
   once more in other cities, and particularly in Bithynia and
   Hellespontus, and in the city of Constantinople. In short, it is said
   that Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, and Theognis, bishop of Nicæa,
   bribed the notary to whom the emperor had intrusted the custody of the
   documents of the Nicæan Council, effaced their signatures, and
   attempted openly to teach that the Son is not to be considered
   consubstantial with the Father. Eusebius was accused of these
   irregularities before the emperor, and he replied with great boldness
   as he showed part of his clothing. "If this robe," said he, "had been
   cut asunder in my presence, I could not affirm the fragments to be all
   of the same substance." The emperor was much grieved at these disputes,
   for he had believed that questions of this nature had been finally
   decided by the council of Nicæa, but contrary to his hopes he saw them
   again agitated. He more especially regretted that Eusebius and Theognis
   had received certain Alexandrians into communion, [1178] although the
   Synod had recommended them to repent on account of their heterodox
   opinions, and although he had himself condemned them to banishment from
   their native land, as being the exciters of sedition. [1179] It is
   asserted by some, that it was for the above reasons that the emperor in
   anger exiled Eusebius and Theognis; but as I have already stated, I
   have derived my information from those who are intimately acquainted
   with these matters.

   Chapter XXII.--The Vain Machinations of the Arians and Melitians
   against St. Athanasius.

   The various calamities which befell Athanasius were primarily
   occasioned by Eusebius and Theognis. [1180] As they possessed great
   freedom of speech and influence with the emperor, they strove for the
   recall of Arius, with whom they were on terms of concord and
   friendship, to Alexandria, and at the same time the expulsion from the
   Church of him who was opposed to them. They accused him before
   Constantine of being the author of all the seditions and troubles that
   agitated the Church, and of excluding those who were desirous of
   joining the Church; and alleged that unanimity would be restored were
   he alone to be removed. The accusations against him were substantiated
   by many bishops and clergy who were with John, and who sedulously
   obtained access to the emperor; they pretended to great orthodoxy, and
   imputed to Athanasius and the bishops of his party all the bloodshed,
   bonds, unjust blows, wounds, and conflagrations of churches. But when
   Athanasius demonstrated to the emperor the illegality of the ordination
   of John's adherents, their innovations of the decrees of the Nicæan
   Council, and the unsoundness of their faith, and the insults offered to
   those who held right opinions about God, Constantine was at a loss to
   know whom to believe. Since there were such mutual allegations, and
   many accusations were frequently stirred up by each party, and since he
   was earnestly anxious to restore the like-mindedness of the people, he
   wrote to Athanasius that no one should be shut out. If this should be
   betrayed to the last, he would send regardless of consequences, one who
   should expel him from the city of Alexandria. If any one should desire
   to see this letter of the emperor's, he will here find the portion of
   it relating to this affair: "As you are now acquainted with my will,
   which is, that to all who desire to enter the Church you should offer
   an unhindered entrance. For should I hear that any who are willing to
   join the Church, have been debarred or hindered therefrom by you, I
   shall send at once an officer who shall remove you, according to my
   command, and shall transfer you to some other place." Athanasius,
   however, wrote to the emperor and convinced him that the Arians ought
   not to be received into communion by the Catholic Church; and Eusebius
   perceiving that his schemes could never be carried into execution while
   Athanasius strove in opposition, determined to resort to any means in
   order to get rid of him. But as he could not find a sufficient pretext
   for effecting this design, he promised the Melitians to interest the
   emperor and those in power in their favor, if they would bring an
   accusation against Athanasius. Accordingly, came the first indictment
   that he had imposed upon the Egyptians a tax on linen tunics, and that
   such a tribute had been exacted from the accusers. Apis [1181] and
   Macarius, presbyters of the Church of Athanasius, who then happened to
   be at court, clearly proved the persistent accusation to be false. On
   being summoned to answer for the offense, Athanasius was further
   accused of having conspired against the emperor, and of having sent,
   for this purpose, a casket of gold to one Philumen. The emperor
   detected the calumny of his accusers, sent Athanasius home, and wrote
   to the people of Alexandria to testify that their bishop possessed
   great moderation and a correct faith; that he had gladly met him, and
   recognized him to be a man of God; and that, as envy had been the sole
   cause of his indictment, he had appeared to better advantage than his
   accusers; and having heard that the Arian and Melitian sectarians had
   excited dissensions in Egypt, the emperor, in the same epistle,
   exhorted the multitude to look to God, to take heed unto his judgments,
   to be well disposed toward one another, to prosecute with all their
   might those who plotted against their like-mindedness; thus the emperor
   wrote to the people, exhorting them all to like-mindedness, and
   striving to prevent divisions in the Church.

   Chapter XXIII.--Calumny respecting St. Athanasius and the Hand of
   Arsenius.

   The Melitians, on the failure of their first attempt, secretly
   concocted other indictments against Athanasius. [1182] On the one hand
   they charged him with breaking a sacred chalice, and on the other with
   having slain one Arsenius, and with having cut off his arm and retained
   it for magical purposes. It is said that this Arsenius was one of the
   clergy, [1183] but that, having committed some crime, he fled to a
   place of concealment for fear of being convicted and punished by his
   bishop. The enemies of Athanasius devised the most serious attack for
   this occurrence. They sought Arsenius with great diligence, and found
   him; they showed him great kindness, promised to secure for him every
   goodwill and safety, and conducted him secretly to Patrines, [1184] a
   presbyter of a monastery, who was one of their confederates, and of the
   same interest as themselves. After having thus carefully concealed him,
   they diligently spread the report in the market-places and public
   assemblies that he had been slain by Athanasius. They also bribed John,
   a monk, to corroborate the accusation. As this evil report was
   universally circulated, and had even reached the ears of the emperor,
   Athanasius, being apprehensive that it would be difficult to defend his
   cause before judges whose minds were prejudiced by such false rumors,
   resorted to stratagems akin to those of his adversaries. He did
   everything in his power to prevent truth from being obscured by their
   attacks; but the multitude could not be convinced, on account of the
   non-appearance of Arsenius. Reflecting, therefore, that the suspicion
   which rested upon him could not be removed except by proving that
   Arsenius, who was said to be dead, was still alive, he sent a most
   trustworthy deacon in quest of him. The deacon went to Thebes, and
   ascertained from the declaration of some monks where he was living. And
   when he came to Patrines, with whom he had been concealed, he found
   that Arsenius was not there; for on the first intelligence of the
   arrival of the deacon he had been conveyed to Lower Egypt. The deacon
   arrested Patrines, and conducted him to Alexandria, as also Elias, one
   of his associates, who was said to have been the person who conveyed
   Arsenius elsewhere. He delivered them both to the commander of the
   Egyptian forces, and they confessed that Arsenius was still alive, that
   he had been secretly concealed in their house, and that he was now
   living in Egypt. Athanasius took care that all these facts should be
   reported to Constantine. The emperor wrote back to him, desiring him to
   attend to the due performance of the priestly functions, and the
   maintenance of order and piety among the people, and not to be
   disquieted by the machinations of the Melitians, it being evident that
   envy alone was the cause of the false indictments which were circulated
   against him and the disturbance in the churches. The emperor added
   that, for the future, he should not give place to such reports; and
   that, unless the calumniators preserved the peace, he should certainly
   subject them to the rigor of the state laws, and let justice have its
   course, as they had not only unjustly plotted against the innocent, but
   had also shamefully abused the good order and piety of the Church. Such
   was the strain of the emperor's letter to Athanasius; and he further
   commanded that it should be read aloud before the public, in order that
   they might all be made acquainted with his intentions. The Melitians
   were alarmed at these menaces, and became more quiet for a while,
   because they viewed with anxiety the threat of the ruler. The churches
   throughout Egypt enjoyed profound peace, and, directed by the
   presidency of this great priest, it daily increased in numbers by the
   conversion of multitudes of pagans and other heretics.

   Chapter XXIV.--Some Indian Nations received Christianity at that Time
   through the Instrumentality of Two Captives, Frumentius and Edesius.

   We have heard that about this period some of the most distant of the
   nations that we call Indians, to whom the preaching of Bartholomew was
   unknown, shared in our doctrine, through Frumentius, [1185] who became
   a priest and teacher of the sacred learning among them. But in order
   that we may know, even by the marvel of what happened in India, that
   the doctrine of the Christians ought to be received as a system not
   from man, as it seems a tissue of miracles to some, it is necessary to
   relate the reason for the ordination of Frumentius. It was as follows:
   The most celebrated philosophers among the Greeks explored unknown
   cities and regions. Plato, the friend of Socrates, dwelt for a time
   among the Egyptians, in order to acquaint himself with their manners
   and customs. He likewise sailed to Sicily for the sight of its craters,
   whence, as from a fountain, spontaneously issued streams of fire, which
   frequently overflowing, rushed like a river and consumed the
   neighboring regions, so that even yet many fields appear burnt and
   cannot be sown or planted with trees, just as they narrate about the
   land of Sodom. These craters were likewise explored by Empedocles, a
   man highly celebrated for philosophy among the Greeks, and who has
   expounded his knowledge in heroic verse. He set out to investigate this
   fiery eruption, when either because he thought such a mode of death
   preferable to any other, or because, to speak more truthfully, he
   perhaps knew not wherefore he should seek to terminate his life in this
   manner, he leaped into the fire and perished. Democritus of Coös
   explored many cities and climates and nations, and he says concerning
   himself that eighty years of his life were spent in traveling through
   foreign lands. Besides these philosophers, thousands of wise men among
   the Greeks, ancient and modern, devoted themselves to this travel. In
   emulation, Meropius, a philosopher of Tyre in Phoenicia, journeyed as
   far as India. They say he was accompanied by two youths, named
   Frumentius and Edesius; they were his relatives; he conducted their
   rhetorical training, and educated them liberally. After exploring India
   as much as possible, he set out for home, and embarked in a vessel
   which was on the point of sailing for Egypt. It happened that, from
   want of water or some other necessary, the vessel was obliged to stop
   at some port, and the Indians rushed upon it and murdered all, Meropius
   included. These Indians had just thrown off their alliance with the
   Romans; they took the boys as living captives, because they pitied
   their youth, and conducted them to their king. He appointed the younger
   one his cup-bearer; the older, Frumentius, he put over his house and
   made him administrator of his treasures; for he perceived that he was
   intelligent and very capable in business. These youths served the king
   usefully and faithfully during a long course of years, and when he felt
   his end approaching, his son and wife surviving, he rewarded the
   good-will of the servants with liberty, and permitted them to go where
   they pleased. They were anxious to return to Tyre, where their
   relatives resided; but the king's son being a minor, his mother
   besought them to remain for a little while and take charge of public
   affairs, until her son reached the years of manhood. They yielded to
   her entreaties, and directed the affairs of the kingdom and of the
   government of the Indies. Frumentius, by some Divine impulse, perhaps
   because God moved him spontaneously, inquired whether there were any
   Christians in India, or Romans among the merchants, who had sailed
   thither. Having succeeded in finding the objects of his inquiry, he
   summoned them into his presence, treated them with love and
   friendliness, and convened them for prayer, and the assembly was
   conducted after the Roman usage; and when he had built houses of
   prayer, he encouraged them to honor God continually.

   When the king's son attained the age of manhood, Frumentius and Edesius
   besought him and the queen, and not without difficulty persuaded the
   rulers to be separated from themselves, and having parted as friends,
   they went back as Roman subjects. Edesius went to Tyre to see his
   relatives, and was soon after advanced to the dignity of presbyter.
   Frumentius, however, instead of returning to Phoenicia, repaired to
   Alexandria; for with him patriotism and filial piety were subordinate
   to religious zeal. He conferred with Athanasius, the head of the
   Alexandrian Church, described to him the state of affairs in India, and
   the necessity of appointing a bishop over the Christians located in
   that country. Athanasius assembled the endemic priests, and consulted
   with them on the subject; and he ordained Frumentius bishop of India,
   since he was peculiarly qualified and apt to do much service among
   those among whom he was the first to manifest the name of Christian,
   and the seed of the participation in the doctrine was sown. [1186]
   Frumentius, therefore, returned to India, and, it is said, discharged
   the priestly functions so admirably that he became an object of
   universal admiration, and was revered as no less than an apostle. God
   highly honored him, enabling him to perform many wonderful cures, and
   to work signs and wonders. Such was the origin of the Indian
   priesthood.

   Chapter XXV.--Council of Tyre; Illegal Deposition of St. Athanasius.

   The plots of the enemies of Athanasius involved him in fresh troubles,
   excited the hatred of the emperor against him, and stirred up a
   multitude of accusers. Wearied by their importunity, the emperor
   convened a council at Cæsarea in Palestine. Athanasius was summoned
   thither; but fearing the artifices of Eusebius, bishop of the city, of
   Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, and of their party, he refused to
   attend, and for thirty months, although pressed to attend, persisted in
   his refusal. At the end of that period, however, he was forced more
   urgently and repaired to Tyre, where a great number of the bishops of
   the East were assembled, [1187] who commanded him to undergo the
   charges of those who accused him. Of John's party, Callinicus, a
   bishop, and a certain Ischurias, accused him of breaking a mystical
   chalice and of throwing down an episcopal chair; and of often causing
   Ischurias, although he was a presbyter, to be loaded with chains; and
   by falsely informing Hyginus, governor of Egypt, that he had cast
   stones at the statues of the emperor of occasioning his being thrown
   into prison; of deposing Callinicus, bishop of the Catholic Church at
   Pelusium, and of saying that he would debar him from fellowship unless
   he could remove certain suspicions concerning his having broken a
   mystical chalice; of committing the Church of Pelusium to Mark, a
   deposed presbyter; and of placing Callinicus under a military guard,
   and of putting him under judicial tortures. Euplus, Pachomius, Isaac,
   Achillas, [1188] and Hermæon, bishops of John's party, accused him of
   inflicting blows. They all concurred in maintaining that he obtained
   the episcopal dignity by means of the perjury of certain individuals,
   it having been decreed that no one should receive ordination, who could
   not clear himself of any crime laid to his charge. They further
   alleged, that having been deceived by him, they had separated
   themselves from communion with him, and that, so far from satisfying
   their scruples, he had treated them with violence and thrown them into
   prison.

   Further, the affair of Arsenius was again agitated; and as generally
   happens in such a studiously concocted plot, many even of those
   considered his friends loomed up unexpectedly as accusers. A document
   was then read, containing popular complaints that the people of
   Alexandria could not continue their attendance at church on his
   account. Athanasius, having been urged to justify himself, presented
   himself repeatedly before the tribunal; successfully repelled some of
   the allegations, and requested delay for investigation as to the
   others. He was exceedingly perplexed when he reflected on the favor in
   which his accusers were held by his judges, on the number of witnesses
   belonging to the sects of Arius and Melitius who appeared against him,
   and on the indulgence that was manifested towards the informers, whose
   allegations had been overcome. And especially in the indictment
   concerning Arsenius, whose arm he was charged with having cut off for
   purposes of magic, and in the indictment concerning a certain woman to
   whom he was charged with having given gifts for uncleanness, and with
   having corrupted her by night, although she was unwilling. Both these
   indictments were proved to be ridiculous and full of false espionage.
   When this female made the deposition before the bishops, Timothy, a
   presbyter of Alexandria, who stood by Athanasius, approached her
   according to a plan he had secretly concerted, and said to her, "Did I
   then, O woman, violate your chastity?" [1189] She replied, "But didst
   thou not?" and mentioned the place and the attendant circumstances, in
   which she had been forced. He likewise led Arsenius into the midst of
   them, showed both his hands to the judges, and requested them to make
   the accusers account for the arm which they had exhibited. For it
   happened that Arsenius, either driven by a Divine influence, or, as it
   is said, having been concealed by the plans of Athanasius, when the
   danger to that bishop on his account was announced, escaped by night,
   and arrived at Tyre the day before the trial. But these allegations
   having been thus summarily dismissed, so that no defense was necessary,
   no mention of the first was made in the transactions; most probably, I
   think, because the whole affair was considered too indecorous and
   absurd for insertion. As to the second, the accusers strove to justify
   themselves by saying that a bishop under the jurisdiction of
   Athanasius, named Plusian, [1190] had, at the command of his chief,
   burnt the house of Arsenius, fastened him to a column, and maltreated
   him with thongs, and then chained him in a cell. They further stated
   that Arsenius escaped from the cell through a window, and while he was
   sought for remained a while in concealment; that as he did not appear,
   they naturally supposed him to be dead; that the reputation he had
   acquired as a man and confessor, had endeared him to the bishops of
   John's party; and that they sought for him, and applied on his behalf
   to the magistrates.

   Athanasius was filled with apprehension when he reflected on these
   subjects, and began to suspect that his enemies were secretly scheming
   to effect his ruin. After several sessions, when the Synod was filled
   with tumult and confusion, and the accusers and a multitude of persons
   around the tribunal were crying aloud that Athanasius ought to be
   deposed as a sorcerer and a ruffian, and as being utterly unworthy the
   priesthood, the officers, who had been appointed by the emperor to be
   present at the Synod for the maintenance of order, compelled the
   accused to quit the judgment hall secretly; for they feared lest they
   might become his murderers, as is apt to be the case in the rush of a
   tumult. On finding that he could not remain in Tyre without peril of
   his life, and that there was no hope of obtaining justice against his
   numerous accusers, from judges who were inimical to him, he fled to
   Constantinople. The Synod condemned him during his absence, deposed him
   from the bishopric, and prohibited his residing at Alexandria, lest,
   said they, he should excite disturbances and seditions. John and all
   his adherents were restored to communion, as if they had been unjustly
   suffering wrongs, and each was reinstated in his own clerical rank. The
   bishops then gave an account of their proceedings to the emperor, and
   wrote to the bishops of all regions, enjoining them not to receive
   Athanasius into fellowship, and not to write to him or receive letters
   from him, as one who had been convicted of the crimes which they had
   investigated, and on account of his flight, as also guilty in those
   indictments which had not been tried. They likewise declared, in this
   epistle, that they had been obliged to pass such condemnation upon him,
   because, when commanded by the emperor the preceding year to repair to
   the bishops of the East, who were assembled at Cæsarea, he disobeyed
   the injunction, kept the bishops waiting for him, and set at naught the
   commands of the ruler. They also deposed that when the bishops had
   assembled at Tyre, he went to that city, attended by a large retinue,
   for the purpose of exciting disturbances and tumults in the Synod; that
   when there, he sometimes refused to reply to the charges preferred
   against him; sometimes insulted the bishops individually; when summoned
   by them, sometimes not obeying, at others not deigning to be judged.
   They specified in the same letter, that he was manifestly guilty of
   having broken a mystical chalice, and that this fact was attested by
   Theognis, bishop of Nicæa; by Maris, bishop of Chalcedonia; by
   Theodore, bishop of Heraclea; by Valentinus and Ursacius; and by
   Macedonius, who had been sent to the village in Egypt, where the
   chalice was said to have been broken, in order to ascertain the truth.
   Thus did the bishops detail successively each of the allegations
   against Athanasius, with the same art to which sophists resort when
   they desire to heighten the effect of their calumnies. Many of the
   priests, however, who were present at the trial, perceived the
   injustice of the accusation. It is related that Paphnutius, the
   confessor, [1191] who was present at the Synod, arose, and took the
   hand of Maximus, the bishop of Jerusalem, to lead him away, as if those
   who were confessors, and had their eyes dug out for the sake of piety,
   ought not to participate in an assembly of wicked men.

   Chapter XXVI.--Erection of a Temple by Constantine the Great at
   Golgotha, in Jerusalem; its Dedication.

   The temple, [1192] called the "Great Martyrium," which was built in the
   place of the skull at Jerusalem, was completed about the thirtieth year
   [1193] of the reign of Constantine; and Marianus, an official, who was
   a short-hand writer of the emperor, came to Tyre and delivered a letter
   from the emperor to the council, commanding them to repair quickly to
   Jerusalem, in order to consecrate the temple. Although this had been
   previously determined upon, yet the emperor deemed it necessary that
   the disputes which prevailed among the bishops who had been convened at
   Tyre should be first adjusted, and that they should be purged of all
   discord and grief before going to the consecration of the temple. For
   it is fitting to such a festival for the priests to be like-minded.
   When the bishops arrived at Jerusalem, the temple was therefore
   consecrated, as likewise numerous ornaments and gifts, which were sent
   by the emperor and are still preserved in the sacred edifice; their
   costliness and magnificence is such that they cannot be looked upon
   without exciting wonder. Since that period the anniversary of the
   consecration has been celebrated with great pomp by the church of
   Jerusalem; [1194] the festival continues eight days, initiation by
   baptism is administered, and people from every region under the sun
   resort to Jerusalem during this festival, and visit the sacred places.

   Chapter XXVII.--Concerning the Presbyter by whom Constantine was
   persuaded to recall Arius and Euzoïus from Exile; the Tractate
   concerning his Possibly Pious Faith, and how Arius was again received
   by the Synod assembled at Jerusalem.

   The bishops who had embraced the sentiments of Arius found a favorable
   opportunity of restoring him and Euzoïus to communion, by zealously
   striving to have a council in the city of Jerusalem. They effected
   their design in the following manner [1195] :--

   A certain presbyter who was a great admirer of the Arian doctrines, was
   on terms of intimacy with the emperor's sister. At first he concealed
   his sentiments; but as he frequently visited and became by degrees more
   familiar with Constantia, for such was the name of the sister of
   Constantine, he took courage to represent to her that Arius was
   unjustly exiled from his country, and cast out from the Church, through
   the jealousy and personal enmity of Alexander bishop of the Alexandrian
   Church. He said that his jealousy had been excited by the esteem which
   the people manifested towards Arius.

   Constantia believed these representations to be true, yet took no steps
   in her lifetime to innovate upon the decrees of Nicæa. Being attacked
   with a disease which threatened to terminate in death, she besought her
   brother, who went to visit her, to grant what she was about to ask, as
   a last favor; this request was, to receive the above mentioned
   presbyter on terms of intimacy, and to rely upon him as a man who had
   correct opinions about the Divinity. "For my part," she added, "I am
   drawing nigh to death, and am no longer interested in the concerns of
   this life; the only apprehension I now feel, arises from dread lest you
   should incur the wrath of God and suffer any calamity, or the loss of
   your empire, since you have been induced to condemn just and good men
   wrongfully to perpetual banishment." From that period the emperor
   received the presbyter into favor, and after permitting him to speak
   freely with him and to commune on the same topics concerning which his
   sister had given her command, deemed necessary to subject the case of
   Arius to a fresh examination; it is probable that, in forming this
   decision, the emperor was either influenced by a belief in the
   credibility of the attacks, or by the desire of gratifying his sister.
   It was not long before he recalled Arius from exile, [1196] and
   demanded of him a written exposition of his faith concerning the
   Godhead. Arius avoided making use of the new terms which he had
   previously devised, and constructed another exposition by using simple
   terms, and such as were recognized by the sacred Scriptures; he
   declared upon oath, that he held the doctrines set forth in this
   exposition, that he both felt these statements ex animo and had no
   other thought than these. It was as follows: [1197] "Arius and Euzoïus,
   presbyters, to Constantine, our most pious emperor and most beloved of
   God.

   "According as your piety, beloved of God, commanded, O sovereign
   emperor, we here furnish a written statement of our own faith, and we
   protest before God that we, and all those who are with us, believe what
   is here set forth.

   "We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, and in His Son the Lord
   Jesus Christ, who was begotten from Him before all ages, God the Word,
   by whom all things were made, whether things in heaven or things on
   earth; He came and took upon Him flesh, suffered and rose again, and
   ascended into heaven, whence He will again come to judge the quick and
   the dead.

   "We believe in the Holy Ghost, in the resurrection of the body, in the
   life to come, in the kingdom of heaven, and in one Catholic Church of
   God, established throughout the earth. We have received this faith from
   the Holy Gospels, in which the Lord says to His disciples, Go forth and
   teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
   Son, and of the Holy Ghost.' If we do not so believe this, and if we do
   not truly receive the doctrines concerning the Father, the Son, and the
   Holy Ghost, as they are taught by the whole Catholic Church and by the
   sacred Scriptures, as we believe in every point, let God be our judge,
   both now and in the day which is to come. Wherefore we appeal to your
   piety, O our emperor most beloved of God, that, as we are enrolled
   among the members of the clergy, and as we hold the faith and thought
   of the Church and of the sacred Scriptures, we may be openly reconciled
   to our mother, the Church, through your peacemaking and pious piety; so
   that useless questions and disputes may be cast aside, and that we and
   the Church may dwell together in peace, and we all in common may offer
   the customary prayer for your peaceful and pious empire and for your
   entire family."

   Many considered this declaration of faith as an artful compilation, and
   as bearing the appearance of difference in expression, while, in
   reality, it supported the doctrine of Arius; the terms in which it was
   couched being so vague that it was susceptible of diverse
   interpretations. The emperor imagined that Arius and Euzoïus were of
   the same sentiments as the bishops of the council of Nicæa, and was
   delighted over the affair. He did not, however, attempt to restore them
   to communion without the judgment and approval of those who are, by the
   law of the Church, masters in these matters. He, therefore, sends them
   to the bishops who were then assembled at Jerusalem, and wrote,
   desiring them to examine the declaration of faith submitted by Arius
   and Euzoïus, and so to influence the Synod that, whether they found
   that their doctrine was orthodox, and that the jealousy of their
   enemies had been the sole cause of their condemnation, or that, without
   having reason to blame those who had condemned them, they had changed
   their minds, a humane decision might, in either case, be accorded them.
   Those who had long been zealous for this, seized the opportunity under
   cover of the emperor's letter, and received him into fellowship. They
   wrote immediately to the emperor himself, to the Church of Alexandria,
   and to the bishops and clergy of Egypt, of Thebes, and of Libya,
   earnestly exhorting them to receive Arius and Euzoïus into communion,
   since the emperor bore witness to the correctness of their faith, in
   one of his own epistles, and since the judgment of the emperor had been
   confirmed by the vote of the Synod. [1198]

   These were the subjects which were zealously discussed by the Synod of
   Jerusalem.

   Chapter XXVIII.--Letter from the Emperor Constantine to the Synod of
   Tyre, and Exile of St. Athanasius through the Machination of the Arian
   Faction.

   Athanasius, after having fled from Tyre, repaired [1199] to
   Constantinople, and on coming to the emperor Constantine, complained of
   what he had suffered, in presence of the bishops who had condemned him,
   and besought him to permit the decrees of the council of Tyre to be
   submitted for examination before the emperor. Constantine regarded this
   request as reasonable, and wrote in the following terms to the bishops
   assembled at Tyre:--

   "I know not what has been enacted in confusion and vehemence by your
   Synod; but it appears that, from some disturbing disorder, decrees
   which are not in conformity with truth have been enacted, and that your
   constant irritation of one another evidently prevented you from
   considering what is pleasing to God. But it will be the work of Divine
   Providence to scatter the evils which have been drawn out of this
   contentiousness, and to manifest to us clearly whether you have not
   been misled in your judgment by motives of private friendship or
   aversion. I therefore command that you all come here to my piety
   without delay, in order that we may receive an exact account of your
   transactions. I will explain to you the cause of my writing to you in
   this strain, and you will know from what follows, why I summon you
   before myself through this document. As I was returning on horseback to
   that city which bears my name, and which I regard as my much prospered
   country, Athanasius, the bishop, presented himself so unexpectedly in
   the middle of the highway, with certain individuals who accompanied
   him, that I felt exceedingly surprised at beholding him. God, who sees
   all things, is my witness, that at first I did not know who he was, but
   that some of my attendants having ascertained this point, and the
   injustice which he had suffered, gave me the necessary information. I
   did not on this occasion grant him an interview. He, however,
   persevered in requesting an audience; and although I refused him, and
   was on the point of commanding that he should be removed from my
   presence, he told me with more boldness, that he sought no other favor
   of me than that I should summon you hither, in order that he might in
   your presence complain of what he had suffered unnecessarily. As this
   request appears reasonable and timely, I deemed it right to address you
   in this strain, and to command all of you who were convened at the
   Synod of Tyre to hasten to the court of our clemency, so that you may
   demonstrate by your works, the purity and inflexibility of your
   decisions before me, whom you cannot refuse to acknowledge as a genuine
   servant of God. By my zeal in His service, peace has been established
   throughout the world, and the name of God is genuinely praised among
   the barbarians, who till now were in ignorance of the truth; and it is
   evident that whoever is ignorant of the truth knows not God.
   Notwithstanding, as is above stated, the barbarians have, through my
   instrumentality, learnt to know genuinely and to worship God; for they
   perceived that everywhere, and on all occasions, his protection rested
   on me; and they reverence God the more deeply because they fear my
   power. But we who have to announce the mysteries of forbearance (for I
   will not say that we keep them), we, I say, ought not to do anything
   that can tend to dissension or hatred, or, to speak plainly, to the
   destruction of the human race. Come, then, to us, as I have said, with
   all diligence, and be assured that I shall do everything in my power to
   preserve all the particularly infallible parts of the law of God in a
   way that no fault or heterodoxy can be fabricated; while those enemies
   of the law who, under the guise of the Holy Name, endeavor to introduce
   variant and differing blasphemies, have been openly scattered, utterly
   crushed, and wholly suppressed."

   This letter of the emperor so excited the fears of some of the bishops
   that they set off on their journey homewards. But Eusebius, bishop of
   Nicomedia, and his partisans, went to the emperor, and represented that
   the Synod of Tyre had enacted no decrees against Athanasius but what
   were founded on justice. They brought forward as witnesses Theognis,
   Maris, Theodore, Valens, and Ursacius, and deposed that he had broken
   the mystical cup, and after uttering many other calumnies, they
   prevailed with their accusations. The emperor, either believing their
   statements to be true, or imagining that unanimity would be restored
   among the bishops if Athanasius were removed, exiled him to Treves, in
   Western Gaul; and thither, therefore, he was conducted.

   Chapter XXIX.--Alexander, Bishop of Constantinople; his Refusal to
   receive Arius into Communion; Arius is burst asunder while seeking
   Natural Relief.

   After the Synod of Jerusalem, Arius went to Egypt, [1200] but as he
   could not obtain permission to hold communion with the Church of
   Alexandria, he returned to Constantinople. As all those who had
   embraced his sentiments, and those who were attached to Eusebius,
   bishop of Nicomedia, had assembled cunningly in that city for the
   purpose of holding a council, Alexander, who was then ordering the see
   of Constantinople, used every effort to dissolve the council. But as
   his endeavors were frustrated, he openly refused all covenant with
   Arius, affirming that it was neither just nor according to
   ecclesiastical canons, to make powerless their own vote, and that of
   those bishops who had been assembled at Nicæa, from nearly every region
   under the sun. When the partisans of Eusebius perceived that their
   arguments produced no effect on Alexander, they had recourse to
   contumely, and threatened that unless he would receive Arius into
   communion on a stated day, he should be expelled from the church, and
   that another should be elected in his place who would be willing to
   hold communion with Arius. They then separated, the partisans of
   Eusebius, to await the time they had fixed for carrying their menaces
   into execution, and Alexander to pray that the words of Eusebius might
   be prevented from being carried into deed. His chief source of fear
   arose from the fact that the emperor had been persuaded to give way. On
   the day before the appointed day he prostrated himself before the
   altar, and continued all the night in prayer to God, that his enemies
   might be prevented from carrying their schemes into execution against
   him. Late in the afternoon, Arius, being seized suddenly with pain in
   the stomach, was compelled to repair to the public place set apart for
   emergencies of this nature. As some time passed away without his coming
   out, some persons, who were waiting for him outside, entered, and found
   him dead and still sitting upon the seat. When his death became known,
   all people did not view the occurrence under the same aspect. Some
   believed that he died at that very hour, seized by a sudden disease of
   the heart, or suffering weakness from his joy over the fact that his
   matters were falling out according to his mind; others imagined that
   this mode of death was inflicted on him in judgment, on account of his
   impiety. Those who held his sentiments were of opinion that his death
   was brought about by magical arts. It will not be out of place to quote
   what Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, stated on the subject. The
   following is his narrative:--

   says he derived his statements from Macarius, a presbyter, an
   eye-witness of some of the events narrated in this chapter and the
   next.

   Chapter XXX.--Account given by the Great Athanasius of the Death of
   Arius.

   "Arius, [1201] the author of the heresy and the associate of Eusebius,
   having been summoned before the most blessed Constantine Augustus, at
   the solicitation of the partisans of Eusebius, was desired to give in
   writing an exposition of his faith. He drew up this document with great
   artfulness, and like the devil, concealed his impious assertions
   beneath the simple words of Scripture. The most blessed Constantine
   said to him, If you have no other points in mind than these, render
   testimony to the truth; for if you perjure yourself, the Lord will
   punish you'; and the wretched man swore that he neither held nor
   conceived any sentiments except those now specified in the document,
   even if he had ever affirmed otherwise; soon after he went out, and
   judgment was visited upon him; for he bent forwards and burst in the
   middle. With all men the common end of life is death. We must not blame
   a man, even if he be an enemy, merely because he died, for it is
   uncertain whether we shall live to the evening. But the end of Arius
   was so singular that it seems worthy of some remark. The partisans of
   Eusebius threatened to reinstate him in the church, and Alexander,
   bishop of Constantinople, opposed their intention; Arius placed his
   confidence in the power and menaces of Eusebius; for it was the
   Sabbath, and he expected the next day to be readmitted. The dispute ran
   high; the partisans of Eusebius were loud in their menaces, while
   Alexander had recourse to prayer. The Lord was the judge, and declared
   himself against the unjust. A little before sunset Arius was compelled
   by a want of nature to enter the place appointed for such emergencies,
   and here he lost at once both restoration to communion and his life.
   The most blessed Constantine was amazed when he heard of this
   occurrence, and regarded it as the proof of perjury. It then became
   evident to every one that the menaces of Eusebius were absolutely
   futile, and that the expectations of Arius were vain. It also became
   manifest that the Arian madness could not be fellowshipped by the
   Saviour both here and in the church of the Firstborn. Is it not then
   astonishing that some are still found who seek to exculpate him whom
   the Lord condemned, and to defend that heresy which the Lord proved to
   be unworthy of fellowship, by not permitting its author to enter the
   church? We have been duly informed that this was the mode of the death
   of Arius." It is said that for a long period subsequently no one would
   make use of the seat on which he died. Those who were compelled by
   necessities of nature, as is wont to be the case in a crowd, to visit
   the public place, when they entered, spoke to one another to avoid the
   seat, and the place was shunned afterwards, because Arius had there
   received the punishment of his impiety. At a later time a certain rich
   and powerful man, who had embraced the Arian tenets, bought the place
   of the public, and built a house on the spot, in order that the
   occurrence might fall into oblivion, and that there might be no
   perpetual memorial of the death of Arius.

   Chapter XXXI.--Events which occurred in Alexandria after the Death of
   Arius. Letter of Constantine the Great to the Church there.

   The death of Arius did not terminate the doctrinal dispute which he had
   originated. [1202] Those who adhered to his sentiments did not cease
   from plotting against those who maintained opposite opinions. The
   people of Alexandria loudly complained of the exile of Athanasius, and
   offered up supplications for his return; and Antony, the celebrated
   monk, wrote frequently to the emperor to entreat him to attach no
   credit to the insinuations of the Melitians, but to reject their
   accusations as calumnies; yet the emperor was not convinced by these
   arguments, and wrote to the Alexandrians, accusing them of folly and of
   disorderly conduct. He commanded the clergy and the holy virgins to
   remain quiet, and declared that he would not change his mind nor recall
   Athanasius, whom, he said, he regarded as an exciter of sedition,
   justly condemned by the judgment of the Church. He replied to Antony,
   by stating that he ought not to overlook the decree of the Synod; for
   even if some few of the bishops, he said, were actuated by ill-will or
   the desire to oblige others, it scarcely seems credible that so many
   prudent and excellent bishops could have been impelled by such motives;
   and, he added, that Athanasius was contumelious and arrogant, and the
   cause of dissension and sedition. The enemies of Athanasius accused him
   the more especially of these crimes, because they knew that the emperor
   regarded them with peculiar aversion. When he heard that the Church was
   split into two factions, of which one supported Athanasius and the
   other John, he was transported with indignation, and exiled John
   himself. This John had succeeded Melitius, and had, with those who held
   the same sentiments as himself, been restored to communion and
   reestablished in the clerical functions by the Synod of Tyre. His
   banishment was contrary to the wishes of the enemies of Athanasius, yet
   it was done, and the decrees of the Synod of Tyre did not benefit John,
   for the emperor was beyond supplication or petition of any kind with
   respect to any one who was suspected of stirring up Christian people to
   sedition or dissension.

   Chapter XXXII.--Constantine enacts a Law against all Heresies, and
   prohibits the People from holding Church in any place but the Catholic
   Church, and thus the Greater Number of Heresies disappear. The Arians
   who sided with Eusebius of Nicomedia, artfully attempted to obliterate
   the Term "Consubstantial."

   Although the doctrine of Arius was zealously supported by many persons
   in disputations, [1203] a party had not as yet been formed to whom the
   name of Arians could be applied as a distinctive appellation; for all
   assembled together as a church and held communion with each other, with
   the exception of the Novatians, those called Phrygians, the
   Valentinians, the Marcionites, the Paulianians, and some few others who
   adhered to already invented heresies. The emperor, however, enacted a
   law that their own houses of prayer should be abolished; and that they
   should meet in the churches, and not hold church in private houses, or
   in public places. He deemed it better to hold fellowship in the
   Catholic Church, and he advised them to assemble in her walls. By means
   of this law, almost all the heresies, I believe, disappeared. During
   the reign of preceding emperors, all who worshiped Christ, however they
   might have differed from each other in opinion, received the same
   treatment from the pagans, and were persecuted with equal cruelty.
   These common calamities, to which they were all equally liable,
   prevented them from prosecuting any close inquiries as to the
   differences of opinion which existed among themselves; it was therefore
   easy for the members of each party to hold church by themselves, and by
   continually conferring with one another, however few they might have
   been in number, they were not disrupted. But after this law was passed
   they could not assemble in public, because it was forbidden; nor could
   they hold their assemblies in secret, for they were watched by the
   bishops and clergy of their city. Hence the greater number of these
   sectarians were led, by fear of consequences, to join themselves to the
   Catholic Church. Those who adhered to their original sentiments did
   not, at their death, leave any disciples to propagate their heresy, for
   they could neither come together into the same place, nor were they
   able to teach in security those of the same opinions. On account either
   of the absurdity of the heretical dogmas, or of the utter ignorance of
   those who devised and taught them, the respective followers of each
   heresy were, from the beginning, very few in number. The Novatians
   alone, [1204] who had obtained good leaders, and who entertained the
   same opinions respecting the Divinity as the Catholic Church, were
   numerous, from the beginning, and remained so, not being much injured
   by this law; the emperor, I believe, willingly relaxed in their favor
   the rigor of the enactment, for he only desired to strike terror into
   the minds of his subjects, and had no intention of persecuting them.
   Acesius, who was then the bishop of this heresy in Constantinople, was
   much esteemed by the emperor on account of his virtuous life; and it is
   probable that it was for his sake that the church which he governed met
   with protection. The Phrygians suffered the same treatment as the other
   heretics in all the Roman provinces except Phrygia and the neighboring
   regions, for here they had, since the time of Montanus, existed in
   great numbers and do so to the present day.

   About this time the partisans of Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, and of
   Theognis, bishop of Nicæa, began to make innovations in writing upon
   the confession set forth by the Nicæan Council. They did not venture to
   reject openly the assertion that the Son is consubstantial with the
   Father, because this assertion was maintained by the emperor; but they
   propounded another document, and signified to the Eastern bishops that
   they received the terms of the Nicæan doctrine with verbal
   interpretations. From this declaration and reflection, the former
   dispute lapsed into fresh discussion, and what seemed to have been put
   at rest was again set in motion.

   Chapter XXXIII.--Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra; his Heresy and Deposition.

   At the same period, Marcellus, bishop of Ancyra, [1205] in Galatia, was
   deposed and cast out of the Church by the bishops assembled at
   Constantinople, because he had introduced some new doctrines, whereby
   he taught that the existence of the Son of God commenced when He was
   born of Mary, and that His kingdom would have an end; he had, moreover,
   drawn up a written document wherein these views were propounded. Basil,
   a man of great eloquence and learning, was invested with the bishopric
   of the parish of Galatia. They also wrote to the churches in the
   neighboring regions, to desire them to search for the copies of the
   book [1206] written by Marcellus, and to destroy them, and to lead back
   any whom they might find to have embraced his sentiments. They stated
   that the work was too voluminous to admit of their transcribing the
   whole in their epistle, but that they inserted quotations of certain
   passages in order to prove that the doctrines which they had condemned
   were there advocated. Some persons, however, maintained that Marcellus
   had merely propounded a few questions which had been misconstrued by
   the adherents of Eusebius, and represented to the emperor as actual
   confessions. Eusebius and his partisans were much irritated against
   Marcellus, because he had not consented to the definitions propounded
   by the Synod in Phoenicia, nor to the regulations which had been made
   in favor of Arius at Jerusalem; and had likewise refused to attend at
   the consecration of the Great Martyrium, in order to avoid communion
   with them. In their letter to the emperor, they dwelt largely upon this
   latter circumstance, and brought it forward as a charge, alleging that
   it was a personal insult to him to refuse attendance at the
   consecration of the temple which he had constructed at Jerusalem. The
   motive by which Marcellus was induced to write this work was that
   Asterius, who was a sophist and a native of Cappadocia, had written a
   treatise in defense of the Arian doctrines, and had read it in various
   cities, and to the bishops, and likewise at several Synods where he had
   attended. Marcellus undertook to refute his arguments, and while thus
   engaged, he, either deliberately or unintentionally, fell into the
   opinions of Paul of Samosata. He was afterwards, however, reinstated in
   his bishopric by the Synod of Sardis, after having proved that he did
   not hold such sentiments.

   Chapter XXXIV.--Death of Constantine the Great; he died after Baptism
   and was buried in the Temple of the Holy Apostles.

   The emperor had already divided the empire among his sons, who were
   styled Cæsars. [1207] To Constantine and Constans he awarded the
   western regions; and to Constantius, the eastern; and as he was
   indisposed, and required to have recourse to bathing, he repaired for
   that purpose to Helenopolis, a city of Bithynia. His malady, however,
   increased, and he went to Nicomedia, and was initiated into holy
   baptism in one of the suburbs of that city. After the ceremony he was
   filled with joy, and returned thanks to God. He then confirmed the
   division of the empire among his sons, according to his former
   allotment, and bestowed certain privileges on old Rome and on the city
   named after himself. He placed his testament in the hands of the
   presbyter who constantly extolled Arius, and who had been recommended
   to him as a man of virtuous life by his sister Constantia in her last
   moments, and commanded him with an added oath to deliver it to
   Constantius on his return, for neither Constantius nor the other Cæsars
   were with their dying father. After making these arrangements,
   Constantine survived but a few days; he died in the sixty-fifth year of
   his age, and the thirty-first of his reign. He was a powerful protector
   of the Christian religion, and was the first of the emperors who began
   to be zealous for the Church, and to bestow upon her high benefactions.
   He was more successful than any other sovereign in all his
   undertakings; for he formed no design, I am convinced, without God. He
   was victorious in his wars against the Goths and Sarmatians, and,
   indeed, in all his military enterprises; and he changed the form of
   government according to his own mind with so much ease, that he created
   another senate and another imperial city, to which he gave his own
   name. He assailed the pagan religion, and in a little while subverted
   it, although it had prevailed for ages among the princes and the
   people.

   After the death of Constantine, his body was placed in a golden coffin,
   conveyed to Constantinople, and deposited on a certain platform in the
   palace; the same honor and ceremonial were observed, by those who were
   in the palace, as were accorded to him while living. On hearing of his
   father's death, Constantius, who was then in the East, hastened to
   Constantinople, and interred the royal remains with the utmost
   magnificence, and deposited them in the tomb which had been constructed
   by order of the deceased in the Church of the Apostles. From this
   period it became the custom to deposit the remains of subsequent
   Christian emperors in the same place of interment; and here bishops,
   likewise, were buried, for the hierarchical dignity is not only equal
   in honor to imperial power, but, in sacred places, even takes the
   ascendancy.

   Book III.

   Chapter I.--After the Death of Constantine the Great, the Adherents of
   Eusebius and Theognis attack the Nicene Faith.

   We have now seen what events transpired in the churches during the
   reign of Constantine. [1208] On his death the doctrine which had been
   set forth at Nicæa, was subjected to renewed examination. Although this
   doctrine was not universally approved, no one, during the life of
   Constantine, had dared to reject it openly. At his death, however, many
   renounced this opinion, especially those who had previously been
   suspected of treachery. Of all these Eusebius and Theognis, bishops of
   the province of Bithynia, did everything in their power to give
   predominance to the tenets of Arius. They believed that this object
   would be easily accomplished, if the return of Athanasius from exile
   could be prevented, and by giving the government of the Egyptian
   churches to a bishop of like opinion with them. They found an efficient
   coadjutor in the presbyter who had obtained from Constantine the recall
   of Arius. He was held in high esteem by the emperor Constantius, on
   account of the service he had rendered in delivering to him the
   testament of his father; since he was trusted, he boldly seized the
   opportunities, until he became an intimate of the emperor's wife, and
   of the powerful eunuchs of the women's sleeping apartments. At this
   period Eusebius [1209] was appointed to superintend the concerns of the
   royal household, and being zealously attached to Arianism, he induced
   the empress and many of the persons belonging to the court to adopt the
   same sentiments. Hence disputations concerning doctrines again became
   prevalent, both in private and in public, and revilings and animosities
   were renewed. This state of things was in accordance with the views of
   Theognis and his partisans.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1208] This section is manifestly an abridgment of Soc. ii. 2.

   [1209] This Eusebius was a eunuch, who was now made chief chamberlain,
   and became a disciple of the alleged presbyter.

   Chapter II.--Return of Athanasius the Great from Rome; Letter of
   Constantine Cæsar, Son of Constantine the Great; Renewed Machinations
   of the Arians against Athanasius; Acacius of Berroea; War between
   Constans and Constantine.

   At this period Athanasius returned from Gaul to Alexandria. [1210] It
   is said that Constantine intended to have recalled him, and that in his
   testament he even gave orders to that effect. But as he was prevented
   by death from performing his intention, his son who bore his name, and
   who was then commanding in Western Gaul, recalled Athanasius, and wrote
   a letter on the subject to the people of Alexandria. Having met with a
   copy of this letter translated from the Latin into Greek, I shall
   insert it precisely as I found it. It is as follows:--

   "Constantine Cæsar, to the people of the Catholic Church in the city of
   Alexandria. [1211]

   "You cannot, I believe, be unacquainted with the fact that Athanasius,
   the interpreter of the venerated law, since the cruelty of his
   bloodthirsty and hostile enemies continued, to the danger of his sacred
   person, was sent for a time into Gaul in order that he might not incur
   irretrievable extremities through the perversity of these worthless
   opponents; in order then to make this danger futile, he was taken out
   of the jaws of the men, who pressed upon him, and was commanded to live
   near me, so that in the city where he dwelt, he might be amply
   furnished with all necessaries; but his virtue is so famous and
   extraordinary, because he is confident of Divine aid, that he sets at
   naught all the rougher burdens of fortune. Our lord and my father,
   Constantine Augustus, of blessed memory, intended to have reinstated
   this bishop in his own place, and thus especially to have restored him
   to your much beloved piety; but, since he was anticipated by the human
   lot, and died before fulfilling his intention, I, as his successor,
   purpose to carry into execution the design of the emperor of Divine
   memory. Athanasius will inform you, when he shall see your face, in how
   great reverence he was held by me. Nor is it surprising that I should
   have acted as I have done towards him, for the image of your own desire
   and the appearance of so noble a man, moved and impelled me to this
   step. May Divine Providence watch over you, my beloved brethren."

   In consequence of this letter from the emperor Athanasius went home,
   and resumed the government of the Egyptian churches. Those who were
   attached to the Arian doctrines were thrown into consternation and
   could not keep the peace; they excited continuous seditions, and had
   recourse to other machinations against him. The partisans of Eusebius
   accused him before the emperor of being a seditious person, and of
   having reversed the decree of exile, contrary to the laws of the
   church, and without the consent of the bishops. I shall presently
   relate in the proper place, how, by their intrigues, Athanasius was
   again expelled from Alexandria.

   Eusebius, surnamed Pamphilus, died [1212] about this period, and
   Acacius succeeded to the bishopric of Cæsarea in Palestine. He was a
   zealous imitator of Eusebius because he had been instructed by him in
   the Sacred Word; he possessed a capable mind and was polished in
   expression, so that he left many writings worthy of commendation. Not
   long after, [1213] the emperor Constantine declared war against his
   brother Constans at Aquileia, [1214] and was slain by his own generals.
   The Roman Empire was divided between the surviving brothers; the West
   fell to the lot of Constans and the East to Constantius.

   Chapter III.--Paul, Bishop of Constantinople, and Macedonius, the
   Pneumatomachian.

   Alexander died [1215] about this time, and Paul succeeded to the high
   priesthood of Constantinople. The followers of Arius and Macedonius
   assert that he took possession at his own motion, and against the
   advice of Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, or of Theodore, bishop of
   Heraclea, in Thrace; upon whom, as being the nearest bishops, the right
   of conferring ordination devolved. Many, however, maintain, on the
   testimony of Alexander, whom he succeeded, that he was ordained by the
   bishops who were then assembled at Constantinople. [1216] For when
   Alexander, who was ninety-eight years of age, and who had conducted the
   episcopal office vigorously for twenty-three years, was at the point of
   death, his clergy, asked him to whom he wished to turn over his church.
   "If," replied he, "you seek a man good in Divine matters and one who is
   apt to teach you, have Paul. But if you desire one who is conversant
   with public affairs, and with the councils of rulers, Macedonius is
   better." The Macedonians themselves admit that this testimony was given
   by Alexander; but they say that Paul was more skilled in the
   transaction of business and the art of eloquence; but they put emphasis
   for Macedonius, on the testimony of his life; and they accuse Paul of
   having been addicted to effeminacy and an indifferent conduct. [1217]
   It appears, however, from their own acknowledgment, that Paul was a man
   of eloquence, and brilliant in teaching the Church. Events proved that
   he was not competent to combat the casualties of life, or to hold
   intercourse with those in power; for he was never successful in
   subverting the machinations of his enemies, [1218] like those who are
   adroit in the management of affairs. Although he was greatly beloved by
   the people, he suffered severely from the treachery of those who then
   rejected the doctrine which prevailed at Nicæa. In the first place, he
   was expelled from the church of Constantinople, as if some accusation
   of misconduct had been established against him. [1219] He was then
   condemned to banishment, and finally, it is said, fell a victim to the
   devices of his enemies, and was strangled. But these latter events took
   place at a subsequent period.

   Chapter IV.--A Sedition was excited on the Ordination of Paul.

   The ordination of Paul occasioned a great commotion in the Church of
   Constantinople. [1220] During the life of Alexander, the Arians did not
   act very openly; for the people by being attentive to him were well
   governed and honored Divine things, and especially believed that the
   unexpected occurrence which befell Arius, whom they believed met such a
   death, was the Divine wrath, drawn down by the imprecations of
   Alexander. After the death of this bishop, however, the people became
   divided into two parties, and disputes and contests concerning
   doctrines were openly carried on. The adherents of Arius desired the
   ordination of Macedonius, while those who maintained that the Son is
   consubstantial with the Farther wished to have Paul as their bishop;
   and this latter party prevailed. After the ordination of Paul, the
   emperor, who chanced to be away from home, returned to Constantinople,
   and manifested as much displeasure at what had taken place as though
   the bishopric had been conferred upon an unworthy man. Through the
   machinations of the enemies of Paul a Synod was convened, and he was
   expelled from the Church. It handed over the Church of Constantinople
   to Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia.

   Chapter V.--The Partial Council of Antioch; it deposed Athanasius; it
   substituted Gregory; its Two Statements of the Faith; those who agreed
   with them.

   Soon after these occurrences, the emperor went to Antioch, a city of
   Syria. [1221] Here a church had already been completed, which excelled
   in size and beauty. Constantine began to build it during his lifetime,
   and as the structure had been just finished by his son Constantius, it
   was deemed a favorable opportunity by the partisans of Eusebius, who of
   old were zealous for it, to convene a council. They, therefore, with
   those from various regions who held their sentiments, met together in
   Antioch; [1222] their bishops were about ninety-seven in number. Their
   professed object was the consecration of the newly finished church; but
   they intended nothing else than the abolition of the decrees of the
   Nicæan Council, and this was fully proved by the sequel. The Church of
   Antioch was then governed by Placetus, [1223] who had succeeded
   Euphronius. The death of Constantine the Great had taken place about
   five years prior to this period. When all the bishops had assembled in
   the presence of the emperor Constantius, the majority expressed great
   indignation, and vigorously accused Athanasius of having contemned the
   sacerdotal regulation which they had enacted, [1224] and taken
   possession of the bishopric of Alexandria without first obtaining the
   sanction of a council. They also deposed that he was the cause of the
   death of several persons, who fell in a sedition excited by his return;
   and that many others had on the same occasion been arrested and
   delivered up to the judicial tribunals. By these accusations they
   contrived to cast odium on Athanasius, and it was decreed that Gregory
   should be invested with the government of the Church of Alexandria.
   They then turned to the discussion of doctrinal questions, and found no
   fault with the decrees of the council of Nice. They dispatched letters
   to the bishops of every city, in which they declared that, as they were
   bishops themselves, they had not followed Arius. "For how," said they,
   "could we have been followers of him, when he was but a presbyter,
   [1225] and we were placed above him?" Since they were the testers of
   his faith, they had readily received him; and they believed in the
   faith which had from the beginning been handed down by tradition. This
   they further explained at the bottom of their letter, but without
   mentioning the substance of the Father or the Son, or the term
   consubstantial. They resorted, in fact, to such ambiguity of
   expression, that neither the Arians nor the followers of the decrees of
   the Nicæan Council could call the arrangement of their words into
   question, as though they were ignorant of the holy Scriptures. They
   purposely avoided all forms of expression which were rejected by either
   party, and only made use of those which were universally admitted. They
   confessed [1226] that the Son is with the Father, that He is the only
   begotten One, and that He is God, and existed before all things; and
   that He took flesh upon Him, and fulfilled the will of His Father. They
   confessed these and similar truths, but they did not describe the
   doctrine of the Son being co-eternal or consubstantial with the Father,
   or the opposite. They subsequently changed their minds, it appears,
   about this formulary, and issued another, [1227] which, I think, very
   nearly resembled that of the council of Nice, unless, indeed, some
   secret meaning be attached to the words which is not apparent to me.
   Although they refrained--I know not from what motive--from saying that
   the Son is consubstantial, they confessed that He is immutable, that
   His Divinity is not susceptible of change, that He is the perfect image
   of the substance, and counsel, and power, and glory of the Father, and
   that He is the first-born of every creature. They stated that they had
   found this formulary of faith, and that it was entirely written by
   Lucianus, [1228] who was martyred in Nicomedia, and who was a man
   highly approved and exceedingly accurate in the sacred Scriptures. I
   know not whether this statement was really true, or whether they merely
   advanced it in order to give weight to their own document, by
   connecting with it the dignity of a martyr. Not only did Eusebius (who,
   on the expulsion of Paul, had been transferred from Nicomedia to the
   throne of Constantinople) participate in this council, but likewise
   Acacius, the successor of Eusebius Pamphilus, Patrophilus, bishop of
   Scythopolis, Theodore, bishop of Heraclea, formerly called Perinthus,
   Eudoxius, bishop of Germanicia, who subsequently directed the Church of
   Constantinople after Macedonius, and Gregory, who had been chosen to
   preside over the Church of Alexandria. It was universally acknowledged
   that all these bishops held the same sentiments, such as Dianius,
   [1229] bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, George, bishop of Laodicea in
   Syria, and many others who acted as bishops over metropolitan and other
   distinguished churches.

   Chapter VI.--Eusebius surnamed Emesenus; Gregory accepted Alexandria;
   Athanasius seeks Refuge in Rome.

   Eusebius, surnamed Emesenus, likewise attended the council. [1230] He
   sprang from a noble family of Edessa, a city of Osroënæ. According to
   the custom of his country, he had from his youth upwards, learned the
   Holy Word, and was afterwards made acquainted with the learning of the
   Greeks, by the teachers who then frequented his native city. He
   subsequently acquired a more intimate knowledge of sacred literature
   under the guidance of Eusebius Pamphilus and Patrophilus, the president
   of Scythopolis. He went to Antioch at the time that Eustathius was
   deposed on the accusation of Cyrus, and lived with Euphronius, his
   successor, on terms of intimacy. He fled to escape being invested with
   the priestly dignity, went to Alexandria and frequented the schools of
   the philosophers. After acquainting himself with their mode of
   discipline, he returned to Antioch and dwelt with Placetus, the
   successor of Euphronius. During the time that the council was held in
   that city, Eusebius, bishop of Constantinople, entreated him to accept
   the see of Alexandria for it was thought that, by his great reputation
   for sanctity and consummate eloquence, he would easily supplant
   Athanasius in the esteem of the Egyptians. He, however, refused the
   ordination, on the plea that he could otherwise only incur the ready
   hatred of the Alexandrians, who would have no other bishop but
   Athanasius. Gregory was, therefore, appointed to the church of
   Alexandria, and Eusebius to that of Emesa.

   There he suffered from a sedition; for the people accused him of
   practicing that variety of astronomy which is called astrological, and
   being obliged to seek safety by flight, he repaired to Laodicea, and
   dwelt with George, bishop of that city, who was his particular friend.
   He afterwards accompanied this bishop to Antioch, and obtained
   permission from the bishops Placetus and Narcissus to return to Emesa.
   He was much esteemed by the emperor Constantius, and attended him in
   his military expedition against the Persians. It is said that God
   wrought miracles through his instrumentality, as is testified by George
   of Laodicea, [1231] who has related these and other incidents about
   him.

   But although he was endowed with so many exalted qualities, he could
   not escape the jealousy of those who are irritated by witnessing the
   virtues of others. He endured the censure of having embraced the
   doctrines of Sabellius. At the present time, however, he voted with the
   bishops who had been convened at Antioch. It is said that Maximus,
   bishop of Jerusalem, purposely, kept aloof from this council, because
   he repented having unawares consented to the deposition of Athanasius.
   [1232] The manager of the Roman see, nor any representative from the
   east of Italy, nor from the parts beyond Rome were present at Antioch.
   [1233] At the same period of time, the Franks devastated Western Gaul;
   and the provinces of the East, and more particularly Antioch after the
   Synod, were visited by tremendous earthquakes. [1234] After the Synod,
   Gregory repaired to Alexandria with a large body of soldiers, who were
   enjoined to provide an undisturbed and safe entrance into the city; the
   Arians also, who were anxious for the expulsion of Athanasius, sided
   with him. Athanasius, fearful lest the people should be exposed to
   sufferings on his account, [1235] assembled them by night in the
   church, and when the soldiers came to take possession of the church,
   prayers having been concluded, he first ordered a psalm to be sung.
   During the chanting of this psalm the soldiers remained without and
   quietly awaited its conclusion, and in the meantime Athanasius passed
   under the singers and secretly made his escape, and fled to Rome. In
   this manner Gregory possessed himself of the see of Alexandria. The
   indignation of the people was aroused, and they burnt the church which
   bore the name of Dionysius, one of their former bishops.

   Chapter VII.--High Priests of Rome and of Constantinople; Restoration
   of Paul after Eusebius; the Slaughter of Hermogenes, a General of the
   Army; Constantius came from Antioch and removed Paul, and was
   wrathfully disposed toward the City; he allowed Macedonius to be in
   Doubt, and returned to Antioch.

   Thus were the schemes of those who upheld various heresies in
   opposition to truth successfully carried into execution; and thus did
   they depose those bishops who strenuously maintained throughout the
   East the supremacy of the doctrines of the Nicæan Council. These
   heretics had taken possession of the most important sees, such as
   Alexandria in Egypt, Antioch in Syria, and the imperial city of the
   Hellespont, and they held all the persuaded bishops in subjection. The
   ruler of the Church at Rome and all the priests of the West regarded
   these deeds as a personal insult; for they had accorded from the
   beginning with all the decisions in the vote made by those convened at
   Nice, nor did they now cease from that way of thinking. On the arrival
   of Athanasius, they received him kindly, and espoused his cause among
   themselves. Irritated at this interference, Eusebius wrote to Julius,
   exhorting him to constitute himself a judge of the decrees that had
   been enacted against Athanasius by the council of Tyre. [1236] But
   before he had been able to ascertain the sentiments of Julius, and,
   indeed, not long after the council of Antioch, Eusebius died.
   Immediately upon this event, those citizens of Constantinople who
   maintained the doctrines of the Nicæan Council, conducted Paul to the
   church. At the same time those of the opposing multitude seized this
   occasion and came together in another church, among whom were the
   adherents of Theognis, bishop of Nicæa, of Theodore, bishop of
   Heraclea, and others of the same party who chanced to be present, and
   they ordained Macedonius bishop of Constantinople. This excited
   frequent seditions in the city which assumed all the appearance of a
   war, for the people fell upon one another, and many perished. The city
   was filled with tumult, so that the emperor, who was then at Antioch,
   on hearing of what had occurred, was moved to wrath, and issued a
   decree for the expulsion of Paul. Hermogenes, general of the cavalry,
   endeavored to put this edict of the emperor's into execution; for
   having been sent to Thrace, he had, on the journey, to pass by
   Constantinople, and he thought, by means of his army, to eject Paul
   from the church by force. But the people, instead of yielding, met him
   with open resistance, and while the soldiers, in order to carry out the
   orders they had received, attempted still greater violence, the
   insurgents entered the house of Hermogenes, set fire to it, killed him,
   and attaching a cord to his body, dragged it through the city. [1237]
   The emperor had no sooner received this intelligence than he took horse
   for Constantinople, in order to punish the people. But he spared them
   when he saw them coming to meet him with tears and supplications. He
   deprived the city of about half of the corn which his father,
   Constantine, had granted them annually out of the public treasury from
   the tributes of Egypt, probably from the idea that luxury and excess
   made the populace idle and disposed to sedition. He turned his anger
   against Paul and commanded his expulsion from the city. He manifested
   great displeasure against Macedonius also, because he was the occasion
   of the murder of the general and of other individuals and also, because
   he had been ordained without first obtaining his sanction. He, however,
   returned to Antioch, without having either confirmed or dissolved his
   ordination. Meanwhile the zealots of the Arian tenets deposed Gregory,
   because he was indifferent in the support of their doctrines, and had
   moreover incurred the ill-will of the Alexandrians on account of the
   calamities which had befallen the city at his entrance, especially the
   conflagration of the church. They elected George, a native of
   Cappadocia, in his stead; [1238] this new bishop was admired on account
   of his activity and his zeal in support of the Arian dogma.

   Chapter VIII.--Arrival of the Eastern High Priests at Rome; Letter of
   Julius, Bishop of Rome, concerning them; by means of the Letters of
   Julius, Paul and Athanasius receive their own Sees; Contents of the
   Letter from the Archpriests of the East to Julius.

   Athanasius, on leaving Alexandria, had fled to Rome. [1239] Paul,
   bishop of Constantinople, Marcellus, bishop of Ancyra, and Asclepas,
   bishop of Gaza, repaired thither at the same time. Asclepas, who was
   opposed to the Arians and had therefore been deposed, after having been
   accused by some of the heterodox of having thrown down an altar;
   Quintianus had been appointed in his stead over the Church of Gaza.
   Lucius also, bishop of Adrianople, who had been deposed from the church
   under his care on another charge, was dwelling at this period in Rome.
   The Roman bishop, on learning the accusation against each individual,
   and on finding that they held the same sentiments about the Nicæan
   dogmas, admitted them to communion as of like orthodoxy; and as the
   care for all was fitting to the dignity of his see, he restored them
   all to their own churches. He wrote to the bishops of the East, and
   rebuked them for having judged these bishops unjustly, and for
   harassing the Churches by abandoning the Nicæan doctrines. He summoned
   a few among them to appear before him on an appointed day, in order to
   account to him for the sentence they had passed, and threatened to bear
   with them no longer, unless they would cease to make innovations. This
   was the tenor of his letters. Athanasius and Paul were reinstated in
   their respective sees, and forwarded the letter of Julius to the
   bishops of the East. The bishops could scarcely brook such documents,
   and they assembled together at Antioch, [1240] and framed a reply to
   Julius, beautifully expressed and composed with great legal skill, yet
   filled with considerable irony and indulging in the strongest threats.
   They confessed in this epistle, that the Church of Rome was entitled to
   universal honor, because it was the school of the apostles, and had
   become the metropolis of piety from the outset, although the
   introducers of the doctrine had settled there from the East. They added
   that the second place in point of honor ought not to be assigned to
   them, because they did not have the advantage of size or number in
   their churches; for they excelled the Romans in virtue and
   determination. They called Julius to account for having admitted the
   followers of Athanasius into communion, and expressed their indignation
   against him for having insulted their Synod and abrogated their
   decrees, and they assailed his transactions as unjust and discordant
   with ecclesiastical right. After these censures and protestations
   against such grievances, they proceeded to state, that if Julius would
   acknowledge the deposition of the bishops whom they had expelled, and
   the substitution of those whom they had ordained in their stead, they
   would promise peace and fellowship; but that, unless he would accede to
   these terms, they would openly declare their opposition. They added
   that the priests who had preceded them in the government of the Eastern
   churches had offered no opposition to the deposition of Novatian, by
   the Church of Rome. They made no allusion in their letter to any
   deviations they had manifested from the doctrines of the council of
   Nice, but merely stated they had various reasons to allege in
   justification of the course they had pursued, and that they considered
   it unnecessary to enter at that time upon any defense of their conduct,
   as they were suspected of having violated justice in every respect.

   Chapter IX.--Ejection of Paul and Athanasius; Macedonius is invested
   with the Government of the Church of Constantinople.

   After having written in this strain to Julius, the bishops of the East
   brought accusations against those whom they had deposed before the
   emperor Constantius. [1241] Accordingly, the emperor, who was then at
   Antioch, wrote to Philip, the prefect of Constantinople, commanding him
   to surrender the Church to Macedonius, and to expel Paul from the city.
   The prefect feared the commotion among the people, and before the order
   of the emperor could be divulged, he repaired to the public bath which
   is called Zeuxippus, a conspicuous and large structure, and summoned
   Paul, as if he wished to converse with him on some affairs of general
   interest; as soon as he had arrived, he showed him the edict of the
   emperor. Paul was, according to orders, secretly conducted through the
   palace contiguous to the bath, to the seaside, and placed on board a
   vessel and was sent to Thessalonica, whence, it is said, his ancestors
   originally came. He was strictly prohibited from approaching the
   Eastern regions, but was not forbidden to visit Illyria and the remoter
   provinces.

   On quitting the court room, Philip, accompanied by Macedonius,
   proceeded to the church. The people, who had in the meantime been
   assembling together in untold numbers, quickly filled the church, and
   the two parties into which they were divided, namely, the supporters of
   the Arian heresy and the followers of Paul respectively, strove to take
   possession of the building. When the prefect and Macedonius arrived at
   the gates of the church, the soldiers endeavored to force back the
   people, in order to make way for these dignitaries, but as they were so
   crowded together, it was impossible for them to recede, since they were
   closely packed to the farthest point, or to make way; the soldiers,
   under the impression that the crowd was unwilling to retire, slew many
   with their swords, and a great number were killed by being trampled
   upon. The edict of the emperor was thus accomplished, and Macedonius
   received the Churches, while Paul was unexpectedly ejected from the
   Church in Constantinople.

   Athanasius in the meantime had fled, and concealed himself, fearing the
   menace of the emperor Constantius, for he had threatened to punish him
   with death; for the heterodox had made the emperor believe that he was
   a seditious person, and that he had, on his return to the bishopric,
   occasioned the death of several persons. But the anger of the emperor
   had been chiefly excited by the representation that Athanasius had sold
   the provisions which the emperor Constantine had bestowed on the poor
   of Alexandria, and had appropriated the price.

   Chapter X.--The Bishop of Rome writes to the Bishops of the East in
   Favor of Athanasius, and they send an Embassy to Rome who, with the
   Bishop of Rome, are to investigate the Charges against the Eastern
   Bishops; this Deputation is dismissed by Constans, the Cæsar.

   The bishops of Egypt, [1242] having sent a declaration in writing that
   these allegations were false, and Julius having been apprised that
   Athanasius was far from being in safety in Egypt, sent for him to his
   own city. He replied at the same time to the letter of the bishops who
   were convened at Antioch, for just then he happened to have received
   their epistle, [1243] and accused them of having clandestinely
   introduced innovations contrary to the dogmas of the Nicene council,
   and of having violated the laws of the Church, by neglecting to invite
   him to join their Synod; for he alleged that there is a sacerdotal
   canon which declares that whatever is enacted contrary to the judgment
   of the bishop of Rome is null. He also reproached them for having
   deviated from justice in all their proceedings against Athanasius, both
   at Tyre and Mareotis, and stated that the decrees enacted at the former
   city had been annulled, on account of the calumny concerning the hand
   of Arsenius, and at the latter city, on account of the absence of
   Athanasius. Last of all he reprehended the arrogant style of their
   epistle.

   Julius was induced by all these reasons to undertake the defense of
   Athanasius and of Paul: the latter had arrived in Italy not long
   previously, and had lamented bitterly these calamities. When Julius
   perceived that what he had written to those who held the sacerdotal
   dignity in the East was of no avail, he made the matter known to
   Constans the emperor. Accordingly, Constans wrote to his brother
   Constantius, requesting him to send some of the bishops of the East,
   that they might assign a reason for the edicts of deposition which they
   had passed. Three bishops were selected for this purpose; namely,
   Narcissus, bishop of Irenopolis, in Cilicia; Theodore, bishop of
   Heraclea, in Thrace; and Mark, bishop of Arethusa, in Syria. On their
   arrival in Italy, they strove to justify their actions and to persuade
   the emperor that the sentence passed by the Eastern Synod was just.
   Being required to produce a statement of their belief, they concealed
   the formulary they had drawn up at Antioch, and presented another
   written confession [1244] which was equally at variance with the
   doctrines approved at Nicæa. Constans perceived that they had unjustly
   entrapped both Paul and Athanasius, and had ejected them from
   communion, not for charges against his conduct, as the depositions
   held, but simply on account of differences in doctrine; and he
   accordingly dismissed the deputation without giving any credit to the

   Chapter XI.--The Long Formulary and the Enactments issued by the Synod
   of Sardica. Julius, Bishop of Rome, and Hosius, the Spanish Bishop,
   deposed by the Bishops of the East, because they held Communion with
   Athanasius and the Rest.

   Three years afterwards, the bishops of the East [1245] sent to those of
   the West a formulary of faith, which, because it had been framed with
   verbiage and thoughts in excess of any former confession, was called
   makrostichos ekthesis. [1246] In this formulary they made no mention of
   the substance of God, but those are excommunicated who maintain that
   the Son arose out of what had no previous existence, or that He is of
   Another hypostasis, and not of God, or that there was a time or an age
   in which He existed not. Eudoxius, who was still bishop of Germanicia,
   Martyrius, and Macedonius, carried this document, but the Western
   priests did not entertain it; for they declared that they felt fully
   satisfied with the doctrines established at Nicæa, and thought it
   entirely unnecessary to be too curious about such points.

   After the Emperor Constans [1247] had requested his brother to
   reinstate the followers of Athanasius in their sees, and had found his
   application to be unavailing, on account of the counteracting influence
   of those who adopted a hostile heresy; and when, moreover, the party of
   Athanasius and Paul entreated Constans to assemble a Synod on account
   of the plots for the abolition of orthodox doctrines, both the emperors
   were of the opinion that the bishops of the East and of the West should
   be convened on a certain day at Sardica, a city of Illyria. The bishops
   of the East, who had previously assembled at Philippopolis, a city of
   Thrace, wrote to the bishops of the West, who had already assembled at
   Sardica, that they would not join them, unless they would eject the
   followers of Athanasius from their assembly, and from communion with
   them, because they had been deposed. They afterwards went to Sardica,
   but declared they would not enter the church, while those who had been
   deposed by them were admitted thither. The bishops of the West replied,
   that they never had ejected them, and that they would not yield this
   now, particularly as Julius, bishop of Rome, after having investigated
   the case, had not condemned them, and that besides, they were present
   and ready to justify themselves and to refute again the offenses
   imputed to them. These declarations, however, were of no avail; and
   since the time they had appointed for the adjustment of their
   differences, concerning which they had convened, had expired, they
   finally wrote letters to one another on these points, and by these they
   were led to an increase of their previous ill-will. And after they had
   convened separately, they brought forward opposite decisions; for the
   Eastern bishops confirmed the sentences they had already enacted
   against Athanasius, Paul, Marcellus, and Asclepas, and deposed Julius,
   bishop of Rome, because he had been the first to admit those who had
   been condemned by them, into communion; and Hosius, the confessor, was
   also deposed, partly for the same reason, and partly because he was the
   friend of Paulinus and Eustathius, the rulers of the church in Antioch.
   Maximus, bishop of Treves, was deposed, because he had been among the
   first who had received Paul into communion, and had been the cause of
   his returning to Constantinople, and because he had excluded from
   communion the Eastern bishops who had repaired to Gaul. Besides the
   above, they likewise deposed Protogenes, bishop of Sardica, and
   Gaudentius; [1248] the one because he favored Marcellus, although he
   had previously condemned him, and the other because he had adopted a
   different line of conduct from that of Cyriacus, his predecessor, and
   had supported many individuals then deposed by them. After issuing
   these sentences, they made known to the bishops of every region, that
   they were not to hold communion with those who were deposed, and that
   they were not to write to them, nor to receive letters from them. They
   likewise commanded them to believe what was said concerning God in the
   formulary which they subjoined to their letter, and in which no mention
   was made of the term "consubstantial," but in which, those were
   excommunicated who said there are three Gods, or that Christ is not
   God, or that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are the same, or
   that the Son is unbegotten, or that there was a time or an age in which
   He existed not. [1249]

   Chapter XII.--The Bishops of the Party of Julius and Hosius held
   another Session and deposed the Eastern High Priests, and also made a
   Formulary of Faith.

   The adherents of Hosius, [1250] in the meantime, assembled together,
   and declared them innocent: Athanasius, because unjust machinations had
   been carried on against him by those who had convened at Tyre; and
   Marcellus, because he did not hold the opinions with which he was
   charged; and Asclepas, because he had been re-established in his
   diocese by the vote of Eusebius Pamphilus and of many other judges;
   that this was true he proved by the records of the trial; and lastly,
   Lucius, because his accusers had fled. They wrote to the parishes of
   each of the acquitted, commanding them to receive and recognize their
   bishops. They stated that Gregory had not been nominated by them bishop
   of Alexandria; nor Basil, bishop of Ancyra; nor Quintianus, bishop of
   Gaza; and that they had not received these men into communion, and did
   not even account them Christians. They deposed from the episcopates,
   Theodore, bishop of Thrace; Narcissus, bishop of Irenopolis; Acacius,
   bishop of Cæsarea, in Palestine; Menophantus, bishop of Ephesus;
   Ursacius, bishop of Sigidunus in Moesia; Valens, bishop of Mursia in
   Pannonia; and George, bishop of Laodicea, although this latter had not
   attended the Synod with the Eastern bishops. They ejected the
   above-named individuals from the priesthood and from communion, because
   they separated the Son from the substance of the Father, and had
   received those who had been formerly deposed on account of their
   holding the Arian heresy, and had, moreover, promoted them to the
   highest offices in the service of God. After they had excided them for
   these perversions and decreed them to be aliens to the Catholic Church,
   they afterwards wrote to the bishops of every nation, [1251] commanding
   them to confirm these decrees, and to be of one mind on doctrinal
   subjects with themselves. They likewise compiled another document of
   faith, which was more copious than that of Nicæa, although the same
   thought was carefully preserved, and very little change was made in the
   words of that instrument. Hosius and Protogenes, who held the first
   rank among the Western bishops assembled at Sardica, fearing perhaps
   lest they should be suspected of making any innovations upon the
   doctrines of the Nicene council, wrote to Julius, [1252] and testified
   that they were firmly attached to these doctrines, but, pressed by the
   need of perspicuity, they had to expand the identical thought, in order
   that the Arians might not take advantage of the brevity of the
   document, to draw those who were unskilled in dialectics into some
   absurdity. When what I have related had been transacted by each party,
   the conference was dissolved, and the members returned to their
   respective homes. This Synod was held during the consulate of Rufinus
   and Eusebius, and about eleven years after the death of Constantine.
   [1253] There were about three hundred [1254] bishops of cities in the
   West, and upwards of seventy-six Eastern bishops, among whom was
   Ischyrion, who had been appointed bishop of Mareotis by the enemies of
   Athanasius.

   Chapter XIII.--After the Synod, the East and the West are separated;
   the West nobly adheres to the Faith of the Nicene Council, while the
   East is disturbed by Contention here and there over this Dogma.

   After this Synod, the Eastern and the Western churches ceased to
   maintain the intercourse which usually exists among people of the same
   faith, and refrained from holding communion with each other. [1255] The
   Christians of the West separated themselves from all as far as Thrace;
   those of the East as far as Illyria. This divided state of the churches
   was mixed, as might be supposed, with dissentient views and calumnies.
   Although they had previously differed on doctrinal subjects, yet the
   evil had attained no great height, for they had still held communion
   together and were wont to have kindred feelings. The Church throughout
   the whole of the West in its entirety regulated itself by the doctrines
   of the Fathers, and kept aloof from all contentions and hair-splitting
   about dogma. Although Auxentius, who had become bishop of Milan, and
   Valens and Ursacius, bishops of Pannonia, had endeavored to lead that
   part of the empire into the Arian doctrines, their efforts had been
   carefully anticipated by the president of the Roman see and the other
   priests, who cut out the seeds of such a troublesome heresy. As to the
   Eastern Church, although it had been racked by dissension since the
   time of the council of Antioch, and although it had already openly
   differed from the Nicæan form of belief, yet I think it is true that
   the opinion of the majority united in the same thought, and confessed
   the Son to be of the substance of the Father. There were some, however,
   who were fond of wrangling and battled against the term
   "consubstantial" for those who had been opposed to the word at the
   beginning, thought, as I infer, and as happens to most people, that it
   would be a disgrace to appear as conquered. Others were finally
   convinced of the truth of the doctrines concerning God, by the habit of
   frequent disputation on these themes, and ever afterwards continued
   firmly attached to them. Others again, being aware that contentions
   ought not to arise, inclined toward that which was gratifying to each
   of the sides, on account of the influence, either of friendship or they
   were swayed by the various causes which often induce men to embrace
   what they ought to reject, and to act without boldness, in
   circumstances which require thorough conviction. Many others,
   accounting it absurd to consume their time in altercations about words,
   quietly adopted the sentiments inculcated by the council of Nicæa.
   Paul, bishop of Constantinople, Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, the
   entire multitude of monks, Antony the Great, who still survived, his
   disciples, and a great number of Egyptians and of other places in the
   Roman territory, firmly and openly maintained the doctrines of the
   Nicæan council throughout the other regions of the East. As I have been
   led to allude to the monks, I shall briefly mention those who
   flourished during the reign of Constantius.

   Chapter XIV.--Of the Holy Men who flourished about this time in Egypt,
   namely, Antony, the Two Macariuses, Heraclius, Cronius, Paphnutius,
   Putubastus, Arsisius, Serapion, Piturion, Pachomius, Apollonius, Anuph,
   Hilarion, and a Register of many other Saints.

   I shall commence my recital [1256] with Egypt and the two men named
   Macarius, who were the celebrated chiefs of Scetis and of the
   neighboring mountain; the one was a native of Egypt, the other was
   called Politicus, because he was a citizen and was of Alexandrian
   origin. They were both so wonderfully endowed with Divine knowledge and
   philosophy, that the demons regarded them with terror, and they wrought
   many extraordinary works and miraculous cures. The Egyptian, the story
   says, restored a dead man to life, in order to convince a heretic of
   the truth of the resurrection from the dead. He lived about ninety
   years, sixty of which he passed in the deserts. When in his youth he
   commenced the study of philosophy, he progressed so rapidly, that the
   monks surnamed him "old child," and at the age of forty he was ordained
   presbyter. The other Macarius became a presbyter at a later period of
   his life; he was proficient in all the exercises of asceticism, some of
   which he devised himself, and what particulars he heard among other
   ascetics, he carried through to success in every form, so that by
   thoroughly drying up his skin, the hairs of his beard ceased to grow.
   Pambo, Heraclides, Cronius, Paphnutius, Putubastus, Arsisius, Serapion
   the Great, Piturion, who dwelt near Thebes, and Pachomius, the founder
   of the monks called the Tabennesians, flourished at the same place and
   period. The attire and government of this sect differed in some
   respects from those of other monks. Its members were, however, devoted
   to virtue, they contemned the things of earth, excited the soul to
   heavenly contemplation, and prepared it to quit the body with joy. They
   were clothed in skins in remembrance of Elias, it appears to me,
   because they thought that the virtue of the prophet would be thus
   always retained in their memory, and that they would be enabled, like
   him to resist manfully the seductions of amorous pleasures, to be
   influenced by similar zeal, and be incited to the practice of sobriety
   by the hope of an equal reward. It is said that the peculiar vestments
   of these Egyptian monks had reference to some secret connected with
   their philosophy, and did not differ from those of others without some
   adequate cause. They wore their tunics without sleeves, in order to
   teach that the hands ought not to be ready to do presumptuous evil.
   They wore a covering on their heads called a cowl, to show that they
   ought to live with the same innocence and purity as infants who are
   nourished with milk, and wear a covering of the same form. Their
   girdle, and a species of scarf, which they wear across the loins,
   shoulders, and arms, admonish them that they ought to be always ready
   in the service and work of God. I am aware that other reasons have been
   assigned for their peculiarity of attire, but what I have said appears
   to me to be sufficient. It is said that Pachomius at first practiced
   philosophy alone in a cave, but that a holy angel appeared to him, and
   commanded him to call together some young monks, and live with them,
   for he had succeeded well in pursuing philosophy by himself, and to
   train them by the laws which were about to be delivered to him, and now
   he was to possess and benefit many as a leader of communities. A tablet
   was then given to him, which is still carefully preserved. Upon this
   tablet were inscribed injunctions by which he was bound to permit every
   one to eat, to drink, to work, and to fast, according to his
   capabilities of so doing; those who ate heartily were to be subjected
   to arduous labor, and the ascetic were to have more easy tasks assigned
   them; he was commanded to have many cells erected, in each of which
   three monks were to dwell, who were to take their meals at a common
   refectory in silence, and to sit around the table with a veil thrown
   over the face, so that they might not be able to see each other or
   anything but the table and what was set before them; they were not to
   admit strangers to eat with them, with the exception of travelers, to
   whom they were to show hospitality; those who desired to live with
   them, were first to undergo a probation of three years, during which
   time the most laborious tasks were to be done, and, by this method they
   could share in their community. They were to clothe themselves in
   skins, and to wear woolen tiaras adorned with purple nails, and linen
   tunics and girdles. They were to sleep in their tunics and garments of
   skin, reclining on long chairs specially constructed by being closed on
   each side, so that it could hold the material of each couch. On the
   first and last days of the week they were to approach the altar for the
   communion in the holy mysteries, and were then to unloose their girdles
   and throw off their robes of skin. They were to pray twelve times every
   day and as often during the evening, and were to offer up the same
   number of prayers during the night. At the ninth hour they were to pray
   thrice, and when about to partake of food they were to sing a psalm
   before each prayer. The whole community was to be divided into
   twenty-four classes, each of which was to be distinguished by one of
   the letters of the Greek alphabet, and so that each might have a
   cognomen fitting to the grade of its conduct and habit. Thus the name
   of Iota was given to the more simple, and that of Zeta or of Xi to the
   crooked, and the names of the other letters were chosen according as
   the purpose of the order most fittingly answered the form of the
   letter.

   These were the laws [1257] by which Pachomius ruled his own disciples.
   He was a man who loved men and was beloved of God, so that he could
   foreknow future events, and was frequently admitted to intercourse with
   the holy angels. He resided at Tabenna, in Thebaïs, and hence the name
   Tabennesians, which still continues. By adopting these rules for their
   government, they became very renowned, and in process of time increased
   so vastly, that they reached to the number of seven thousand men. But
   the community on the island of Tabenna with which Pachomius lived,
   consisted of about thirteen hundred; the others resided in the Thebaïs
   and the rest of Egypt. They all observed one and the same rule of life,
   and possessed everything in common. They regarded the community
   established in the island of Tabenna as their mother, and the rulers of
   it as their fathers and their princes.

   About the same period, Apollonius became celebrated by his profession
   of monastic philosophy. It is said that from the age of fifteen he
   devoted himself to philosophy in the deserts, and that when he attained
   the age of forty, he went according to a Divine command he then
   received, to dwell in regions inhabited by men. He had likewise a
   community in the Thebaïs. He was greatly beloved of God, and was
   endowed with the power of performing miraculous cures and notable
   works. He was exact in the observance of duty, and instructed others in
   philosophy with great goodness and kindness. He was acceptable to such
   a degree in his prayers, that nothing of what he asked from God was
   denied him, but he was so wise that he always proffered prudent
   requests and such as the Divine Being is ever ready to grant.

   I believe that Anuph the divine, lived about this period. I have been
   informed that from the time of the persecution, when he first avowed
   his attachment to Christianity, he never uttered a falsehood, nor
   desired the things of earth. All his prayers and supplications to God
   were duly answered, and he was instructed by a holy angel in every
   virtue. Let, however, what we have said of the Egyptian monks suffice.

   The same species of philosophy was about this time cultivated in
   Palestine, after being learned in Egypt, and Hilarion the divine then
   acquired great celebrity. He was a native of Thabatha, [1258] a village
   situated near the town of Gaza, towards the south, and hard by a
   torrent which falls into the sea, and received the same name as the
   village, from the people of that country. When he was studying grammar
   at Alexandria, he went out into the desert to see the monk Antony the
   Great, and in his company he learned to adopt a like philosophy. After
   spending a short time there, he returned to his own country, because he
   was not allowed to be as quiet as he wished, on account of the
   multitudes who flocked around Antony. On finding his parents dead, he
   distributed his patrimony among his brethren and the poor, and without
   reserving anything whatever for himself, he went to dwell in a desert
   situated near the sea, and about twenty stadia from his native village.
   His cell residence was a very little house, and was constructed of
   bricks, chips and broken tiles, and was of such a breadth, height, and
   length that no one could stand in it without bending the head, or lie
   down in it without drawing up the feet; for in everything he strove to
   accustom himself to hardship and to the subjugation of luxurious ease.
   To none of those we have known did he yield in the high reach of his
   unboastful and approved temperance. He contended against hunger and
   thirst, cold and heat, and other afflictions of the body and of the
   soul. He was earnest in conduct, grave in discourse, and with a good
   memory and accurate attainment in Sacred Writ. He was so beloved by
   God, that even now many afflicted and possessed people are healed at
   his tomb. It is remarkable that he was first interred in the island of
   Cyprus, but that his remains are now deposited in Palestine; for it so
   happened, that he died during his residence in Cyprus, and was buried
   by the inhabitants with great honor and respect. But Hesychas, one of
   the most renowned of his disciples, stole the body, conveyed it to
   Palestine, and interred it in his own monastery. From that period, the
   inhabitants conducted a public and brilliant festival yearly; for it is
   the custom in Palestine to bestow this honor on those among them, who
   have attained renown by their goodness, such as Aurelius, Anthedonius,
   Alexion, a native of Bethagathon, and Alaphion, a native of Asalea,
   who, during the reign of Constantius, lived religiously and
   courageously in the practice of philosophy, and by their personal
   virtues they caused a considerable increase to the faith among the
   cities and villages that were still under the pagan superstition.

   About the same period, Julian practiced philosophy near Edessa; he
   attempted a very severe and incorporeal method of life so that he
   seemed to consist of bones and skin without flesh. The setting forth of
   the history is due to Ephraim, the Syrian writer, who wrote the story
   of Julian's life. God himself confirmed the high opinion which men had
   formed of him; for He bestowed on him the power of expelling demons and
   of healing all kinds of diseases, without having recourse to drugs, but
   simply by prayer.

   Besides the above, many other ecclesiastical philosophers flourished in
   the territories of Edessa and Amida, and about the mountain called
   Gaugalius; among these were Daniel and Simeon. But I shall now say
   nothing further of the Syrian monks; I shall further on, if God will,
   describe them more fully. [1259]

   It is said that Eustathius, [1260] who governed the church of Sebaste
   in Armenia, founded a society of monks in Armenia, Paphlagonia, and
   Pontus, and became the author of a zealous discipline, both as to what
   meats were to be partaken of or to be avoided, what garments were to be
   worn, and what customs and exact course of conduct were to be adopted.
   Some assert that he was the author of the ascetic treatises commonly
   attributed to Basil of Cappadocia. It is said that his great exactness
   led him into certain extravagances which were altogether contrary to
   the laws of the Church. Many persons, however, justify him from this
   accusation, and throw the blame upon some of his disciples, who
   condemned marriage, refused to pray to God in the houses of married
   persons, despised married presbyters, fasted on Lord's days, held their
   assemblies in private houses, denounced the rich as altogether without
   part in the kingdom of God, contemned those who partook of animal food.
   They did not retain the customary tunics and stoles for their dress,
   but used a strange and unwonted garb, and made many other innovations.
   Many women were deluded by them, and left their husbands; but, not
   being able to practice continence, they fell into adultery. Other
   women, under the pretext of religion, cut off their hair, and behaved
   otherwise than is fitting to a woman, by arraying themselves in men's
   apparel. The bishops of the neighborhood of Gangroe, the metropolis of
   Paphlagonia, assembled themselves together, and declared that all those
   who imbibed these opinions should be aliens to the Catholic Church,
   unless, according to the definitions of the Synod, they would renounce
   each of the aforesaid customs. It is said that from that time,
   Eustathius exchanged his clothing for the stole, and made his journeys
   habited like other priests, thus proving that he had not introduced and
   practiced these novelties out of self-will, but for the sake of a godly
   asceticism. He was as renowned for his discourses as for the purity of
   his life. To confess the truth, he was not eloquent, nor had he ever
   studied the art of eloquence; yet he had admirable sense and a high
   capacity of persuasion, so that he induced several men and women, who
   were living in fornication, to enter upon a temperate and earnest
   course of life. It is related that a certain man and woman, who,
   according to the custom of the Church, had devoted themselves to a life
   of virginity, were accused of cohabiting together. He strove to make
   them cease from their intercourse; finding that his remonstrances
   produced no effect upon them, he sighed deeply, and said, that a woman
   who had been legally married had, on one occasion, heard him discourse
   on the advantage of continence, and was thereby so deeply affected that
   she voluntarily abstained from legitimate intercourse with her own
   husband, and that the weakness of his powers of conviction was, on the
   other hand, attested by the fact, that the parties above mentioned
   persisted in their illegal course. Such were the men who originated the
   practice of monastic discipline in the regions above mentioned.

   Although the Thracians, the Illyrians, and the other European nations
   were still inexperienced in monastic communities, yet they were not
   altogether lacking in men devoted to philosophy. Of these, Martin,
   [1261] the descendant of a noble family of Saboria in Pannonia, was the
   most illustrious. He was originally a noted warrior, and the commander
   of armies; but, accounting the service of God to be a more honorable
   profession, he embraced a life of philosophy, and lived, in the first
   place, in Illyria. Here he zealously defended the orthodox doctrines
   against the attacks of the Arian bishops, and after being plotted
   against and frequently beaten by the people, he was driven from the
   country. He then went to Milan, and dwelt alone. He was soon, however,
   obliged to quit his place of retreat on account of the machinations of
   Auxentius, bishop of that region, who did not hold soundly to the
   Nicene faith; and he went to an island called Gallenaria, where he
   remained for some time, satisfying himself with roots of plants.
   Gallenaria is a small and uninhabited island lying in the Tyrrhenian
   Sea. Martin was afterwards appointed bishop of the church of Tarracinæ
   (Tours). He was so richly endowed with miraculous gifts that he
   restored a dead man to life, and performed other signs as wonderful as
   those wrought by the apostles. We have heard that Hilary, a man divine
   in his life and conversation, lived about the same time, and in the
   same country; like Martin, he was obliged to flee from his place of
   abode, on account of his zeal in defense of the faith.

   I have now related what I have been able to ascertain concerning the
   individuals who practiced philosophy in piety and ecclesiastical rites.
   There were many others who were noted in the churches about the same
   period on account of their great eloquence, and among these the most
   distinguished were, Eusebius, who administered the priestly office at
   Emesa; Titus, bishop of Bostra; Serapion, bishop of Thmuis; Basil,
   bishop of Ancyra; Eudoxius, bishop of Germanicia; Acacius, bishop of
   Cæsarea; and Cyril, who controlled the see of Jerusalem. A proof of
   their education is in the books they have written and left behind, and
   the many things worthy of record.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XV.--Didymus the Blind, and Aëtius the Heretic.

   Didymus, [1262] an ecclesiastical writer and president of the school of
   sacred learning in Alexandria, flourished about the same period. He was
   acquainted with every branch of science, and was conversant with poetry
   and rhetoric, with astronomy and geometry, with arithmetic, and with
   the various theories of philosophy. He had acquired all this knowledge
   by the efforts of his own mind, aided by the sense of hearing, for he
   became blind during his first attempt at learning the rudiments. When
   he had advanced to youth, he manifested an ardent desire to acquire
   speech and training, and for this purpose he frequented the teachers of
   these branches, but learned by hearing only, where he made such rapid
   progress that he speedily comprehended the difficult theorems in
   mathematics. It is said that he learned the letters of the alphabet by
   means of tablets in which they were engraved, and which he felt with
   his fingers; and that he made himself acquainted with syllables and
   words by the force of attention and memory, and by listening
   attentively to the sounds. His was a very extraordinary case, and many
   persons resorted to Alexandria for the express purpose of hearing, or,
   at least, of seeing him. His firmness in defending the doctrines of the
   Nicæan council was extremely displeasing to the Arians. He easily
   carried conviction to the minds of his audience by persuasion rather
   than by power of reasoning, and he constituted each one a judge of the
   ambiguous points. He was much sought after by the members of the
   Catholic Church, and was praised by the orders of monks in Egypt, and
   by Antony the Great.

   It is related that when Antony left the desert and repaired to
   Alexandria to give his testimony in favor of the doctrines of
   Athanasius, he said to Didymus, "It is not a severe thing, nor does it
   deserve to be grieved over, O Didymus, that you are deprived of the
   organs of sight which are possessed by rats, mice, and the lowest
   animals; but it is a great blessing to possess eyes like angels,
   whereby you can contemplate keenly the Divine Being, and see accurately
   the true knowledge." In Italy and its territories, Eusebius and Hilary,
   whom I have already mentioned, were conspicuous for strength in the use
   of their native tongue, whose treatises [1263] concerning the faith and
   against the heterodox, they say, were approvingly circulated. Lucifer,
   as the story goes, was the founder of a heresy which bears his name,
   [1264] and flourished at this period. Aëtius [1265] was likewise held
   in high estimation among the heterodox; he was a dialectician, apt in
   syllogism and proficient in disputation, and a diligent student of such
   forms, but without art. He reasoned so boldly concerning the nature of
   God, that many persons gave him the name of "Atheist." It is said that
   he was originally a physician of Antioch in Syria, and that, as he
   frequently attended meetings of the churches, and thought over the
   Sacred Scriptures, he became acquainted with Gallus, who was then
   Cæsar, and who honored religion much and cherished its professors. It
   seems likely that, as Aëtius obtained the esteem of Cæsar by means of
   these disputations, he devoted himself the more assiduously to these
   pursuits, in order to progress in the favor of the emperor. It is said
   that he was versed in the philosophy of Aristotle, and frequented the
   schools in which it was taught at Alexandria.

   Besides the individuals above specified, there were many others in the
   churches who were capable of instructing the people and of reasoning
   concerning the doctrines of the Holy Scriptures. It would be too great
   a task to attempt to name them all. Let it not be accounted strange, if
   I have bestowed commendations upon the leaders or enthusiasts of the
   above-mentioned heresies. I admire their eloquence, and their
   impressiveness in discourse. I leave their doctrines to be judged by
   those whose right it is. For I have not been set forth to record such
   matters, nor is it befitting in history; I have only to give an account
   of events as they happened, not supplementing my own additions. Of
   those who at that time became most distinguished in education and
   discourse and who used the Roman and Greek languages, I have enumerated
   in the above narrative as many as I have received an account of.

   Chapter XVI.--Concerning St. Ephraim.

   Ephraim the Syrian [1266] was entitled to the highest honors, and was
   the greatest ornament of the Catholic Church. He was a native of
   Nisibis, or his family was of the neighboring territory. He devoted his
   life to monastic philosophy; and although he received no instruction,
   he became, contrary to all expectation, so proficient in the learning
   and language of the Syrians, that he comprehended with ease the most
   abstruse theorems of philosophy. His style of writing was so replete
   with splendid oratory and with richness and temperateness of thought
   that he surpassed the most approved writers of Greece. If the works of
   these writers were to be translated into Syriac, or any other language,
   and divested, as it were, of the beauties of the Greek language, they
   would retain little of their original elegance and value. The
   productions of Ephraim have not this disadvantage: they were translated
   into Greek during his life, and translations are even now being made,
   and yet they preserve much of their original force, so that his works
   are not less admired when read in Greek than when read in Syriac.
   Basil, who was subsequently bishop of the metropolis of Cappadocia, was
   a great admirer of Ephraim, and was astonished at his erudition. The
   opinion of Basil, who is universally confessed to have been the most
   eloquent man of his age, is a stronger testimony, I think, to the merit
   of Ephraim, than anything that could be indited to his praise. It is
   said that he wrote three hundred thousand verses, and that he had many
   disciples who were zealously attached to his doctrines. The most
   celebrated of his disciples were Abbas, Zenobius, Abraham, Maras, and
   Simeon, in whom the Syrians and whoever among them pursued accurate
   learning make a great boast. Paulanas and Aranad are praised for their
   finished speech, although reported to have deviated from sound
   doctrine.

   I am not ignorant that there were some very learned men who formerly
   flourished in Osroëne, as, for instance, Bardasanes, who devised a
   heresy designated by his name, [1267] and Harmonius, his son. It is
   related that this latter was deeply versed in Grecian erudition, and
   was the first to subdue his native tongue to meters and musical laws;
   these verses he delivered to the choirs, and even now the Syrians
   frequently sing, not the precise copies by Harmonius, but the same
   melodies. For as Harmonius was not altogether free from the errors of
   his father, and entertained various opinions concerning the soul, the
   generation and destruction of the body, and the regeneration which are
   taught by the Greek philosophers, he introduced some of these
   sentiments into the lyrical songs which he composed. When Ephraim
   perceived that the Syrians were charmed with the elegance of the
   diction and the rhythm of the melody, he became apprehensive, lest they
   should imbibe the same opinions; and therefore, although he was
   ignorant of Grecian learning, he applied himself to the understanding
   of the metres of Harmonius, and composed similar poems in accordance
   with the doctrines of the Church, and wrought also in sacred hymns and
   in the praises of passionless men. From that period the Syrians sang
   the odes of Ephraim according to the law of the ode established by
   Harmonius. The execution of this work is alone sufficient to attest the
   natural endowments of Ephraim. He was as celebrated for the good
   actions he performed as for the rigid course of discipline he pursued.
   He was particularly fond of tranquillity. He was so serious and so
   careful to avoid giving occasion to calumny, that he refrained from the
   very sight of women. It is related that a female of careless life, who
   was either desirous of tempting him, or who had been bribed for the
   purpose, contrived on one occasion to meet him face to face, and fixed
   her eyes intently upon him; he rebuked her, and commanded her to look
   down upon the ground, "Wherefore should I obey your injunction,"
   replied the woman; "for I was born not of the earth, but of you? It
   would be more just if you were to look down upon the earth whence you
   sprang, while I look upon you, as I was born of you." Ephraim,
   astonished at the little woman, recorded the whole transaction in a
   book, which most Syrians regard as one of the best of his productions.
   It is also said of him, that, although he was naturally prone to
   passion, he never exhibited angry feeling toward any one from the
   period of his embracing a monastic life. It once happened that after he
   had, according to custom, been fasting several days, his attendant, in
   presenting some food to him, let fall the dish on which it was placed.
   Ephraim, perceiving that he was overwhelmed with shame and terror, said
   to him, "Take courage; we will go to the food as the food does not come
   to us" and he immediately seated himself beside the fragments of the
   dish, and ate his supper. What I am about to relate will suffice to
   show that he was totally exempt from the love of vainglory. He was
   appointed bishop of some town, and attempts were made to convey him
   away for the purpose of ordaining him. As soon as he became aware of
   what was intended, he ran to the market-place, and showed himself as a
   madman by stepping in a disorderly way, dragging his clothes along, and
   eating in public. Those who had come to carry him away to be their
   bishop, on seeing him in this state, believed that he was out of his
   mind, and departed; and he, meeting with an opportunity for effecting
   his escape, remained in concealment until another had been ordained in
   his place. What I have now said concerning Ephraim must suffice,
   although his own countrymen relate many other anecdotes of him. Yet his
   conduct on one occasion, shortly before his death, appears to me so
   worthy of remembrance that I shall record it here. The city of Edessa
   being severely visited by famine, he quitted the solitary ceil in which
   he pursued philosophy, and rebuked the rich for permitting the poor to
   die around them, instead of imparting to them of their superfluities;
   and he represented to them by his philosophy, that the wealth which
   they were treasuring up so carefully would turn to their own
   condemnation, and to the ruin of the soul, which is of more value than
   all riches, and the body itself and all other values, and he proved
   that they were putting no estimate upon their souls, because of their
   actions. The rich men, revering the man and his words, replied, "We are
   not intent upon hoarding our wealth, but we know of no one to whom we
   can confide the distribution of our goods, for all are prone to seek
   after lucre, and to betray the trust placed in them." "What think you
   of me?" asked Ephraim. On their admitting that they considered him an
   efficient, excellent, and good man, and worthy, and that he was exactly
   what his reputation confirmed, he offered to undertake the distribution
   of their alms. As soon as he received their money, he had about three
   hundred beds fitted up in the public porches; and here he tended those
   who were ill and suffering from the effects of the famine, whether they
   were foreigners or natives of the surrounding country. On the cessation
   of the famine he returned to the cell in which he had previously dwelt;
   and, after the lapse of a few days, he expired. He attained no higher
   clerical degree than that of deacon, although he became no less famous
   for his virtue than those who are ordained to the priesthood and are
   admired for the conversation of a good life and for learning. I have
   now given some account of the virtue of Ephraim. It would require a
   more experienced hand than mine, to furnish a full description of his
   character and that of the other illustrious men who, about the same
   period, had devoted themselves to a life and career of philosophy; and
   for some things, it would require such a writer as he himself was. The
   attempt is beyond my powers by reason of weakness of language, and
   ignorance of the men themselves and their exploits. Some of them
   concealed themselves in the deserts. Others, who lived in the
   intercourse of cities, strove to preserve a mean appearance, and to
   seem as if they differed in no respect from the multitude, working out
   their virtue, concealing a true estimate of themselves, that they might
   avoid the praises of others. For as they were intent upon the exchange
   of future benefits, they made God alone the witness of their thoughts,
   and had no concern for outward glory.

   Chapter XVII.--Transactions of that Period, and Progress of Christian
   Doctrine through the Joint Efforts of Emperors and Arch-Priests.

   Those who presided over the churches at this period were noted for
   personal conduct, and, as might be expected, the people whom they
   governed were earnestly attached to the worship of Christ. [1268]
   Religion daily progressed, by the zeal, virtue, and wonderful works of
   the priests, and of the ecclesiastical philosophers, who attracted the
   attention of the pagans, and led them to renounce their superstitions.
   The emperors who then occupied the throne were as zealous as was their
   father in protecting the churches, and they granted honors and tax
   exemptions to the clergy, their children, and their slaves. They
   confirmed the laws enacted by their father, and enforced new ones
   prohibiting the offering of sacrifice, the worship of images, or any
   other pagan observance. They commanded that all temples, whether in
   cities or in the country, should be closed. Some of these temples were
   presented to the churches, when either the ground they stood on or the
   materials for building were required. The greatest possible care was
   bestowed upon the houses of prayer, those which had been defaced by
   time were repaired, and others were erected from the foundations in a
   style of extraordinary magnificence. The church of Emesa is one most
   worthy to see and famous for its beauty. The Jews were strictly
   forbidden to purchase a slave belonging to any other heresy than their
   own. If they transgressed this law, the slave was confiscated [1269] to
   the public; but if they administered to him the Jewish rite of
   circumcision, the penalties were death and total confiscation of
   property. For, as the emperors were desirous of promoting by every
   means the spread of Christianity, they deemed it necessary to prevent
   the Jews from proselyting those whose ancestors were of another
   religion, and those who were holding the hope of professing
   Christianity were carefully reserved for the Church; for it was from
   the pagan multitudes that the Christian religion increased.

   the law itself is extant in Cod. Theod. xvi. 91, 2, and is entitled Ne
   Christianum Mancipium Judæus habeat. The second law begins: Si aliquis
   Judæorum, mancipium sectæ alterius seu nationis crediderit comparandum,
   mancipium fisco protenus vindicetur.

   Chapter XVIII.--Concerning the Doctrines held by the Sons of
   Constantine. Distinction between the Terms "Homoousios" and
   "Homoiousios." Whence it came that Constantius quickly abandoned the
   Correct Faith.

   The emperors [1270] had, from the beginning, preserved their father's
   view about doctrine; for they both favored the Nicene form of belief.
   Constans maintained these opinions till his death; Constantius held a
   similar view for some time; he, however, renounced his former
   sentiments when the term "consubstantial" was calumniated, yet he did
   not altogether refrain from confessing that the Son is of like
   substance with the Father. The followers of Eusebius, and other bishops
   of the East, who were admired for their speech and life, made a
   distinction, as we know, between the term "consubstantial" (homoousios)
   and the expression "of like substance," which latter they designated by
   the term, "homoiousios." They say that the term "consubstantial"
   (homoousios) properly belongs to corporeal beings, such as men and
   other animals, trees and plants, whose participation and origin is in
   like things; but that the term "homoiousios" appertains exclusively to
   incorporeal beings, such as God and the angels, of each one of whom a
   conception is formed according to his own peculiar substance. The
   Emperor Constantius was deceived by this distinction; and although I am
   certain that he retained the same doctrines as those held by his father
   and brother, yet he adopted a change of phraseology, and, instead of
   using the term "homoousios," made use of the term "homoiousios." The
   teachers to whom we have alluded maintained that it was necessary to be
   thus precise in the use of terms, and that otherwise we should be in
   danger of conceiving that to be a body which is incorporeal. Many,
   however, regard this distinction as an absurdity, "for," say they, "the
   things which are conceived by the mind can be designated only by names
   derived from things which are seen; and there is no danger in the use
   of words, provided that there be no error about the idea.

   Chapter XIX.--Further Particulars concerning the Term "Consubstantial."
   Council of Ariminum, the Manner, Source, and Reason of its Convention.

   It is not surprising that the Emperor Constantius was induced to adopt
   the use of the term "homoiousios," for it was admitted by many priests
   who conformed to the doctrines of the Nicæan council. [1271] Many use
   the two words indifferently, to convey the same meaning. Hence, it
   appears to me, that the Arians departed greatly from the truth when
   they affirmed that, after the council of Nicæa, many of the priests,
   among whom were Eusebius and Theognis, refused to admit that the Son is
   consubstantial with the Father, and that Constantine was in consequence
   so indignant, that he condemned them to banishment. They say that it
   was afterwards revealed to his sister by a dream or a vision from God,
   that these bishops held orthodox doctrines and had suffered unjustly;
   and that the emperor thereupon recalled them, and demanded of them
   wherefore they had departed from the Nicene doctrines, since they had
   been participants in the document concerning the faith which had been
   there framed; and that they urged in reply that they had not assented
   to those doctrines from conviction, but from the fear that, if the
   disputes then existing were prolonged, the emperor, who was then just
   beginning to embrace Christianity, and who was yet unbaptized, might be
   impelled to return to Paganism, as seemed likely, and to persecute the
   Church. They assert that Constantine was pleased with this defense, and
   determined upon convening another council; but that, being prevented by
   death from carrying his scheme into execution, the task devolved upon
   his eldest son, Constantius, to whom he represented that it would avail
   him nothing to be possessed of imperial power, unless he could
   establish uniformity of worship throughout his empire; and Constantius
   they say, at the instigation of his father, convened a council at
   Ariminum. [1272] This story is easily seen to be a gross fabrication,
   for the council was convened during the consulate of Hypatius and
   Eusebius, and twenty-two years after Constantius had, on the death of
   his father, succeeded to the empire. Now, during this interval of
   twenty-two years, many councils were held, in which debates were
   carried on concerning the terms "homoousios" and "homoiousios." No one,
   it appears, ventured to deny that the Son is of like substance [1273]
   with the Father, until Aëtius, by starting a contrary opinion, so
   offended the emperor that, in order to arrest the course of the heresy,
   he commanded the priests to assemble themselves together at Ariminum
   and at Seleucia. Thus the true cause of this council being convened was
   not the command of Constantine, [1274] but the question agitated by
   Aëtius. And this will become still more apparent by what we shall
   hereafter relate.

   Chapter XX.--Athanasius again reinstated by the Letter of Constantius,
   and receives his See. The Arch-Priests of Antioch. Question put by
   Constantius to Athanasius. The Praise of God in Hymns.

   When Constans was apprised of what had been enacted at Sardica, he
   wrote [1275] to his brother to request him to restore the followers of
   Athanasius and Paul to their own churches. As Constantius seemed to
   hesitate, he wrote again, and threatened him with war, unless he would
   consent to receive the bishops. Constantius, after conferring on the
   subject with the bishops of the East, judged that it would be foolish
   to excite on this account the horrors of civil war. He therefore
   recalled Athanasius from Italy, and sent public carriages to convey him
   on his return homewards, and wrote several letters requesting his
   speedy return. Athanasius, who was then residing at Aquilea, on
   receiving the letters of Constantius, repaired to Rome to take leave of
   Julius and his friends. Julius parted from him with great
   demonstrations of friendship, and gave him a letter addressed to the
   clergy and people of Alexandria, in which he spoke of him as a
   wonderful man, deserving of renown by the numerous trials he had
   undergone, and congratulated the church of Alexandria on the return of
   so good a priest, and exhorted them to follow his doctrines.

   He then proceeded to Antioch in Syria, where the emperor was then
   residing. Leontius presided over the churches of that region; for after
   the flight of Eustathius, those who held heretical sentiments had
   seized the see of Antioch. The first bishop they appointed was
   Euphronius; to him succeeded Placetus; and afterwards Stephen. This
   latter was deposed as being unworthy of the dignity, and Leontius
   obtained the bishopric. Athanasius avoided him as a heretic, and
   communed with those who were called Eustathians, who assembled in a
   private house. Since he found that Constantius was well disposed, and
   agreeable, and it looked as if the emperor would restore his own church
   to him, Constantius, at the instigation of the leaders of the opposing
   heresy, replied as follows: "I am ready to perform all that I promised
   when I recalled you; but it is just that you should in return grant me
   a favor, and that is, that you yield one of the numerous churches which
   are under your sway to those who are averse to holding communion with
   you." Athanasius replied: "O emperor, it is exceedingly just and
   necessary to obey your commands, and I will not gainsay, but as in the
   city of Antioch there are many who eschew communion between the
   heterodox and ourselves, I seek a like favor that one church may be
   conceded to us, and that we may assemble there in safety." As the
   request of Athanasius appeared reasonable to the emperor, the heterodox
   deemed it more politic to keep quiet; for they reflected that their
   peculiar opinions could never gain any ground in Alexandria, on account
   of Athanasius, who was able both to retain those who held the same
   sentiments as himself, and lead those of contrary opinions; and that,
   moreover if they gave up one of the churches of Antioch, the
   Eustathians, who were very numerous, would assemble together, and then
   probably attempt innovations, since it would be possible for them
   without risk to retain those whom they held. Besides, the heterodox
   perceived that, although the government of the churches was in their
   hands, all the clergy and people did not conform to their doctrines.
   [1276] When they sang hymns to God, they were, according to custom,
   divided into choirs, and, at the end of the odes, each one declared
   what were his own peculiar sentiments. Some offered praise to "the
   Father and the Son," regarding them as co-equal in glory; others
   glorified "The Father by the Son," to denote by the insertion of the
   preposition that they considered the Son to be inferior to the Father.
   While these occurrences took place, Leontius, the bishop of the
   opposite faction, who then presided over the see of Antioch, did not
   dare to prohibit the singing of hymns to God which were in accordance
   with the tradition of the Nicæan Synod, for he feared to excite an
   insurrection of the people. It is related, however, that he once raised
   his hand to his head, the hairs of which were quite white, and said,
   "When this snow is dissolved, there will be plenty of mud." By this he
   intended to signify that, after his death, the different modes of
   singing hymns would give rise to great seditions, and that his
   successors would not show the same consideration to the people which he
   had manifested.

   Chapter XXI.--Letter of Constantius to the Egyptians in behalf of
   Athanasius. Synod of Jerusalem.

   The emperor, on sending back [1277] Athanasius to Egypt, wrote in his
   favor to the bishops and presbyters of that country, and to the people
   of the church of Alexandria; he testified to the integrity of his
   conduct and the virtue of his manners, and exhorted them to be of one
   mind, and to unite in prayer and service to God under his guidance. He
   added that, if any evil-disposed persons should excite disturbances,
   they should receive the punishment awarded by the laws for such
   offenses. He also commanded that the former decrees he had enacted
   against Athanasius, and those who were in communion with him, should be
   effaced from the public registers, and that his clergy should be
   admitted to the same exemptions they had previously enjoyed; and edicts
   to this effect were dispatched to the governors of Egypt and Libya.

   Immediately on his arrival in Egypt, Athanasius displaced those whom he
   knew to be attached to Arianism, and placed the government of the
   Church and the confession of the Nicæan council in the hands of those
   whom he approved, and he exhorted them to hold to this with
   earnestness. It was said at that time, that, when he was traveling
   through other countries, he effected the same change, if he happened to
   visit churches which were under the Arians. He was certainly accused of
   having dared to perform the ceremony of ordination in cities where he
   had no right to do so. But because he had effected his return, although
   his enemies were unwilling, and it did not seem that he could be easily
   cast under suspicion, in that he was honored with the friendship of the
   Emperor Constans, he was regarded with greater consideration than
   before. Many bishops, who had previously been at enmity with him,
   received him into communion, particularly those of Palestine. When he
   at that time visited these latter, they received him kindly. They held
   a Synod at Jerusalem, and Maximus and the others wrote the following
   letter in his favor.

   Chapter XXII.--Epistle written by the Synod of Jerusalem in Favor of
   Athanasius.

   "The holy Synod assembled at Jerusalem, to the presbyters, deacons, and
   people of Egypt, Libya, and Alexandria, our beloved and most cherished
   brethren, greeting in the Lord. [1278]

   "We can never, O beloved, return adequate thanks to God, the Creator of
   all things, for the wonderful works he has now accomplished,
   particularly for the blessings He has conferred on your churches by the
   restoration of Athanasius, your shepherd and lord, and our
   fellow-minister. Who could have hoped to have ever seen this with his
   eyes, which now you are realizing in deed? But truly your prayers have
   been heard by the God of the universe who is concerned for His Church,
   and who has regarded your tears and complaint, and on this account has
   heard your requests. For you were scattered abroad and rent like sheep
   without a pastor. Therefore, the true Shepherd, who from heaven watched
   over you, and who is concerned for His own sheep, has restored to you
   him whom you desired. Behold, we do all things for the peace of the
   Church, and are influenced by love like yours. Therefore we received
   and embraced your pastor, and, having held communion with you through
   him, we dispatch this address and our eucharistic prayers that you may
   know how we are united by the bond of love to him and you. It is right
   that you should pray for the piety of the emperors most beloved of God,
   who having recognized your desire about him and his purity determined
   to restore him to you with every honor. Receive him, then, with
   uplifted hands, and be zealous to send aloft the requisite eucharistic
   prayers in his behalf to the God who has conferred these benefits upon
   you; and may you ever rejoice with God, and glorify the Lord in Christ
   Jesus our Lord, by whom be glory to the Father throughout all ages.
   Amen."

   Chapter XXIII.--Valens and Ursacius, who belonged to the Arian Faction,
   confess to the Bishop of Rome that they had made False Charges against
   Athanasius.

   Such was the letter written by the Synod convened in Palestine. Some
   time after Athanasius had the satisfaction of seeing the injustice of
   the sentence enacted against him by the council of Tyre publicly
   recognized. [1279] Valens and Ursacius, who had been sent with Theognis
   and his followers to obtain information in Mareotis, as we before
   mentioned, concerning the holy cup which Ischyrion had accused
   Athanasius of having broken, wrote the following retraction to Julius,
   bishop of Rome:--

   "Ursacius and Valens, to the most blessed Lord Pope Julius.

   "Since we previously, as is well known, made many various charges
   against Athanasius, the bishop, by our letters, and although we have
   been urged persistently by the epistles of your excellency in this
   matter which we publicly alleged and have not been able to give a
   reason for our accusation, therefore, we now confess to your excellency
   in the presence of all the presbyters, our brethren, that all that you
   have heard concerning the aforesaid Athanasius is utterly false and
   fictitious, and in every way foreign to his nature. For this reason, we
   joyfully enter into communion with him, particularly as your piety in
   accordance with your implanted love of goodness has granted forgiveness
   to us for our error. Moreover, we declare unto you that if the bishops
   of the East, or even Athanasius himself, should at any time malignantly
   summon us to judgment, we would not sever ourselves from your judgment
   and disposition about the case. We now and ever shall anathematize, as
   we formerly did in the memorial which we presented at Milan, the
   heretic Arius and his followers, who say that there was a time, in
   which the Son existed not, and that Christ is from that which had no
   existence, and who deny that Christ was God and the Son of God before
   all ages. We again protest, in our own handwriting, that we shall ever
   condemn the aforesaid Arian heresy, and its originators.

   "I, Ursacius, sign this confession with my own signature. In like
   manner also Valens."

   This was the confession which they sent to Julius. It is also necessary
   to append to it their letter to Athanasius: it is as follows:--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XXIV.--Letter of Conciliation from Valens and Ursacius to the
   Great Athanasius. Restoration of the Other Eastern Bishops to their own
   Sees. Ejection of Macedonius again; and Accession of Paul to the See.

   "The bishops, Ursacius and Valens, to Athanasius, our brother in the
   Lord. [1280]

   "We take the opportunity of the departure of Museus, our brother and
   fellow-presbyter, who is going to your esteemed self, O beloved
   brother, to send you amplest greeting from Aquileia through him, and
   hope that our letter will find you in good health. You will afford us
   great encouragement if you will write us a reply to this letter. Know
   that we are at peace and in ecclesiastical communion with you."

   Athanasius therefore returned under such circumstances from the West to
   Egypt. Paul, Marcellus, Asclepas, and Lucius, whom the edict of the
   emperor had returned from exile, received their own sees. Immediately
   on the return of Paul to Constantinople Macedonius retired, and held
   church in private. There was a great tumult at Ancyra on the deposition
   of Basil from the church there, and the reinstallation of Marcellus.
   The other bishops were reinstated in their churches without difficulty.

   Book IV.

   Chapter I.--Death of Constans Cæsar. Occurrences which took place in
   Rome.

   Four years after the council of Sardica, [1282] Constans was killed in
   Western Gaul. [1283] Magnentius, who had plotted his murder, reduced
   the entire government of Constans under his own sway. In the meantime
   Vetranio was proclaimed emperor at Sirmium, by the Illyrian troops.
   Nepotian, the son of the late emperor's sister, gathered about him a
   body of gladiators, and wrangled for the imperial power, and ancient
   Rome had the greatest share of these evils. Nepotian, however, was put
   to death by the soldiers of Magnentius. [1284] Constantius, finding
   himself the sole master of the empire, was proclaimed sole ruler, and
   hastened to depose the tyrants. In the meantime, Athanasius, having
   arrived in Alexandria, prepared to convene a Synod of the Egyptian
   bishops, and had the enactments confirmed which had been passed at
   Sardica, and in Palestine, in his favor.

   Chapter II.--Constantius again ejects Athanasius, and banishes those
   who represented the Homoousian Doctrine. Death of Paul, Bishop of
   Constantinople. Macedonius: his Second Usurpation of the See, and his
   Evil Deeds.

   The emperor, [1285] deceived by the calumnies of the heterodox, changed
   his mind, and, in opposition to the decrees of the council of Sardica,
   exiled the bishops whom he had previously restored. Marcellus was again
   deposed, and Basil re-acquired possession of the bishopric of Ancyra.
   Lucius was thrown into prison, and died there. Paul was condemned to
   perpetual banishment, and was conveyed to Cucusum, in Armenia, where he
   died. I have never, however, been able to ascertain whether or not he
   died a natural death. It is still reported, that he was strangled by
   the adherents of Macedonius. [1286] As soon as he was sent into exile,
   Macedonius seized the government of his church; and, being aided by
   several orders of monks whom he had incorporated at Constantinople, and
   by alliances with many of the neighboring bishops, he commenced, it is
   said, a persecution against those who held the sentiments of Paul. He
   ejected them, in the first place, from the church, and then compelled
   them to enter into communion with himself. Many perished from wounds
   received in the struggle; some were deprived of their possessions;
   some, of the rights of citizenship; and others were branded on the
   forehead with an iron instrument, in order that they might be stamped
   as infamous. The emperor was displeased when he heard of these
   transactions, and imputed the blame of them to Macedonius and his
   adherents.

   Chapter III.--Martyrdom of the Holy Notaries.

   The persecution increased in violence, [1287] and led to deeds of
   blood. Martyrius and Marcian were among those who were slain. They had
   lived in Paul's house, [1288] and were delivered up by Macedonius to
   the governor, as having been guilty of the murder of Hermogenes, and of
   exciting the former sedition against him. Martyrius was a sub-deacon,
   and Marcian a singer and a reader of Holy Scripture. Their tomb is
   famous, and is situated before the walls of Constantinople, as a
   memorial of the martyrs; it is placed in a house of prayer, which was
   commenced by John and completed by Sisinnius; these both afterwards
   presided over the church of Constantinople. For they who had been
   unworthily adjudged to have no part in the honors of martyrdom, were
   honored by God, because the very place where those conducted to death
   had been decapitated, and which previously was not approached on
   account of ghosts, was now purified, and those who were under the
   influence of demons were released from the disease, and many other
   notable miracles were wrought at the tomb. These are the particulars
   which should be stated concerning Martyrius and Marcian. If what I have
   related appears to be scarcely credible, it is easy to apply for
   further information to those who are more accurately acquainted with
   the circumstances; and perhaps far more wonderful things are related
   concerning them than those which I have detailed.

   October.

   Chapter IV.--Campaign of Constantius in Sirmium, and Details concerning
   Vetranio and Magnentius. Gallus receives the Title of Cæsar, and is
   sent to the East.

   On the expulsion of Athanasius, which took place about this period,
   George persecuted [1289] all those throughout Egypt who refused to
   conform to his sentiments. The emperor marched into Illyria, and
   entered Sirmium, whither Vetranio had repaired by appointment. The
   soldiers who had proclaimed him emperor suddenly changed their mind,
   and saluted Constantius as sole sovereign, and as Augustus, for both
   the emperor and his supporters, strove for this very action. Vetranio
   perceived that he was betrayed, and threw himself as a suppliant at the
   feet of Constantius. Constantius pitied him indeed, but stripped him of
   the imperial ornaments and purple, obliged him to return to private
   life, liberally provided for his wants out of the public treasury, and
   told him that it was more seemly to an old man to abstain from the
   cares of empire and to live in quietude. After terminating these
   arrangements in favor of Vetranio, Constantius sent a large army into
   Italy against Magnentius. He then conferred the title of Cæsar on his
   cousin Gallus, and sent him into Syria to defend the provinces of the
   East.

   Chapter V.--Cyril directs the Sacerdotal Office after Maximus, and the
   Largest Form of the Cross, surpassing the Sun in Splendor, again
   appears in the Heavens, and is visible during several Days.

   At the time that Cyril administered the church of Jerusalem after
   Maximus, the sign of the cross appeared in the heavens. It shone
   brilliantly, not with divergent rays like a comet, but with the
   concentration of a great deal of light, apparently dense and yet
   transparent. Its length was about fifteen stadia from Calvary to the
   Mount of Olives, and its breadth was in proportion to its length. So
   extraordinary a phenomenon excited universal terror. Men, women, and
   children left their houses, the market-place, or their respective
   employments, and ran to the church, where they sang hymns to Christ
   together, and voluntarily confessed their belief in God. The
   intelligence disturbed in no little measure our entire dominions, and
   this happened rapidly; for, as the custom was, there were travelers
   from every part of the world, so to speak, who were dwelling at
   Jerusalem for prayer, or to visit its places of interest, these were
   spectators of the sign, and divulged the facts to their friends at
   home. The emperor was made acquainted with the occurrence, partly by
   numerous reports concerning it which were then current, and partly by a
   letter from Cyril [1290] the bishop. It was said that this prodigy was
   a fulfillment of an ancient prophecy contained in the Holy Scriptures.
   It was the means of the conversion of many pagans and Jews to
   Christianity.

   Chapter VI.--Photinus, Bishop of Sirmium. His Heresy, and the Council
   convened at Sirmium in Opposition thereto. The Three Formularies of
   Faith. This Agitator of Empty Ideas was refuted by Basil of Ancyra.
   After his Deposition Photinus, although solicited, declined
   Reconciliation.

   About this time, [1291] Photinus, who administered the church of
   Sirmium, laid before the emperor, who was then staying at that city, a
   heresy which he had originated some time previously. His natural ease
   of utterance and powers of persuasion enabled him to lead many into his
   own way of thinking. He acknowledged that there was one God Almighty,
   by whose own word all things were created, but would not admit that the
   generation and existence of the Son was before all ages; on the
   contrary, he alleged that Christ derived His existence from Mary. As
   soon as this opinion was divulged, it excited the indignation of the
   Western and of the Eastern bishops, and they considered it in common as
   an innovation of each one's particular belief, for it was equally
   opposed by those who maintained the doctrines of the Nicæan council,
   and by those who favored the tenets of Arius. The emperor also regarded
   the heresy with aversion, and convened a council at Sirmium, where he
   was then residing. Of the Eastern bishops, George, who governed the
   church of Alexandria, Basil, bishop of Ancyra, and Mark, bishop of
   Arethusa, were present at this council; and among the Western bishops
   were Valens, bishop of Mursa, and Hosius the Confessor. This latter,
   who had attended the council of Nicæa, was unwillingly a participant of
   this; he had not long previously been condemned to banishment through
   the machinations of the Arians; he was summoned to the council of
   Sirmium by the command of the emperor extorted by the Arians, who
   believed that their party would be strengthened, if they could gain
   over, either by persuasion or force, a man held in universal admiration
   and esteem, as was Hosius. The period at which the council was convened
   at Sirmium, was the year after the expiration of the consulate of
   Sergius and Nigrinian; and during this year there were no consuls
   either in the East or the West, owing to the insurrections excited by
   the tyrants. Photinus was deposed by this council, because he was
   accused of countenancing the errors of Sabellius and Paul of Samosata.
   The council then proceeded to draw up three formularies of faith in
   addition to the previous confessions, of which one was written in
   Greek, and the others in Latin. But they did not agree with one
   another, nor with any other of the former expositions of doctrine,
   either in word or import. It is not said in the Greek formulary, [1292]
   that the Son is consubstantial, or of like substance, with the Father,
   but it is there declared, that those who maintain that the Son had no
   commencement, or that He proceeded from an expansion of the substance
   of the Father, or that He is united to the Father without being subject
   to Him, are excommunicated. In one of the Roman formularies, [1293] it
   is forbidden to say, of the essence of the Godhead which the Romans
   call substance, that the Son is either consubstantial, or of like
   substance with the Father, as such statements do not occur in the Holy
   Scriptures, and are beyond the reach of the understanding and knowledge
   of men. It is said, that the Father must be recognized as superior to
   the Son in honor, in dignity, in divinity, and in the relationship
   suggested by His name of Father; and that it must be confessed that the
   Son, like all created beings, is subject to the Father, that the Father
   had no commencement, and that the generation of the Son is unknown to
   all save the Father. It is related, that when this formulary was
   completed, the bishops became aware of the errors it contained, and
   endeavored to withdraw it from the public, and to correct it; and that
   the emperor threatened to punish those who should retain or conceal any
   of the copies that had been made of it. But having been once published,
   no efforts were adequate to suppress it altogether.

   The third formulary [1294] is of the same import as the others. It
   prohibits the use of the term "substance" on account of the terms used
   in Latin, while the Greek term having been used with too much
   simplicity by the Fathers, and having been a cause of offense to many
   of the unlearned multitude, because it was not to be found in the
   Scriptures, "we have deemed it right totally to reject the use of it:
   and we would enjoin the omission of all mention of the term in allusion
   to the Godhead, for it is nowhere said in the Holy Scriptures, that the
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are of the same substance, where the word
   person is written. But we say, in conformity with the Holy Scriptures,
   that the Son is like unto the Father."

   Such was the decision arrived at in the presence of the emperor
   concerning the faith. Hosius at first refused to assent to it.
   Compulsion, however, was resorted to; and being extremely old, he sunk,
   as it is reported, beneath the blows that were inflicted on him, and
   yielded his consent and signature.

   After the deposition of Photinus, the Synod thought it expedient to try
   whether it were not somehow possible to persuade him to change his
   views. But when the bishop urged him, and promised to restore his
   bishopric if he would renounce his own dogma, and vote for their
   formulary, he would not acquiesce, but challenged them to a discussion.
   On the day appointed for this purpose, the bishops, therefore,
   assembled with the judges who had been appointed by the emperor to
   preside at their meetings, and who, in point of eloquence and dignity,
   held the first rank in the palace. Basil, bishop of Ancyra, was
   selected to commence the disputation against Photinus. The conflict
   lasted a long time, on account of the numerous questions started and
   the answers given by each party, and which were immediately taken down
   in short-hand; but finally the victory declared itself in favor of
   Basil. Photinus was condemned and banished, but did not cease on that
   account from enlarging his own dogma. He wrote and published many works
   in Greek and Latin, in which he endeavored to show that all opinions,
   except his own, were erroneous. I have now concluded all that I had to
   say concerning Photinus and the heresy to which his name was affixed.

   Chapter VII.--Death of the Tyrants Magnentius and Silvanus the
   Apostate. Sedition of the Jews in Palestine. Gallus Cæsar is slain, on
   Suspicion of Revolution.

   In the meantime, [1295] Magnentius made himself master of ancient Rome,
   and put numbers of the senators, and of the people, to death. Hearing
   that the troops of Constantius were approaching, he retired into Gaul;
   and here the two parties had frequent encounters, in which sometimes
   the one and sometimes the other was victorious. At length, however,
   Magnentius was defeated, and fled to Mursa, which is the fortress of
   this Gaul, and when he saw that his soldiers were dispirited because
   they had been defeated, he stood on an elevated spot and endeavored to
   revive their courage. But, although they addressed Magnentius with the
   acclamations usually paid to emperors, and were ready to shout at his
   public appearance, they secretly and without premeditation shouted for
   Constantius as emperor in place of Magnentius. Magnentius, concluding
   from this circumstance, that he was not destined by God to hold the
   reins of empire, endeavored to retreat from the fortress to some
   distant place. But he was pursued by the troops of Constantius, and
   being overtaken at a spot called Mount Seleucus, he escaped alone from
   the encounter, and fled to Lugduna. On his arrival there, he slew his
   own mother and his brother, whom he had named Cæsar; and lastly, he
   killed himself. [1296] Not long after, Decentius, another of his
   brothers, put an end to his own existence. Still the public tumults
   were not quelled; for not long after, Silvanus assumed the supreme
   authority in Gaul; but he was put to death immediately by the generals
   of Constantius.

   The Jews of Diocæsarea also overran Palestine and the neighboring
   territories; they took up arms with the design of shaking off the Roman
   yoke. [1297] On hearing of their insurrection, Gallus Cæsar, who was
   then at Antioch, sent troops against them, defeated them, and destroyed
   Diocæsarea. Gallus, intoxicated with success, could not bear his
   prosperity, but aspired to the supreme power, and he slew Magnus, the
   quæstor, and Domitian, the prefect of the East, because they apprised
   the emperor of his innovations. The anger of Constantius was excited;
   and he summoned him to his presence. Gallus did not dare to refuse
   obedience, and set out on his journey. When, however, he reached the
   island Elavona he was killed by the emperor's order; this event
   occurred in the third year of his consulate, and the seventh of
   Constantius. [1298]

   Chapter VIII.--Arrival of Constantius at Rome. A Council held in Italy.
   Account of what happened to Athanasius the Great through the
   Machinations of the Arians.

   On the death of the tyrants, [1299] Constantius anticipated the
   restoration of peace and cessation of tumults, and quitted Sirmium in
   order to return to ancient Rome, and to enjoy the honor of a triumph
   after his victory over the tyrants. He likewise intended to bring the
   Eastern and the Western bishops, if possible, to one mind concerning
   doctrine, by convening a council in Italy. Julius died about this
   period, after having governed the church of Rome during twenty-five
   years; [1300] and Liberius succeeded him. Those who were opposed to the
   doctrines of the Nicæan council thought this a favorable opportunity to
   calumniate the bishops whom they had deposed, and to procure their
   ejection from the church as abettors of false doctrine, and as
   disturbers of the public peace; and to accuse them of having sought,
   during the life of Constans, to excite a misunderstanding between the
   emperors; and it was true, as we related above, [1301] that Constans
   menaced his brother with war unless he would consent to receive the
   orthodox bishops. Their efforts were principally directed against
   Athanasius, towards whom they entertained so great an aversion that,
   even when he was protected by Constans, and enjoyed the friendship of
   Constantius, they could not conceal their enmity. Narcissus, bishop of
   Cilicia, Theodore, bishop of Thrace, Eugenius, bishop of Nicæa,
   Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis, Menophantes, bishop of Ephesus, and
   other bishops, to the number of thirty, assembled themselves in
   Antioch, [1302] and wrote a letter to all the bishops of every region,
   in which they stated that Athanasius had returned to his bishopric in
   violation of the rules of the Church, that he had not justified himself
   in any council, and that he was only supported by some of his own
   faction; and they exhorted them not to hold communion with him, nor to
   write to him, but to enter into communion with George, who had been
   ordained to succeed him. Athanasius only contemned these proceedings;
   but he was about to undergo greater trials than any he had yet
   experienced. Immediately on the death of Magnentius, and as soon as
   Constantius found himself sole master of the Roman Empire, he directed
   all his efforts to induce the bishops of the West to admit that the Son
   is of like substance with the Father. In carrying out this scheme,
   however, he did not, in the first place, resort to compulsion, but
   endeavored by persuasion to obtain the concurrence of the other bishops
   in the decrees of the Eastern bishops against Athanasius; for he
   thought that if he could bring them to be of one mind on this point, it
   would be easy for him to regulate aright the affairs connected with
   religion.

   [1299] Independent chapter.

   [1300] Sozomen is mistaken in saying twenty-five years; he was bishop
   from a.d. 337-352, fifteen years; this error is due to his earlier
   confusion of Julius and Silvester.

   [1301] See above, iii. 20.

   [1302] Sozomen is the only historian who makes mention of this Synod at
   Antioch in Syria; probably from Sabinus.

   Chapter IX.--Council of Milan. Flight of Athanasius.

   The emperor [1303] was extremely urgent to convene a council in Milan,
   yet few of the Eastern bishops repaired thither; some, it appears,
   excused themselves from attendance under the plea of illness; others,
   on account of the length and difficulties of the journey. There were,
   however, upwards of three hundred of the Western bishops at the
   council. The Eastern bishops insisted that Athanasius should be
   condemned to banishment, and expelled from Alexandria; and the others,
   either from fear, fraud, or ignorance, assented to the measure.
   Dionysius, bishop of Alba, the metropolis of Italy, Eusebius, bishop of
   Vercella in Liguria, Paulinus, bishop of Treves, Rhodanus, [1304] and
   Lucifer, were the only bishops who protested against this decision; and
   they declared that Athanasius ought not to be condemned on such slight
   pretexts; and that the evil would not cease with his condemnation; but
   that those who supported the orthodox doctrines concerning the Godhead
   would be forthwith subjected to a plot. They represented that the whole
   measure was a scheme concerted by the emperor and the Arians with the
   view of suppressing the Nicene faith. Their boldness was punished by an
   edict of immediate banishment, and Hilary was exiled with them. The
   result too plainly showed for what purpose the council of Milan had
   been convened. For the councils which were held shortly after at
   Ariminum and Seleucia were evidently designed to change the doctrines
   established by the Nicæan council, as I shall directly show.

   Athanasius, being apprised that plots had been formed against him at
   court, deemed it prudent not to repair to the emperor himself, as he
   knew that his life would be thereby endangered, nor did he think that
   it would be of any avail. He, however, selected five of the Egyptian
   bishops, among whom was Serapion, bishop of Thumis, a prelate
   distinguished by the wonderful sanctity of his life and the power of
   his eloquence, and sent them with three presbyters of the Church to the
   emperor, who was then in the West. They were directed to attempt, if
   possible, to conciliate the emperor; to reply, if requisite, to the
   calumnies of the hostile party; and to take such measures as they
   deemed most advisable for the welfare of the Church and himself.
   Shortly after they had embarked on their voyage, Athanasius received
   some letters from the emperor, summoning him to the palace. Athanasius
   and all the people of the Church were greatly troubled at this command;
   for they considered that no safety could be enjoyed when acting either
   in obedience or in disobedience to an emperor of heterodox sentiments.
   It was, however, determined that he should remain at Alexandria, and
   the bearer of the letters quitted the city without having effected
   anything. The following summer, another messenger from the emperor
   arrived with the governors of the provinces, and he was charged to urge
   the departure of Athanasius from the city, and to act with hostility
   against the clergy. When he perceived, however, that the people of the
   Church were full of courage, and ready to take up arms, he also
   departed from the city without accomplishing his mission. Not long
   after, troops, called the Roman legions, which were quartered in Egypt
   and Libya, marched into Alexandria. As it was reported that Athanasius
   was concealed in the church known by the name "Theonas," the commander
   of the troops, and Hilary, [1305] whom the emperor had again intrusted
   with the transaction of this affair, caused the doors of the church to
   be burst open, and thus effected their entrance; but they did not find
   Athanasius within the walls, although they sought for him everywhere.
   It is said that he escaped this and many other perils by the Divine
   interposition; and that God had disclosed this previously; directly as
   he went out, the soldiers took the doors of the church, and were within
   a little of seizing him.

   Chapter X.--Divers Machinations of the Arians against Athanasius, and
   his Escape from Various Dangers through Divine Interposition. Evil
   Deeds perpetrated by George in Egypt after the Expulsion of Athanasius.

   There is no doubt but that Athanasius was beloved of God, and endowed
   with the gift of foreseeing the future. [1306] More wonderful facts
   than those which we have related might be adduced to prove his intimate
   acquaintance with futurity. It happened that during the life of
   Constans, the Emperor Constantius was once determined upon ill-treating
   this holy man; but Athanasius fled, and concealed himself with some one
   of his acquaintances. He lived for a long time in a subterraneous and
   sunless dwelling, which had been used as a reservoir for water. No one
   knew where he was concealed except a serving-woman, who seemed
   faithful, and who waited upon him. As the heterodox, however, were
   anxiously intent upon taking Athanasius alive, it appears that, by
   means of gifts or promises, they at length succeeded in corrupting the
   attendant. But Athanasius was forewarned by God of her treachery, and
   effected his escape from the place. The servant was punished for having
   made a false deposition against her masters, while they, on their part,
   fled the country; for it was accounted no venial crime by the heterodox
   to receive or to conceal Athanasius, but was, on the contrary, regarded
   as an act of disobedience against the express commands of the emperor,
   and as a crime against the empire, and was visited as such by the civil
   tribunals. It has come to my hearing that Athanasius was saved on
   another occasion in a similar manner. He was again obliged for the same
   reason to flee for his life; and he set sail up the Nile [1307] with
   the design of retreating to the further districts of Egypt, but his
   enemies received intelligence of his intention, and pursued him. Being
   forewarned of God that he would be pursued, he announced it to his
   fellow-passengers, and commanded them to return to Alexandria. While he
   sailed down the river, his plotters rowed by. He reached Alexandria in
   safety, and effectually concealed himself in the midst of its similar
   and numerous houses. His success in avoiding these and many other
   perils led to his being accused of sorcery by the pagan and the
   heterodox. It is reported, that once, as he was passing through the
   city, a crow was heard to caw, and that a number of pagans who happened
   to be on the spot, asked him in derision what the crow was saying. He
   replied, smiling, "It utters the sound cras, the meaning of which in
   the Latin language is, tomorrow' and it has hereby announced to you
   that the morrow will not be propitious to you; for it indicates that
   you will be forbidden by the Roman emperor to celebrate your festival
   tomorrow." Although this prediction of Athanasius appeared to be
   absurd, it was fulfilled; for the following day edicts were transmitted
   to the governors from the emperor, by which it was commanded that the
   pagans were not to be permitted to assemble in the temples to perform
   their usual ceremonies, nor to celebrate their festival; and thus was
   abolished the most solemn and magnificent feast which the pagans had
   retained. What I have said is sufficient to show that this holy man was
   endowed with the gift of prophecy.

   After Athanasius had escaped, in the manner we have described, from
   those who sought to arrest him, his clergy and people remained for some
   time in possession of the churches; but eventually, the governor of
   Egypt and the commander of the army forcibly ejected all those who
   maintained the sentiments of Athanasius, in order to deliver up the
   government of the churches to those who favored George, whose arrival
   was then expected. Not long after he reached the city, and the churches
   were placed under his authority. He ruled by force rather than by
   priestly moderation; and as he strove to strike terror into the minds
   of the people, and carried on a cruel persecution against the followers
   of Athanasius, and, moreover, imprisoned and maimed many men and women,
   he was accounted a tyrant. For these reasons he fell into a universal
   hate; the people were so deeply incensed at his conduct, that they
   rushed into the church, and would have torn him to pieces; in such an
   extremity of danger, he escaped with difficulty, and fled to the
   emperor. Those who held the sentiments of Athanasius then took
   possession of the churches. But they did not long retain the mastery of
   them; for the commander of the troops in Egypt came and restored the
   churches to the partisans of George. An imperial shorthand writer of
   the notary class was afterwards sent to punish the leaders of the
   sedition, and he tortured and scourged many of the citizens. When
   George returned a little while after, he was more formidable, it
   appears, than ever, and was regarded with greater aversion than before,
   for he instigated the emperor to the perpetration of many evil deeds;
   and besides, the monks of Egypt openly declared him to be perfidious
   and inflated with arrogance. The opinions of these monks were always
   adopted by the people, and their testimony was universally received,
   because they were noted for their virtue and the philosophical tenor of
   their lives.

   Chapter XI.--Liberius, Bishop of Rome, and the cause of his being
   exiled by Constantius. Felix his Successor.

   Although what I have recorded did not occur to Athanasius and the
   church of Alexandria, at the same period of time after the death of
   Constans, yet I deemed it right, for the sake of greater clearness, to
   relate all these events collectively. The council of Milan [1308] was
   dissolved without any business having been transacted, and the emperor
   condemned to banishment all those who had opposed the designs of the
   enemies of Athanasius. As Constantius wished to establish uniformity of
   doctrine throughout the Church, and to unite the priesthood in the
   maintenance of the same sentiments, he formed a plan to convene the
   bishops of every religion to a council, to be held in the West. He was
   aware of the difficulty of carrying this scheme into execution, arising
   from the vast extent of land and seas which some of the bishops would
   have to traverse, yet he did not altogether despair of success. While
   this project was occupying his mind, and before he prepared to make his
   triumphal entrance into Rome, he sent for Liberius, the bishop of Rome,
   and strove to persuade him to conformity of sentiment with the priests
   by whom he was attended, amongst whom was Eudoxius. As Liberius,
   however, refused compliance, and protested that he would never yield on
   this point, the emperor banished him to Beroea, in Thrace. It is
   alleged, that another pretext for the banishment of Liberius was, that
   he would not withdraw from communion with Athanasius, but manfully
   opposed the emperor, who insisted that Athanasius had injured the
   Church, had occasioned the death of the elder of his two brothers,
   [1309] and had sown the seeds of enmity between Constans and himself.
   As the emperor revived all the decrees which had been enacted against
   Athanasius by various councils, and particularly by that of Tyre,
   Liberius told him that no regard ought to be paid to edicts which were
   issued from motives of hatred, of favor, or of fear. He desired that
   the bishops of every region should be made to sign the formulary of
   faith compiled at Nicæa, and that those bishops who had been exiled on
   account of their adherence to it should be recalled. He suggested that
   after these matters were righted all the bishops should, at their own
   expense, and without being furnished either with public conveyances or
   money, so as not to seem burdensome and destructive, proceed to
   Alexandria, and make an accurate test of the truth, which could be more
   easily instituted at that city than elsewhere, as the injured and those
   who had inflicted injury as well as the confuters of the charges dwelt
   there. He then exhibited the letter written by Valens and Ursacius to
   Julius, his predecessor in the Roman see, in which they solicited his
   forgiveness, and acknowledged that the depositions brought against
   Athanasius, at the Mareotis, were false; and he besought the emperor
   not to condemn Athanasius during his absence, nor to give credit to
   enactments which were evidently obtained by the machinations of his
   enemies. With respect to the alleged injuries which had been inflicted
   on his two brothers, he entreated the emperor not to revenge himself by
   the hands of priests who had been set apart by God, not for the
   execution of vengeance, but for sanctification, and the performance of
   just and benevolent actions.

   The emperor perceiving that Liberius was not disposed to comply with
   his mandate, commanded that he should be conveyed to Thrace, unless he
   would change his mind within two days. "To me, O emperor," replied
   Liberius, "there is no need of deliberation; my resolution has long
   been formed and decided, and I am ready to go forth to exile." It is
   said, that when he was being conducted to banishment, the emperor sent
   him five hundred pieces of gold; he, however, refused to receive them,
   and said to the messenger who brought them, "Go, and tell him who sent
   this gold to give it to the flatterers and hypocrites [1310] who
   surround him, for their insatiable cupidity plunges them into a state
   of perpetual want which can never be relieved. Christ, who is in all
   respects, [1311] like unto his Father, supplies us with food and with
   all good things."

   Liberius having for the above reasons been deposed from the Roman
   church, his government was transferred to Felix, a deacon of the clergy
   there. It is said that Felix always continued in adherence to the
   Nicene faith; and that, with respect to his conduct in religious
   matters he was blameless. The only thing alleged against him was, that,
   prior to his ordination, he held communion with the heterodox. When the
   emperor entered Rome, the people loudly demanded Liberius, and besought
   his return; after consulting with the bishops who were with him, he
   replied that he would recall Liberius and restore him to the people, if
   he would consent to embrace the same sentiments as those held by the
   priests of the court.

   Chapter XII.--Aëtius, the Syrian, and Eudoxius, the Successor of
   Leontius in Antioch. Concerning the Term "Consubstantial."

   About this time, [1312] Aëtius broached his peculiar opinions
   concerning the Godhead. He was then deacon of the church of Antioch,
   and had been ordained by Leontius. [1313] He maintained, like Arius,
   that the Son is a created being, that He was created out of nothing,
   and that He is dissimilar from the Father. As he was extremely addicted
   to contention, very bold in his assertions on theological subjects, and
   prone to have recourse to a very subtle mode of argumentation, he was
   accounted a heretic, even by those who held the same sentiments as
   himself. When he had been, for this reason, excommunicated by the
   heterodox, he feigned a refusal to hold communion with them, because,
   they had unjustly admitted Arius into communion after he had perjured
   himself by declaring to the Emperor Constantine that he maintained the
   doctrines of the council of Nicæa. Such is the account given of Aëtius.

   While the emperor was in the West, tidings arrived of the death of
   Leontius, bishop of Antioch. Eudoxius requested permission of the
   emperor to return to Syria, that he might superintend the affairs of
   that church. On permission being granted, he repaired with all speed to
   Antioch, and installed himself as bishop of that city without the
   sanction of George, bishop of Laodicea; of Mark, bishop of Arethusa; of
   the other Syrian bishops; or of any other bishop to whom the right of
   ordination pertained. It was reported that he acted with the
   concurrence of the emperor, and of the eunuchs belonging to the palace,
   who, like Eudoxius, favored the doctrines of Aëtius, and believed that
   the Son is dissimilar from the Father. When Eudoxius found himself in
   possession of the church of Antioch, he ventured to uphold this heresy
   openly. He assembled in Antioch all those who held the same opinions as
   himself, among whom was Acacius, bishop of Tyre, and rejected the
   terms, "of like substance," and "consubstantial," under the pretext
   that they had been denounced by the Western bishops. For Hosius, with
   some of the priests there, had certainly, with the view of arresting
   the contention excited by Valens, Ursacius, and Germanius, [1314]
   consented, though by compulsion, [1315] at Sirmium, as it is reported,
   to refrain from the use of the terms "consubstantial" and "of like
   substance," because such terms do not occur in the Holy Scriptures, and
   are beyond the understanding of men. [1316] They [1317] sent an epistle
   to the bishops as though these sustained the writings of Hosius on this
   point, and conveyed their thanks to Valens, Ursacius, and Germanius,
   because they had given the impulse of right views to the Western
   bishops.

   Chapter XIII.--Innovations of Eudoxius censured in a Letter written by
   George, Bishop of Laodicea. Deputation from the Council of Ancyra to
   Constantius.

   After Eudoxius had introduced these new doctrines, many members of the
   church of Antioch, who were opposed to them, were excommunicated.
   [1318] George, bishop of Laodicea, gave them a letter to take to the
   bishops who had been invited from the neighboring towns of Ancyra in
   Galatia by Basil, for the purpose of consecrating a church which he had
   erected. This letter was as follows:--

   "George, to his most honored lords Macedonius, Basil, Cecropius, and
   Eugenius, sends greeting in the Lord.

   "Nearly the whole city has suffered from the shipwreck of Aëtius. The
   disciples of this wicked man, whom you contemned, have been encouraged
   by Eudoxius, and promoted by him to clerical appointments, and Aëtius
   himself has been raised to the highest honor. Go, then, to the
   assistance of this great city, lest by its shipwreck the whole world
   should be submerged. Assemble yourselves together, and solicit the
   signatures of other bishops, that Aëtius may be ejected from the church
   of Antioch, and that his disciples who have been manipulated beforehand
   into the lists of the clergy by Eudoxius, may be cut off. If Eudoxius
   persist in affirming with Aëtius, that the Son is dissimilar from the
   Father, and in preferring those who uphold this dogma to those who
   reject it, the city of Antioch is lost to you." Such was the strain of
   George's letter.

   The bishops who were assembled at Ancyra clearly perceived by the
   enactments of Eudoxius at Antioch, that he contemplated the
   introduction of innovations in doctrine; they apprised the emperor of
   this fact, and besought him that the doctrine established at Sardica,
   at Sirmium, and at other councils, might be confirmed, and especially
   the dogma that the Son is of like substance with the Father. In order
   to proffer this request to the emperor, they sent to him a deputation
   composed of the following bishops: Basil, bishop of Ancyra; Eustathius,
   bishop of Sebaste; Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus; and Leontius, the
   presbyter of the imperial bed-chamber. On their arrival at the palace,
   they found that Asphalius, a presbyter of Antioch, and a zealot of the
   Aëtian heresy, was on the point of taking his departure, after having
   terminated the business for which he undertook the journey and having
   obtained a letter from the emperor. On receiving, however, the
   intelligence concerning the heresy conveyed by the deputation from
   Ancyra, Constantius condemned Eudoxius and his followers, withdrew the
   letter he had confided to Asphalius, and wrote the following one:--

   Chapter XIV.--Letter of the Emperor Constantius against Eudoxius and
   his Partisans.

   "Constantius Augustus the Conqueror, to the holy church in Antioch.
   [1319]

   "Eudoxius came without our authority; let no one suppose that he had
   it, for we are far from regarding such persons with favor. If they have
   recourse to deceit with others in transactions like this, they give
   evidence that they will refine away the truth in still higher things.
   For from what will they voluntarily refrain, who, for the sake of
   power, follow the round of the cities, leaping from one to another, as
   a kind of wanderer, prying into every nook, led by the desire for more?
   It is reported that there are among these people certain quacks and
   sophists, whose very names are scarcely to be tolerated, and whose
   deeds are evil and most impious. You all know to what set of people I
   allude; for you are all thoroughly acquainted with the doctrines of
   Aëtius and the heresy which he has cultivated. He and his followers
   have devoted themselves exclusively to the task of corrupting the
   people; and these clever fellows have had the audacity to publish that
   we approved of their ordination. Such is the report they circulate,
   after the manner of those who talk overmuch; but it is not true, and,
   indeed, far removed from the truth. Recall to your recollection the
   words of which we made use, when we first made a declaration of our
   belief; for we confessed that our Saviour is the Son of God, and of
   like substance with the Father. But these people, who have the audacity
   to set forth whatever enters their imagination, concerning the Godhead,
   are not far removed from atheism; and they strive, moreover, to
   propagate their opinions among others. We are convinced that their
   iniquitous proceedings will fall back upon their own heads. In the
   meantime, it is sufficient to eject them from synods and from ordinary
   conference; for I will not now allude to the chastisements which must
   hereafter overtake them, unless they will desist from their madness.
   How great is the evil they perpetrate, when they collect together the
   most wicked persons, as if by an edict, and they select the leaders of
   heresy for the clergy, thus debasing the reverend order as though they
   were allowed to do what they please! Who can bear with people who fill
   the cities with impiety, who secrete impurity in the most distant
   regions, and who delight in nothing but in injuring the righteous? What
   an evil-working unity it is, which limps forward to enthrone itself in
   the diviner seats! Now is the time for those who have imbibed the truth
   to come forward into the light, and whoever were previously restrained
   through fear, and now would escape from conventionalism, let them step
   into the middle; for the artifices of these evil men have been
   thoroughly confuted, and no sort of device can be invented which will
   deliver them from acting impiously. It is the duty of good men to
   retain the faith of the Fathers, and, so to speak, to augment it,
   without busying themselves with other matters. I earnestly exhort those
   who have escaped, though but recently, from the precipice of this
   heresy, to assent to the decrees which the bishops who are wise in
   divine learning, have rightly determined for the better."

   Thus we see that the heresy usually denominated Anomian was within a
   little of becoming predominant at this period.

   Chapter XV.--The Emperor Constantius repairs to Sirmium, recalls
   Liberius, and restores him to the Church of Rome; he also commands
   Felix to assist Liberius in the Sacerdotal Office.

   Not long after these events, the emperor returned to Sirmium from Rome;
   on receiving a deputation from the Western bishops, he recalled
   Liberius from Beroea. [1320] Constantius urged him, in the presence of
   the deputies of the Eastern bishops, and of the other priests who were
   at the camp, to confess that the Son is not of the same substance as
   the Father. He was instigated to this measure by Basil, Eustathius, and
   Eusebius, who possessed great influence over him. They had formed a
   compilation, in one document, of the decrees against Paul of Samosata,
   and Photinus, bishop of Sirmium; to which they subjoined a formulary of
   faith drawn up at Antioch at the consecration of the church, as if
   certain persons had, under the pretext of the term "consubstantial,"
   attempted to establish a heresy of their own. Liberius, Athanasius,
   Alexander, Severianus, and Crescens, a priest of Africa, were induced
   to assent to this document, as were likewise Ursacius, Germanius,
   bishop of Sirmium, Valens, bishop of Mursa, and as many of the Eastern
   bishops as were present. They partially approved of a confession of
   faith drawn up by Liberius, in which he declared that those who affirm
   that the Son is not like unto the Father in substance and in all other
   respects, are excommunicated. For when Eudoxius and his partisans at
   Antioch, who favored the heresy of Aëtius, received the letter of
   Hosius, they circulated the report that Liberius had renounced the term
   "consubstantial," and had admitted that the Son is dissimilar from the
   Father. After these enactments had been made by the Western bishops,
   the emperor permitted Liberius to return to Rome. The bishops who were
   then convened at Sirmium [1321] wrote to Felix, who governed the Roman
   church, and to the other bishops, desiring them to receive Liberius.
   They directed that both should share the apostolical throne and
   discharge the priestly duties in common, with harmony of mind; and that
   whatever illegalities might have occurred in the ordination of Felix,
   or the banishment of Liberius, might be buried in oblivion. The people
   of Rome regarded Liberius as a very excellent man, and esteemed him
   highly on account of the courage he had evinced in opposing the
   emperor, so that they had even excited seditions on his account, and
   had gone so far as to shed blood. Felix survived but a short time; and
   Liberius found himself in sole possession of the church. This event
   was, no doubt, ordained by God, that the seat of Peter might not be
   dishonored by the occupancy of two bishops; for such an arrangement is
   a sign of discord, and is foreign to ecclesiastical law.

   Chapter XVI.--The Emperor purposed, on account of the Heresy of Aëtius
   and the Innovations in Antioch, to convene a Council at Nicomedia; but
   as an Earthquake took place in that City, and many other Affairs
   intervened, the Council was first convened at Nicæa, and afterwards at
   Ariminum and Seleucia. Account of Arsacius, the Confessor.

   Such were the events which transpired at Sirmium. It seemed at this
   period as if, from the fear of displeasing the emperor, the Eastern and
   Western Churches had united in the profession of the same doctrine. The
   emperor had determined upon convening a council at Nicæa to take into
   consideration the innovations introduced at Antioch, and the heresy of
   Aëtius. [1322] As Basil, however, and his party were averse to the
   council being held in this city, because doctrinal questions had
   previously been agitated there, it was determined to hold the council
   at Nicomedia in Bithynia; and edicts were issued, summoning the most
   intelligent and eloquent bishops of every nation to repair thither
   punctually on an appointed day, so that it might be the privilege of
   all the priests of the state to share in the Synod and to be present at
   its decisions. The great number of these bishops had commenced their
   journey when the calamity that had come upon Nicomedia was reported,
   and that God had shaken the entire city to its foundations. Since the
   story of the destruction of the city everywhere prevailed and grew, the
   bishops arrested their journey; for as is usual in such cases, far more
   was rumored to those at a distance, than had actually occurred. It was
   reported that Nicæa, Perinthus, and the neighboring cities, even
   Constantinople, had been involved in the same catastrophe. The orthodox
   bishops were grieved immoderately at this occurrence; for the enemies
   of religion took occasion, on the overthrow of a magnificent church, to
   represent to the emperor that a multitude of bishops, men, women, and
   children fled to the church in the hope of their finding safety, and
   that they all perished. This report was not true. The earthquake
   occurred at the second hour of the day, at which time there was no
   assembly in the church. The only bishops who were killed were
   Cecropius, bishop of Nicomedia, and a bishop from the Bosphorus, and
   they were outside of the church when the fatal accident happened. The
   city was shaken in an instant of time, so that the people had not the
   power, even if they had the wish, to seek safety by flight; at the
   first experience of danger, they were either preserved, or they
   perished on the spot where they were standing. [1323]

   It is said that this calamity was predicted by Arsacius. [1324] He was
   a Persian, and a soldier who was employed in tending the emperor's
   lions; but during the reign of Licinius he became a noted confessor,
   and left the army. He then went to the citadel of Nicomedia, and led
   the life of a monastic philosopher within its walls. Here a vision from
   heaven appeared to him, and he was commanded to quit the city
   immediately, that he might be saved from the calamity about to happen.
   He ran with the utmost earnestness to the church, and besought the
   clergy to offer supplications to God that His anger might be turned
   away. But, finding that far from being believed by them, he was
   regarded with ridicule, and as disclosing unlooked-for sufferings, he
   returned to his tower, and prostrated himself on the ground in prayer.
   Just at this moment the earthquake occurred, and many perished. Those
   who were spared fled into the country and the desert. And as happens in
   a prosperous and large city, there were fires in the brasiers and
   extinguishers of every house, and in the ovens of the baths, and in the
   furnaces of all who use fire in the arts; and when the framework fell
   in ruin, the flame was hemmed in by the stuff, and of course there was
   dry wood commingled, much of which was oily,--this served as a
   contribution to the rapid conflagration, and nourished the fire without
   stint; the flame creeping everywhere, and attaching to itself all
   circumjacent material, made the entire city, so to speak, one mass of
   fire. It being impossible to obtain access to the houses, those who had
   been saved from the earthquake rushed to the citadel. Arsacius was
   found dead in the unshaken tower, and prostrated on the ground, in the
   same posture in which he had begun to pray. It was said that he had
   supplicated God to permit him to die, because he preferred death to
   beholding the destruction of a city in which he had first known Christ,
   and practiced monastical philosophy. As I have been led to speak of
   this good man, it is well to mention that he was endowed by God with
   the power of exorcising demons and of purifying those troubled by them.
   A man possessed with a demon once ran through the market-place with a
   naked sword in his hand. The people fled from him, and the whole city
   was in confusion. Arsacius went out to meet him, and called upon the
   name of Christ, and at that name the demon was expelled, and the man
   restored to sanity. Besides the above, Arsacius performed many other
   actions beyond the power and skill of man. There was a dragon, or some
   other species of reptile, which had entrenched itself in a cavity of
   the roadside, and which destroyed those who passed by, with its breath.
   Arsacius went to the spot and engaged in prayer, and the serpent
   voluntarily crept forth from its hole, dashed its head against the
   ground, and killed itself. All these details I have obtained from
   persons who heard them stated by those who had seen Arsacius.

   As the bishops were deterred from continuing their journey by the
   intelligence of the calamity which had occurred at Nicomedia, some
   awaited the further commands of the emperor, and others declared their
   opinions concerning the faith in letters which they wrote on the
   subject. The emperor hesitates as to what measures ought to be adopted,
   and writes to consult Basil as to whether a council ought to be
   convened. In his reply, it appears, Basil commended his piety, and
   tried to console him for the destruction of Nicomedia by examples drawn
   from the Holy Scriptures; he exhorted him, for the sake of religion, to
   hasten the Synod; and not to drop such a proof of his zeal for
   religion, and not to dismiss the priests who had been gathered together
   for this purpose, and had already set forth and were on their way,
   until some business had been transacted. He also suggested that the
   council might be held at Nicæa instead of Nicomedia, so that the
   disputed points might be finally decided on the very spot where they
   had been first called in question. Basil, in writing to this effect,
   believed that the emperor would be pleased with this proposition, as he
   had himself originally suggested the propriety of holding the council
   at Nicæa. On receiving this epistle from Basil, the emperor commanded
   that, at the commencement of summer, the bishops should assemble
   together at Nicæa, with the exception of those who were laboring under
   bodily infirmity; and these latter were to depute presbyters and
   deacons to make known their sentiments and to consult together on
   contested points of doctrine, and arrive at the same decision
   concerning all points at issue. He ordained that ten delegates should
   be selected from the Western churches, and as many from the Eastern, to
   take cognizance of the enactments that might be issued, and to decide
   whether they were in accordance with the Holy Scriptures, and also to
   exercise a general superintendence over the transactions of the
   council. After further consultation the emperor enacted that the
   bishops should remain where they might be residing, or in their own
   churches, until it had been decided where the council was to be held,
   and until they received notice to repair thither. He then writes to
   Basil, and directs him to inquire by letter of the Eastern bishops,
   where they would advise the council to be held, so that a public
   announcement might be made at the commencement of spring; for the
   emperor was of opinion that it was not advisable to convene the council
   at Nicæa, on account of the earthquake which had recently occurred in
   the province. Basil wrote to the bishops of every province, urging them
   to deliberate together, and to decide quickly upon the locality in
   which it would be most expedient to hold the council, and he prefixed a
   copy of the emperor's letter to his epistle. As is frequently the case
   in similar circumstances, the bishops were divided in opinion on the
   subject, and Basil repaired to the emperor, who was then at Sirmium. He
   found several bishops at that city who had gone thither on their own
   private affairs, and among them were Mark, bishop of Arethusa, and
   George, who had been appointed to preside over the church of
   Alexandria. When at length it was decided that the council should be
   held in Seleucia, a city of Isauria, by Valens and his adherents, for
   Valens was then sojourning in Sirmium; since they favored the heresy of
   the Anomians, they urged the bishops who were present at the military
   court, to subscribe to a formulary of the faith which had been
   prepared, and in which there was no mention of the term "substance."
   But while preparations were being zealously made for convening the
   council, Eudoxius and Acacius, Ursacius and Valens, with their
   followers, reflected that, while many of the bishops were attached to
   the Nicene faith, and others favored the formulary drawn up at the
   consecration of the church of Antioch, yet that both parties retained
   the use of the term "substance," and maintained that the Son was, in
   every respect, like unto the Father; and being aware that if both
   parties assembled together in one place they would readily condemn the
   doctrines of Aëtius, as being contrary to their respective creeds, they
   so contrived matters that the bishops of the West were convened at
   Ariminum, and those of the East at Seleucia, a city of Isauria. As it
   is easier to convince a few than a great many individuals, they
   conceived that they might possibly lead both parties to favor their
   sentiments by dealing with them separately, or that they might, at any
   rate, succeed with one, so that their heresy might not incur universal
   condemnation. They accomplished this through Eusebius, a eunuch who was
   superintendent of the imperial house: he was on terms of friendship
   with Eudoxius, and upheld the same doctrines, and many of those in
   power were seeking to conciliate this very Eusebius.

   Chapter XVII.--Proceedings of the Council of Ariminum.

   The emperor [1325] was persuaded that it would not be desirable for the
   public, on account of the expense, nor advantageous to the bishops, on
   account of the length of the journey, to convene them all to the same
   place for the purpose of holding a council. He therefore writes to the
   bishops who were then at Ariminum, as well as to those who were then at
   Seleucia, and directed them to enter upon an investigation of contested
   points concerning the faith, and then to turn their attention to the
   complaints of Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, and of other bishops who had
   remonstrated against the injustice of the decrees of deposition and
   banishment which had been issued against them, and to examine the
   legality of various sentences which had been enacted against other
   bishops. There were, in fact, several accusations pending against
   different bishops. George was accused by the Egyptians of rapine and
   violence. Finally, the emperor commanded that ten deputies should be
   sent to him from each council, to inform him of their respective
   proceedings.

   In accordance with this edict, the bishops assembled at the appointed
   cities. The Synod at Ariminum first commenced proceedings; [1326] it
   consisted of about four hundred members. Those who regarded Athanasius
   with the greatest enmity, were of opinion that there was nothing
   further to be decreed against him. When they had entered upon the
   investigation of doctrinal questions, Valens and Ursacius, supported by
   Germenius, Auxentius, Caius, and Demophilus, advanced into the middle
   of the assembly, and demanded that all the formularies of the faith
   which had been previously compiled should be suppressed, and that the
   formulary which they had but a short time previously set forth in the
   Latin language at Sirmium should be alone retained. In this formulary
   it was taught, according to Scripture, that the Son is like unto the
   Father; but no mention was made of the substance of God. They declared
   that this formulary had been approved by the emperor, and that it was
   incumbent upon the council to adopt it, instead of consulting too
   scrupulously the individual opinions of every member of the council, so
   that disputes and divisions might not spring up, were the terms to be
   delivered up to debate and accurate proof. They added that it would
   better enable those who were more ignorant of the art of discourse to
   have a right conception of God, than were they to introduce novelties
   in terms, so akin to disputatious jugglery. By these representations,
   they designed to denounce the use of the term "consubstantial," because
   they said it was not found in the Holy Scriptures, and was obscure to
   the multitude; and, instead of this term, they wished to substitute the
   expression that "the Son is like unto the Father in all things," which
   is borne out by the Holy Scriptures. After they had read their
   formulary containing the above representations, many of the bishops
   told them that no new formulary of the faith ought to be set forth,
   that those which had been previously compiled were quite sufficient for
   all purposes, and that they were met together for the express purpose
   of preventing all innovations. These bishops then urged those who had
   compiled and read the formulary to declare publicly their condemnation
   of the Arian doctrine, as the cause of all the troubles which had
   agitated the churches of every region. Ursacius and Valens, Germenius
   and Auxentius, Demophilus and Caius, having protested against this
   protestation, the council commanded that the expositions of the other
   heresies should be read, and likewise that set forth at Nicæa; so that
   those formularies which favored divers heresies might be condemned, and
   those which were in accordance with the Nicene doctrines might be
   approved; in order that there might be no further ground for dispute,
   and no future necessity for councils, but that an efficient decision
   might be formed. [1327] They remarked that it was absurd to compose so
   many formularies, as if they had but just commenced to become
   acquainted with the faith, and as if they wished to slight the ancient
   traditions of the Church, by which the churches had been governed by
   themselves, and by their predecessors, many of whom had witnessed a
   good confession, and had received the crown of martyrdom. Such were the
   arguments adduced by these bishops, to prove that no innovations ought
   to be attempted. As Valens and Ursacius and their partisans refused to
   be convinced by these arguments, but persisted in advocating the
   adoption of their own formulary, they were deposed, and it was decided
   that their formulary should be rejected. It was remarked that the
   declaration at the commencement of this formulary, of its having been
   compiled at Sirmium, in the presence of Constantius, "the eternal
   Augustus," and during the consulate of Eusebius and Hypatius, was an
   absurdity. Athanasius made the same remark, in a letter addressed to
   one of his friends, [1328] and said that it was ridiculous to term
   Constantius the eternal emperor, and yet to shrink from acknowledging
   the Son of God to be eternal; he also ridiculed the date affixed to the
   formulary, as though condemnation were meant to be thrown on the faith
   of former ages, as well as on those who had, before that period, been
   initiated into the faith.

   After these events had transpired at Ariminum, Valens and Ursacius,
   together with their adherents, irritated at their deposition, repaired
   with all haste to the emperor.

   Chapter XVIII.--Letter from the Council at Ariminum to the Emperor
   Constantius.

   The Synod selected twenty bishops, [1329] and sent them on an embassy
   to the emperor, with the following letter, which has been translated
   from Latin into Greek:-- [1330]

   "We believe that it is by the command of God, as well as by the
   arrangement of your piety, that we have been led from all the cities of
   the West, to assemble at Ariminum, for the purpose of declaring the
   faith of the Catholic Church, and of detecting those who have set forth
   heresies in opposition to it. After a protracted investigation, we have
   come to the conclusion that it is best to preserve that faith which has
   been continuous from antiquity, and which was preached by the prophets,
   the evangelists, the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Guardian of
   your empire, and Protector of your strength, by holding on thereto and
   guarding it to the end. It would have been absurd, as well as illegal,
   to have introduced any change in the doctrines which were so rightly
   and so justly propounded by the bishops at Nicæa, with the concurrence
   of the most illustrious Constantine, the emperor and your father, whose
   teaching and thought has gone forth and been preached in the universal
   hearing and reflection of men; and it is the antagonist and destroyer
   of the Arian heresy; through whose agency not only that deflection from
   the faith, but all others have been destroyed. There is great danger in
   adding to, or in taking away from, these doctrines; nor can the
   slightest alteration be made in any one of them, without giving an
   opportunity to the adversaries to do what they list. Ursacius and
   Valens, after having been suspected of participating in and advising
   about the Arian doctrine, were cut off from communion with us. In the
   hope of being restored to communion, they confessed their error, and
   obtained forgiveness, as their own writings testify, through which they
   were spared and received a pardon from the charges. The occasion on
   which the edict of forgiveness was conceded, was at the council of
   Milan, when the presbyters of the Roman church were also present.

   "Since we know that the formulary of the faith set forth at Nicæa was
   compiled with the greatest care and accuracy, in the presence of
   Constantine, of worthy memory, who maintained it throughout his life,
   and at his baptism, and when he departed to enjoy the merited peace of
   heaven, we judge that it would be absurd to attempt any alteration in
   it, and to overlook so many holy confessors and martyrs, and the
   writers and authors of this dogma, who have bestowed much thought upon
   it, and have perpetuated the ancient decree of the Catholic Church. God
   has transmitted the knowledge of their faith to the time in which you
   live, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom you reign and rule the
   world. Again have these wretched men, who are lamentable, to our way of
   thinking, announced themselves as heralds of an impious view with
   unlawful rashness, and have attempted to overturn the entire system of
   truth. For according to your injunction, the Synod was convened, and
   these men laid bare the view of their own deceit; for they attempted an
   innovation which they introduced with knavery and disturbance, and they
   found some companions whom they captured for this nefarious
   transaction; viz. Germanius, Auxentius, and Caius, who caused
   contention and discord. The teaching of these men, although it was
   uniform, exceeded the entire range of blasphemies. As they perceived
   that they were after all not of the same heresy, and that they did not
   think alike in any of the points of their evil suggestions, they went
   over to our symbol, so that it might appear as some other document. The
   time was indeed brief, but it was sufficient to refute their opinions.
   In order that the affairs of the Church might not be wrecked by them
   and that the disturbance and tumult which tossed everything to and fro
   might be restrained, it appeared the safe thing to preserve the ancient
   and immovable definitions, and to eject the aforesaid persons from
   communion with us. We have, for this reason, sent our reinstructed
   deputies to your Clemency, and have furnished them with letters,
   declaratory of the sentiments of the council. These deputies have been
   especially charged by us to maintain the truths which were defined
   rightly by the founders, and to instruct your Holiness as to the
   falsity of the assertion of Valens and Ursacius, that a few changes in
   righteous truths would produce peace in the Church. For how can peace
   be reproduced by those who destroy peace? They would be more likely to
   introduce contention and disturbance into the other cities and into the
   Church of Rome. We therefore entreat your Clemency to consider our
   deputies with gentle audience and mild look, and not to allow the dead
   to be dishonored by any novel changes. We pray you to permit us to
   remain in the definitions and decrees which we received from our
   ancestors, who, we would affirm, did their work with ready minds, with
   prudence, and with the Holy Spirit. For these innovations not only lead
   believers to infidelity, but also delude unbelievers to immaturity. We
   likewise entreat you to command that the bishops who are now absent
   from their churches, and of whom some are laboring under the
   infirmities of old age, and others under the privations of poverty, may
   be furnished with the means of returning to their own homes, in order
   that the churches may not be longer deprived of their ministry.

   "Again, we beseech you that nothing be taken away from the former
   decisions, or added to them; let all remain unchanged, even as it has
   been preserved from the piety of your father to the present time; so
   that we may not in future be fatigued, and be compelled to become
   strangers to our own parishes, but that bishops and people may dwell
   together in peace, and be able to devote themselves to prayer and
   supplication for your own personal salvation and empire and peace,
   which may the Deity graciously vouchsafe to you uninterruptedly.

   "Our deputies will show you the signatures and the names of the
   bishops, and some of them will offer instruction to your Holiness out
   of the Sacred Scriptures."

   Chapter XIX.--Concerning the Deputies of the Council and the Emperor's
   Letter; Agreement of the Adherents of Ursacius and Valens afterwards
   with the Letter put forth; Exile of the Archbishops. Concerning the
   Synod at Nicæa, and the Reason why the Synod was held in Ariminum.

   We have now transcribed the letter of the council of Ariminum. Ursacius
   and Valens, with their adherents, anticipating the arrival of the
   deputies of the council, showed to the emperor the document which they
   had read, and calumniated the council. [1331] The emperor was
   displeased at the rejection of this formulary, as it had been composed
   in his presence at Sirmium, and he therefore treated Ursacius and
   Valens with honor; while, on the other hand, he manifested great
   contempt towards the deputies, and even delayed granting them an
   audience. At length, however, he wrote to the Synod, and informed them
   that an expedition which he was compelled to undertake against the
   barbarians prevented him from conferring with the deputies; and that he
   had, therefore, commanded them to remain at Adrianople until his
   return, in order that, when public business had been dismissed, his
   mind might be at liberty to hear and test the representations of the
   deputies; "for it is right," he said, "to bring to the investigation of
   Divine subjects, a mind unfettered by other cares." Such was the strain
   of his letter. [1332]

   The bishops replied that they could never depart from the decision they
   had formed, as they had before declared in writing, and had charged
   their deputies to declare; and they besought him to regard them with
   favor, and to give audience to their deputies, and to read their
   letter. They told him that it must appear grievous to him that so many
   churches should be deprived of their bishops; and that, if agreeable to
   him, they would return to their churches before the winter. After
   writing this letter, which was full of supplications and entreaties,
   the bishops waited for a time for a reply; but as no answer was granted
   them, they afterwards returned to their own cities.

   What I have above stated clearly proves that the bishops who were
   convened at Ariminum confirmed the decrees which had of old been set
   forth at Nicæa. Let us now consider how it was that they eventually
   assented to the formulary of faith compiled by Valens and Ursacius and
   their followers. Various accounts have been given me of this
   transaction. Some say that the emperor was offended at the bishops
   having departed from Ariminum without his permission, and allowed
   Valens and his partisans to govern the churches of the West according
   to their own will, to set forth their own formulary, to eject those who
   refused to sign it from the churches, and to ordain others in their
   place. They say that, taking advantage of this power, Valens compelled
   some of the bishops to sign the formulary, and that he drove many who
   refused compliance, from their churches, and first of all Liberius,
   bishop of Rome. It is further asserted that when Valens and his
   adherents had acted in this manner in Italy, they resolved to handle
   the Eastern churches in the same way. As these persecutors were passing
   through Thrace, they stopped, it is said, at Nicæa, a city of that
   province. They there convened a council, and read the formulary of
   Ariminum, which they had translated into the Greek language, and by
   representing that it had been approved by a general council, they
   obtained its adoption at Nicæa; they then cunningly denominated it the
   Nicæan formulary of faith, in order, by the resemblance of names, to
   deceive the simple, and cause it to be mistaken for the ancient
   formulary set forth by the Nicæan council. Such is the account given by
   some parties. Others say that the bishops who were convened at the
   council of Ariminum were wearied by their detention in that city, as
   the emperor neither honored them with a reply to their letter, nor
   granted them permission to return to their own churches; and that, at
   this juncture, those who had espoused the opposite heresy represented
   to them that it was not right that divisions should exist between the
   priests of the whole world for the sake of one word, and that it was
   only requisite to admit that the Son is like unto the Father in order
   to put an end to all disputes; for that the bishops of the East would
   never rest until the term "substance" was rejected. By these
   representations, it is said, the members of the council were at length
   persuaded to assent to the formulary which Ursacius had so sedulously
   pressed upon them. Ursacius and his partisans, being apprehensive lest
   the deputies sent by the council to the emperor should declare what
   firmness was in the first place evinced by the Western bishops, and
   should expose the true cause of the rejection of the term
   "consubstantial," detained these deputies at Nicæa in Thrace throughout
   the winter, under the pretext that no public conveyance could be then
   obtained, and that the roads were in a bad state for traveling; and
   they then induced them, it is said, to translate the formulary they had
   accepted from Latin into Greek, and to send it to the Eastern bishops.
   By this means, they anticipated that the formulary would produce the
   impression they intended without the fraud being detected; for there
   was no one to testify that the members of the council of Ariminum had
   not voluntarily rejected the term "substance" from deference to the
   Eastern bishops, who were averse to the use of that word. But this was
   evidently a false account; for all the members of the council, with the
   exception of a few, maintained strenuously that the Son is like unto
   the Father in substance, and the only differences of opinion existing
   between them were that some said that the Son is of the same substance
   as the Father, while others asserted that he is of like substance with
   the Father. Some state this matter in one form, others in a different

   Chapter XX.--Events which took place in the Eastern Churches:
   Marathonius, Eleusius of Cyzicus, and Macedonius expel those who
   maintain the Term "Consubstantial." Concerning the Churches of the
   Novatians; how one Church was Transported; the Novatians enter into
   Communion with the Orthodox.

   While the events I have above related were taking place in Italy, the
   East, even before the council of Seleucia had been constituted, was the
   theatre of great disturbances. [1333] The adherents of Acacius and
   Patrophilus, having ejected Maximus, turned over the church of
   Jerusalem to Cyril. Macedonius harassed Constantinople and the
   neighboring cities; he was abetted by Eleusius and Marathonius. This
   latter was originally a deacon in his own church, and was a zealous
   superintendent of the poor of the monastical dwellings inhabited by men
   and women, and Macedonius raised him to the bishopric of Nicomedia.
   Eleusius, who, not without distinction, was formerly attached to the
   military service of the palace, had been ordained bishop of Cyzicus. It
   is said that Eleusius and Marathonius were both good men in their
   conduct, but that they were zealous in persecuting those who maintained
   that the Son is of the same substance as the Father, although they were
   not so distinctly cruel as Macedonius, who not only expelled those who
   refused to hold communion with him, but imprisoned some, and dragged
   others before the tribunals. In many cases he compelled the unwilling
   to communion. He seized children and women who had not been initiated
   and initiated them, and destroyed many churches in different places,
   under the pretext that the emperor had commanded the demolition of all
   houses of prayer in which the Son was recognized to be of the same
   substance as the Father.

   Under this pretext the church of the Novatians at Constantinople,
   situated in that part of the city called Pelargus, was destroyed. It is
   related that these heretics performed a courageous action with the aid
   of the members of the Catholic Church, with whom they made common
   cause. When those who were employed to destroy this church were about
   to commence the work of demolition, the Novatians assembled themselves
   together; some tore down the materials, and others conveyed them to a
   suburb of the city called Sycæ. They quickly achieved this task; for
   men, women, and children participated in it, and by offering their
   labor to God they were extraordinarily inspirited. By the exercise of
   this zeal the church was soon renewed, and, from this circumstance,
   received the name of Anastasia. After the death of Constantius, Julian,
   his successor, granted to the Novatians the ground which they had
   previously possessed, and permitted them to rebuild their church. The
   people spiritedly took advantage of this permission, and transported
   the identical materials of the former edifice from Sycæ. But this
   happened at a later period of time than that which we are now
   reviewing. At this period a union was nearly effected between the
   Novatian and Catholic churches; for as they held the same opinions
   concerning the Godhead, and were subjected to a common persecution, the
   members of both churches assembled and prayed together. The Catholics
   then possessed no houses of prayer, for the Arians had wrested them
   from them. It appears, too, that from the frequent intercourse between
   the members of each church, they reasoned that the differences between
   them were vain, and they resolved to commune with one another. A
   reconciliation would certainly have been effected, I think, had not the
   desire of the multitude been frustrated by the slander of a few
   individuals, who asserted that there was an ancient law prohibiting the
   union of the churches.

   Chapter XXI.--Proceedings of Macedonius in Mantinium. His Removal from
   his See when he attempted to remove the Coffin of Constantine the
   Great. Julian was pronounced Cæsar.

   About the same time Eleusius wholly demolished the church of the
   Novatians in Cyzicus. [1334] The inhabitants of other parts of
   Paphlagonia, and particularly of Mantinium, were subjected to similar
   persecutions. Macedonius, having been apprised that the majority of
   these people were followers of Novatus, and that the ecclesiastical
   power was not of itself sufficiently strong to expel them, persuaded
   the emperor to send four cohorts against them. For he imagined that men
   who are unaccustomed to arms would, on the first appearance of
   soldiers, be seized with terror, and conform to his sentiments. But it
   happened otherwise, for the people of Mantinium armed themselves with
   sickles and axes and whatever other weapons chanced to be at hand, and
   marched against the military. A severe conflict ensued, and many of the
   Paphlagonians fell, but nearly all the soldiers were slain. Many of the
   friends of Macedonius blamed him for having occasioned so great a
   disaster, and the emperor was displeased, and regarded him with less
   favor than before. Inimical feelings were engendered still more
   strongly by another occurrence. Macedonius contemplated the removal of
   the coffin of the Emperor Constantine, as the structure in which it had
   been concealed was falling into ruin. The people were divided in
   opinion on this subject: some concurred in the design, and others
   opposed it, deeming it impious and similar to digging up a grave. Those
   who maintained the Nicene doctrines were of the latter sentiment, and
   insisted that no indignity should be offered to the body of
   Constantine, as that emperor had held the same doctrines as themselves.
   They were besides, I can readily imagine, eager to oppose the projects
   of Macedonius. However, without further delay, Macedonius caused the
   coffin to be conveyed to the same church in which the tomb of Acacius
   the martyr is placed. The people, divided into two factions, the one
   approving, the other condemning the deed, rushed upon each other in the
   same church, and so much carnage ensued that the house of prayer and
   the adjoining place were filled with blood and slaughtered bodies. The
   emperor, who was then in the West, was deeply incensed on hearing of
   this occurrence; and he blamed Macedonius as the cause of the indignity
   offered to his father, and of the slaughter of the people.

   The emperor had determined to visit the East, and held on his way; he
   conferred the title of Cæsar on his cousin Julian, and sent him to
   Western Gaul.

   Chapter XXII.--Council of Seleucia.

   About the same period the Eastern bishops assembled, [1335] to the
   number of about one hundred and sixty, in Seleucia, a city of Isauria.
   This was during the consulate of Eusebius and Hypatius. Leonas, who
   held a brilliant military office at the palace, repaired to this
   council at the command of Constantius, so that the doctrinal confession
   might be conducted in his presence. Lauricius, the military governor of
   the province, was present to prepare whatever might be necessary; for
   the letter of the emperor had commanded him to render this service. At
   the first session of this council, several of the bishops were absent,
   and among others, Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis; Macedonius,
   bishop of Constantinople; and Basil, bishop of Ancyra. They resorted to
   divers pretexts in justification of their non-attendance. Patrophilus
   alleged in excuse a complaint in the eyes, and Macedonius pleaded
   indisposition; but it was suspected they had absented themselves from
   the fear that various accusations would be brought against them. As the
   other bishops refused to enter upon the investigation of disputed
   points during their absence, Leonas commanded them to proceed at once
   to the examination of the questions that had been agitated. Thus some
   were of the opinion that it was necessary to commence with the
   discussion of doctrinal topics, while others maintained that inquiries
   ought first to be instituted into the conduct of those among them
   against whom accusations had been laid, as had been the case with
   Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, Eustathius, bishop of Sebaste, and others.
   The ambiguity of the emperor's letters, which sometimes prescribed one
   course and sometimes another, gave rise to this dispute. The contention
   arising from this source became so fierce, that all union was destroyed
   between them, and they became divided into two parties. However, the
   advice of those who wished to commence with the examination of
   doctrine, prevailed. When they proceeded to the investigation of terms,
   some desired to reject the use of the term "substance," and appealed to
   the authority of the formulary of faith which had not long previously
   been compiled by Mark [1336] at Sirmium, and had been received by the
   bishops who were at the court, among whom was Basil, [1337] bishop of
   Ancyra. Many others were anxious for the adoption of the formulary of
   faith drawn up at the dedication of the church of Antioch. To the first
   of these parties belonged Eudoxius, Acacius, Patrophilus, George,
   bishop of Alexandria, Uranius, bishop of Tyre, and thirty-two other
   bishops. The latter party was supported by George, bishop of Laodicea,
   in Syria; by Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus; by Sophronius, bishop of
   Pompeiopolis, in Paphlagonia; with these the majority agreed. It was
   suspected, and with reason, that Acacius and his partisans absented
   themselves on account of the difference between their sentiments and
   those of the aforesaid bishops, and also because they desired to evade
   the investigation of certain accusations which had been brought against
   them; for, although they had previously acknowledged in writing to
   Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, that the Son is in all respects
   like unto the Father, and of the same substance, now they fought
   entirely shy of their former professions. After prolonged disputations
   and contention, Silvanus, bishop of Tarsus, declared, in a loud and
   peremptory tone, that no new formulary of faith ought to be introduced
   but that which had been approved at Antioch, and this alone ought to
   prevail. As this proposition was repugnant to the followers of Acacius,
   they withdrew, and the other bishops read the formulary of Antioch. The
   following day these bishops assembled in the church, closed the doors,
   and privately confirmed this formulary. Acacius condemned this
   proceeding, and laid the formulary which he advocated before Leonas and
   Lauricius privately. Three days afterwards the same bishops
   reassembled, and were joined by Macedonius and Basil, who had been
   previously absent. Acacius and his partisans declared that they would
   take no part in the proceedings of the council until those who had been
   deposed and accused had quitted the assembly. His demand was complied
   with; for the bishops of the opposite party were determined that he
   should have no pretext for dissolving the council, which was evidently
   his object, in order to prevent the impending examination of the heresy
   of Aëtius, and of the accusations which had been brought against
   himself and his partisans. When all the members were assembled, Leonas
   stated that he held a document which had been handed to him by the
   partisans of Acacius; it was their formulary of faith, with
   introductory remarks. None of the other bishops knew anything about it;
   for Leonas, who was of the same sentiment as Acacius, had willingly
   kept the whole matter a secret. When this document [1338] was read, the
   whole assembly was filled with tumult; for some of the statements it
   contained were to the effect that, though the emperor had prohibited
   the introduction of any term into the formularies of faith which was
   not found in the Sacred Scriptures, yet that bishops who had been
   deposed, having been brought from various provinces to the assembly,
   with others who had been illegally ordained, the council had been
   thrown into confusion, and that some of the members had been insulted,
   and others prevented from speaking. It was added that Acacius and his
   partisans did not reject the formulary which had been compiled at
   Antioch, although those who had assembled in that city had drawn it up
   for the express purpose of meeting the difficulty which had just then
   arisen; but that, as the terms "consubstantial" and "of similar
   substance" had grieved some individuals, and that, as it had been
   recently asserted that the Son is dissimilar from the Father, it was
   necessary, on this account, to reject the terms "consubstantial" and a
   "similar substance," which do not occur in Scripture, to condemn the
   term "dissimilar," and to confess clearly that the Son is like unto the
   Father; for He is, as the Apostle Paul somewhere says, "the image of
   the invisible God." These prefatory observations were followed by a
   formulary, which was neither conformable with that of Nicæa, nor with
   that of Antioch, and which was so artfully worded that the followers of
   Arius and of Aëtius would not appear to be in error if they should thus
   state their faith. In this formulary, the words used by those who had
   convened at Nicæa, in condemnation of the Arian doctrine, were omitted,
   and the declarations of the council of Antioch, concerning the
   immutability of the Deity of the Son, and concerning His being the
   unchangeable image of the substance, the counsel, and the power, and
   the glory of the Father, were passed over in silence, and belief was
   simply expressed in the Father, in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost; and
   after bestowing some vulgar epithets on a few individuals who had never
   entered into any doctrinal contention on one side or the other, all
   those who entertained any other opinions than those set forth in this
   formulary were declared to be aliens to the Catholic Church. Such were
   the contents of the document presented by Leonas, and which had been
   signed by Acacius, and by those who had adopted his sentiments. After
   it had been read, Sophronius, a bishop of Paphlagonia, exclaimed, "If
   we daily receive the opinions of individuals as a statement of the
   faith, we shall fail in attaining precision of the truth." Acacius
   having retorted that it was not forbidden to compile new formularies,
   as that of Nicæa had been once and frequently altered, Eleusius replied
   as follows: "But the council has not now met for the purpose of
   learning what is already known, or of accepting any other formulary
   than that which has been already approved by those who assembled at
   Antioch; and, moreover, living and dying, we will adhere to this
   formulary." The dispute having taken this turn, they entered upon
   another inquiry, and asked the partisans of Acacius, in what they
   considered the Son to be like unto the Father. They replied that the
   Son is similar in will only, but not in substance, and the others
   thereupon insisted that He is similar in substance, and convicted
   Acacius, by a work which he had formerly written, that he had once been
   of their opinion. Acacius replied that he ought not to be judged from
   his own writings; and the dispute had continued with heat for some
   time, when Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus, spoke as follows: "It matters
   little to the council whether Mark or Basil has transgressed in any
   way, whether they or the adherents of Acacius have any accusation to
   bring against each other; neither does the trouble devolve upon the
   council of examining whether their formulary be commendable or
   otherwise; it is enough to maintain the formulary which has been
   already confirmed at Antioch by ninety-seven priests; and if any one
   desire to introduce any doctrine which is not contained therein, he
   ought to be held as an alien to religion and the Church." Those who
   were of his sentiments applauded his speech; and the assembly then
   arose and separated. The following day, the partisans of Acacius and of
   George refused to attend the council; and Leonas, who had now openly
   declared himself to be of their sentiments, likewise refused, in spite
   of all entreaties, to repair thither. Those who were deputed to request
   his attendance found the partisans of Acacius in his house; and he
   declined their invitation, under the plea that too much discord
   prevailed in the council, and that he had only been commanded by the
   emperor to attend the council in case of unanimity among the members.
   Much time was consumed in this way; and the partisans of Acacius were
   frequently solicited by the other bishops to attend the assemblies; but
   they sometimes demanded a special conference in the house of Leonas,
   and sometimes alleged that they had been commissioned by the emperor to
   judge those who had been accused; for they would not receive the creed
   adopted by the other bishops, nor clear themselves of the crimes of
   which they had been accused; neither would they examine the case of
   Cyril, whom they had deposed; and there was no one to compel them to do
   so. The council, however, eventually deposed George, bishop of
   Alexandria; Acacius, bishop of Cæsarea; Uranius, bishop of Tyre;
   Patrophilus, bishop of Scythopolis; and Eudoxius, bishop of Antioch;
   and several other prelates. Many persons were likewise put out of
   communion until they could purge themselves of the crimes imputed to
   them. The transactions were conveyed in writing to the parish of each
   of the clergy. Adrian, [1339] a presbyter of Antioch, was ordained
   bishop over that church, in room of Eudoxius; but the partisans of
   Acacius arrested him and delivered him over to Leonas and Lauricius.
   They committed him into the custody of the soldiers, but afterwards
   sent him into exile.

   We have now given a brief account of the termination of the council of
   Seleucia. Those who desire more detailed information must seek it in
   the acts of the council, [1340] which have been transcribed by
   attendant shorthand writers.

   Chapter XXIII.--Acacius and Aëtius; and how the Deputies of the Two
   Councils of Ariminum and of Seleucia were led by the Emperor to accept
   the Same Doctrines.

   Immediately after the above transactions, the adherents of Acacius
   repaired to the emperor; [1341] but the other bishops returned to their
   respective homes. The ten bishops who had been unanimously chosen as
   deputies to the emperor, met, on their arrival at the court, the ten
   deputies [1342] of the council of Ariminum, and likewise the partisans
   of Acacius. These latter had gained over to their cause the chief men
   attached to the palace, and, through their influence, had secured the
   favor of the emperor. It was reported that some of these proselytes had
   espoused the sentiments of Acacius at some previous period; that some
   were bribed by means of the wealth belonging to the churches; and that
   others were seduced by the subtilty of the arguments presented to them,
   and by the dignity of the persuader. Acacius was, in fact, no common
   character; by nature he was gifted with great powers of intellect and
   eloquence, and he exhibited no want of skill or of address in the
   accomplishment of his schemes. He was the president of an illustrious
   church, and could boast of Eusebius Pamphilus as his teacher, whom he
   succeeded in the episcopate, and was more honorably known than any
   other man by the reputation and succession of his books. Endowed with
   all these advantages, he succeeded with ease in whatever he undertook.

   As there were at this period at Constantinople all together twenty
   deputies, ten from each council, besides many other bishops, who, from
   various motives, had repaired to the city, Honoratus, [1343] whom the
   emperor, before his departure to the West, had constituted chief
   governor of Constantinople, received directions to examine, in the
   presence of the exarchs of the great council, the reports circulated
   concerning Aëtius and his heresy. Constantius, with some of the rulers,
   eventually undertook the investigation of this case; and as it was
   proved that Aëtius had introduced dogmas essentially opposed to the
   faith, the emperor and the other judges were offended at his
   blasphemous statements. It is said that the partisans of Acacius at
   first feigned ignorance of this heresy, for the purpose of inducing the
   emperor and those around him to take cognizance of it; for they
   imagined that the eloquence of Aëtius would be irresistible; that he
   would infallibly succeed in convincing his auditory; and that his
   heresy would conquer the unwilling. When, however, the result proved
   the futility of their expectations, they demanded that the formulary of
   faith accepted by the council of Ariminum should receive the sanction
   of the deputies from the council of Seleucia. As these latter protested
   that they would never renounce the use of the term "substance," the
   Acacians declared to them upon oath that they did not hold the Son to
   be, in substance, dissimilar from the Father; but that, on the
   contrary, they were ready to denounce this opinion as heresy. They
   added that they esteemed the formulary compiled by the Western bishops
   at Ariminum the more highly, because the word "substance" had been
   unexpectedly expunged from it; because, they said, if this formulary
   were to be received, there would be no further mention, either of the
   word "substance" or of the term "consubstantial," to which many of the
   Western priests were, from their reverence for the Nicæan council,
   peculiarly attached.

   It was for these reasons that the emperor approved of the formulary;
   and when he recalled to mind the great number of bishops who had been
   convened at Ariminum, and reflected that there is no error in saying
   either that "the Son is like unto the Father" or "of the same substance
   as the Father"; and when he further considered that no difference in
   signification would ensue, if, for terms which do not occur in
   Scripture, other equivalent and uncontrovertible expressions were to be
   substituted (such, for instance, as the word "similar"), he determined
   upon giving his sanction to the formulary. Such being his own
   sentiments, he commanded the bishops to accept the formulary. The next
   day preparations were made for the pompous ceremony of proclaiming him
   consul, which, according to the Roman custom, took place in the
   beginning of the month of January, and the whole of that day and part
   of the ensuing night the emperor spent with the bishops, and at length
   succeeded in persuading the deputies of the council of Seleucia to
   receive the formulary transmitted from Ariminum.

   Chapter XXIV.--Formulary of the Council of Ariminum approved by the
   Acacians. List of the Deposed Chief-Priests, and the Causes of their
   Condemnation.

   The partisans of Acacius [1344] remained some time at Constantinople,
   and invited thither several bishops of Bithynia, among whom were Maris,
   bishop of Chalcedon, and Ulfilas, bishop of the Goths. These prelates
   having assembled together, in number about fifty, they confirmed the
   formulary read at the council of Ariminum, adding this provision, that
   the terms "substance " and "hypostasis" should never again be used in
   reference to God. They also declared that all other formularies set
   forth in times past, as likewise those that might be compiled at any
   future period, should be condemned. They then deposed Aëtius from his
   office of deacon, because he had written works full of contention and
   of a species of vain knowledge opposed to the ecclesiastical vocation;
   because he had used in writing and in disputation several impious
   expressions; and because he had been the occasion of troubles and
   seditions in the Church. It was alleged by many that they did not
   depose him willingly, but merely because they wished to remove all
   suspicion from the mind of the emperor which he had with regard to
   them, for they had been accused of holding Aëtian views. Those who held
   these sentiments took advantage of the resentment with which, for
   reasons above mentioned, the emperor regarded Macedonius, and they
   accordingly deposed him, and likewise Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus;
   Basil, bishop of Ancyra; Heortasius, bishop of Sardis; and Dracontius,
   bishop of Pergamus. Although they differed about doctrine from those
   bishops, yet in deposing them, no blame was thrown upon their faith,
   but charges were alleged against them in common with all, that they had
   disturbed the peace and violated the laws of the Church. They
   specified, in particular, that when the presbyter Diogenes was
   traveling from Alexandria to Ancyra, Basil seized his papers, and
   struck him; they also deposed that Basil had, without trial, delivered
   over many of the clergy from Antioch, from the banks of the Euphrates,
   and from Cilicia, Galatia, and Asia, to the rulers of the provinces, to
   be exiled and subjected to cruel punishments, so that many had been
   loaded with chains, and had been compelled to bribe the soldiers, who
   were conducting them away, not to ill-use them. They added that, on one
   occasion, when the emperor had commanded Aëtius and some of his
   followers to be led before Cecropius, that they might answer to him for
   various accusations laid to their charge, Basil recommended the person
   who was intrusted with the execution of this edict, to act according to
   the dictates of his own judgment. They said that he wrote directions to
   Hermogenes, [1345] the prefect and governor of Syria, stating who were
   to be banished, and whither they were to be sent; and that, when the
   exiles were recalled by the emperor, he would not consent to their
   return, but opposed himself to the wishes of the rulers and of the
   priests. They further deposed that Basil had excited the clergy of
   Sirimium against Germanius; and that, although he stated in writing
   that he had admitted Germanius, Valens, and Ursacius into communion, he
   had placed them as criminals before the tribunal of the African
   bishops; and that, when taxed with this deed, he had denied it, and
   perjured himself; and that, when he was afterwards convicted, he strove
   to justify his perjury by sophistical reasoning. They added, that he
   had been the cause of contention and of sedition in Illyria, Italy,
   Africa, and in the Roman church; that he had thrown a servant into
   prison to compel her to bear false witness against her mistress; that
   he had baptized a man of loose life, who lived in illicit intercourse
   with a woman, and had promoted him to be a deacon; that he had
   neglected to excommunicate a quack-doctor who had occasioned the death
   of several persons; and that he and some of the clergy had bound
   themselves by oath before the holy table, not to bring accusations
   against each other. This, they said, was an artifice adopted by the
   president of the clergy to shield himself from the accusations of his
   plaintiffs. In short, such were the reasons they specified for the
   deposition of Basil. Eustathius, they said, was deposed because, when a
   presbyter, he had been condemned, and put away from the communion of
   prayers by Eulalius, his own father, who was bishop of the church of
   Cæsarea, in Cappadocia; and also because he had been excommunicated by
   a council held at Neocæsarea, a city of Pontus, and deposed by
   Eusebius, bishop of Constantinople, for unfaithfulness in the discharge
   of certain duties that had devolved upon him. He had also been deprived
   of his bishopric by those who were convened in Gangroe, on account of
   his having taught, acted, and thought contrary to sound doctrine. He
   had been convicted of perjury by the council of Antioch. He had
   likewise endeavored to reverse the decrees of those convened at
   Melitina; and, although he was guilty of many crimes, he had the
   assurance to aspire to be judge over the others, and to stigmatize them
   as heretics. They deposed Eleusius because he had raised
   inconsiderately one Heraclius, a native of Tyre, to be a deacon; this
   man had been a priest of Hercules at Tyre, had been accused of and
   tried for sorcery, and, therefore, had retired to Cyzicus and feigned
   conversion to Christianity; and moreover, Eleusius, after having been
   apprised of these circumstances, had not driven him from the Church. He
   had also, without inquiry, ordained certain individuals, who had come
   to Cyzicus, after they had been condemned by Maris, bishop of
   Chalcedonia, who participated in this council. Heortasius was deposed
   because he had been ordained bishop of Sardis without the sanction of
   the bishops of Lydia. They deposed Dracontius, bishop of Pergamus,
   because he had previously held another bishopric in Galatia, and
   because, they stated, he had on both occasions been unlawfully
   ordained. After these transactions, a second assembly of the council
   was held, and Silvanus, bishop of Tarsus, Sophronius, bishop of
   Pompeiopolis in Paphlagonia, Elpidius, bishop of Satala, and Neonas,
   bishop of Seleucia in Isauria, were deposed. The reason they assigned
   for the deposition of Silvanus was, that he had constituted himself the
   leader of a foolish party in Seleucia and Constantinople; he had,
   besides, constituted Theophilus as president of the church of
   Castabala, who had been previously ordained bishop of Eleutheropolis by
   the bishops of Palestine, and who had promised upon oath that he would
   never accept any other bishopric without their permission. Sophronius
   was deposed on account of his avarice, and on account of his having
   sold some of the offerings presented to the church, for his own profit;
   besides, after he had received a first and second summons to appear
   before the council, he could, at last, be scarcely induced to make his
   appearance, and then, instead of replying to the accusations brought
   against him, he appealed to other judges. Neonas was deposed for having
   resorted to violence in his endeavors to procure the ordination in his
   own church, of Annianus, who had been appointed bishop of Antioch,
   [1346] and for having ordained as bishops certain individuals who had
   previously been engaged in politics, and who were utterly ignorant of
   the Holy Scriptures and of ecclesiastical canons, and who, after their
   ordination, preferred the enjoyment of their property to that of the
   priestly dignity, and declared in writing that they would rather take
   charge of their own possessions than to discharge the episcopal
   functions without them. Elpidius was deposed because he had
   participated in the malpractices of Basil, and had occasioned great
   disorders; and because he had, contrary to the decrees of the council
   of Melitina, restored to his former rank in the presbytery a man named
   Eusebius, who had been deposed for having created Nectaria a deaconess,
   after she had been excommunicated on account of violating agreements
   and oaths; and to confer this honor upon her was clearly contrary to
   the laws of the Church.

   Chapter XXV.--Causes of the Deposition of Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem.
   Mutual Dissensions among the Bishops. Melitius is ordained by the
   Arians, and supplants Eustathius in the Bishopric of Sebaste.

   Besides the prelates above mentioned, Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, was
   deposed [1347] because he had admitted Eustathius and Elpidius into
   communion, after they had opposed the decrees enacted by those convened
   at Melitina, among whom was Cyril himself; and because he had also
   received Basil and George, bishop of Laodicea, into communion after
   their deposition in Palestine. When Cyril was first installed in the
   bishopric of Jerusalem, he had a dispute with Acacius, bishop of
   Cæsarea, concerning his rights as a Metropolitan, which he claimed on
   the ground of his bishopric being an apostolic see. This dispute
   excited feelings of enmity between the two bishops, and they mutually
   accused each other of unsoundness of doctrine concerning the Godhead.
   In fact, they had both been suspected previously; the one, that is,
   Acacius, of favoring the heresy of Arius; and the other, of siding with
   those who maintain that the Son is in substance like unto the Father.
   Acacius being thus inimically disposed towards Cyril, and finding
   himself supported by the bishops of the province, who were of the same
   sentiments as himself, contrived to depose Cyril under the following
   pretext. Jerusalem and the neighboring country was at one time visited
   with a famine, and the poor appealed in great multitudes to Cyril, as
   their bishop, for necessary food. As he had no money to purchase the
   requisite provisions, he sold for this purpose the veil and sacred
   ornaments of the church. It is said that a man, having recognized an
   offering which he had presented at the altar as forming part of the
   costume of an actress, made it his business to inquire whence it was
   procured; and ascertained that a merchant had sold it to the actress,
   and that the bishop had sold it to the merchant. It was under this
   pretext that Acacius deposed Cyril.

   And on inquiry I find these to be the facts. It is said that the
   Acacians then expelled from Constantinople all the bishops above
   mentioned who had been deposed. Ten bishops of their own party who had
   refused to subscribe to these edicts of deposition, were separated from
   the others, and were interdicted from performing the functions of the
   ministry or ruling their churches until they consented to give their
   signatures. It was enacted that unless they complied within six months,
   [1348] and yielded their assent to all the decrees of the council, they
   should be deposed, and that the bishops of every province should be
   summoned to elect other bishops in their stead. After these
   determinations and deeds, letters were then sent to all the bishops and
   clergy, to observe and fulfill its decrees.

   As a consequence, not long after, some of the Eudoxian party were
   substituted here and there. Eudoxius himself took possession of the
   bishopric of Macedonius; Athanasius was placed over the church of
   Basil; and Eunomius, who was subsequently the leader of a heresy
   bearing his name, took the see of Eleusius; and Meletius was appointed
   to the church of Sebaste, instead of Eustathius.

   Chapter XXVI.--Death of Macedonius, Bishop of Constantinople. What
   Eudoxius said in his Teaching. Eudoxius and Acacius strenuously sought
   the Abolition of the Formularies of Faith set forth at Nicæa and at
   Ariminum; Troubles which thence arose in the Churches.

   Macedonius, [1349] on his expulsion from the church of Constantinople,
   retired to one of the suburbs of the city, where he died. Eudoxius took
   possession of his church in the tenth year of the consulate of
   Constantius, and the third of Julian, surnamed Cæsar. It is related
   that, at the dedication of the great church called "Sophia," when he
   rose to teach the people, he commenced his discourse with the following
   proposition: "The Father is impious, the Son is pious"; and that, as
   these words excited a great commotion among the people, he added, "Be
   calm; the Father is impious, because he worships no one; the Son is
   pious, because he worships the Father." On this explanation, he threw
   his audience into laughter. Eudoxius and Acacius jointly exerted
   themselves to the utmost in endeavoring to cause the edicts of the
   Nicene Council to fall into oblivion. They sent the formulary read at
   Ariminum with various explanatory additions of their own, to every
   province of the empire, and procured from the emperor an edict for the
   banishment of all who should refuse to subscribe to it. But this
   undertaking, which appeared to them so easy of execution, was the
   beginning of the greatest calamities, for it excited commotions
   throughout the empire, and entailed upon the Church in every region a
   persecution more grievous than those which it had suffered under the
   pagan emperors. [1350] For if this persecution did not occasion such
   tortures to the body as the preceding ones, it appeared more grievous
   to all who reflected aright, on account of its disgraceful nature; for
   both the persecutors and the persecuted belonged to the Church; and the
   one was all the more disgraceful in that men of the same religion
   treated their fellows with a degree of cruelty which the ecclesiastical
   laws prohibit to be manifested towards enemies and strangers.

   Chapter XXVII.--Macedonius, after his Rejection from his See,
   blasphemes against the Holy Spirit; Propagation of his Heresy through
   the Instrumentality of Marathonius and Others.

   The spirit of innovation is self-laudatory, [1351] and hence it
   advanced further and further, and crept along to greater novelties with
   increasing self-conceit, and in scorn of the fathers it enacted laws of
   its own, nor does it honor the doctrines of the ancients concerning
   God, but is always thinking out strange dogmas and restlessly adds
   novelty to novelty as the events now show. For after Macedonius had
   been deposed from the church of Constantinople, he renounced the tenets
   of Acacius and Eudoxius. [1352] He began to teach that the Son is God,
   and that He is in all respects and in substance like unto the Father.
   But he affirmed that the Holy Ghost is not a participant of the same
   dignities, and designated Him a minister and a servant, and applied to
   Him whatever could, without error, be said of the holy angels. This
   doctrine was embraced by Eleusius, Eustathius, and by all the other
   bishops who had been deposed at Constantinople, by the partisans of the
   opposite heresy. Their example was quickly followed by no small part of
   the people of Constantinople, Bithynia, Thrace, the Hellespont, and of
   the neighboring provinces. For their mode of life had no little
   influence, and to this do the people give special attention. They
   assumed great gravity of demeanor, and their discipline was like that
   of the monks; their conversation was plain and of a style fitted to
   persuade. It is said that all these qualifications were united in
   Marathonius. He originally held a public appointment in the army, under
   the command of the prefect. After amassing some money in this
   employment, he quit military science, and undertook the superintendence
   of the establishments for the relief of the sick and the destitute.
   Afterwards, at the suggestion of Eustathius, bishop of Sebaste, he
   embraced an ascetic mode of life, and founded a monastical institution
   in Constantinople which exists to the present day. He brought so much
   zeal, and so much of his own wealth to the support of the aforesaid
   heresy, that the Macedonians were by many termed Marathonians, and it
   seems to me not without reason; for it appears that he alone, together
   with his institutions, was the cause that it was not altogether
   extinguished in Constantinople. In fact, after the deposition of
   Macedonius, the Macedonians possessed neither churches nor bishops
   until the reign of Arcadius. [1353]

   The Arians, who drove out of the churches and rigorously persecuted all
   who held different sentiments from themselves, deprived them of all
   these privileges. It would be no easy task to enumerate the names of
   the priests who were at this period ejected from their own cities; for
   I believe that no province of the empire was exempted from such a
   calamity.

   Chapter XXVIII.--The Arians, under the Impression that the divine
   Meletius upheld their Sentiments, translate him from Sebaste to
   Antioch. On his Bold Confession of the Orthodox Doctrines, they were
   confounded, and after they had deposed him they placed Euzoïus in the
   See. Meletius formed his own Church: but those who held to
   Consubstantiality turned away from him because he had been ordained by
   Arians.

   At the period that Eudoxius obtained the government of the church of
   Constantinople, [1354] there were many aspirants to the see of Antioch;
   and as is frequently the case under such circumstances, contentions and
   seditions divided the clergy and the people of that church.

   Each party was anxious to commit the government of the church to a
   bishop of its own persuasion; for interminable disputes concerning
   doctrine were rampant among them, and they could not agree as to the
   mode of singing psalms; and, as has been before stated, psalms were
   sung by each individual, in conformity with his own peculiar creed.
   Such being the state of the church at Antioch, the partisans of
   Eudoxius thought it would be well to intrust the bishopric of that city
   to Meletius, then bishop of Sebaste, he being possessed of great and
   persuasive eloquence, of excellent life, and all, as they imagined,
   being of like opinions with themselves. They believed that his
   reputation would attract the inhabitants of Antioch and of the
   neighboring cities to conform to their heresy, particularly those
   called Eustathians, who had adhered invariably to the Nicene doctrines.
   But their expectations were utterly frustrated. It is said that on his
   first arrival in Antioch, an immense multitude, composed of Arians, and
   of those who were in communion with Paulinus, flocked around him. Some
   wished to see the man because his fame was great, even before his
   coming; others were anxious to hear what he had to say, and to
   ascertain the nature of his opinions; for a report had been spread
   abroad which was afterwards proved to be true, that he maintained the
   doctrines of those convened at Nicæa. In his first discourses he
   confined himself to instructing the people in what we call ethics;
   afterwards, however, he openly declared that the Son is of the same
   substance as the Father. It is said that at these words, the arch
   deacon of the church, who was then one of the clergy there, stretched
   out his hand, and covered the mouth of the preacher; but that he
   continued to explain his sentiments more clearly by means of his
   fingers than he could by language. He extended three fingers only
   towards the people, closed them, and then allowed only one finger to
   remain extended, and thus expressed by signs what he was prevented from
   uttering. As the archdeacon, in his embarrassment, seized the hand, he
   released the mouth; the tongue was free, and Meletius declared his
   opinion still more clearly and with a loud voice, and exhorted his
   auditors to adhere to the tenets of the council of Nicæa, and he
   testified to his hearers that those who held other views deviated from
   the truth. As he persisted in the enunciation of the same sentiments,
   either by word of mouth or by means of signs, when the archdeacon
   closed his mouth, a contention between both sides occurred, not unlike
   that of the pancratium; the followers of Eustathius shouted aloud and
   rejoiced and leaped, while the Arians were cast down. Eudoxius and his
   partisans were transported with indignation at this discourse, and
   contrived by their machinations to expel Meletius from Antioch. Soon
   afterwards, however, they recalled him, for they fancied he had
   renounced his former sentiments and had espoused theirs. As, however,
   it soon became apparent that his devotion to the Nicene doctrines was
   firm and unalterable, he was ejected from the church, and banished by
   order of the emperor; and the see of Antioch was conferred on Euzoïus,
   who had formerly been banished with Arius. The followers of Meletius
   separated themselves from the Arians, and held their assemblies apart,
   for those who had from the beginning maintained that the Son is
   consubstantial with the Father refused to admit them into communion,
   because Meletius had been ordained by Arian bishops, and because his
   followers had been baptized by Arian priests. For this reason they were
   separated, although holding the same views.

   The emperor having been informed that an Insurrection was about to
   arise in Persia, repaired to Antioch.

   Chapter XXIX.--The Partisans of Acacius again do not remain Quiet, but
   strive to abolish the Term "Consubstantial," and to confirm the Heresy
   of Arius.

   The partisans of Acacius [1355] were not able to remain in
   tranquillity; and they therefore assembled together with a few others
   in Antioch, and condemned the decrees which they had themselves
   enacted. They decided to erase the term "similar" from the formulary
   which had been read at Ariminum and at Constantinople, and affirmed
   that in all respects, in substance and in will, the Son is dissimilar
   from the Father, and that He proceeded from what had no previous
   existence, even as Arius had taught from the commencement. They were
   joined by the partisans of Aëtius, who had been the first after Arius
   to venture openly upon the profession of these opinions; hence Aëtius
   was called atheist, and his approvers, Anomians and Exucontians.

   When those who maintained the Nicene doctrines demanded of the Acacians
   how they could say that the Son is dissimilar from the Father, and that
   He proceeded out of nothing, when it was affirmed in their own
   formulary that He is "God of God," they replied that the Apostle Paul
   had declared that "All things are of God," [1356] and that the Son is
   included in the term "all things"; and that it was in this sense, and
   in accordance with the Sacred Scriptures, that the expressions in their
   formulary were to be understood. Such were the equivocations and
   sophistry to which they had recourse. At length, finding that they
   could advance no efficient argument to justify themselves in the
   opinion of those who pressed them on this point, they withdrew from the
   assembly, after the formulary of Constantinople had been read a second
   time, and returned to their own cities.

   Chapter XXX.--George, Bishop of Antioch, and the Chief-Priests of
   Jerusalem. Three Chief-Priests successively succeed Cyril; Restoration
   of Cyril to the See of Jerusalem.

   During this period, [1357] Athanasius was obliged to remain in
   concealment, and George returned to Alexandria, and commenced a cruel
   persecution against the pagans, and against the Christians who differed
   from him in opinion. He compelled both parties to offer worship in the
   mode he indicated, and where opposition was made, he enforced obedience
   by compulsion. He was hated by the rulers because he scorned them and
   was giving orders to the officers; and the multitude detested him on
   account of his tyranny, for his power was greater than all the rest.
   The pagans regarded him with even greater aversion than the Christians,
   because he prohibited them from offering sacrifices, and from
   celebrating their ancestral festivals; and because he had on one
   occasion, introduced the governor of Egypt [1358] and armed soldiery
   into the city, and despoiled their images, votives and temple
   ornaments. This was, in fact, the cause of his death, on which I will
   dwell.

   On the deposition of Cyril, Erennius obtained the church of Jerusalem;
   [1359] he was succeeded by Heraclius, and to Heraclius succeeded
   Hilarius; for we have gathered from tradition that in that period these
   persons administered the church there, until the reign of Theodosius,
   when Cyril was once more restored to his own see.

   Book V.

   Chapter I.--Apostasy of Julian, the Traitor. Death of the Emperor
   Constantius.

   Such were the transactions which took [1360] place in the Eastern
   Church. In the meantime, however, Julian, the Cæsar, attacked and
   conquered the barbarians who dwelt on the banks of the Rhine; many he
   killed, and others he took prisoners. As the victory added greatly to
   his fame, and as his moderation and gentleness had endeared him to the
   troops, they proclaimed him Augustus. Far from making an excuse to
   Constantius for this act, he exchanged the officers who had been
   elected by Constantius, and industriously circulated letters wherein
   Constantius had solicited the barbarians to enter the Roman
   territories, and aid him against Magnentius. He then suddenly changed
   his religion, and although he had previously confessed Christianity, he
   declared himself high-priest, frequented the pagan temples, offered
   sacrifices, and invited his subjects to adopt that form of worship.

   As an invasion of Roman territory by the Persians was expected, and as
   Constantius had on this account repaired to Syria, Julian conceived
   that he might without battle render himself master of Illyricum; he
   therefore set out on his journey to this province, under pretense that
   he intended to present an apology to Constantius for having, without
   his sanction, received the symbols of imperial power. It is said, that
   when he arrived on the borders of Illyria, the vines appeared full of
   green grapes, although the time of the vintage was past, and the
   Pleiades had set; and that there fell upon his followers a dashing of
   the dew from the atmosphere, of which each drop was stamped with the
   sign of the cross. He and many of those with him regarded the grapes
   appearing out of season as a favorable omen; while the dew had made
   that figure by chance on the garments upon which it happened to fall.

   Others thought that of the two symbols, the one of the green grapes
   signified that the emperor would die prematurely, and his reign would
   be very short; while the second sign, that of the crosses formed by the
   drops of dew, indicated that the Christian religion is from heaven, and
   that all persons ought to receive the sign of the cross. I am, for my
   own part, convinced that those who regarded these two phenomena as
   unfavorable omens for Julian, were not mistaken; and the progress of
   time proved the accuracy of their opinion.

   When Constantius heard that Julian was marching against him at the head
   of an army, he abandoned his intended expedition against the Persians,
   and departed for Constantinople; but he died on the journey, when he
   had arrived as far as Mopsucrenæ, which lies near the Taurus, between
   Cilicia and Cappadocia.

   He died in the forty-fifth year of his age, after reigning thirteen
   years conjointly with his father Constantine, and twenty-five years
   after the death of that emperor.

   A little while after the decease of Constantius, Julian, who had
   already made himself master of Thrace, entered Constantinople and was
   proclaimed emperor. Pagans assert that diviners and demons had
   predicted the death of Constantius, and the change in affairs, before
   his departure for Galatia, and had advised him to undertake the
   expedition. This might have been regarded as a true prediction, had not
   the life of Julian been terminated so shortly afterwards, and when he
   had only tasted the imperial power as in a dream. But it appears to me
   absurd to believe that, after he had heard the death of Constantius
   predicted, and had been warned that it would be his own fate to fall in
   battle by the hands of the Persians, he should have leaped into
   manifest death,--offering him no other fame in the world than that of
   lack of counsel, and poor generalship,--and who, had he lived, would
   probably have suffered the greater part of the Roman territories to
   fall under the Persian yoke. This observation, however, is only
   inserted lest I should be blamed for omitting it. I leave every one to
   form his own opinion.

   Chapter II.--The Life, Education, and Training of Julian, and his
   Accession to the Empire.

   Immediately after the death of Constantius, [1361] the dread of a
   persecution arose in the Church, and Christians suffered more anguish
   from the anticipation of this calamity than they would have experienced
   from its actual occurrence. This state of feeling proceeded from the
   fact that a long interval had made them unaccustomed to such dangers,
   and from the remembrance of the tortures which had been exercised by
   the tyrants upon their fathers, and from their knowledge of the hatred
   with which the emperor regarded their doctrines. It is said that he
   openly renounced the faith of Christ so entirely, that he by sacrifices
   and expiations, which the pagans call renunciatory, and by the blood of
   animals, purged himself of our baptism. From that period he employed
   himself in auguries and in the celebration of the pagan rites, both
   publicly and privately. It is related [1362] that one day, as he was
   inspecting the entrails of a victim, he beheld among them a cross
   encompassed with a crown. This appearance terrified those who were
   assisting in the ceremony, for they judged that it indicated the
   strength of religion, and the eternal duration of the Christian
   doctrines; inasmuch as the crown by which it was encircled is the
   symbol of victory, and because of its continuity, for the circle
   beginning everywhere and ending in itself, has no limits in any
   direction. The chief augur commanded Julian to be of good cheer,
   because in his judgment the victims were propitious, and since they
   surrounded the symbol of the Christian doctrine, and was indeed pushing
   into it, so that it would not spread and expand itself where it wished,
   since it was limited by the circumference of the circle.

   I have also heard that one day Julian descended into a most noted and
   terrific adytum, [1363] either for the purpose of participating in some
   initiation, or of consulting an oracle; and that, by means of machinery
   which is devised for this end, or of enchantments, such frightful
   specters were projected suddenly before him, that through perturbation
   and fear, he became forgetful of those who were present, for he had
   turned to his new religion when already a man, and so unconsciously
   fell into his earlier habit, and signed himself with the symbol of
   Christ, just as the Christian encompassed with untried dangers is wont
   to do. Immediately the specters disappeared and their designs were
   frustrated. The initiator was at first surprised at this, but when
   apprised of the cause of the flight of the demons, he declared that the
   act was a profanation; and after exhorting the emperor to be courageous
   and to have no recourse in deed or thought to anything connected with
   the Christian religion, he again conducted him to the initiation. The
   zeal of the king for such matters saddened the Christians not a little
   and made them extremely anxious, more especially as he had been himself
   formerly a Christian. He was born of pious parents, had been initiated
   in infancy according to the custom of the Church, and had been brought
   up in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, and was nurtured by bishops
   and men of the Church. He and Gallus were the sons of Constantius, the
   brother by the same father of Constantine the emperor, and of
   Dalmatius. Dalmatius had a son of the same name, who was declared
   Cæsar, and was slain by the soldiery after the death of Constantine.
   His fate would have been shared by Gallus and Julian, who were then
   orphans, had not Gallus been spared on account of a disease under which
   he was laboring, and from which, it was supposed, that he would soon
   naturally die; and Julian, on account of his extreme youth, for he was
   but eight years of age. After this wonderful preservation, a residence
   was assigned to the two brothers in a palace called Macellum, situated
   in Cappadocia; this imperial post was near Mount Argeus, and not far
   from Cæsarea; it contained a magnificent palace and was adorned with
   baths, gardens, and perennial fountains. Here they were cultured and
   educated in a manner corresponding to the dignity of their birth; they
   were taught the sciences and bodily exercises befitting their age, by
   masters of languages and interpreters of the Holy Scriptures, so that
   they were enrolled among the clergy, and read the ecclesiastical books
   to the people. Their habits and actions indicated no dereliction from
   piety. They respected the clergy and other good people and persons
   zealous for doctrine; they repaired regularly to church and rendered
   due homage to the tombs of the martyrs.

   It is said that they undertook to deposit the tomb of St. Mammas [1364]
   the martyr in a large edifice, and to divide the labor between
   themselves, and that while they were trying to excel one another in a
   rivalry of honor, an event occurred which was so astonishing that it
   would indeed be utterly incredible were it not for the testimony of
   many who are still among us, who heard it from those who were
   eyewitnesses of the transaction.

   The part of the edifice upon which Gallus labored advanced rapidly and
   according to wish, but of the section upon which Julian labored, a part
   fell into ruin; another was projected upward from the earth; a third
   immediately on its touching the foundation could not be held upright,
   but was hurled backward as if some resistant and strong force from
   beneath were pushing against it.

   This was universally regarded as a prodigy. The people, however, drew
   no conclusion from it till subsequent events manifested its import.
   There were a few who from that moment doubted the reality of Julian's
   religion, and suspected that he only made an outward profession of
   piety for fear of displeasing the emperor, who was then a Christian,
   and that he concealed his own sentiments because it was not safe to
   divulge them. It is asserted that he was first secretly led to renounce
   the religion of his fathers by his intercourse with diviners; for when
   the resentment of Constantius against the two brothers was abated,
   Gallus went to Asia, and took up his residence in Ephesus, where the
   greater part of his property was situated; and Julian repaired to
   Constantinople, and frequented the schools, where his fine natural
   abilities and ready attainments in the sciences did not remain
   concealed. He appeared in public in the garb of a private individual,
   and had much company; but because he was related to the emperor and was
   capable of conducting affairs and was expected to become emperor,
   considerable talk about him to this effect was prevalent, as is wont to
   be the case in a populous and imperial city, he was commanded to retire
   to Nicomedia.

   Here he became acquainted with Maximus, an Ephesian philosopher, [1365]
   who instructed him in philosophy, and inspired him with hatred towards
   the Christian religion, and moreover assured him that the much talked
   of prophecy about him was true. Julian, as happens in many cases, while
   suffering in anticipation of severe circumstances, was softened by
   these favorable hopes and held Maximus as his friend. As these
   occurrences reached the ears of Constantius, Julian became
   apprehensive, and accordingly shaved himself, and adopted externally
   the monkish mode of life, while he secretly held to the other religion.

   When he arrived at the age of manhood, he was more readily infatuated,
   and yet was anxious about these tendencies; and admiring the art (if
   there be such an art) of predicting the future, he thought the
   knowledge of it necessary; he advanced to such experiments as are not
   lawful for Christians. From this period he had as his friends those who
   followed this art. In this opinion, he came into Asia from Nicomedia,
   and there consorting with men of such practices, he became more ardent
   in the pursuit of divination.

   When Gallus, his brother, who had been established as Cæsar, was put to
   death on being accused of revolution, Constantius also suspected Julian
   of cherishing the love of empire, and therefore put him under the
   custody of guards.

   Eusebia, the wife of Constantius, obtained for him permission to retire
   to Athens; and he accordingly settled there, under pretext of attending
   the pagan exercises and schools; but as rumor says, he communed with
   diviners concerning his future prospects. Constantius recalled him, and
   proclaimed him Cæsar, promised him his sister Constantia [1366] in
   marriage, and sent him to Gaul; for the barbarians whose aid had been
   hired by Constantius previously against Magnentius, finding that their
   services were not required, had portioned out that country. As Julian
   was very young, generals, to whom the prudential affairs were turned
   over, were sent with him; but as these generals abandoned themselves to
   pleasure, he was present as Cæsar, and provided for the war. He
   confirmed his soldiers in their spirit for battle, and urged them in
   other ways to incur danger; he also ordered that a fixed reward should
   be given to each one who should slay a barbarian. After he had thus
   secured the affections of the soldiery, he wrote to Constantius,
   acquainting him with the levity of the generals; and when another
   general had been sent, he attacked the barbarians, and obtained the
   victory. They sent embassies to beg for peace, and showed the letter in
   which Constantius had requested them to enter the Roman dominions. He
   purposely delayed to send the ambassador back; he attacked a number of
   the enemy unexpectedly and conquered them.

   Some have said that Constantius, with designed enmity, committed this
   campaign to him; [1367] but this does not appear probable to me. For,
   as it rested with Constantius alone to nominate him Cæsar, why did he
   confer that title upon him? Why did he give him his sister in marriage,
   or hear his complaints against the inefficient generals, and send a
   competent one in their stead in order to complete the war, if he were
   not friendly to Julian?

   But as I conjecture, he conferred on him the title of Cæsar because he
   was well disposed to Julian; but that after Julian had, without his
   sanction, been proclaimed emperor, he plotted against him through the
   barbarians on the Rhine; and this, I think, resulted either from the
   dread that Julian would seek revenge for the ill-treatment he and his
   brother Gallus had experienced during their youth, or as would be
   natural, from jealousy of his attaining similar honor. But a great
   variety of opinions are entertained on this subject.

   Chapter III.--Julian, on his Settlement in the Empire, began quietly to
   stir up Opposition to Christianity, and to introduce Paganism artfully.

   When Julian found himself sole possessor of the empire, [1368] he
   commanded that all the pagan temples should be reopened throughout the
   East; that those which had been neglected should be repaired; that
   those which had fallen into ruins should be rebuilt, and that the
   altars should be restored. He assigned considerable money for this
   purpose; he restored the customs of antiquity and the ancestral
   ceremonies in the cities, and the practice of offering sacrifice.

   He himself offered libations openly and publicly sacrificed; bestowed
   honors on those who were zealous in the performance of these
   ceremonies; restored the initiators and the priests, the hierophants
   and the servants of the images, to their old privileges; and confirmed
   the legislation of former emperors in their behalf; he conceded
   exemption from duties and from other burdens as was their previous
   right; he restored the provisions, which had been abolished, to the
   temple guardians, and commanded them to be pure from meats, and to
   abstain from whatever according to pagan saying was befitting him who
   had announced his purpose of leading a pure life.

   He also ordered that the nilometer and the symbols and the former
   ancestral tablets should be cared for in the temple of Serapis, instead
   of being deposited, according to the regulation, established by
   Constantine, in the church. He wrote frequently to the inhabitants of
   those cities in which he knew paganism was nourished, and urged them to
   ask what gifts they might desire. Towards the Christians, on the
   contrary, he openly manifested his aversion, refusing to honor them
   with his presence, or to receive their deputies who were delegated to
   report about grievances.

   When the inhabitants of Nisibis sent to implore his aid against the
   Persians, who were on the point of invading the Roman territories, he
   refused to assist them because they were wholly Christianized, and
   would neither reopen their temples nor resort to the sacred places; he
   threatened that he would not help them, nor receive their embassy, nor
   approach to enter their city before he should hear that they had
   returned to paganism.

   He likewise accused the inhabitants of Constantia in Palestine, of
   attachment to Christianity, and rendered their city tributary to that
   of Gaza. Constantia, as we stated before, was formerly called Majuma,
   and was used as a harbor for the vessels of Gaza; but on hearing that
   the majority of its inhabitants were Christians, Constantine elevated
   it to the dignity of a city, and conferred upon it the name of his own
   son, and a separate form of government; for he considered that it ought
   not to be dependent on Gaza, a city addicted to pagan rites. On the
   accession of Julian, the citizens of Gaza went to law against those of
   Constantia. The emperor himself sat as judge, and decided in favor of
   Gaza, and commanded that Constantia should be an appendage to that
   city, although it was situated at a distance of twenty stadia.

   Its former name having been abolished by him, it has since been
   denominated the maritime region of Gaza. They have now the same city
   magistrates, military officers, and public regulations. With respect to
   ecclesiastical concerns, however, they may still be regarded as two
   cities. They have each their own bishop and their own clergy; they
   celebrate festivals in honor of their respective martyrs, and in memory
   of the priests who successively ruled them; and the boundaries of the
   adjacent fields by which the altars belonging to the bishops are
   divided, are still preserved.

   It happened within our own remembrance that an attempt was made by the
   bishop of Gaza, on the death of the president of the church at Majuma,
   to unite the clergy of that town with those under his own jurisdiction;
   and the plea he advanced was, that it was not lawful for two bishops to
   preside over one city. The inhabitants of Majuma opposed this scheme,
   and the council of the province took cognizance of the dispute, and
   ordained another bishop. The council decided that it was altogether
   right for those who had been deemed worthy of the honors of a city on
   account of their piety, not to be deprived of the privilege conferred
   upon the priesthood and rank of their churches, through the decision of
   a pagan emperor, who had taken a different ground of action.

   But these events occurred at a later period than that now under review.

   Chapter IV.--Julian inflicted Evils upon the Inhabitants of Cæsarea.
   Bold Fidelity of Maris, Bishop of Chalcedon.

   About the same time, the emperor erased Cæsarea, [1369] the large and
   wealthy metropolis of Cappadocia, situated near Mount Argeus, from the
   catalogue of cities, and even deprived it of the name of Cæsarea, which
   had been conferred upon it during the reign of Claudius Cæsar, its
   former name having been Mazaca. [1370] He had long regarded the
   inhabitants of this city with extreme aversion, because they were
   zealously attached to Christianity, and had formerly destroyed the
   temple of the ancestral Apollo and that of Jupiter, the tutelar deity
   of the city. The temple dedicated to Fortune, [1371] the only one
   remaining in the city, was overturned by the Christians after his
   accession; and on hearing of the deed, he hated the entire city
   intensely and could scarce endure it. He also blamed the pagans, who
   were few in number, but who ought, he said, to have hastened to the
   temple, and, if necessary, to have suffered cheerfully for Fortune. He
   caused all possessions and money belonging to the churches of the city
   and suburbs of Cæsarea to be rigorously sought out and carried away;
   about three hundred pounds of gold, obtained from this source, were
   conveyed to the public treasury. He also commanded that all the clergy
   should be enrolled among the troops under the governor of the province,
   which is accounted the most arduous and least honorable service among
   the Romans.

   He ordered the Christian populace to be numbered, women and children
   inclusive, and imposed taxes upon them as onerous as those to which
   villages are subjected.

   He further threatened that, unless their temples were speedily
   re-erected, his wrath would not be appeased, but would be visited on
   the city, until none of the Galileans remained in existence; for this
   was the name which, in derision, he was wont to give to the Christians.
   There is no doubt but that his menaces would have been fully executed
   had not death quickly intervened.

   It was not from any feeling of compassion towards the Christians that
   he treated them at first with greater humanity than had been evinced by
   former persecutors, but because he had discovered that paganism had
   derived no advantage from their tortures, while Christianity had been
   especially increased, and had become more honored by the fortitude of
   those who died in defense of the faith.

   It was simply from envy of their glory, that instead of employing fire
   and the sword against them, and maltreating their bodies like former
   persecutors, and instead of casting them into the sea, or burying them
   alive in order to compel them to a change of sentiment, he had recourse
   to argument and persuasion, and sought by these means to reduce them to
   paganism; he expected to gain his ends more easily by abandoning all
   violent measures, and by the manifestation of unexpected benevolence.
   It is said that on one occasion, when he was sacrificing in the temple
   of Fortune at Constantinople, Maris, [1372] bishop of Chalcedon,
   presented himself before him, and publicly rebuked him as an irreligous
   man, an atheist, and an apostate. Julian had nothing in return to
   reproach him with except his blindness, for his sight was impaired by
   old age, and he was led by a child. According to his usual custom of
   uttering blasphemies against Christ, Julian afterward added in
   derision, "The Galilean, thy God, will not cure thee." Maris replied, I
   thank God for my blindness, since it prevents me from beholding one who
   has fallen away from our religion.' Julian passed on without giving a
   reply, for he considered that paganism would be more advanced by a
   personal and unexpected exhibition of patience and mildness towards
   Christians.

   Chapter V.--Julian restores Liberty to the Christians, in order to
   execute Further Troubles in the Church. The Evil Treatment of
   Christians he devised.

   It was from these motives that Julian recalled from exile [1373] all
   Christians who, during the reign of Constantius, had been banished on
   account of their religious sentiments, and restored to them their
   property that had been confiscated by law. He charged the people not to
   commit any act of injustice against the Christians, not to insult them,
   and not to constrain them to offer sacrifice unwillingly. He commanded
   that if they should of their own accord desire to draw near the altars,
   they were first to appease the wrath of the demons, whom the pagans
   regard as capable of averting evil, and to purify themselves by the
   customary course of expiations. He deprived the clergy, however, of the
   immunities, honors, and provisions which Constantine had conferred;
   [1374] repealed the laws which had been enacted in their favor, and
   reinforced their statute liabilities. He even compelled the virgins and
   widows, who, on account of their poverty, were reckoned among the
   clergy, to refund the provision which had been assigned them from
   public sources. For when Constantine adjusted the temporal concerns of
   the Church, he devoted a sufficient portion of the taxes raised upon
   every city, to the support of the clergy everywhere; and to ensure the
   stability of this arrangement he enacted a law which has continued in
   force from the death of Julian to the present day. They say these
   transactions were very cruel and rigorous, as appears by the receipts
   given by the receivers of the money to those from whom it had been
   extorted, and which were designed to show that the property received in
   accordance with the law of Constantine had been refunded.

   Nothing, however, could diminish the enmity of the ruler against
   religion. In the intensity of his hatred against the faith, he seized
   every opportunity to ruin the Church. He deprived it of its property,
   votives, and sacred vessels, and condemned those who had demolished
   temples during the reign of Constantine and Constantius, to rebuild
   them, or to defray the expenses of their re-erection. On this ground,
   since they were unable to pay the sums and also on account of the
   inquisition for sacred money, many of the priests, clergy, and the
   other Christians were cruelly tortured and cast into prison.

   It may be concluded from what has been said, that if Julian shed less
   blood than preceding persecutors of the Church, and that if he devised
   fewer punishments for the torture of the body, yet that he was severer
   in other respects; for he appears as inflicting evil upon it in every
   way, except that he recalled the priests who had been condemned to
   banishment by the Emperor Constantius; but it is said he issued this
   order in their behalf, not out of mercy, but that through contention
   among themselves, the churches might be involved in fraternal strife,
   and might fail of her own rights, or because he wanted to asperse
   Constantius; for he supposed that he could render the dead monarch
   odious to almost all his subjects, by favoring the pagans who were of
   the same sentiments as himself, and by showing compassion to those who
   had suffered for Christ, as having been treated unjustly. He expelled
   the eunuchs from the palaces, because the late emperor had been well
   affected towards them. He condemned Eusebius, the governor of the
   imperial court, to death, from a suspicion he entertained that it was
   at his suggestion that Gallus his brother had been slain. He recalled
   Aëtius, the leader of the Eunomian heresy, [1375] from the region
   whither Constantius had banished him, who had been otherwise suspected
   on account of his intimacy with Gallus; and to him Julian sent letters
   full of benignity, and furnished him with public conveyances. For a
   similar reason he condemned Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus, under the
   heaviest penalty, to rebuild, within two months, and at his own
   expense, a church belonging to the Novatians which he had destroyed
   under Constantius. Many other things might be found which he did from
   hatred to his predecessor, either himself effecting these or permitting
   others to accomplish them.

   Chapter VI.--Athanasius, after having been Seven Years concealed in the
   House of a Wise and Beautiful Virgin, reappears at that time in Public,
   and enters the Church of Alexandria.

   At this period, Athanasius, who had long remained in concealment,
   having heard of the death of Constantius, appeared by night in the
   church at Alexandria. [1376] His unexpected appearance excited the
   greatest astonishment. He had escaped falling into the hands of the
   governor of Egypt, who, at the command of the emperor, and at the
   request of the friends of George, had formed plans to arrest him, as
   before stated, and had concealed himself in the house of a holy virgin
   in Alexandria. It is said that she was endowed with such extraordinary
   beauty, that those who beheld her regarded her as a phenomenon of
   nature; and that men who possessed continence and prudence, kept aloof
   from her in order that no blame might be attached to them by the
   suspicious. She was in the very flower of youth and was exceedingly
   modest and prudent, qualities which are wont alone to adorn the body
   even to a refinement of beauty when nature may not be helpful with the
   gift. For it is not true, as some assert, that "as is the body, so is
   the soul." On the contrary, the habit of the body is imaged forth by
   the operation of the soul, and any one who is active in any way
   whatever will appear to be of that nature as long as he may be thus
   actively engaged.

   This is a truth I think admitted by all who have accurately
   investigated the subject. It is related that Athanasius sought refuge
   in the house of this holy virgin by the revelation of God, who designed
   to save him in this manner.

   When I reflect on the result which ensued, I cannot doubt but that all
   the events were directed by God; so that the relatives of Athanasius
   might not have distress if any one had attempted to trouble them about
   him, and had they been compelled to swear. There was nothing to excite
   suspicion of a priest being concealed in the house of so lovely a
   virgin. However, she had the courage to receive him, and through her
   prudence preserved his life. She was his most faithful keeper and
   assiduous servant; for she washed his feet and brought him food, and
   she alone served in every other necessity, which nature demands in her
   exacting uses; the books he stood in need of she cared for through the
   help of others; during the long time in which these services were
   rendered, none of the inhabitants of Alexandria knew anything about it.

   Chapter VII.--Violent Death and Triumph of George, Bishop of
   Alexandria. The Result of Certain Occurrences in the Temple of Mithra.
   Letter of Julian on this Aggravated Circumstance.

   After Athanasius had been preserved in this wise and appeared suddenly
   in the church, no one knew whence he came. [1377] The people of
   Alexandria, however, rejoiced at his return, and restored his churches
   to him.

   The Arians, being thus expelled from the churches, were compelled to
   hold their assemblies in private houses, and constituted Lucius, in the
   place of George, as the bishop of their heresy. George had been already
   slain; for when the magistrates had announced to the public the decease
   of Constantius, and that Julian was sole ruler, the pagans of
   Alexandria rose up in sedition. They attacked George with shouts and
   reproaches as if they would kill him at once. The repellants of this
   precipitate attack, then put him in prison; a little while after they
   rushed, early in the morning, to the prison, killed him, flung the
   corpse upon a camel, and after exposing it to every insult during the
   day, burnt it at nightfall. I am not ignorant that the Arian heretics
   assert that George received this cruel treatment from the followers of
   Athanasius; but it seems to me more probable that the perpetrators of
   these deeds were the pagans; for they had more cause than any other
   body of men to hate him, especially on account of the insults be
   offered their images and their temples; and having, moreover,
   prohibited them from sacrificing, or performing the ancestral rites.
   Besides, the influence he had acquired in the palaces intensified the
   hatred towards him; and as the people are wont to feel towards those in
   power, they regarded him as unendurable.

   A calamity had also taken place at a spot called Mithrium; it was
   originally a desert, and Constantius had bestowed it on the church of
   Alexandria. While George was clearing the ground, in order to erect a
   house of prayer, an adytum was discovered. In it were found idols and
   certain instruments for initiation or perfection which seemed ludicrous
   and strange to the beholders. The Christians caused them to be publicly
   exhibited, and made a procession in order to nettle the pagans; but the
   pagans gathered a multitude together, and rushed upon and attacked the
   Christians, after arming themselves with swords, stones, and whatever
   weapon came first to hand. They slew many of the Christians, and, in
   derision of their religion, crucified others, and they left many
   wounded.

   This led to the abandonment of the work that had been commenced by the
   Christians, while the pagans murdered George as soon as they had heard
   of the accession of Julian to the empire. This fact is admitted by that
   emperor himself, which he would not have confessed unless he had been
   forced by the truth; for he would rather, I think, have had the
   Christians, whoever they were, than the pagans to be the murderers of
   George; but it could not be concealed. It is apparent in the letter
   which he wrote on the subject to the inhabitants of Alexandria, [1378]
   wherein he expresses severe opinions. In this epistle he only censures
   and passes over the punishment; for he said that he feared Serapis,
   their tutelary divinity, and Alexander their founder, and Julian, his
   own uncle, who formerly was governor of Egypt and of Alexandria. This
   latter was so favorable to paganism and hated Christianity so
   exceedingly, that contrary to the wishes of the emperor, he persecuted
   the Christians unto death.

   Chapter VIII.--Concerning Theodore, the Keeper of the Sacred Vessels of
   Antioch. How Julian, the Uncle of the Traitor, on Account of these
   Vessels, falls a Prey to Worms.

   It is said that when Julian, the uncle of the emperor, [1379] was
   intent upon removing the votive gifts of the church of Antioch, which
   were many and costly, and placing them in the imperial treasury, and
   also closing the places of prayer, all the clergy fled. One presbyter,
   by name Theodoritus, alone did not leave the city; Julian seized him,
   as the keeper of the treasures, and as capable of giving information
   concerning them, and maltreated him terribly; finally he ordered him to
   be slain with the sword, after he had responded bravely under every
   torture and had been well approved by his doctrinal confessions. When
   Julian had made a booty of the sacred vessels, he flung them upon the
   ground and began to mock; after blaspheming Christ as much as he
   wished, he sat upon the vessels and augmented his insulting acts.
   Immediately his genitals and rectum were corrupted; their flesh became
   putrescent, and was changed into worms. The disease was beyond the
   skill of the physicians. However, from reverence and fear for the
   emperor, they resorted to experiments with all manner of drugs, and the
   most costly and the fattest birds were slain, and their fat was applied
   to the corrupted parts, in the hope that the worms might be thereby
   attracted to the surface, but this was of no effect; for being deep
   buried, they crept into the living flesh, and did not cease their
   gnawing until they put an end to his life. It seemed that this calamity
   was an infliction of Divine wrath, because the keeper of the imperial
   treasures, and other of the chief officers of the court who had made
   sport of the Church, died in an extraordinary and dreadful manner,
   [1380] as if condemned by Divine wrath.

   Chapter IX.--Martyrdom of the Saints Eusebius, Nestabus, and Zeno in
   the City of Gaza.

   As I have advanced thus far in my history, and have given an account of
   the death of George and of Theodoritus, I deem it right to relate some
   particulars concerning the death of the three brethren, Eusebius,
   Nestabus, and Zeno. [1381] The inhabitants of Gaza, being inflamed with
   rage against them, dragged them from their house, in which they had
   concealed themselves and cast them into prison, and beat them. They
   then assembled in the theater, and cried out loudly against them,
   declaring that they had committed sacrilege in their temple, and had
   used the past opportunity for the injury and insult of paganism. By
   these shouts and by instigating one another to the murder of the
   brethren, they were filled with fury; and when they had been mutually
   incited, as a crowd in revolt is wont to do, they rushed to the prison.
   They handled the men very cruelly; sometimes with the face and
   sometimes with the back upon the ground, the victims were dragged
   along, and were dashed to pieces by the pavement. I have been told that
   even women quitted their distaffs and pierced them with the
   weaving-spindles, and that the cooks in the markets snatched from their
   stands the boiling pots foaming with hot water and poured it over the
   victims, or perforated them with spits. When they had torn the flesh
   from them and crushed in their skulls, so that the brain ran out on the
   ground, their bodies were dragged out of the city and flung on the spot
   generally used as a receptacle for the carcasses of beasts; then a
   large fire was lighted, and they burned the bodies; the remnant of the
   bones not consumed by the fire was mixed with those of camels and
   asses, that they might not be found easily. But they were not long
   concealed; for a Christian woman, who was an inhabitant, though not a
   native of Gaza, collected the bones at night by the direction of God.
   She put them in an earthen pot and gave them to Zeno, their cousin, to
   keep, for thus God had informed her in a dream, and also had indicated
   to the woman where the man lived: and before she saw him, he was shown
   to her, for she was previously unacquainted with Zeno; and when the
   persecution had been agitated recently he remained concealed. He was
   within a little of being seized by the people of Gaza and being put to
   death; but he had effected his escape while the people were occupied in
   the murder of his cousins, and had fled to Anthedon, a maritime city,
   about twenty stadia from Gaza and similarly favorable to paganism and
   devoted to idolatry. When the inhabitants of this city discovered that
   he was a Christian, they beat him terribly on the back with rods and
   drove him out of the city. He then fled to the harbor of Gaza and
   concealed himself; and here the woman found him and gave him the
   remains. He kept them carefully in his house until the reign of
   Theodosius, when he was ordained bishop; and he erected a house of
   prayer beyond the walls of the city, placed an altar there, and
   deposited the bones of the martyrs near those of Nestor, the Confessor.
   Nestor had been on terms of intimacy with his cousins, and was seized
   with them by the people of Gaza, imprisoned, and scourged. But those
   who dragged him through the city were affected by his personal beauty;
   and, struck with compassion, they cast him, before he was quite dead,
   out of the city. Some persons found him, and carried him to the house
   of Zeno, where he expired during the dressing of his cuts and wounds.
   When the inhabitants of Gaza began to reflect on the enormity of their
   crime, they trembled lest the emperor should take vengeance on them.

   It was reported that the emperor was filled with indignation, and had
   determined upon punishing the decuria; but this report was false, and
   had no foundation save in the fears and self-accusations of the
   criminals. Julian, far from evincing as much anger against them as he
   had manifested against the Alexandrians on the murder of George, did
   not even write to rebuke the people of Gaza. On the contrary, he
   deposed the governor of the province, and held him as a suspect, and
   represented that clemency alone prevented his being put to death. The
   crime imputed to him was, that of having arrested some of the
   inhabitants of Gaza, who were reported to have begun the sedition and
   murders, and of having imprisoned them until judgment could be passed
   upon them in accordance with the laws. "For what right had he," asked
   the emperor, "to arrest the citizens merely for retaliating on a few
   Galileans the injuries that had been inflicted on them and their gods?"
   This, it is said, was the fact in the case.

   Chapter X.--Concerning St. Hilarion and the Virgins in Heliopolis who
   were destroyed by Swine. Strange Martyrdom of Mark, Bishop of Arethusa.

   At the same period the inhabitants of Gaza sought for the monk
   Hilarion; but he had fled to Sicily. [1382] Here he employed himself in
   collecting wood in the deserts and on the mountains, which he carried
   on his shoulders for sale in the cities, and, by these means, obtained
   sufficient food for the support of the body. But as he was at length
   recognized by a man of quality whom he had dispossessed of a demon, he
   retired to Dalmatia, where, by the power of God, he performed numerous
   miracles, and through prayer, repressed an inundation of the sea and
   restored the waves to their proper bounds, and again departed, for it
   was no joy to him to live among those who praised him; but when he
   changed his place of abode, he was desirous of being unobserved and by
   frequent migrations to be rid of the fame which prevailed about him.
   Eventually he sailed for the island of Cyprus, but touched at Paphos,
   and, at the entreaty of the bishop of Cyprus, he loved the life there
   and practiced philosophy at a place called Charburis.

   Here he only escaped martyrdom by flight; for he fled in compliance
   with the Divine precept which commands us not to expose ourselves to
   persecution; but that if we fall into the hands of persecutors, to
   overcome by our own fortitude the violence of our oppressors.

   The inhabitants of Gaza and of Alexandria were not the only citizens
   who exercised such atrocities against the Christians as those I have
   described. The inhabitants of Heliopolis, near Mount Libanus, and of
   Arethusa in Syria, seem to have surpassed them in excess of cruelty.
   [1383] The former were guilty of an act of barbarity which could
   scarcely be credited, had it not been corroborated by the testimony of
   those who witnessed it. They stripped the holy virgins, who had never
   been looked upon by the multitude, of their garments, and exposed them
   in a state of nudity as a public spectacle and objects of insult. After
   numerous other inflictions they at last shaved them, ripped them open,
   and concealed in their viscera the food usually given to pigs; and
   since the swine could not distinguish, but were impelled by the need of
   their customary food, they also tore in pieces the human flesh.

   I am convinced that the citizens of Heliopolis perpetrated this
   barbarity against the holy virgins on account of the prohibition of the
   ancient custom of yielding up virgins to prostitution with any chance
   comer before being united in marriage to their betrothed. This custom
   was prohibited by a law enacted by Constantine, after he had destroyed
   the temple of Venus at Heliopolis, and erected a church upon its ruins.
   [1384]

   Mark, bishop of Arethusa, [1385] an old man and venerable for his gray
   hairs and life, was put to a very cruel death by the inhabitants of
   that city, who had long entertained inimical feelings against him,
   because, during the reign of Constantine, he had more spiritedly than
   persuasively elevated the pagans to Christianity, and had demolished a
   most sacred and magnificent temple. On the accession of Julian he saw
   that the people were excited against the bishop; an edict was issued
   commanding the bishop either to defray the expenses of its re-erection,
   or to rebuild the temple. Reflecting that the one was impossible and
   the other unlawful for a Christian and still less for a priest, he at
   first fled from the city. On hearing, however, that many were suffering
   on his account, that some were dragged before the tribunals and others
   tortured, he returned, and offered to suffer whatever the multitude
   might choose to inflict upon him. The entire people, instead of
   admiring him the more as having manifested a deed befitting a
   philosopher, conceived that he was actuated by contempt towards them,
   and rushed upon him, dragged him through the streets, pressing and
   plucking and beating whatever member each one happened upon. People of
   each sex and of all ages joined with alacrity and fury in this
   atrocious proceeding. His ears were severed by fine ropes; the boys who
   frequented the schools made game of him by tossing him aloft and
   rolling him over and over, sending him forward, catching him up, and
   unsparingly piercing him with their styles. When his whole body was
   covered with wounds, and he nevertheless was still breathing, they
   anointed him with honey and a certain mixture, and placing him in a
   fish-basket made of woven rushes, raised him up on an eminence. It is
   said that while he was in this position, and the wasps and bees lit
   upon him and consumed his flesh, he told the inhabitants of Arethusa
   that he was raised up above them, and could look down upon them below
   him, and that this reminded him of the difference that would exist
   between them in the life to come. It is also related that the prefect
   [1386] who, although a pagan, was of such noble conduct that his memory
   is still honored in that country, admired the self-control of Mark, and
   boldly uttered reproaches against the emperor for allowing himself to
   be vanquished by an old man, who was exposed to innumerable tortures;
   and he added that such proceedings reflected ridicule on the emperor,
   while the names of the persecuted were at the same time rendered
   illustrious. Thus did the blessed one [1387] endure all the torments
   inflicted upon him by the inhabitants of Arethusa with such unshaken
   fortitude that even the pagans praised him.

   Chapter XI.--Concerning Macedonius, Theodulus, Gratian, Busiris, Basil,
   and Eupsychius, who suffered Martyrdom in those Times.

   About the same period, Macedonius, Theodulus, and Tatian, who were
   Phrygians by birth, courageously endured martyrdom. [1388] A temple of
   Misos, a city of Phrygia, having been reopened by the governor of the
   province, after it had been closed many years, these martyrs entered
   therein by night, and destroyed the images. As other individuals were
   arrested, and were on the point of being punished for the deed, they
   avowed themselves the actors in the transaction. They might have
   escaped all further punishment by offering sacrifices to idols; but the
   governor could not persuade them to accept acquittal on these terms.
   His persuasions being ineffectual, he maltreated them in a variety of
   forms, and finally extended them on a gridiron, beneath which a fire
   had been lighted. While they were being consumed, they said to the
   governor, "Amachus (for that was his name), "if you desire cooked
   flesh, give orders that our bodies may be turned with the other side to
   the fire, in order that we may not seem, to your taste, half cooked."
   Thus did these men nobly endure and lay down their life amid the
   punishments.

   It is said that Busiris also obtained renown at Ancyra, a city of
   Galatia, by his brilliant and most manly confession of religion. He
   belonged to the heresy denominated Eucratites; the governor of the
   province apprehended and designed to maltreat him for ridiculing the
   pagans. He led him forth publicly to the torture chamber and commanded
   that he should be elevated. Busiris raised both hands to his head so as
   to leave his sides exposed, and told the governor that it would be
   useless for the executioners to lift him up to the instrument of
   torture and afterwards to lower him, as he was ready without this to
   yield to the tortures as much as might be desired. The governor was
   surprised at this proposition; but his astonishment was increased by
   what followed, for Busiris remained firm, holding up both hands and
   receiving the blows while his sides were being torn with hooks,
   according to the governor's direction. Immediately afterwards, Busiris
   was consigned to prison, but was released not long subsequently, on the
   announcement of the death of Julian. He lived till the reign of
   Theodosius, renounced his former heresy, and joined the Catholic
   Church.

   It is said that about this period, Basil, [1389] presbyter of the
   church of Ancyra, and Eupsychius, [1390] a noble of Cæsarea in
   Cappadocia, who had but just taken to himself a wife and was still a
   bridegroom, terminated their lives by martyrdom. I believe that
   Eupsychius was condemned in consequence of the demolition of the temple
   of Fortune, which, as I have already stated, excited the anger of the
   emperor against all the inhabitants of Cæsarea. Indeed, all the actors
   in this transaction were condemned, some to death, and others to
   banishment. Basil had long manifested great zeal in defense of the
   faith, and had opposed the Arians during the reign of Constantius;
   hence the partisans of Eudoxius had prohibited him from holding public
   assemblies. On the accession of Julian, however, he traveled hither and
   thither, publicly and openly exhorting the Christians to cleave to
   their own doctrines, and to refrain from defiling themselves with pagan
   sacrifices and libations. He urged them to account as nothing the
   honors which the emperor might bestow upon them, such honors being but
   of short duration, and leading to eternal infamy. His zeal had already
   rendered him an object of suspicion and of hatred to the pagans, when
   one day he chanced to pass by and see them offering sacrifice. He
   sighed deeply, and uttered a prayer to the effect that no Christian
   might be suffered to fall into similar delusion. He was seized on the
   spot, and conveyed to the governor of the province. Many tortures were
   inflicted on him; and in the manly endurance of this anguish he
   received the crown of martyrdom.

   Even if these cruelties were perpetrated contrary to the will of the
   emperor, yet they serve to prove that his reign was signalized by
   martyrs neither ignoble nor few.

   For the sake of clearness, I have related all these occurrences
   collectively, although the martyrdoms really occurred at different
   periods.

   Chapter XII.--Concerning Lucifer and Eusebius, Bishops of the West.
   Eusebius with Athanasius the Great and Other Bishops collect a Council
   at Alexandria, and confirm the Nicene Faith by defining the
   Consubstantiality of the Spirit with the Father and the Son. Their
   Decree concerning Substance and Hypostasis.

   After the return of Athanasius, Lucifer, bishop of Cagliari in
   Sardinia, and Eusebius, bishop of Vercelli, a city of Liguria in Italy,
   returned from the upper Thebaïs. [1391] They had been condemned by
   Constantius to perpetual exile in that country. For the regulation and
   general systematizing of ecclesiastical affairs, Eusebius came to
   Alexandria, and there, in concert with Athanasius, to hold a council
   for the purpose of confirming the Nicene doctrines.

   Lucifer sent a deacon with Eusebius to take his place in the council,
   and went himself to Antioch, to visit the church there in its
   disturbances.

   A schism had been excited by the Arians then under the guidance of
   Euzoïus, and by the followers of Meletius, who, as I have above stated,
   were at variance even with those who held the same opinions as
   themselves. As Meletius had not then returned from exile, Lucifer
   ordained Paulinus bishop. [1392]

   In the meantime, the bishops of many cities had assembled in Alexandria
   with Athanasius and Eusebius, and had confirmed the Nicene doctrines.
   They confessed that the Holy Ghost is of the same substance as the
   Father and the Son, and they made use of the term "Trinity."

   They declared that the human nature assumed by God the Word is to be
   regarded as consisting of not a perfect body only, but also of a
   perfect soul, even as was taught by the ancient Church philosophers. As
   the Church had been agitated by questions concerning the terms
   "substance" and "hypostasis," and the contentions and disputes about
   these words had been frequent, they decreed, and, as I think, wisely,
   that these terms should not henceforth at the beginning be used in
   reference to God, except in refutation of the Sabellian tenet; lest
   from the paucity of terms, one and the same thing might appear to be
   called by three names; but that one might understand each by its
   peculiar term in a threefold way.

   These were the decrees passed by the bishops convened at Alexandria.
   Athanasius read in the council the document about his flight which he
   had written in order to justify himself. [1393]

   Chapter XIII.--Concerning Paulinus and Meletius, Chief-Priests of
   Antioch; how Eusebius and Lucifer antagonized One Another; Eusebius and
   Hilarius defend the Nicene Faith.

   On the termination of the council, Eusebius repaired to Antioch and
   found dissension prevailing among the people. [1394] Those who were
   attached to Meletius would not join Paulinus, but held their assemblies
   apart. Eusebius was much grieved at the state of affairs; for the
   ordination ought not to have taken place without the unanimous consent
   of the people; yet, from respect towards Lucifer, he did not openly
   express his dissatisfaction.

   He refused to hold communion with either party, but promised to redress
   their respective grievances by means of a council. While he was thus
   striving to restore concord and unanimity, Meletius returned from
   exile, and, finding that those who held his sentiments had seceded from
   the other party, he held meetings with them beyond the walls of the
   city. Paulinus, in the meantime, assembled his own party within the
   city; for his mildness, his virtuous life, and his advanced age had so
   far won the respect of Euzoïus, the Arian president, that, instead of
   being expelled from the city, a church had been assigned him for his
   own use. Eusebius, on finding all his endeavors for the restoration of
   concord frustrated, quitted Antioch. Lucifer fancied himself injured by
   him, because he had refused to approve the ordination of Paulinus; and,
   in displeasure, seceded from communion with him. As if purely from the
   desire of contention, Lucifer then began to cast aspersions on the
   enactments of the council of Alexandria; and in this way he seems to
   have originated the heresy which has been called after him, Luciferian.

   Those who espoused his cause seceded from the church; but, although he
   was deeply chagrined at the aspect affairs had taken, yet, because he
   had deputed a deacon to accompany Eusebius in lieu of himself, he
   yielded to the decrees of the council of Alexandria, and conformed to
   the doctrines of the Catholic Church. About this period he repaired to
   Sardinia.

   In the meantime Eusebius traversed the Eastern provinces, restored
   those who had declined from the faith, and taught them what it was
   necessary to believe. After passing through Illyria, he went to Italy,
   and there he met with Hilarius, bishop of Poictiers [1395] in
   Aquitania. Hilarius had returned from exile before Eusebius, and had
   taught the Italians and the Gauls what doctrines they had to receive,
   and what to reject; he expressed himself with great eloquence in the
   Latin tongue, and wrote many admirable works, it is said, in refutation
   of the Arian dogmas. Thus did Hilarius and Eusebius maintain the
   doctrines of the Nicæan council in the regions of the West.

   Chapter XIV.--The Partisans of Macedonius disputed with the Arians
   concerning Acacius.

   At this period the adherents of Macedonius, among whom were Eleusius,
   Eustathius, and Sophronius, who now began openly to be called
   Macedonians, as constituting a distinct sect, adopted the bold measure
   on the death of Constantius, of calling together those of their own
   sentiments who had been convened at Seleucia, and of holding several
   councils. They condemned the partisans of Acacius and the faith which
   had been established at Ariminum, and confirmed the doctrines which had
   been set forth at Antioch, and afterwards approved at Seleucia.

   When interrogated as to the cause of their dispute with the partisans
   of Acacius, with whom, as being of the same sentiments as themselves
   they had formerly held communion, they replied by the mouth of
   Sophronius, [1396] a bishop of Paphlagonia, that while the Christians
   in the West maintained the use of the term "consubstantial," the
   followers of Aëtius in the East upheld the dogma of dissimilarity as to
   substance; and that the former party irregularly wove together into a
   unity the distinct persons of the Father and of the Son, by their use
   of the term "consubstantial," and that the latter party represented too
   great a difference as existing in the relationship between the nature
   of the Father and of the Son; but that they themselves preserved the
   mean between the two extremes, and avoided both errors, by religiously
   maintaining that in hypostasis, the Son is like unto the Father. It was
   by such representations as these that the Macedonians vindicated
   themselves from blame.

   Chapter XV.--Athanasius is again Banished; concerning Eleusius, Bishop
   of Cyzicus, and Titus, Bishop of Bostra; Mention of the Ancestors of
   the Author.

   The emperor, [1397] on being informed that Athanasius held meetings in
   the church of Alexandria, and taught the people boldly, and converted
   many pagans to Christianity, commanded him, under the severest
   penalties, to depart from Alexandria. [1398] The pretext made use of
   for enforcing this edict, was that Athanasius, after having been
   banished by Constantius, had reassumed his episcopal see without the
   sanction of the reigning emperor; for Julian declared that he had never
   contemplated restoring the bishops who had been exiled by Constantius
   to their ecclesiastical functions, but only to their native land. On
   the announcement of the command enjoining his immediate departure,
   Athanasius said to the Christian multitudes who stood weeping around
   him, "Be of good courage; it is but a cloud which will speedily be
   dispersed." After these words he bade farewell; he then committed the
   care of the church to the most zealous of his friends and quitted
   Alexandria.

   About the same period, the inhabitants of Cyzicus sent an embassy to
   the emperor to lay before him some of their private affairs, and
   particularly to entreat the restoration of the pagan temples. He
   applauded their forethought, and promised to grant all their requests.
   He expelled Eleusius, the bishop of their city, because he had
   destroyed some temples, and desecrated the sacred areas with contumely,
   provided houses for the support of widows, erected buildings for holy
   virgins, and induced pagans to abandon their ancestral rites.

   The emperor prohibited some foreign Christians, who had accompanied
   him, from entering the city of Cyzicus, from the apprehension, it
   appears, that they would, in conjunction with the Christians within the
   city, excite a sedition on account of religion. There were many persons
   gathered with them who also held like religious views with the
   Christians of the city, and who were engaged in woolen manufactures for
   the state, and were coiners of money. They were numerous, and were
   divided into two populous classes; they had received permission from
   preceding emperors to dwell, with their wives and possessions, in
   Cyzicus, provided that they annually handed over to the public treasury
   a supply of clothes for the soldiery and of newly coined money.

   Although Julian was anxious to advance paganism by every means, yet he
   deemed it the height of imprudence to employ force or vengeance against
   those who refused to sacrifice. Besides, there were so many Christians
   in every city that it would have been no easy task for the rulers even
   to number them. He did not even forbid them to assemble together for
   worship, as he was aware that when freedom of the will is called into
   question, constraint is utterly useless. He expelled the clergy and
   presidents of the churches from all the cities, in order to put an end
   to these assemblies, saying truly that by their absence the gatherings
   of the people would be effectually dissolved, if indeed there were none
   to convene the churches, and none to teach or to dispense the
   mysteries, religion itself would, in the course of time, fall into
   oblivion. The pretext which he advanced for these proceedings was, that
   the clergy were the leaders of sedition among the people. Under this
   plea, he expelled Eleusius and his friends from Cyzicus, although there
   was not even a symptom nor expectation of sedition in that city. He
   also publicly called upon the citizens of Bostra [1399] to expel Titus,
   their bishop. It appears that the emperor had threatened to impeach
   Titus and the other clergy as the authors of any sedition that might
   arise among the people, and that Titus had thereupon written stating to
   him that although the Christians were near the pagans in number, yet
   that, in accordance with his exhortations, they were disposed to remain
   quiet, and were not likely to rise up in sedition. Julian, with the
   view of not exciting the enmity of the inhabitants of Bostra against
   Titus, represented, in a letter which he addressed to them, that their
   bishop had advanced a calumny against them, by stating that it was in
   accordance with his exhortations rather than with their own inclination
   that they refrained from sedition; and Julian exhorted them to expel
   him from their city as a public enemy.

   It appears that the Christians were subjected to similar injustice in
   other places; sometimes by the command of the emperor, and sometimes by
   the wrath and impetuosity of the populace. The blame of these
   transactions may be justly imputed to the ruler; for he did not bring
   under the force of law the transgressors of law, but out of his hatred
   to the Christian religion, he only visited the perpetrators of such
   deeds with verbal rebukes, while, by his actions, he urged them on in
   the same course. Hence although not absolutely persecuted by the
   emperor, the Christians were obliged to flee from city to city and
   village to village. My grandfather and many of my ancestors were
   compelled to flee in this manner. My grandfather was of pagan
   parentage; and, with his own family and that of Alaphion, had been the
   first to embrace Christianity in Bethelia, a populous town near Gaza,
   in which there are temples highly reverenced by the people of the
   country, on account of their antiquity and structural excellence. The
   most celebrated of these temples is the Pantheon, built on an
   artificial eminence commanding a view of the whole town. The conjecture
   is that the place received its name from the temple, that the original
   name given to this temple was in the Syriac language, and that this
   name was afterwards rendered into Greek and expressed by a word which
   signifies that the temple is the residence of all the gods.

   It is said that the above-mentioned families were converted through the
   instrumentality of the monk Hilarion. Alaphion, it appears, was
   possessed of a devil; and neither the pagans nor the Jews could, by any
   incantations and enchantments, deliver him from this affliction; but
   Hilarion, by simply calling on the name of Christ, expelled the demon,
   and Alaphion, with his whole family, immediately embraced Christianity.

   My grandfather was endowed with great natural ability, which he applied
   with success to the explanation of the Sacred Scriptures; he had made
   some attainments in general knowledge, and was not ignorant of
   arithmetic. He was much beloved by the Christians of Ascalon, of Gaza,
   and of the surrounding country; and was regarded as necessary to
   religion, on account of his gift in expounding the doubtful points of
   Scripture. No one can speak in adequate terms of the virtues of the
   other [1400] family. The first churches and monasteries erected in that
   country were founded by members of this family and supported by their
   power and beneficence towards strangers and the needy. Some good men
   belonging to this family have flourished even in our own days; and in
   my youth I saw some of them, but they were then very aged. I shall have
   occasion to say more concerning them in the course of my history.

   Chapter XVI.--Efforts of Julian to establish Paganism and to abolish
   our Usages. The Epistle which he sent to the Pagan High-Priests.

   The emperor [1402] was deeply grieved at finding that all his efforts
   to secure the predominance of paganism were utterly ineffectual, and at
   seeing Christianity excelling in repute; for although the gates of the
   temples were kept open, although sacrifices were offered, and the
   observance of ancient festivals restored in all the cities, yet he was
   far from being satisfied; for he could plainly foresee that, on the
   withdrawal of his influence, a change in the whole aspect of affairs
   would speedily take place. He was particularly chagrined on discovering
   that the wives, children, and servants of many of the pagan priests had
   been converted to Christianity. On reflecting that one main support of
   the Christian religion was the life and behavior of its professors, he
   determined to introduce into the pagan temples the order and discipline
   of Christianity, to institute various orders and degrees of ministry,
   to appoint teachers and readers to give instruction in pagan doctrines
   and exhortations, and to command that prayers should be offered on
   certain days at stated hours. He moreover resolved to found monasteries
   for the accommodation of men and women who desired to live in
   philosophical retirement, as likewise hospitals for the relief of
   strangers and of the poor and for other philanthropical purposes. He
   wished to introduce among the pagans the Christian system of penance
   for voluntary and involuntary transgressions; but the point of
   ecclesiastical discipline which he chiefly admired, and desired to
   establish among the pagans, was the custom among the bishops to give
   letters of recommendation to those who traveled to foreign lands,
   wherein they commended them to the hospitality and kindness of other
   bishops, in all places, and under all contingencies. In this way did
   Julian strive to ingraft the customs of Christianity upon paganism. But
   if what I have stated appears to be incredible, I need not go far in
   search of proofs to corroborate my assertions; for I can produce a
   letter written by the emperor himself on the subject. He writes as
   follows: [1403] --

   "To Arsacius, High-Priest of Galatia. Paganism has not yet reached the
   degree of prosperity that might be desired, owing to the conduct of its
   votaries. The worship of the gods, however, is conducted on the
   grandest and most magnificent scale, so far exceeding our very prayer
   and hope; let our Adrastea be propitious to these words, for no one
   could have dared to look for so extensive and so surprising a change as
   that which we have witnessed within a very short space of time. But are
   we to rest satisfied with what has been already effected? Ought we not
   rather to consider that the progress of Atheism has been principally
   owing to the humanity evinced by Christians towards strangers, to the
   reverence they have manifested towards the dead, and to the delusive
   gravity which they have assumed in their life? It is requisite that
   each of us should be diligent in the discharge of duty: I do not refer
   to you alone, as that would not suffice, but to all the priests of
   Galatia.

   "You must either put them to shame, or try the power of persuasion, or
   else deprive them of their sacerdotal offices, if they do not with
   their wives, their children, and their servants join in the service of
   the gods, or if they support the servants, sons, or wives of the
   Galileans in treating the gods impiously and in preferring Atheism to
   piety. Then exhort the priests not to frequent theaters, not to drink
   at taverns, and not to engage in any trade, or practice any nefarious
   art.

   "Honor those who yield to your remonstrances, and expel those who
   disregard them. Establish hostelries in every city, so that strangers
   from neighboring and foreign countries may reap the benefit of our
   philanthropy, according to their respective need.

   "I have provided means to meet the necessary expenditure, and have
   issued directions throughout the whole of Galatia, that you should be
   furnished annually with thirty thousand bushels of corn and sixty
   thousand measures of wine, of which the fifth part is to be devoted to
   the support of the poor who attend upon the priests; and the rest to be
   distributed among strangers and our own poor. For, while there are no
   persons in need among the Jews, and while even the impious Galileans
   provide not only for those of their own party who are in want, but also
   for those who hold with us, it would indeed be disgraceful if we were
   to allow our own people to suffer from poverty.

   "Teach the pagans to co-operate in this work of benevolence, and let
   the first-fruits of the pagan towns be offered to the gods.

   "Habituate the pagans to the exercise of this liberality, by showing
   them how such conduct is sanctioned by the practice of remote
   antiquity; for Homer [1404] represents Eumæus as saying,--

   My guest! I should offend, treating with scorn

   The stranger, though a poorer should arrive

   Than even thyself; for all the poor that are,

   And all the strangers are the care of Jove."

   "Let us not permit others to excel us in good deeds; let us not
   dishonor ourselves by violence, but rather let us be foremost in piety
   towards the gods. If I hear that you act according to my directions, I
   shall be full of joy. Do not often visit the governors at their own
   houses, but write to them frequently. When they enter the city, let no
   priest go to meet them; and let not the priest accompany them further
   than the vestibule when they repair to the temple of the gods; neither
   let any soldiers march before them on such occasions; but let those
   follow them who will. For as soon as they have entered within the
   sacred bounds, they are but private individuals; for there it is your
   duty, as you well know, to preside, according to the divine decree.
   Those who humbly conform to this law manifest that they possess true
   religion; whereas those who contemn it are proud and vainglorious.

   "I am ready to render assistance to the inhabitants of Pessinus,
   provided that they will propitiate the mother of the gods; but if they
   neglect this duty, they will incur my utmost displeasure.

   I should myself transgress,

   Receiving here, and giving conduct hence

   To one detested by the gods as these." [1405]

   "Convince them, therefore, that if they desire my assistance, they must
   offer up supplications to the mother of the gods."

   Chapter XVII.--In Order that he might not be thought Tyrannical, Julian
   proceeds artfully against the Christians. Abolition of the Sign of the
   Cross. He makes the Soldiery sacrifice, although they were Unwilling.

   When Julian acted and wrote in the manner aforesaid, he expected that
   he would by these means easily induce his subjects to change their
   religious opinions. [1406] Although he earnestly desired to abolish the
   Christian religion, yet he plainly was ashamed to employ violent
   measures, lest he should be accounted tyrannical. He used every means,
   however, that could possibly be devised to lead his subjects back to
   paganism; and he was more especially urgent with the soldiery, whom he
   sometimes addressed individually and sometimes through the medium of
   their officers. To habituate them in all things to the worship of the
   gods, he restored the ancient form of the standard of the Roman armies,
   [1407] which, as we have already stated, Constantine had, at the
   command of God, converted into the sign of the cross. Julian also
   [1408] caused to be painted, in juxtaposition with his own figure, on
   the public pictures, a representation either of Jupiter coming out of
   heaven and presenting to him the symbols of imperial power, a crown or
   a purple robe, or else of Mars, or of Mercury, with their eyes intently
   fixed upon him, as if to express their admiration of his eloquence and
   military skill. He placed the pictures of the gods in juxtaposition
   with his own, in order that the people might secretly be led to worship
   them under the pretext of rendering due honor to him; he abused ancient
   usages, and endeavored to conceal his purpose from his subjects. He
   considered that if they would yield obedience on this point, they would
   be the more ready to obey him on every other occasion; but that if they
   ventured to refuse obedience, he would have reason to punish them, as
   infringers of the Roman customs and offenders against the emperor and
   the state. There were but very few (and the law had its course against
   them) who, seeing through his designs, refused to render the customary
   homage to his pictures; but the multitude, through ignorance or
   simplicity, conformed as usual to the ancient regulation, and
   thoughtlessly paid homage to his image. The emperor derived but little
   advantage from this artifice; yet he did not cease from his efforts to
   effect a change in religion.

   The next machination to which he had recourse was less subtle and more
   violent than the former one; and the fortitude of many soldiers
   attached to the court was thereby tested. When the stated day came
   round for giving money to the troops, [1409] which day generally fell
   upon the anniversary of some festival among the Romans, such as that of
   the birth of the emperor, or the foundation of some royal city, Julian
   reflected that soldiers are naturally thoughtless and simple, and
   disposed to be covetous of money, and therefore concluded that it would
   be a favorable opportunity to seduce them to the worship of the gods.
   Accordingly, as each soldier approached to receive the money, he was
   commanded to offer sacrifice, fire and incense having been previously
   placed for this purpose near the emperor, according to an ancient Roman
   custom. Some of the soldiers had the courage to refuse to offer
   sacrifice and receive the gold; others were so habituated to the
   observance of the law and custom that they conformed to it, without
   imagining that they were committing sin. Others, again, deluded by the
   luster of the gold, or compelled by fear and consideration on account
   of the test which was immediately in sight, complied with the pagan
   rite, and suffered themselves to fall into the temptation from which
   they ought to have fled.

   It is related that, as some of them who had ignorantly fallen into this
   sin were seated at table, and drinking to each other, one among them
   happened to mention the name of Christ over the cups. Another of the
   guests immediately exclaimed: "It is extraordinary that you should call
   upon Christ, when, but a short time ago, you denied him for the sake of
   the emperor's gift, by throwing incense into the fire." On hearing this
   observation, they all became suddenly conscious of the sin they had
   committed; they rose from table and rushed into the public streets,
   where they screamed and wept and called upon all men to witness that
   they were and would remain Christians, and that they had offered
   incense unawares, and with the hand alone, and not with the assent of
   the judgment. They then presented themselves before the emperor, threw
   back his gold, and courageously asked him to take back his own gift,
   and besought him to put them to death, protesting that they would never
   renounce their sentiments, whatever torments might, in consequence of
   the sin committed by their hand, be inflicted on the other parts of
   their body for the sake of Christ.

   Whatever displeasure the emperor might have felt against them, he
   refrained from slaying them, lest they should enjoy the honor of
   martyrdom; he therefore merely deprived them of their military
   commission and dismissed them from the palace.

   Chapter XVIII.--He prohibited the Christians from the Markets and from
   the Judicial Seats and from Sharing in Greek Education. Resistance of
   Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian, and Apolinarius to this
   Decree. They rapidly translate the Scripture into Greek Modes of
   Expression. Apolinarius and Gregory Nazianzen do this more than Basil,
   the one in a Rhetorical Vein, the other in Epic Style and in Imitation
   of every Poet.

   Julian entertained the same sentiments as those above described towards
   all Christians, as he manifested whenever an opportunity was offered.
   Those who refused to sacrifice to the gods, although perfectly
   blameless in other respects, were deprived of the rights of
   citizenship, [1410] and of the privilege of participating in
   assemblies, and in the forum; and he would not allow them to be judges
   or magistrates, or to share in offices.

   He forbade the children of Christians from frequenting the public
   schools, and from being instructed in the writings of the Greek poets
   and authors. [1411] He entertained great resentment against Apolinarius
   the Syrian, a man of manifold knowledge and philological attainments,
   against Basil and Gregory, natives of Cappadocia, the most celebrated
   orators of the time, and against other learned and eloquent men, of
   whom some were attached to the Nicene doctrines, and others to the
   dogmas of Arius. His sole motive for excluding the children of
   Christian parents from instruction in the learning of the Greeks, was
   because he considered such studies conducive to the acquisition of
   argumentative and persuasive power. Apolinarius, therefore, employed
   his great learning and ingenuity in the production of a heroic epic on
   the antiquities of the Hebrews to the reign of Saul, as a substitute
   for the poem of Homer. He divided this work into twenty-four parts, to
   each of which he appended the name of one of the letters of the Greek
   alphabet, according to their number and order. He also wrote comedies
   in imitation of Menander, tragedies resembling those of Euripides, and
   odes on the model of Pindar. In short, taking themes of the entire
   circle of knowledge from the Scriptures, he produced within a very
   brief space of time, a set of works which in manner, expression,
   character, and arrangement are well approved as similar to the Greek
   literatures and which were equal in number and in force. Were it not
   for the extreme partiality with which the productions of antiquity are
   regarded, I doubt not but that the writings of Apolinarius would be
   held in as much estimation as those of the ancients. [1412]

   The comprehensiveness of his intellect is more especially to be
   admired; for he excelled in every branch of literature, whereas ancient
   writers were proficient only in one. He wrote a very remarkable work
   entitled "The Truth" [1413] against the emperor and the pagan
   philosophers, in which he clearly proved, without any appeal to the
   authority of Scripture, that they were far from having attained right
   opinions of God. The emperor, for the purpose of casting ridicule on
   works of this nature, wrote to the bishops in the following words: "I
   have read, I have understood, and I have condemned." [1414] To this
   they sent the following reply, "You have read, but you have not
   understood; for, had you understood, you would not have condemned."

   Some have attributed this letter to Basil, the president of the church
   in Cappadocia, and perhaps not without reason; but whether dictated by
   him or by another, it fully displays the magnanimity and learning of
   the writer.

   Chapter XIX.--Work written by Julian entitled "Aversion to Beards."
   Daphne in Antioch, a Full Description of it. Translation of the Remains
   of Babylas, the Holy Martyr.

   Julian, [1415] having determined upon undertaking a war against Persia,
   repaired to Antioch in Syria. The people loudly complained, that,
   although provisions were very abundant the price affixed to them was
   very high. Accordingly, the emperor, from liberality, as I believe,
   towards the people, reduced the price of provisions to so low a scale
   that the vendors fled the city.

   A scarcity in consequence ensued, for which the people blamed the
   emperor; and their resentment found vent in ridiculing the length of
   his beard, and the bulls which he had had stamped upon his coins; and
   they satirically remarked, that he upset the world in the same way that
   his priests, when offering sacrifice, threw down the victims.

   At first his displeasure was excited, and he threatened to punish them
   and prepared to depart for Tarsus. Afterwards, however, he suppressed
   his feelings of indignation, and repaid their ridicule by words alone;
   he composed a very elegant work under the title of "Aversion to
   Beards," which he sent to them. He treated the Christians of the city
   precisely in the same manner as at other places, and endeavored, as far
   as possible, to promote the extension of paganism.

   I shall here recount some of the details connected with the tomb of
   Babylas, the martyr, and certain occurrences which took place about
   this period in the temple of Apollo at Daphne.

   Daphne is a suburb of Antioch, and is planted with cypresses and other
   trees, beneath which all kinds of flowers flourish in their season. The
   branches of these trees are so thick and interlaced that they may be
   said to form a roof rather than merely to afford shade, and the rays of
   the sun can never pierce through them to the soil beneath. It is made
   delicious and exceedingly lovely by the richness and beauty of the
   waters, the temperateness of the air, and the breath of friendly winds.
   The Greeks invent the myth that Daphne, the daughter of the river
   Ladon, was here changed into a tree which bears her name, while she was
   fleeing from Arcadia, to evade the love of Apollo. The passion of
   Apollo was not diminished, they say, by this transformation; he made a
   crown of the leaves of his beloved and embraced the tree. He afterwards
   often fixed his residence on this spot, as being dearer to him than any
   other place.

   Men of grave temperament, however, considered it disgraceful to
   approach this suburb; for the position and nature of the place seemed
   to excite voluptuous feelings; and the substance of the fable itself
   being erotic, afforded a measurable impulse and redoubled the passions
   among corrupt youths. They, who furnished this myth as an excuse, were
   greatly inflamed and gave way without constraint to profligate deeds,
   incapable of being continent themselves, or of enduring the presence of
   those who were continent. Any one who dwelt at Daphne without a
   mistress was regarded as callous and ungracious, and was shunned as an
   abominable and abhorrent thing. The pagans likewise manifested great
   reverence for this place on account of a very beautiful statue of the
   Daphnic Apollo which stood here, as also a magnificent and costly
   temple, supposed to have been built by Seleucus, the father of
   Antiochus, who gave his name to the city of Antioch. Those who attach
   credit to fables of this kind believe that a stream flows from the
   fountain Castalia which confers the power of predicting the future, and
   which is similar in its name and powers to the fountain of Delphi. It
   is related that Adrian here received intimation of his future
   greatness, when he was but a private individual; and that he dipped a
   leaf of the laurel into the water and found written thereon an account
   of his destiny. When he became emperor, it is said, he commanded the
   fountain to be closed, in order that no one might be enabled to pry
   into the knowledge of the future. But I leave this subject to those who
   are more accurately acquainted with mythology than I am.

   When Gallus, the brother of Julian, had been declared Cæsar by
   Constantius, and had fixed his residence at Antioch, his zeal for the
   Christian religion and his veneration for the memory of the martyrs
   determined him to purge the place of the pagan superstition and the
   outrages of profligates. He considered that the readiest method of
   effecting this object would be to erect a house of prayer in the temple
   and to transfer thither the tomb of Babylas, the martyr, who had, with
   great reputation to himself, presided over the church of Antioch, and
   suffered martyrdom. It is said that from the time of this translation,
   the demon ceased to utter oracles. This silence was at first attributed
   to the neglect into which his service was allowed to fall and to the
   omission of the former cult; but results proved that it was occasioned
   solely by the presence of the holy martyr. The silence continued
   unbroken even when Julian was the sole ruler of the Roman Empire,
   although libations, incense, and victims were offered in abundance to
   the demon; for when eventually the oracle itself spoke and indicated
   the cause of its previous silence, the emperor himself entered the
   temple for the purpose of consulting the oracle, and offering up gifts
   and sacrifices with entreaties to grant a reply. The demon did not
   openly admit that the hindrance was occasioned by the tomb of Babylas,
   the martyr, but he stated that the place was filled with dead bodies,
   and that this prevented the oracle from speaking.

   Although many interments had taken place at Daphne, the emperor
   perceived that it was the presence of Babylas, the martyr, alone which
   had silenced the oracle, and he commanded his tomb to be removed. The
   Christians, therefore, assembled together and conveyed the coffin to
   the city, about forty stadia distant, and deposited it in the place
   where it is still preserved, and to which the name of the martyr has
   been given. It is said that men and women, young men and maidens, old
   men and children drew the casket, and encouraged one another by singing
   psalms as they went along the road, apparently for the purpose of
   lightening their labor, but in truth because they were transported by
   zeal and spirit for their kindred religious belief, which the emperor
   had opposed. The best singers sang first, and the multitude replied in
   chorus, and the following was the burden of their song: "Confounded are
   all they who worship graven images, who boast themselves in idols."

   Chapter XX.--In Consequence of the Translation, Many of the Christians
   are Ill-Treated. Theodore the Confessor. Temple of Apollo at Daphne
   destroyed by Fire falling from Heaven.

   The transaction above related [1416] excited the indignation of the
   emperor as much as if an insult had been offered him, and he determined
   upon punishing the Christians; but Sallust, a prætorian prefect,
   although a pagan, tried to dissuade him from this measure. The emperor,
   however, could not be appeased, and Sallust was compelled to execute
   his mandate, and arrest and imprison many Christians. One of the first
   whom he arrested was a young man named Theodore, who was immediately
   stretched upon the rack; but although his flesh was lacerated by the
   application of the nails, he addressed no supplication to Sallust, nor
   did he implore a diminution of his torments; on the contrary, he seemed
   as insensible to pain as if he had been merely a spectator of the
   sufferings of another, and bravely received the wounds; and he sang the
   same psalm which he had joined in singing the day before, to show that
   he did not repent of the act for which he had been condemned. The
   prefect, struck with admiration at the fortitude of the young man, went
   to the emperor and told him that, unless he would desist speedily from
   the measure he had undertaken, he and his party would be exposed to
   ridicule while the Christians would acquire more glory. This
   representation produced its effect, and the Christians who had been
   arrested were set at liberty. It is said [1417] that Theodore was
   afterwards asked whether he had been sensible of any pain while on the
   rack; and that he replied that he had not been entirely free from
   suffering, but had his pains assuaged by the attentions of a young man
   who had stood by him, and who had wiped off the perspiration with the
   finest linen cloth, and supplied him with coolest water by which he
   eased the inflammation and refreshed his labors. I am convinced that no
   man, whatever magnanimity he may possess, is capable, without the
   special assistance of Divine Power, of manifesting such entire
   indifference about the body.

   The body of the martyr Babylas was, for the reasons aforesaid, removed
   to Daphne, and was subsequently conveyed elsewhere. Soon after it had
   been taken away, fire suddenly fell upon the temple of the Daphnic
   Apollo, the roof and the very statue of the god were burned, and the
   naked walls, with the columns on which the portico and the back part of
   the edifice had rested, alone escaped the conflagration. [1418] The
   Christians believed that the prayers of the martyr had drawn down fire
   from heaven upon the demon; but the pagans reported the Christians as
   having set fire to the place. This suspicion gained ground; and the
   priest of Apollo was brought before the tribunal of justice to render
   up the names of those who had dared the incendiary act; but though
   bound and subjected to the most cruel tortures, he did not name any
   one.

   Hence the Christians were more fully convinced than before, that it was
   not by the deed of man, but by the wrath of God, that fire was poured
   down from heaven upon the temple. Such were the occurrences which then
   took place. The emperor, as I conjecture, on hearing that the calamity
   at Daphne had been occasioned by the martyr Babylas, and on being
   further informed that the honored remains of the martyrs were preserved
   in several houses of prayer near the temple of the Apollo Didymus,
   which is situated close to the city of Miletus, wrote to the governor
   of Caria, commanding him to destroy with fire all such edifices as were
   furnished with a roof and an altar, and to throw down from their very
   foundations the houses of prayer which were incomplete in these
   respects.

   Chapter XXI.-- Of the Statue of Christ in Paneas which Julian overthrew
   and made Valueless; he erected his own Statue; this was overthrown by a
   Thunder-Bolt and destroyed. Fountain of Emmaus in which Christ washed
   his Feet. Concerning the Tree Persis, which worshiped Christ in Egypt,
   and the Wonders wrought through it.

   Among so many remarkable events which occurred during the reign of
   Julian, I must not omit to mention one which affords a sign of the
   power of Christ, and proof of the Divine wrath against the emperor.
   [1419]

   Having heard that at Cæsarea Philippi, otherwise called Paneas, a city
   of Phoenicia, there was a celebrated statue of Christ which had been
   erected by a woman whom the Lord had cured of a flow of blood, [1420]
   Julian commanded it to be taken down and a statue of himself erected in
   its place; but a violent fire from heaven fell upon it and broke off
   the parts contiguous to the breast; the head and neck were thrown
   prostrate, and it was transfixed to the ground with the face downwards
   at the point where the fracture of the bust was; and it has stood in
   that fashion from that day until now, full of the rust of the
   lightning. The statue of Christ was dragged around the city and
   mutilated by the pagans; but the Christians recovered the fragments,
   and deposited the statue in the church in which it is still preserved.
   Eusebius relates, that at the base of this statue grew an herb which
   was unknown to the physicians and empirics, but was efficacious in the
   cure of all disorders. It does not appear a matter of astonishment to
   me, that, after God had vouchsafed to dwell with men, he should
   condescend to bestow benefits upon them.

   It appears that innumerable other miracles were wrought in different
   cities and villages; accounts have been accurately preserved by the
   inhabitants of these places only, because they learned them from
   ancestral tradition; and how true this is, I will at once show. There
   is a city now called Nicopolis, in Palestine, which was formerly only a
   village, and which was mentioned by the divine book of the Gospel under
   the name of Emmaus. [1421] The name of Nicopolis was given to this
   place by the Romans after the conquest of Jerusalem and the victory
   over the Jews. Just beyond the city where three roads meet, is the spot
   where Christ, after His resurrection, said farewell to Cleopas and his
   companion, as if he were going to another village; and here is a
   healing fountain in which men and other living creatures afflicted with
   different diseases wash away their sufferings; for it is said that when
   Christ together with His disciples came from a journey to this
   fountain, they bathed their feet therein, and, from that time the water
   became a cure for disorders.

   At Hermopolis, in the Thebaïs, is a tree called Persis, of which the
   branches, the leaves, and the least portion of the bark, are said to
   heal diseases, when touched by the sick; for it is related by the
   Egyptians that when Joseph fled with Christ and Mary, the holy mother
   of God, from the wrath of Herod, they went to Hermopolis; when entering
   at the gate, this largest tree, as if not enduring the advent of
   Christ, inclined to the ground and worshiped Him. I relate precisely
   what I have heard from many sources concerning this tree. I think that
   this phenomenon was a sign of the presence of God in the city; or
   perhaps, as seems most probable, the tree, which had been worshiped by
   the inhabitants, after the pagan custom, was shaken, because the demon,
   who had been an object of worship, started up at sight of Him who was
   manifested for purification from such agencies. It was moved of its own
   accord; for at the presence of Christ the idols of Egypt were shaken,
   even as Isaiah [1422] the prophet had foretold. On the expulsion of the
   demon, the tree was permitted to remain as a monument of what had
   occurred, and was endued with the property of healing those who
   believed.

   The inhabitants of Egypt and of Palestine testify to the truth of these
   events, which took place among themselves.

   Chapter XXII.--From Aversion to the Christians, Julian granted
   Permission to the Jews to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem; in every
   Endeavor to put their Hands to the Work, Fire sprang upward and killed
   Many. About the Sign of the Cross which appeared on the Clothing of
   those who had exerted themselves in this Work.

   Though the emperor [1423] hated and oppressed the Christians, he
   manifested benevolence and humanity towards the Jews. He wrote [1424]
   to the Jewish patriarchs and leaders, as well as to the people,
   requesting them to pray for him, and for the prosperity of the empire.
   In taking this step he was not actuated, I am convinced, by any respect
   for their religion; for he was aware that it is, so to speak, the
   mother of the Christian religion, and he knew that both religions rest
   upon the authority of the patriarchs and the prophets; but he thought
   to grieve the Christians by favoring the Jews, who are their most
   inveterate enemies. But perhaps he also calculated upon persuading the
   Jews to embrace paganism and sacrifices; for they were only acquainted
   with the mere letter of Scripture, and could not, like the Christians
   and a few of the wisest among the Hebrews, discern the hidden meaning.

   Events proved that this was his real motive; for he sent for some of
   the chiefs of the race and exhorted them to return to the observance of
   the laws of Moses and the customs of their fathers. On their replying
   that because the temple in Jerusalem was overturned, it was neither
   lawful nor ancestral to do this in another place than the metropolis
   out of which they had been cast, he gave them public money, commanded
   them to rebuild the temple, and to practice the cult similar to that of
   their ancestors, by sacrificing after the ancient way. The Jews entered
   upon the undertaking, without reflecting that, according to the
   prediction of the holy prophets, it could not be accomplished. They
   sought for the most skillful artisans, collected materials, cleared the
   ground, and entered so earnestly upon the task, that even the women
   carried heaps of earth, and brought their necklaces and other female
   ornaments towards defraying the expense. The emperor, the other pagans,
   and all the Jews, regarded every other undertaking as secondary in
   importance to this. Although the pagans were not well-disposed towards
   the Jews, yet they assisted them in this enterprise, because they
   reckoned upon its ultimate success, and hoped by this means to falsify
   the prophecies of Christ. Besides this motive, the Jews themselves were
   impelled by the consideration that the time had arrived for rebuilding
   their temple. When they had removed the ruins of the former building,
   they dug up the ground and cleared away its foundation; it is said that
   on the following day when they were about to lay the first foundation,
   a great earthquake occurred, and by the violent agitation of the earth,
   stones were thrown up from the depths, by which those of the Jews who
   were engaged in the work were wounded, as likewise those who were
   merely looking on. The houses and public porticos, near the site of the
   temple, in which they had diverted themselves, were suddenly thrown
   down; many were caught thereby, some perished immediately, others were
   found half dead and mutilated of hands or legs, others were injured in
   other parts of the body. When God caused the earthquake to cease, the
   workmen who survived again returned to their task, partly because such
   was the edict of the emperor, and partly because they were themselves
   interested in the undertaking. Men often, in endeavoring to gratify
   their own passions, seek what is injurious to them, reject what would
   be truly advantageous, and are deluded by the idea that nothing is
   really useful except what is agreeable to them. When once led astray by
   this error, they are no longer able to act in a manner conducive to
   their own interests, or to take warning by the calamities which are
   visited upon them.

   The Jews, I believe, were just in this state; for, instead of regarding
   this unexpected earthquake as a manifest indication that God was
   opposed to the re-erection of their temple, they proceeded to
   recommence the work. But all parties relate, that they had scarcely
   returned to the undertaking, when fire burst suddenly from the
   foundations of the temple, and consumed several of the workmen.

   This fact is fearlessly stated, and believed by all; the only
   discrepancy in the narrative is that some maintain that flame burst
   from the interior of the temple, as the workmen were striving to force
   an entrance, while others say that the fire proceeded directly from the
   earth. In whichever way the phenomenon might have occurred, it is
   equally wonderful. A more tangible and still more extraordinary prodigy
   ensued; suddenly the sign of the cross appeared spontaneously on the
   garments of the persons engaged in the undertaking. These crosses were
   disposed like stars, and appeared the work of art. Many were hence led
   to confess that Christ is God, and that the rebuilding of the temple
   was not pleasing to Him; others presented themselves in the church,
   were initiated, and besought Christ, with hymns and supplications, to
   pardon their transgression. If any one does not feel disposed to
   believe my narrative, let him go and be convinced by those who heard
   the facts I have related from the eyewitnesses of them, for they are
   still alive. Let him inquire, also, of the Jews and pagans who left the
   work in an incomplete state, or who, to speak more accurately, were
   able to commence it.

   Book VI.

   Chapter I.--Expedition of Julian into Persia; he was worsted and broke
   off his Life Miserably. Letter written by Libanius, describing his
   Death.

   I have narrated in the preceding book the occurrences which took place
   in the Church, during the reign of Julian. [1425] This emperor, having
   determined to carry on the war with Persia, made a rapid transit across
   the Euphrates in the beginning of spring, and, passing by Edessa from
   hatred to the inhabitants, who had long professed Christianity, he went
   on to Carræ, where there was a temple of Jupiter, in which he offered
   up sacrifice and prayer. He then selected twenty thousand armed men
   from among his troops, and sent them towards the Tigris, in order that
   they might guard those regions, and also be ready to join him, in case
   he should require their assistance. He then wrote to Arsacius, king of
   Armenia, one of the Roman allies, to bespeak his aid in the war. In
   this letter Julian manifested the most unbounded arrogance; he boasted
   of the high qualities which had, he said, rendered him worthy of the
   empire, and acceptable to the gods for whom he cared; he reviled
   Constantius, his predecessor, as an effeminate and impious emperor, and
   threatened Arsacius in a grossly insulting way; and since he understood
   that he was a Christian, he intensified his insults, or eagerly and
   largely uttered unlawful blasphemies against Christ, for he was wont to
   dare this in every case. He told Arsacius that unless he acted
   according to his directions, the God in whom he trusted would not be
   able to defend him from his vengeance. When he considered that all his
   arrangements had been duly made, he led his army through Assyria.

   He took a great many towns and fortresses, either through treachery or
   by battle, and thoughtlessly proceeded onwards, without reflecting that
   he would have to return by the same route. He pillaged every place he
   approached, and pulled down or burnt the granaries and storehouses. As
   he was journeying up the Euphrates, he arrived at Ctesiphon, a very
   large city, whither the Persian monarchs have now transferred their
   residence from Babylon. The Tigris flows near this spot. As he was
   prevented from reaching the city with his ships, by a part of the land
   which separated it from the river, he judged that either he must pursue
   his journey by water, or quit his ships and go to Ctesiphon by land;
   and he interrogated the prisoners on the subject. Having ascertained
   from them that there was a canal which had been blocked up in the
   course of time, he caused it to be cleared out, and, having thus
   effected a communication between the Euphrates and the Tigris, he
   proceeded towards the city, his ships floating along by the side of his
   army. But the Persians appeared on the banks of the Tigris with a
   formidable display of horse and many armed troops, of elephants, and of
   horses; and Julian became conscious that his army was besieged between
   two great rivers, and was in danger of perishing, either by remaining
   in its present position, or by retreating through the cities and
   villages which he had so utterly devastated that no provisions were
   attainable; therefore he summoned the soldiers to see horse-races, and
   proposed rewards to the fleetest racers. In the meantime he commanded
   the officers of the ships to throw over the provisions and baggage of
   the army, so that the soldiers, seeing themselves in danger by the want
   of necessaries, might turn about boldly and fight their enemies more
   desperately. After supper he sent for the generals and tribunes and
   commanded the embarkation of the troops. They sailed along the Tigris
   during the night and came at once to the opposite banks and
   disembarked; but their departure was perceived by some of the Persians,
   who exhorted one another to oppose them, but those still asleep the
   Romans readily overcame.

   At daybreak, the two armies engaged in battle; and after much bloodshed
   on both sides, the Romans returned by the river, and encamped near
   Ctesiphon. The emperor, being no longer desirous of proceeding further,
   burnt his vessels, as he considered that they required too many
   soldiers to guard them; and he then commenced his retreat along the
   Tigris, which was to his left. The prisoners, who acted as guides to
   the Romans, led them to a fertile country where they found abundance of
   provisions. Soon after, an old man who had resolved to die for the
   liberty of Persia, allowed himself to be taken prisoner, and was
   brought before the emperor. On being questioned as to the route, and
   seeming to speak the truth, he persuaded them to follow him as capable
   of transporting the army very speedily to the Roman frontiers. He
   observed that for the space of three or four days' journey this road
   would be difficult, and that it would be necessary to carry provisions
   during that time, as the surrounding country was sterile. The emperor
   was deceived by the discourse of this wise old man, and approved the
   march by this route. On advancing further, after the lapse of three
   days, they were cast upon an uncultivated region. The old prisoner was
   put to torture. He confessed that he had exposed himself voluntarily to
   death for the sake of his country, and was therefore prepared to endure
   any sufferings that could be inflicted on him.

   The Roman troops were now worn out by the length of the journey and the
   scarcity of provisions, and the Persians chose this moment to attack
   them.

   In the heat of the conflict which ensued, a violent wind arose; and the
   sky and the sun were totally concealed by the clouds, while the air was
   at the same time mixed with dust. During the darkness which was thus
   produced, a horseman, riding at full gallop, directed his lance against
   the emperor, and wounded him mortally. After throwing Julian from his
   horse, the unknown assailant secretly went away. Some conjectured that
   he was a Persian; others, that he was a Saracen. There are those who
   insist that he who struck the blow was a Roman soldier, who was
   indignant at the imprudence and temerity which the emperor had
   manifested in exposing his army to such peril. Libanius, [1426] the
   sophist, a native of Syria, the most intimate friend of Julian,
   expressed himself in the following terms concerning the person who had
   committed the deed: "You desire to know by whom the emperor was slain.
   I know not his name. We have a proof, however, that the murderer was
   not one of the enemies; for no one came forward to claim the reward,
   although the king of Persia caused proclamation to be made, by a
   herald, of the honors to be awarded to him who had performed the deed.
   We are surely beholden to the enemy for not arrogating to themselves
   the glory of the action, but for leaving it to us to seek the slayer
   among ourselves.

   "Those who sought his death were those who lived in habitual
   transgression of the laws, and who had formerly conspired against him,
   and who therefore perpetrated the deed as soon as they could find an
   opportunity. They were impelled by the desire of obtaining a greater
   degree of freedom from all control than they could enjoy under his
   government; and they were, perhaps, mainly stimulated by their
   indignation at the attachment of the emperor to the service of the
   gods, to which they were averse."

   Chapter II.--He perished under Divine Wrath. Visions of the Emperor's
   Death seen by Various Individuals. Reply of the Carpenter's Son; Julian
   tossed his Blood aloft to Christ. Calamities which Julian entailed upon
   the Romans.

   In the document above quoted, Libanius clearly states that the emperor
   fell by the hand of a Christian; and this, probably, was the truth.
   [1427] It is not unlikely that some of the soldiers who then served in
   the Roman army might have conceived the idea, since Greeks and all men
   until this day have praised tyrannicides for exposing themselves to
   death in the cause of liberty, and spiritedly standing by their
   country, their families, and their friends. Still less is he deserving
   of blame, who, for the sake of God and of religion, performed so bold a
   deed. Beyond this I know nothing accurately concerning the men who
   committed this murder besides what I have narrated. All men, however,
   concur in receiving the account which has been handed down to us, and
   which evidences his death to have been the result of Divine wrath. A
   proof of this is the Divine vision which one of his friends had, which
   I will now proceed to describe. He had, it is related, traveled into
   Persia, with the intention of joining the emperor. While on the road,
   he found himself so far from any habitation that he was obliged, on one
   night, to sleep in a church. He saw, during that night, either in a
   dream or a vision, all the apostles and prophets assembled together,
   and complaining of the injuries which the emperor had inflicted on the
   Church, and consulting concerning the best measures to be adopted.
   After much deliberation and embarrassment two individuals arose in the
   midst of the assembly, desired the others to be of good cheer, and left
   the company hastily, as if to deprive Julian of the imperial power. He
   who was the spectator of this marvel did not attempt to pursue his
   journey, but awaited, in horrible suspense, the conclusion of this
   revelation. He laid himself down to sleep again, in the same place, and
   again, he saw the same assembly; the two individuals who had appeared
   to depart the preceding night to effect their purpose against Julian,
   suddenly returned and announced his death to the others.

   On the same day a vision was sent to Didymus, an ecclesiastical
   philosopher, who dwelt at Alexandria; and, who, being deeply grieved at
   the errors of Julian and his persecution of the churches, fasted and
   offered up supplications to God continually on this account. From the
   effects of anxiety and want of food during the previous night, he fell
   asleep while sitting in his chair. Then being, as it were, in an
   ecstasy, he beheld white horses traversing the air, and heard a voice
   saying to those who were riding thereon, "Go and tell Didymus that
   Julian has been slain just at this hour; let him communicate this
   intelligence to Athanasius, the bishop, and let him arise and eat." I
   have been credibly informed that the friend of Julian and the
   philosopher beheld those things. Results proved that neither of them
   were far from having witnessed the truth. But if these instances do not
   suffice to prove that the death of Julian was the effect of Divine
   wrath on account of his persecution of the Church, let the prediction
   of one of the ecclesiastics be called to mind. [1428] When Julian was
   preparing to enter upon the war against the Persians, he threatened
   that on the termination of the war he would treat the Christians with
   severity, and boasted that the Son of the Carpenter would be unable to
   aid them; the ecclesiastic above mentioned thereupon rejoined, that the
   Son of the Carpenter was then preparing him a wooden coffin in view of
   his death.

   Julian himself was well aware whence the mortal stroke proceeded, and
   what was the cause of its infliction; for, it is said, when he was
   wounded, he took some of the blood that flowed from the wound, and
   threw it up into the air, as if he had seen Jesus Christ appearing, and
   intended to throw it at him, in order to reproach him with his
   slaughter. Others say that he was angry with the sun because it had
   favored the Persians, and had not rescued him, although, according to
   the doctrine of the astronomers, it had presided at his birth; and that
   it was to express his indignation against this luminary that he took
   blood in his hand and flung it upwards in the air. [1429]

   I know not whether, on the approach of death, as is wont to be the case
   when the soul is in the act of being separated from the body and when
   it is enabled to behold diviner spectacles than are allotted to men,
   and so Julian might have beheld Christ. Few allusions have been made to
   this subject, and yet I dare not reject this hypothesis as absolutely
   false; for God often suffers still more improbable and astonishing
   events to take place in order to prove that the religion named after
   Christ is not sustained by human energy. It is, however, very obvious
   that, throughout the reign of this emperor, God gave manifest tokens of
   His displeasure, and permitted many calamities to befall several of the
   provinces of the Roman Empire. He visited the earth with such fearful
   earthquakes, that the buildings were shaken, and no more safety could
   be found within the houses than in the open air. From what I have
   heard, I conjecture that it was during the reign of this emperor, or,
   at least, when he occupied the second place in the government, that a
   great calamity occurred near Alexandria in Egypt, [1430] when the sea
   receded and again passed beyond its boundaries from the reflux waves,
   and deluged a great deal of the land, so that on the retreat of the
   waters, the sea-skiffs were found lodged on the roofs of the houses.
   The anniversary of this inundation, which they call the birthday of an
   earthquake, is still commemorated at Alexandria by a yearly festival; a
   general illumination is made throughout the city; they offer thankful
   prayers to God, and celebrate the day very brilliantly and piously. An
   excessive drought also occurred during this reign; the plants perished
   and the air was corrupted; and for want of proper sustenance, men were
   obliged to have recourse to the food usually eaten by other animals.

   The famine introduced peculiar diseases, by which many lives were lost.
   Such was the state of the empire during the administration of Julian.

   Chapter III.--The Reign of Jovian; he introduced Many Laws which he
   carried out in his Government.

   After the decease of Julian, the government of the empire was, by the
   unanimous consent of the troops, tendered to Jovian. [1431] When the
   army was about to proclaim him emperor, he announced himself to be a
   Christian and refused the sovereignty, nor would he receive the symbols
   of empire; but when the soldiers discovered the cause of his refusal,
   they loudly proclaimed that they were themselves Christians.

   The dangerous and disturbed condition in which affairs had been left by
   Julian's strategy, and the sufferings of the army from famine in an
   enemy's country, compelled Jovian to conclude a peace with the
   Persians, and to cede to them some territories which had been formerly
   tributary to the Romans. Having learned from experience that the
   impiety of his predecessor had excited the wrath of God, and given rise
   to public calamities, he wrote without delay to the governors of the
   provinces, directing that the people should assemble together without
   fear in the churches, that they should serve God with reverence, and
   that they should receive the Christian faith as the only true religion.
   He restored to the churches and the clergy, to the widows and the
   virgins, the same immunities and every former dotation for the
   advantage and honor of religion, which had been granted by Constantine
   and his sons, and afterwards withdrawn by Julian. He commanded
   Secundus, [1432] who was then a prætorian prefect, to constitute it a
   capital crime to marry any of the holy virgins, or even to regard them
   with unchaste desires and to carry them off.

   He enacted this law [1433] on account of the wickedness which had
   prevailed during the reign of Julian; for many had taken wives from
   among the holy virgins, and, either by force or guile, had completely
   corrupted them; and thence had proceeded that indulgence of disgraceful
   lusts with impunity, which always occur when religion is abused.

   Chapter IV.--Troubles again arise in the Churches; Synod of Antioch, in
   which the Nicene Faith is confirmed; the Points which this Important
   Synod wrote about to Jovian.

   The presidents of the churches now resumed the agitation of doctrinal
   questions and discussions. [1434] They had remained quiet during the
   reign of Julian when Christianity itself was endangered, and had
   unanimously offered up their supplications for the mercy of God. It is
   thus that men, when attacked by foreign enemies, remain in accord among
   themselves; but, when external troubles are removed, then internal
   dissensions creep in; this, however, is not a proper place for the
   citation of the numerous examples in governments and nations which
   history affords of this fact.

   At this period Basil, bishop of Ancyra, Silvanus, bishop of Tarsus,
   Sophronius, bishop of Pompeiopolis, and others of their party who
   regarded the heresy of the Anomians, so-called, with the utmost
   aversion, and received the term "similar as to substance," instead of
   the term "consubstantial," wrote a treatise to the emperor; and after
   expressing their thankfulness to God for his accession to the empire,
   besought him to confirm the decrees issued at Ariminum and Seleucia,
   and to annul what had been established merely by the zeal and power of
   certain individuals.

   They also entreated that, if division, which existed on account of the
   Synods, should still prevail in the churches, the bishops from every
   region might be convened alone in some place indicated by the emperor,
   and not be permitted to assemble elsewhere and issue decrees at
   variance with each other, as had been done during the reign of
   Constantius. They added that they had not gone to visit him at his
   camp, because they were fearful of being burdensome to him; but that if
   he desired to see them, they would gladly repair to him, and defray all
   the expenses attendant on the journey themselves. Such was the document
   written to the Emperor Jovian.

   At this juncture a council was convened at Antioch in Syria; the form
   of belief established by the council of Nicæa was confirmed; and it was
   decided that the Son is incontrovertibly of the same substance as the
   Father. Meletius, who then governed the church of Antioch; Eusebius,
   bishop of Samosata; Pelagius, bishop of Laodicea in Syria; Acacius,
   bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine; Irenius, bishop of Gaza; and
   Athanasius, bishop of Ancyra, took part in this council.

   On the termination of the council they acquainted the emperor with the
   transactions that had taken place, by dispatching the following letter:
   [1435] --

   "To the most religious and God-beloved Augustus, our Sovereign Jovian,
   the Conqueror, from the bishops assembled from divers regions, at
   Antioch.

   "We know, O emperor, well-beloved of God, that your piety is fully
   intent upon maintaining peace and concord in the Church; neither are we
   ignorant that you have well received the impress of the chief point of
   such unity, viz., the true and orthodox faith.

   "Lest, therefore, we should be reckoned among those who assail these
   doctrines of truth, we attest to your piety that we receive and
   maintain the form of belief which was anciently set forth by the holy
   council of Nicæa. Now, although the term consubstantial' appears
   strange to some persons, yet it was safely interpreted by the Fathers,
   and signifies that the Son was begotten of the substance of the Father.
   This term does not convey the idea of unbroken generation; neither does
   it coincide with the use which the Greeks make of the word substance,'
   but it is calculated to withstand the impious and rash allegation of
   Arius, that the Son proceeded from what had had no previous existence.
   The Anomians who have just sprung up have the shameless boldness to
   maintain this word to the grief of the concord of the Church. We
   subjoin to this letter a copy of the formulary of faith adopted by the
   bishops assembled at Nicæa, which we also cherish."

   Such were the decisions formed by the priests convened at Antioch; and
   they appended to their letter a copy of the Nicene formulary of faith.

   Chapter V.--Athanasius the Great is Very Highly Esteemed by the
   Emperor, and rules over the Churches of Egypt. Vision of Antony the
   Great.

   At this period, [1436] Athanasius, who governed the see of Alexandria,
   and some of his friends, deemed it requisite, as the emperor was a
   Christian, to repair to his court. [1437] Accordingly Athanasius went
   to Antioch, and laid such matters before the emperor as he deemed
   expedient. Others, however, say that the emperor sent for him in order
   to consult him concerning the affairs relative to religion and the
   right tenet. When the business of the Church had as far as possible
   been transacted, Athanasius began to think of returning.

   Euzoïus, bishop of the Arian heresy in Antioch, endeavored to install
   Probatius, a eunuch who held the same sentiments as himself, in
   Alexandria. The whole party of Euzoïus conspired with him to effect
   this design; and Lucius, a citizen of Alexandria, who had been ordained
   presbyter by George, endeavored to prejudice the emperor against
   Athanasius, by representing [1438] that he had been accused of divers
   crimes and had been condemned to perpetual banishment by preceding
   emperors, as the author of the dissensions and troubles of the Church
   concerning the Divine Being. Lucius likewise besought Jovian to appoint
   another bishop over the church of Alexandria. The emperor, since he
   knew the plots which had happened against Athanasius, attached no
   credit to the calumny, and with threatening, commanded Lucius to retire
   quietly; he also ordered Probatius and the other eunuchs belonging to
   his palace, whom he regarded as the originators of these troubles, to
   act more advisedly. From that period Jovian manifested the greatest
   friendship towards Athanasius, and sent him back to Egypt, with
   directions to govern the churches and people of that country as he
   might think fit. It is also said that he passed commendations on the
   virtue of the bishop, on his life, his intellectual endowments, and his
   eloquence.

   Thus, after having been exposed to opposition for a long while, as has
   been narrated in the former books, was the Nicene faith fully
   reestablished under the present government; but further embarrassment
   awaited it within a very short period. For, as it appeared afterwards,
   the whole of the prediction of Antony the Monk was not fulfilled by the
   occurrences which befell the Church during the reign of Constantius;
   part thereof was not accomplished until the reign of Valens. It is said
   that before the Arians got control of the churches during the reign of
   Constantius, Antony had a dream in which he saw mules kicking the altar
   with their hoofs and overturning the holy table. On awakening, he
   immediately predicted that the Church would be troubled by the
   introduction of spurious and mixed doctrines, and by the rebellion of
   the heterodox. The truth of this prediction was evidenced by the events
   which occurred before and after the period now under review.

   Chapter VI.--Death of Jovian; The Life of Valentinian, and his
   Confidence in God; how he was advanced to the Throne and selected his
   Brother Valens to reign with him; the Differences of Both.

   After Jovian had reigned about eight months, he died suddenly at
   Dadastana, a town of Bithynia, while on his road to Constantinople.
   [1439] Some say that his death was occasioned by eating too plentiful a
   supper; others attribute it to the dampness of the chamber in which he
   slept; for it had been recently plastered with unslaked lime, and
   quantities of coals had been burnt in it during the winter for a
   preventive; the walls had become damp and were exceedingly moist.

   On the arrival of the troops at Nicæa in Bithynia, they proclaimed
   Valentinian emperor. He was a good man and capable of holding the reins
   of the empire. He had not long returned from banishment; for it is said
   that Julian, immediately on his accession to the empire, erased the
   name of Valentinian from the Jovian legions, as they were called, and
   condemned him to perpetual banishment, under the pretext that he had
   failed in his duty of leading out the soldiers under his command
   against the enemy. The true reason of his condemnation, however, was
   the following: When Julian was in Gaul, he went one day to a temple to
   offer incense. Valentinian [1440] accompanied him, according to an
   ancient Roman law, which still prevails, and which enacted that the
   leader of the Jovians and the Herculeans (that is to say, the legions
   of soldiers who have received this appellation in honor of Jupiter and
   of Hercules) should always attend the emperor as his body-guard. When
   they were about to enter the temple, the priest, in accordance with the
   pagan custom, sprinkled water upon them with the branch of a tree. A
   drop fell upon the robe of Valentinian; he scarcely could restrain
   himself, for he was a Christian, and he rebuked his asperser; it is
   even said that he cut off, in view of the emperor, the portion of the
   garment on which the water had fallen, and flung it from him. From that
   moment Julian entertained inimical feelings against him, and soon after
   banished him to Melitine in Armenia, under the plea of misconduct in
   military affairs; for he would not have religion regarded as the cause
   of the decree, lest Valentinian should be accounted a martyr or a
   confessor. Julian treated other Christians, as we have already stated,
   in the same manner; for, as was said before, he perceived that to
   subject them to hazards only added to their reputation, and tended to
   the consolidation of their religion. As soon as Jovian succeeded to the
   throne, Valentinian was recalled from banishment to Nicæa; but the
   death of the emperor in the meantime took place, and Valentinian, by
   the unanimous consent of the troops and those who held the chief
   positions in the government, was appointed his successor. When he was
   invested with the symbols of imperial power, the soldiers cried out
   that it was necessary to elect some one to share the burden of
   government. To this proposition, Valentinian made the following reply:
   "It depended on you alone, O soldiers, to proclaim me emperor; but now
   that you have elected me, it depends not upon you, but upon me, to
   perform what you demand. Remain quiet, as subjects ought to do, and
   leave me to act as an emperor in attending to the public affairs."

   Not long after this refusal to comply with the demand of the soldiery,
   he repaired to Constantinople, and proclaimed his brother emperor. He
   gave him the East as his share of the empire, and reserved to himself
   the regions along the Western Ocean, from Illyria to the furthest
   coasts of Libya. Both the brothers were Christians, but they differed
   in opinion and disposition. For Valens, when he was baptized, employed
   Eudoxius as his initiator, and was zealously attached to the doctrines
   of Arius, and would readily have compelled all mankind by force to
   yield to them. Valentinian, on the other hand, maintained the faith of
   the council of Nicæa, and favored those who upheld the same sentiments,
   without molesting those who entertained other opinions.

   Chapter VII.--Troubles again arise in the Churches, and the Synod of
   Lampsacus is held. The Arians who supported Eudoxius prevail and eject
   the Orthodox from the Churches. Among the Ejected is Meletius of
   Antioch.

   When Valentinian was journeying from Constantinople to Rome, [1441] he
   had to pass through Thrace; and the bishops of Hellespontus and of
   Bithynia, with others, who maintained that the Son is consubstantial
   with the Father, dispatched Hypatian, bishop of Heraclea in Perinthus,
   to meet him, and to request permission to assemble themselves together
   for deliberation on questions of doctrine.

   When Hypatian had delivered the message with which he was intrusted,
   Valentinian made the following reply: "I am but one of the laity, and
   have therefore no right to interfere in these transactions; let the
   priests, to whom such matters appertain, assemble where they please."
   On receiving this answer through Hypatian, their deputy, the bishops
   assembled at Lampsacus.

   After having conferred together for the space of two months, they
   annulled all that had been decreed at Constantinople, through the
   machinations of the partisans of Eudoxius and Acacius. They likewise
   declared null and void the formulary of faith which had been circulated
   under the false assertion that it was the compilation of the Western
   bishops, and to which the signatures of many bishops had been obtained,
   by the promise that the dogma of dissimilarity as to substance should
   be condemned,--a promise which had never been performed.

   They decreed that the doctrine of the Son being in substance like unto
   the Father, should have the ascendancy; for they said that it was
   necessary to resort to the use of the term "like" as indicative of the
   hypostases of the Godhead. They agreed that the form of belief which
   had been confessed at Seleucia, and set forth at the dedication of the
   church of Antioch, should be maintained by all the churches.

   They directed that all the bishops who had been deposed by those who
   hold that the Son is dissimilar from the Father, should forthwith be
   reinstated in their sees, as having been unjustly ejected from their
   churches. They declared that if any wished to bring accusations against
   them, they would be permitted to do so, but under the penalty of
   incurring the same punishment as that due to the alleged crime, should
   the accusation prove to be false. The orthodox bishops of the province
   and of the neighboring countries were to preside as judges, and to
   assemble in the church, with the witnesses who were to make the
   depositions.

   After making these decisions, the bishops summoned the partisans of
   Eudoxius, and exhorted them to repentance; but as they would give no
   heed to these remonstrances, the decrees enacted by the council were
   sent to all the churches. Judging that Eudoxius would be likely to
   endeavor to persuade the emperor to side with him, and would calumniate
   them, they determined to be beforehand with him, and to send an account
   of their proceedings in Lampsacus to the court.

   Their deputies met the Emperor Valens as he was returning from Heraclea
   to Thrace, where he had been traveling in company with his brother, who
   had gone on to Old Rome.

   Eudoxius, however, had previously gained over the emperor and his
   courtiers to his own sentiments; so that when the deputies of the
   council of Lampsacus presented themselves before Valens, he merely
   exhorted them not to be at variance with Eudoxius. The deputies replied
   by reminding him of the artifices to which Eudoxius had resorted at
   Constantinople, and of his machinations to annul the decrees of the
   council of Seleucia; and these representations kindled the wrath of
   Valens to such a pitch, that he condemned the deputies to banishment,
   and made over the churches to the partisans of Eudoxius. He then passed
   over into Syria, for he feared lest the Persians should break the truce
   which they had concluded with Jovian for thirty years. On finding,
   however, that the Persians were not disposed to insurrection, he fixed
   his residence at Antioch. He sent Meletius, the bishop, into
   banishment, but spared Paul, because he admired the sanctity of his
   life. Those who were not in communion with Euzoïus were either ejected
   from the churches, or maltreated and harassed in some other form.

   Chapter VIII.--Revolt and Extraordinary Death of Procopius. Eleusius,
   Bishop of Cyzicus, and Eunomius, the Heretic. Eunomius succeeds
   Eleusius.

   It is probable that a severe persecution might have ensued at this
   juncture, had not Procopius commenced a civil war. [1442] As he began
   to play the tyrant at Constantinople, he soon collected a large army,
   and marched against Valens.

   The latter quitted Syria, and met Procopius near Nacolia, a city of
   Phrygia, and captured him alive through the treachery of Agelon and
   Gomarius, two of his generals.

   Valens put him and his betrayers to a cruel death; and although it is
   said that he had sworn to show favor to the two generals, he caused
   them to be sawn asunder.

   He commanded Procopius to be fastened by the legs to two trees which
   had been bent to the ground, and he allowed these to spring up; when
   the trees were left to resume their natural position, the victim was
   torn in twain.

   On the termination of this war, Valens retired to Nicæa, and finding
   himself in possession of profound tranquillity, he again began to
   molest those who differed from him in opinion concerning the Divine
   nature.

   His anger was unbounded against the bishops of the council of
   Lampsacus, because they had condemned the Arian bishops and the
   formulary of faith set forth at Ariminum.

   While under the influence of these resentful feelings, he summoned
   Eleusius from Syria, and having called together a Synod of bishops who
   held his own sentiments, he endeavored to compel him to assent to their
   doctrines. Eleusius at first manfully refused compliance. But
   afterwards, from the dread of exile and deprivation of his property, as
   was threatened by the emperor, he yielded to the mandate. He soon
   repented of his weakness, and on his return to Cyzicus he made a public
   confession of his fault in the church, and urged the people to choose
   another bishop, for he said that he could not discharge the duties of a
   priesthood after having been a traitor to his own doctrine. The
   citizens respected his conduct and were especially well-disposed to
   him, so that they did not choose to have another bishop. Eudoxius,
   president of the Arians in Constantinople, however, ordained Eunomius
   as bishop of Cyzicus; for he expected that by his great powers of
   eloquence Eunomius would easily draw the people of Cyzicus over to his
   own sentiments. On his arrival at that city he expelled Eleusius, for
   he was furnished with an imperial edict to that effect, and took
   possession of the churches himself.

   The followers of Eleusius built a house of prayer without the walls of
   the city, and here they held their assemblies. I shall soon again have
   occasion to revert to Eunomius and the heresy which bears his name.

   Chapter IX.--Sufferings of those who maintained the Nicene Faith.
   Agelius, the Ruler of the Novatians.

   The Christians who represented the Nicene doctrines and the followers
   of the Novatian views [1443] were treated with equal severity in the
   city of Constantinople.

   They were all ultimately expelled from the city; and the churches of
   the Novatians were closed by order of the emperor. The other party had
   no churches to be closed, having been deprived of them all during the
   reign of Constantius.

   At this period, Agelius who, from the time of Constantius, had governed
   the church of the Novatians at Constantinople, was condemned to
   banishment. It is said that he was especially remarkable for his course
   of life according to the ecclesiastical laws. With respect to his mode
   of life, he had attained to the highest degree of philosophy, namely,
   freedom from worldly possessions; this was evidenced by his daily
   conduct; he had but one tunic, and always walked barefooted. Not long
   after his banishment, he was recalled, received the churches under him,
   and boldly convened churches through the influence of Marcian, a man of
   extraordinary virtue and eloquence, who had formerly been enrolled
   among the troops of the palace, but at this period was a presbyter of
   the Novatian heresy, and the teacher of grammar to Anastasia and
   Carosa, [1444] the daughters of the emperor. There are still baths at
   Constantinople which bear the names of these princesses. It was for the
   sake of Marcian alone that the privilege above-mentioned was conceded
   to the Novatians.

   Chapter X.--Concerning Valentinian the Younger and Gratian. Persecution
   under Valens. The Homoousians, being oppressed by the Arians and
   Macedonians, send an Embassy to Rome. [1445]

   About this period, a son was born to Valentinian in the West, to whom
   the emperor gave his own name. Not long after, he proclaimed his son
   Gratian emperor; this prince was born before his father held the
   government.

   In the meantime, although hailstones of extraordinary magnitude fell in
   various places, and although many cities, particularly Nicæa in
   Bithynia, were shaken by earthquakes, yet Valens, the emperor, and
   Eudoxius, the bishop, paused not in their career, but continued to
   persecute all Christians who differed from them in opinion. They
   succeeded to the utmost of their expectations in their machinations
   against those who adhered to the Nicene doctrines; for throughout the
   greater time of Valens' rule, particularly in Thrace, Bithynia, and the
   Hellespont, and still further beyond, these Christians had neither
   churches nor priests. Valens and Eudoxius then directed their
   resentment against the Macedonians, who were more in number than the
   Christians above mentioned in that region, and persecuted them without
   measure.

   The Macedonians, in apprehension of further sufferings, sent deputies
   to various cities, and finally agreed to have recourse to Valentinian
   and to the bishop of Rome rather than share in the faith of Eudoxius
   and Valens and their followers; and when this seemed favorable for
   execution, they selected three of their own number,--Eustathius, bishop
   of Sebaste; Silvanus, bishop of Tarsus; and Theophilus, bishop of
   Castabalis,--and sent them to the Emperor Valentinian; they likewise
   intrusted them with a letter, addressed to Liberius, bishop of Rome,
   and to the other priests of the West, in which they entreated them as
   prelates who had adhered to the faith approved and confirmed by the
   apostles, and who before others ought to watch over religion, to
   receive their deputies with all confirmation, and to confer with them
   about what should be done in the interval until the affairs of the
   Church could be approvedly set in order.

   When the deputies arrived in Italy, they found that the emperor was in
   Gaul, engaged in war against the barbarians. As they considered that it
   would be perilous to visit the seat of war in Gaul, they delivered
   their letter to Liberius. [1446] After having conferred with him
   concerning the objects of their embassy, they condemned Arius and those
   who held and taught his doctrines; they renounced all heresies opposed
   to the faith established at Nicæa; and received the term
   "consubstantial," as being a word that conveys the same signification
   as the expression "like in substance." When they had presented a
   confession of faith, analogous to the above, to Liberius, he received
   them into communion with himself, and wrote to the bishops of the East,
   commending the orthodoxy of their faith, and detailing what had passed
   in the conference he had held with them. The confession of faith made
   by Eustathius and his companions was as follows:--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1445] Valesius remarks that the title of this chapter is incorrect,
   and that it was the Macedonians, and not the orthodox Christians, who
   sent the embassy to Rome.

   Chapter XI.--The Confession of Eustathius, Silvanus, and Theophilus,
   the Deputies of the Macedonians, to Liberius, Bishop of Rome.

   "To Liberius, our Lord and Brother, and Fellow-minister--Eustathius,
   Silvanus, and Theophilus send greeting in the Lord. [1447]

   "On account of the mad opinions of the heretics who do not cease to
   keep on sowing scandals for the Catholic churches, we who nullify their
   every attack confess the Synod which was held at Lampsacus, the one at
   Smyrna and the councils held in other places, by the orthodox bishops.
   We have furnished letters and sent on an embassy to your Goodness, as
   likewise to all the other bishops of Italy and of the West, to confirm
   and preserve the Catholic faith, which was established at the holy
   council of Nicæa, by the blessed Constantine and three hundred and
   eighteen God-fearing fathers.

   "This remains, by an unmixed and immovable settlement, until now, and
   will remain perpetually; in which the term consubstantial' is fixed in
   all holiness and piety in testimony against the perverseness of Arius.
   We confess, each with his own hand, that we with the aforesaid have
   always held this same faith, that we still hold it, and that we shall
   adhere to it to the last. We condemn Arius, his impious dogmas, and his
   disciples. We also condemn the heresies of Patropasianus, [1448] of
   Photinus, of Marcellus, of Paul of Samosata, and all who maintain such
   doctrines themselves. We anathematize all heresies opposed to the
   aforesaid faith established by the saintly fathers at Nicæa. We
   anathematize Arius especially, and condemn all such decrees as were
   enacted at Ariminum, in opposition to the aforesaid faith established
   by the holy council of Nicæa. We were formerly deluded by the guile and
   perjury of certain parties, and subscribed to these decrees when they
   were transmitted to Constantinople from Nicæa, a city of Thrace."

   After this confession they subjoined a copy of the entire formulary of
   Nicæa to their own creed, and, having received from Liberius a written
   account of all that they had transacted, they sailed to Sicily.

   Chapter XII.--Councils of Sicily and of Tyana. The Synod which was
   expected to be held in Cilicia is dissolved by Valens. The Persecution
   at that Time. Athanasius the Great flees again, and is in Concealment;
   by the Letter of Valens he reappears, and governs the Churches in
   Egypt.

   A council was convened at Sicily; [1449] and after the same doctrines
   had been confirmed as those set forth in the confession of the
   deputies, the assembly was dissolved.

   At the same time, a council was held at Tyana; and Eusebius, bishop of
   Cæsarea in Cappadocia, Athanasius, bishop of Ancyra, Pelagius, bishop
   of Laodicea, Zeno, bishop of Tyre, Paul, bishop of Emesa, Otreus,
   bishop of Melitene, and Gregory, bishop of Nazianzen, were present with
   many others, who, during the reign of Jovian, had assembled at Antioch,
   and determined to maintain the doctrine of the Son being consubstantial
   with the Father. The letters of Liberius and the Western bishops were
   read at this council. These letters afforded high satisfaction to the
   members of the council; and they wrote to all the churches, desiring
   them to peruse the decrees of the bishops in Asia, [1450] and the
   documents written by Liberius and the bishops of Italy, of Africa, of
   Gaul, and of Sicily, which had been intrusted to the deputies of the
   council of Lampsacus. They urged them to reflect on the great number of
   persons by whom these documents had been drawn up, and who were far
   more in number than the members of the council of Ariminum, and
   exhorted them to be of one mind, and to enter into communion with them,
   to signify the same by writing, and finally to assemble together at
   Tarsus in Cilicia before the end of the spring. On a fixed date which
   they prescribed, they urged one another to convene. On the approach of
   the appointed day, when the Synod was on the point of assembling at
   Tarsus, about thirty-four of the Asiatic bishops came together in
   Caria, in the province of Asia, commended the design of establishing
   uniformity of belief in the Church, but objected to the term
   "consubstantial," and insisted that the formularies of faith set forth
   by the councils of Antioch and Seleucia, and maintained by Lucian, the
   martyr, and by many of their predecessors, with dangers and tensions,
   ought to obtain the ascendancy over all others.

   The emperor, at the instigation of Eudoxius, prevented by letter the
   council from being convened in Cilicia, and even prohibited it under
   severe penalties. He also wrote to the governors of the provinces,
   commanding them to eject all bishops from their churches who had been
   banished by Constantine [1451] and who had again taken up their
   priesthood under the Emperor Julian. On account of this order, those
   who were at the head of the government of Egypt were anxious to deprive
   Athanasius of his bishopric and expel him from the city; for no light
   punishment was inserted in the imperial letters; for unless the
   injunctions were fulfilled, all the magistrates equally, and the
   soldiers under them, and counselors were condemned to the payment of
   much money and also threatened with bodily maltreatment. [1452]

   The majority of Christians of the city, however, assembled and besought
   the governor not to banish Athanasius without further consideration of
   the terms of the imperial letter, which merely specified all bishops
   who had been banished by Constantius and recalled by Julian; and it was
   manifest that Athanasius was not of this number, inasmuch as he had
   been recalled by Constantius and had resumed his bishopric; but Julian,
   at the very time that all the other bishops had been recalled,
   persecuted him, and finally Jovian recalled him. The governor was by no
   means convinced by these arguments; nevertheless, he restrained himself
   and did not give way to the use of force. The people ran together from
   every quarter; there was much commotion and perturbation throughout the
   city; an insurrection was expected; he therefore advised the emperor of
   the facts and allowed the bishop to remain in the city. Some days
   afterwards, when the popular excitement had seemingly abated,
   Athanasius secretly quitted the city at dusk, and concealed himself
   somewhere. The very same night, the governor of Egypt and the military
   chief took possession of the church in which Athanasius generally
   dwelt, and sought him in every part of the edifice, and even on the
   roof, but in vain; for they had calculated upon seizing the moment when
   the popular commotion had partially subsided, and when the whole city
   was wrapt in sleep, to execute the mandate of the emperor, and to
   transport Athanasius quietly from the city.

   Not to have found Athanasius naturally excited universal astonishment.
   Some attributed his escape to a special revelation from above; others
   to the advice of some of his followers; both had the same result; but
   more than human prudence seems to have been requisite to foresee and to
   avoid such a plot. Some say, that as soon as the people gave
   indications of being disposed to sedition, he concealed himself among
   the tombs of his ancestors, being apprehensive lest he should be
   regarded as the cause of any disturbances that might ensue; and that he
   afterwards retreated to some other place of concealment.

   The Emperor Valens, soon after, wrote to grant permission for him to
   return and hold his church. It is very doubtful, whether, in making
   this concession, Valens acted according to his own inclination. I
   rather imagine that, on reflecting on the esteem in which Athanasius
   was universally held, he feared to excite the displeasure of the
   Emperor Valentinian, who was well-known to be attached to the Nicene
   doctrines; or perhaps he was apprehensive of a commotion on the part of
   the many admirers of the bishop, lest some innovation might injure the
   public affairs.

   I also believe that the Arian presidents did not, on this occasion,
   plead very vehemently against Athanasius; for they considered that, if
   he were ejected from the city, he would probably traduce them to the
   emperors and then would have an occasion for conference with respect to
   them, and might possibly succeed in persuading Valens to adopt his own
   sentiments, and in arousing the anger of the like-minded Valentinian
   against themselves.

   They were greatly troubled by the evidences of the virtue and courage
   of Athanasius, which had been afforded by the events which had
   transpired during the reign of Constantius. He had, in fact, so
   skilfully evaded the plots of his enemies, that they had been
   constrained to consent to his reinstallation in the government of the
   churches of Egypt; and yet he could scarcely be induced to return from
   Italy, although letters had been dispatched by Constantius to that
   effect.

   I am convinced that it was solely from these reasons that Athanasius
   was not expelled from his church like the other bishops, who were
   subjected to as cruel a persecution as ever was inflicted by pagans.

   Those who would not change their doctrinal tenets were banished; their
   houses of prayer were taken from them, and placed in the possession of
   those who held opposite sentiments. Egypt alone was, during the life of
   Athanasius, exempted from this persecution.

   Chapter XIII.--Demophilus, an Arian, became Bishop of Constantinople
   after Eudoxius. The Pious elect Evagrius. Account of the Persecution
   which ensued.

   About this time the Emperor Valens went to Antioch on the Orontes;
   while he was on his journey Eudoxius died, after having governed the
   churches of Constantinople during the space of eleven years. [1453]
   Demophilus was immediately ordained as his successor by the Arian
   bishops. The followers of the Nicene doctrines, believing that the
   course of events was in their power, elected Evagrius as their bishop.
   He had been ordained by Eustathius, who had formerly governed the
   church of Antioch in Syria, and who having been recalled from
   banishment by Jovian, lived in a private manner at Constantinople, and
   devoted himself to the instruction of those who held his sentiments,
   exhorting them to perseverance in their view of the Divine Being. The
   Arian heretics were stirred to revolt, and commenced a violent
   persecution against those who had participated in the ordination of
   Evagrius. The Emperor Valens, who was then at Nicomedia, on being
   apprised of the occurrences that had taken place in Constantinople
   since the death of Eudoxius, was fearful lest any interest of the city
   should suffer by sedition, and therefore sent thither as many troops as
   he thought requisite to preserve tranquillity.

   Eustathius was arrested by his command and banished to Bizya, a city of
   Thrace, and Evagrius was exiled to some other region. And such was the
   manner of this event.

   Chapter XIV.--Account of the Eighty Pious Delegates in Nicomedia, whom
   Valens burned with the Vessel in Mid-Sea.

   The Arians, as is customary with the prosperous, because more insolent,
   [1454] persecuted unmercifully all Christians whose religious
   sentiments were opposed to their own.

   These Christians being exposed to bodily injuries, and betrayed to
   magistrates and prisons, and finding themselves moreover gradually
   impoverished by the frequent fines, were at length compelled to appeal
   for redress to the emperor. Although exceedingly angry, the emperor did
   not openly manifest any wrath, but secretly commanded the prefect to
   seize and slay the whole deputation. But the prefect, being
   apprehensive that a whole popular insurrection would be excited if he
   were to put so many good and religious men to death without any of the
   forms of justice, pretended that they were to be sent into exile, and
   under this pretext compelled them to embark on board a ship, to which
   they assented with the most perfect resignation. When they had sailed
   to about the center of the bay, which was called Astacius, the sailors,
   according to the orders they had received, set fire to the vessel and
   leaped into the tender. A wind arising, the ship was blown along to
   Dacibiza, a place on the sea-coast of Bithynia; but no sooner had it
   neared the shore, than it was utterly consumed with all the men on
   board.

   Chapter XV.--Disputes between Eusebius, Bishop of Cæsarea, and Basil
   the Great. Hence the Arians took courage and came to Cæsarea, and were
   repulsed.

   When Valens quitted Nicomedia, he went on to Antioch; [1455] and in
   passing through Cappadocia he did all in his power, according to
   custom, to injure the orthodox and to deliver up the churches to the
   Arians. He thought to accomplish his designs the more easily on account
   of a dispute [1456] which was then pending between Basil and Eusebius,
   who then governed the church of Cæsarea. This dissension had been the
   cause of Basil's departing from Pontus, where he lived conjointly with
   some monks who pursued the philosophy. The people and some of the most
   powerful and the wisest men in the city began to regard Eusebius with
   suspicion, particularly as they considered him the cause of the
   withdrawal of one who was equally celebrated for his piety and his
   eloquence; and they accordingly began to plan a secession and the
   holding of separate church. In the meantime Basil, fearing to be a
   source of further trouble to the Church, which was already rent by the
   dissensions of heretics, remained in retirement in the monasteries at
   Pontus. The emperor and the bishops of the Arian heresy, who were
   always attached to his suite, were more inspirited in their designs by
   the absence of Basil and the hatred of the people towards Eusebius. But
   the event was contrary to their judgment. On the first intelligence of
   the intention of the emperor to pass through Cappadocia, Basil quitted
   Pontus and returned to Cæsarea, where he effected a reconciliation with
   Eusebius, and by his eloquence he opportunely aided the Church. The
   projects of Valens were thus defeated, and he returned with his bishops
   without having accomplished any of his designs.

   Chapter XVI.--Basil becomes Bishop of Cæsarea after Eusebius; his
   Boldness towards the Emperor and the Prefect.

   Some time after, the emperor again visited Cappadocia, and found that
   Basil was administering the churches there after the death of Eusebius.
   [1457] He thought of expelling him, but was unwillingly restrained from
   his intention. It is said that the night after he had formed his plans
   his wife was disturbed by a frightful dream, and that his only son
   Galates was cut off by a rapid disease. The death of this son was
   universally attributed to the vengeance of God as a punishment of his
   parents for the machinations that had been carried on against Basil.
   Valens himself was of this opinion, and, after the death of his son,
   offered no further molestation to the bishop.

   When the prince was sinking under the disease, and at the point of
   death, the emperor sent for Basil and requested him to pray to God for
   his son's recovery. For as soon as Valens had arrived at Cæsarea, the
   prefect had sent for Basil and commanded him to embrace the religious
   sentiments of the emperor, menacing him with death in case of
   non-compliance. Basil replied that it would be great gain to him and
   the grant of the highest favor to be delivered as quickly as possible
   from the bondage of the body. The prefect gave him the rest of the day
   and the approaching night for deliberation, and advised him not to rush
   imprudently into obvious danger, but that he should come on the day
   after and declare his opinion. "I do not require to deliberate,"
   replied Basil. "My determination will be the same to-morrow as it is
   to-day; for since I am a creature I can never be induced to worship
   that which is similar to myself and worship it as God; neither will I
   conform to your religion, nor to that of the emperor. Although your
   distinction may be great, and although you have the honor of ruling no
   inconsiderable portion of the empire, yet I ought not on these accounts
   to seek to please men, and, at the same time, belittle that Divine
   faith which neither loss of goods, nor exile, nor condemnation to death
   would ever impel me to betray. Inflictions of this nature have never
   excited in my mind one pang of sorrow. I possess nothing but a cloak
   and a few books. I dwell on the earth as a traveler. The body through
   its weakness would have the better of all sensation and torture after
   the first blow."

   The prefect admired the courage evinced in this bold reply, and
   communicated the circumstance to the emperor. On the festival of the
   Epiphany, the emperor repaired to the church, with the rulers and his
   guards, presented gifts at the holy table, and held a conference with
   Basil, whose wisdom and whose order and arrangement in the conduct of
   the priesthood and the church elicited his praise.

   Not long after, however, the calumny of his enemies prevailed, and
   Basil was condemned to banishment. The night for the execution of the
   edict was at hand; the son of the emperor suddenly fell ill with a
   pressing and dangerous fever. The father prostrated himself on the
   earth and wept over the son who was still alive, and not knowing what
   other measures to take towards effecting the recovery of his son, he
   dispatched some of his attendants to Basil to come and visit the
   prostrate child; because he himself feared to summon the bishop, on
   account of the injury just inflicted upon him. Immediately on the
   arrival of Basil, the boy began to rally; so that many maintain that
   his recovery would have been complete, had not some heretics been
   summoned to pray with Basil for the restoration of the boy. It is said
   that the prefect, likewise, fell ill; but that on his repentance, and
   on prayer being offered to God, he was restored to health. The
   instances above adduced are quite inadequate to convey an idea of the
   wonderful endowments of Basil; his extreme addiction to the philosophic
   life and astonishing powers of eloquence attracted great celebrity.

   Chapter XVII.--Friendship of Basil and of Gregory, the Theologian;
   being Peers in Wisdom, they defend the Nicene Doctrines.

   Basil and Gregory were contemporaries, and they were recognized to be
   equally intent, so to speak, upon the cultivation of the virtues.
   [1458] They [1459] had both studied in their youth at Athens, under
   Himerius and Proæresius, the most approved sophists of the age; and
   afterwards at Antioch, under Libanius, the Syrian. But as they
   subsequently conceived a contempt for sophistry and the study of the
   law, they determined to study philosophy according to the law of the
   Church. After having spent some time in the pursuit of the sciences,
   taught by pagan philosophers, they entered upon the study of the
   commentaries which Origen and the best approved authors who lived
   before and after his time, have written in explanation of the Sacred
   Scriptures.

   They rendered great assistance to those who, like themselves,
   maintained the Nicene doctrines, for they manfully opposed the dogmas
   of the Arians, proving that these heretics did not rightly understand
   either the data upon which they proceeded, nor the opinions of Origen,
   upon which they mainly depended. These two holy men divided the perils
   of their undertaking, either by mutual agreement, or, as I have been
   informed, by lot. The cities in the neighborhood of Pontus fell to the
   lot of Basil; and here he founded numerous monasteries, and, by
   teaching the people, he persuaded them to hold like views with himself.
   After the death of his father, Gregory acted as bishop of the small
   city of Nazianzus, [1460] but resided on that account in a variety of
   places, and especially at Constantinople. Not long after he was
   appointed by the vote of many priests to act as president of the people
   there; for there was then neither bishop nor church in Constantinople,
   and the doctrines of the council of Nicæa were almost extinct.

   Chapter XVIII.--The Persecution which occurred at Antioch, on the
   Orontes. The Place of Prayer in Edessa, called after the Apostle
   Thomas; the Assembly there, and Confession of the Inhabitants of
   Edessa.

   The emperor went to Antioch, and entirely ejected from the churches of
   that city and of the neighboring cities all those who adhered to the
   Nicene doctrines; [1461] moreover, he oppressed them with manifold
   punishments; as some affirm, he commanded many to be put to death in
   various ways, and caused others to be cast into the river Orontes.
   Having heard that there was a magnificent oratory at Edessa, named
   after the Apostle Thomas, he went to see it. He beheld the members of
   the Catholic Church assembled for worship in the plain before the walls
   of the city; for there, too, they had been deprived of their houses of
   prayer. It is said that the emperor reproached the prefect thoroughly
   and struck him on the jaw with his fist for having permitted these
   congregations contrary to his edict. Modestus (for this was the name of
   the prefect), although he was himself a heretic, secretly warned the
   people of Edessa not to meet for prayer on the accustomed spot the next
   day; for he had received orders from the emperor to punish all who
   should be seized. He uttered such threats with the forethought that
   none, or at least but a few, would incur danger, and with the desire to
   appease the wrath of the monarch. But the people of Edessa, totally
   disregarding the threat, ran together with more than their customary
   zeal, and filled the usual place of meeting.

   Modestus, on being apprised of their proceedings, was undecided as to
   what measures ought to be adopted, and repaired in embarrassment to the
   plain with the throng. A woman, leading a child by the hand, and
   trailing her mantle in a way unbefitting the decency of women, forced
   her way through the files of the soldiers who were conducted by the
   prefect, as if bent upon some affair of importance. Modestus remarked
   her conduct, ordered her to be arrested, and summoned her into his
   presence, to inquire the cause of her running. She replied that she was
   hastening to the plain where the members of the Catholic Church were
   assembled. "Know you not," replied Modestus, "that the prefect is on
   his way thither for the purpose of condemning to death all who are
   found on the spot?" "I have heard so," replied she, "and this is the
   very reason of my haste; for I am fearful of arriving too late, and
   thus losing the honor of martyrdom for God." The governor having asked
   her why she took her child with her, she replied, "In order that he may
   share in the common suffering, and participate in the same reward."
   Modestus, struck with astonishment at the courage of this woman, went
   to the emperor, and, acquainting him with what had occurred, persuaded
   him not to carry out a design which he showed to be disgraceful and
   disastrous. Thus was the Christian faith confessed by the whole city of
   Edessa.

   Chapter XIX.--Death of the Great Athanasius; the Elevation of Lucius,
   who was Arian-Minded, to the See; the Numerous Calamities he brought
   upon the Churches in Egypt; Peter, who served after Athanasius, passed
   over to Rome.

   Athanasius, bishop of the church of Alexandria, died about this period,
   after having completed his high-priesthood in about forty-six years.
   [1462] The Arians having received early intelligence of his death,
   Euzoïus, president of the Arians at Antioch, and Magnus, the chief
   treasurer, were sent by the emperor, and lost no time in seizing and
   imprisoning Peter, whom Athanasius had appointed to succeed him in the
   bishopric; and they forthwith transferred the government of the church
   to Lucius.

   Hence those in Egypt suffered more grievously than those in other
   places, and misfortunes piled upon misfortunes oppressed the members of
   the Catholic Church; for as soon as Lucius settled in Alexandria, he
   attempted to take possession of the churches; he met with opposition
   from the people, and the clergy and holy virgins were accused as
   originators of the sedition. Some made their escape as if the city had
   fallen into the hands of an enemy; others were seized and imprisoned.
   Some of the prisoners were afterwards dragged from the dungeons to be
   torn with hooks and thongs, while others were burned by means of
   flaming torches. It seemed wonderful how they could possibly survive
   the tortures to which they were subjected. Banishment or even death
   itself would have been preferable to such sufferings. Peter, the
   bishop, made his escape from prison; and embarking on board a ship,
   proceeded to Rome, the bishop of which church held the same sentiments
   as himself. Thus the Arians, although not many in number, remained in
   possession of the churches. At the same time, an edict was issued by
   the emperor, enacting that as many of the followers of the Nicene
   doctrines should be ejected from Alexandria and the rest of Egypt, as
   might be directed by Lucius. Euzoïus, having thus accomplished all his
   designs, returned to Antioch.

   Chapter XX.--Persecution of the Egyptian Monks, and of the Disciples of
   St. Antony. They were enclosed in a Certain Island on Account of their
   Orthodoxy; the Miracles which they Wrought.

   Lucius went with the general of the soldiers in Egypt, against the
   monks in the desert; [1463] for he imagined that if he could overcome
   their opposition by interrupting the tranquillity which they loved, he
   would meet with fewer obstacles in drawing over to his party the
   Christians who inhabited the cities. The monasteries of this country
   were governed by several individuals of eminent sanctity, who were
   strenuously opposed to the heresy of Arius. The people, who were
   neither willing nor competent to enter upon the investigation of
   doctrinal questions, received their opinions from them, and thought
   with them; for they were persuaded that men whose virtue was manifested
   by their deeds were in possession of truth. We have heard that the
   leaders of these Egyptian ascetics were two men of the name of
   Macarius, of whom mention has already been made, [1464] Pambo and
   Heraclides, and other disciples of Antony.

   On reflecting that the Arians could never succeed in establishing an
   ascendency over the Catholic Church, unless the monks could be drawn
   over to their party, Lucius determined to have recourse to force to
   compel the monks to side with him, since he was unable to persuade
   them. But here again his scheme failed; for the monks were prepared to
   subject their necks to the sword rather than to swerve from the Nicene
   doctrines. It is related that, at the very time that the soldiers were
   about to attack them, a man whose limbs were withered and who was
   unable to stand on his feet was carried to them; and that when they had
   anointed him with oil, and commanded him in the name of Christ, whom
   Lucius persecuted, to arise and go to his house, he suddenly became
   whole. This miraculous cure openly manifested the necessity of adopting
   the sentiments of those to whom God himself had testified as possessing
   the truth, while Lucius was condemned, in that God heard their prayers
   and had healed the sick.

   But the plotters against the monks were not led to repentance by this
   miracle; on the contrary, they arrested these holy men by night, and
   conveyed them to an island of Egypt, concealed in the swamps. The
   inhabitants of this island had never heard of the Christian faith, and
   were devoted to the service of demons: the island contained a temple of
   great antiquity which was held in great reverence. It is said that when
   the monks landed on the island, the daughter of the priest, who was
   possessed of a devil, went to them. The girl ran screaming towards
   them; and the people of the island, astonished at her sudden and
   strange conduct, followed. When she drew near the ship in which were
   the holy messengers, she flung herself pleadingly upon the ground, and
   exclaimed supplicatingly in a loud voice, "Wherefore are you come to
   us, O servants of the great God? for we have long dwelt in this island
   as our residence; we have troubled no one. Unknown to men, we have
   concealed ourselves here, and are everywhere surrounded by these
   marshes. If, however, it please you, accept our possessions, and fix
   your abode here; we will quit the island."

   Such were her utterances. Macarius and his companions rebuked the
   demon, and the girl became sane. Her father and all her house, with the
   inhabitants of the island, immediately embraced Christianity, and after
   demolishing their temple, they transformed it into a church. On these
   occurrences being reported at Alexandria, Lucius was overcome with
   immoderate grief; and, fearing lest he should incur the hatred of his
   own partisans, and be accused of warring against God, and not against
   man, he sent secret orders for Macarius and his companions to be
   re-conveyed to their own dwellings in the wilderness. Thus did Lucius
   occasion troubles and commotions in Egypt.

   About the same period, Didymus the philosopher and several other
   illustrious men acquired great renown. Struck by their virtue, and by
   that of the monks, the people followed their doctrines and opposed
   those of the partisans of Lucius.

   The Arians, though not so strong in point of numbers as the other
   party, grievously persecuted the church of Egypt.

   Chapter XXI.--List of the Places in which the Nicene Doctrines were
   Represented; Faith manifested by the Scythians; Vetranio, the Leader of
   this Race.

   Arianism met with similar opposition at the same period in Osröene; but
   in the Cappadocias, Providence allotted such a divine and most educated
   pair of men,--Basil, the bishop of Cæsarea in that country, and
   Gregory, bishop of Nazianzen. [1465] Syria and the neighboring
   provinces, and more especially the city of Antioch, were plunged into
   confusion and disorder; for the Arians were very numerous in these
   parts, and had possession of the churches. The members of the Catholic
   Church were not, however, few in number. They were called Eustathians
   and Paulinists, and were under the guidance of Paulinus and Meletius,
   as has been before stated. It was through their instrumentality that
   the church of Antioch was preserved from the encroachments of the
   Arians, and enabled to resist the zeal of the emperor and of those in
   power about him. Indeed, it appears that in all the churches which were
   governed by brave men, the people did not deviate from their former
   opinions.

   It is said that this was the cause of the firmness with which the
   Scythians adhered to their faith. There are in this country a great
   number of cities, villages, and fortresses. The metropolis is called
   Tomi; it is a large and populous city, and lies on the sea-shore to the
   left of one sailing to the sea, called the Euxine.

   According to an ancient custom which still prevails, all the churches
   of the whole country are under the sway of one bishop. [1466]

   Vetranio ruled over these churches at the period that the emperor
   visited Tomi. Valens repaired to the church, and strove, according to
   his usual custom, to gain over the bishop to the heresy of Arius; but
   this latter manfully opposed his arguments, and after a courageous
   defense of the Nicene doctrines, quitted the emperor and proceeded to
   another church, whither he was followed by the people. Almost the
   entire city had crowded to see the emperor, for they expected that
   something extraordinary would result from this interview with the
   bishop.

   Valens was extremely offended at being left alone in the church with
   his attendants, and in resentment, condemned Vetranio to banishment.
   Not long after, however, he recalled him, because, I believe, he
   apprehended an insurrection; for the Scythians were offended at the
   absence of their bishop.

   He well knew that the Scythians were a courageous nation, and that
   their country, by the position of its places, possessed many natural
   advantages which rendered it necessary to the Roman Empire, for it
   served as a barrier to ward off the barbarians.

   Thus was the intention of the ruler openly frustrated by Vetranio. The
   Scythians themselves testify that he was good in all other respects and
   eminent for the virtue of his life.

   The resentment of the emperor was visited upon all the clergy except
   those of the Western churches; for Valentinian, who reigned over the
   Western regions, was an admirer of the Nicene doctrines, and was imbued
   with so much reverence for religion, that he never imposed any commands
   upon the priests, nor ever attempted to introduce any alteration for
   better or for worse in ecclesiastical regulations. Although he had
   become one of the best of emperors, and had shown his capacity to rule
   affairs, he considered that ecclesiastical matters were beyond the
   range of his jurisdiction.

   Chapter XXII.--At that Time, the Doctrine of the Holy Ghost was
   agitated, and it was decided that he is to be considered Consubstantial
   with the Father and the Son.

   A question was renewed at this juncture which had previously excited
   much inquiry and now more; namely, whether the Holy Ghost is or is not
   to be considered consubstantial with the Father and the Son. [1467]

   Many contentions and debates ensued on this subject, similar to those
   which had been held concerning the nature of God the Word. Those who
   asserted that the Son is dissimilar from the Father, and those who
   insisted that He is similar in substance to the Father, came to one
   common opinion concerning the Holy Ghost; for both parties maintained
   that the Holy Ghost differs in substance, and that He is but the
   Minister and the third in point of order, honor, and substance. Those,
   on the contrary, who believed that the Son is consubstantial with the
   Father, held also the same view about the Spirit. This doctrine was
   nobly maintained in Syria by Apolinarius, bishop of Laodicea; in Egypt
   by Athanasius, [1468] the bishop; and in Cappadocia and in the churches
   of Pontus by Basil [1469] and Gregory. [1470] The bishop of Rome, on
   learning that this question was agitated with great acrimony, and that
   it of course was augmented daily by controversies, wrote to the
   churches of the East and urged them to receive the doctrine upheld by
   the Western clergy; namely, that the three Persons of the Trinity are
   of the same substance and of equal dignity. The question having been
   thus decided by the Roman churches, peace was restored, and the inquiry
   appeared to have an end.

   Chapter XXIII.--Death of Liberius, Bishop of Rome. He is succeeded by
   Damasus and Syricius. [1471] Orthodox Doctrines prevail Everywhere
   throughout the West, except at Milan, where Auxentius is the
   High-Priest. Synod held at Rome, by which Auxentius is deposed; the
   Definition which it sent by Letter.

   About this period Liberius died, [1472] and Damasus succeeded to the
   see of Rome. [1473] A deacon named Ursicius, who had obtained some
   votes in his favor, but could not endure the defeat, therefore caused
   himself to be clandestinely ordained by some bishops of little note,
   and endeavored to create a division among the people and to hold a
   separate church. He succeeded in effecting this division, and some of
   the people respected him as bishop, while the rest adhered to Damasus.
   This gave rise to much contention and revolt among the people, which at
   length proceeded to the evil of wounds and murder. The prefect of Rome
   was obliged to interfere, and to punish many of the people and of the
   clergy; and he put an end to the attempt of Ursicius. [1474]

   With respect to doctrine, however, no dissension arose either at Rome
   or in any other of the Western churches. The people unanimously adhered
   to the form of belief established at Nicæa, and regarded the three
   persons of the Trinity as equal in dignity and in power.

   Auxentius and his followers differed from the others in opinion; he was
   then president of the church in Milan, and, in conjunction with a few
   partisans, was intent upon the introduction of innovations, and the
   maintenance of the Arian dogma of the dissimilarity of the Son and of
   the Holy Ghost, according to the inquiry which had last sprung up, in
   opposition to the unanimous agreement of the Western priests. The
   bishops of Gaul and of Venetia having reported that similar attempts to
   disturb the peace of the Church were being made by others among them,
   the bishops of several provinces assembled not long after at Rome, and
   decreed that Auxentius and those who held his sentiments should be
   aliens from their communion. They confirmed the traditional faith
   established by the council of Nicæa, and annulled all the decrees that
   had been issued at Ariminum contrary to that faith, under the plea that
   these decrees had not received the assent of the bishop of Rome, nor of
   other bishops who agreed with them, and that many who had been present
   at the Synod, had disapproved of the enactments there made by them.
   That such was the decision really formed by the Synod is testified by
   the epistle [1475] addressed by Damasus, the Roman bishop, and the rest
   of the assembly, to the bishops of Illyria. It is as follows: [1476] --

   "Damasus, Valerius, [1477] and the other bishops of the holy assembly
   convened at Rome to the dearly beloved brethren settled in Illyria,
   greeting in the Lord.

   "We believe that you uphold and teach to the people our holy faith,
   which is founded on the doctrine of the apostles. This faith differs in
   no respect from that defined by the Fathers; neither is it allowable
   for the priests of God, whose right it is to instruct the wise, to have
   any other thought. We have, however, been informed by some of our
   brethren of Gaul and of Venice, that certain individuals are bent upon
   the introduction of heresy.

   "All bishops should diligently guard against this evil, lest some of
   their flock should be led by inexperience, and others by simplicity, to
   oppose the proper interpretations.

   "Those who devise strange doctrines ought not to be followed; but the
   opinions of our fathers ought to be retained, whatever may be the
   diversity of judgment around us.

   "Hence Auxentius, bishop of Milan, has been publicly declared to be
   condemned pre-eminently in this matter. It is right, therefore, that
   all the teachers of the Roman world should be of one mind, and not
   pollute the faith by divers conflicting doctrines.

   "For when the malice of the heretics first began to mature itself, as
   the blasphemy of the Arians has even now done,--may it be far from
   us,--our fathers to the number of three hundred and eighteen elect,
   after making an investigation in Nicæa, erected the wall against the
   weapons of the devil, and repelled the deadly poison by this antidote.

   "This antidote consists in the belief, that the Father and the Son have
   one Godhead, one virtue, and one substance (chrema). It is also
   requisite to believe that the Holy Ghost is of the same hypostasis. We
   have decreed that those who hold any other doctrines are to be aliens
   from our communion.

   "Some have decreed to discolor this saving definition and adorable
   view; but in the very beginning, some of the persons who made the
   innovation at the council of Ariminum, or who were compelled to vote
   for the change, have since, in some measure, made amends by confessing
   that they were deceived by certain specious arguments, which did not
   appear to them to be contrary to the principles laid down by our
   fathers at Nicæa. The number of individuals congregated at the council
   of Ariminum proves nothing in prejudice of orthodox doctrines; for the
   council was held without the sanction of the bishops at Rome, whose
   opinion, before that of all others, ought to have been received, and
   without the assent either of Vincentius, who during a very long series
   of years guarded the episcopate without spot, or of many other bishops
   who agreed with those last mentioned.

   "Besides, as has been before stated, those very persons who seemed
   inclined to something illusory, testified their disapprobation of their
   own proceedings as soon as they made use of a better judgment.
   Therefore your purity must see that this alone is the faith which was
   established at Nicæa upon the authority of the apostles, and which must
   ever be retained inviolate, and that all bishops, whether of the East,
   or of the West, who profess the Catholic religion, ought to consider it
   an honor to be in communion with us. We believe that it will not be
   long before those who maintain other sentiments will be excluded from
   communion, and deprived of the name and dignity of bishop; so that the
   people who are now oppressed by the yoke of those pernicious and
   deceitful principles, may have liberty to breathe. For it is not in the
   power of these bishops to rectify the error of the people, inasmuch as
   they are themselves held by error. Let, therefore, the opinion of your
   honor also be in accord with all the priests of God, in which we
   believe you to be holy and firm. That we ought so to believe along with
   you will be proved by the exchange of letters with your love."

   Chapter XXIV.--Concerning St. Ambrose and his Elevation to the High
   Priesthood; how he persuaded the People to practice Piety. The
   Novatians of Phrygia and the Passover.

   The clergy of the West having thus anticipated the designs of those who
   sought to introduce innovations among them, [1478] carefully continued
   to preserve the inviolability of the faith which had from the beginning
   been handed down to them. With the solitary exception of Auxentius and
   his partisans, there were no individuals among them who entertained
   heterodox opinions. Auxentius, however, did not live long after this
   period. At his death a sedition arose among the people concerning the
   choice of a bishop for the church of Milan, and the city was in danger.
   Those who had aspired to the bishopric, and been defeated in their
   expectations, were loud in their menaces, as is usual in such
   commotions.

   Ambrosius, who was then the governor of the province, being fearful of
   the movement of the people, went to the church, and exhorted the people
   to cease from contention, to remember the laws, and to re-establish
   concord and the prosperity which springs from peace. Before he had
   ceased speaking, all his auditors at once suppressed the angry feelings
   by which they had been mutually agitated against each other, and
   directed the vote of the bishopric upon him, as a fulfillment of his
   counsel to harmony. They exhorted him to be baptized, for he was still
   uninitiated, and begged him to receive the priesthood. After he had
   refused and declined, and unfeignedly fled the business, the people
   still insisted, and declared that the contention would never be
   appeased unless he would accede to their wishes; and at length
   intelligence of these transactions was conveyed to the court. It is
   said that the Emperor Valentinian prayed, and returned thanks to God
   that the very man whom he had appointed governor had been chosen to
   fill a priestly office. When he was informed of the earnest desires of
   the people and the refusal of Ambrosius, he inferred that events had
   been so ordered by God for the purpose of restoring peace to the church
   of Milan, and commanded that Ambrosius should be ordained as quickly as
   possible. [1479] He was initiated and ordained at the same time, and
   forthwith proceeded to bring the church under his sway to unanimity of
   opinion concerning the Divine nature; for, while under the guidance of
   Auxentius, it had long been rent by dissensions on this subject. We
   shall hereafter have occasion to speak of the conduct of Ambrosius
   after his ordination, and of the courageous and holy manner in which he
   discharged the functions of the priesthood.

   About this period, the Novatians of Phrygia, contrary to their ancient
   custom, began to celebrate the festival of the Passover on the same day
   as the Jews. Novatius, the originator of their heresy, refused to
   receive those who repented of their sins into communion, and it was in
   this respect alone that he innovated upon the established doctrine. But
   he and those who succeeded him celebrated the feast of the Passover
   after the vernal equinox, according to the custom of the Roman church.
   Some Novatian bishops, however, assembled about this time at Pazi, a
   town of Phrygia, near the source of the river Sangarus, and agreeing
   not to follow, in this point of discipline, the practice of those who
   differed in doctrine from them, established a new law; they determined
   upon keeping the feast of unleavened bread, and upon celebrating the
   Passover on the same days as the Jews. Agelius, the bishop of the
   Novatians at Constantinople, and the bishops of the Novatians at Nicæa,
   Nicomedia, and Cotyæum, a noted city of Phrygia, did not take part in
   this Synod, although the Novatians consider them to be lords and
   colophons, so to speak, of the transactions affecting their heresy and
   their churches. How for this reason, these innovators advanced into
   divergence, and having cut themselves off, formed a separate church, I
   will speak of at the right time.

   Chapter XXV.--Concerning Apolinarius: Father and Son of that Name.
   Vitalianus, the Presbyter. On being dislodged from One Kind of Heresy,
   they incline to Others.

   About this period, Apolinarius openly devised a heresy, to which his
   name has since been given. [1480] He induced many persons to secede
   from the Church, and formed separate assemblies. Vitalius, a presbyter
   of Antioch, and one of the priests of Meletius, concurred with him in
   the confirmation of his peculiar opinion. In other respects, Vitalius
   was conspicuous in life and conduct, and was zealous in watching over
   those committed to his pastoral superintendence; hence he was greatly
   revered by the people. He seceded from communion with Meletius, joined
   Apolinarius and presided over those at Antioch who had embraced the
   same opinions; by the sanctity of his life he attracted a great number
   of followers, who are still called Vitalians by the citizens of
   Antioch. It is said he was led to secede from the Church from
   resentment at the contempt that was manifested towards him by Flavian,
   then one of his fellow-presbyters, but who was afterwards raised to the
   bishopric of Antioch. Flavian having prevented him from holding his
   customary interview with the bishop, he fancied himself despised and
   entered into communion with Apolinarius, and held him as his friend.
   From that period the members of this sect have formed separate churches
   in various cities, under their own bishops, and have established laws
   differing from those of the Catholic Church. Besides the customary
   sacred order, they sang some metrical songs composed by Apolinarius;
   for, in addition to his other learning he was a poet, and skilled in a
   great variety of meters, and by their sweetness he induced many to
   cleave to him. Men sang his strains at convivial meetings and at their
   daily labor, and women sang them while engaged at the loom. But,
   whether his tender poems were adapted for holidays, festivals, or other
   occasions, they were all alike to the praise and glory of God. Damasus,
   bishop of Rome, and Peter, bishop of Alexandria, were the first to
   learn that the heresy was creeping among the people, and at a council
   held at Rome [1481] they voted it to be foreign to the Catholic Church.
   It is said that it was as much from narrowness of mind as from any
   other cause that Apolinarius made an innovation in doctrine. For when
   Athanasius, who administered the church of Alexandria, was on his road
   back to Egypt from the place whither he had been banished by
   Constantine, he had to pass through Laodicea, and that while in that
   city he formed an intimacy with Apolinarius, which terminated in the
   strictest friendship. As, however, the heterodox considered it
   disgraceful to hold communion with Athanasius, George, the bishop of
   the Arians in that city, ejected Apolinarius in a very insulting manner
   from the church, under the plea that he had received Athanasius
   contrary to the canons and holy laws. The bishop did not rest here, but
   reproached him with crimes which he had committed and repented of at a
   remote period. For when Theodotus, the predecessor of George, regulated
   the church of Laodicea, Epiphanius, the sophist, recited a hymn which
   he had composed in honor of Dionysus. Apolinarius, who was then a youth
   and a pupil of Epiphanius, went to hear the recitation, accompanied by
   his father, whose name also was Apolinarius, and who was a noted
   grammarian. After the exordium, Epiphanius, according to the custom
   always observed at the public recitation of hymns, directed the
   uninitiated and the profane to go out of doors. But neither Apolinarius
   the younger nor the elder, nor, indeed, any of the Christians who were
   present, left the audience. When Theodotus, the bishop, heard that they
   had been present during the recitation, he was exceedingly displeased;
   he, however, pardoned the laymen who had committed this error, after
   they had received a moderate reproof. With respect to Apolinarius,
   father and son, he convicted them both publicly of their sin, and
   ejected them from the church; for they both belonged to the clergy, the
   father being a presbyter, and the son a reader of the Holy Scriptures.
   After some time had elapsed, and when the father and son had evinced by
   tears and fasting a degree of repentance adequate to their
   transgression, Theodotus restored them to their offices in the church.
   When George received the same bishopric, he excommunicated Apolinarius,
   and treated him as alien to the Church on account of his having, as
   before stated, received Athanasius into communion. It is said that
   Apolinarius besought him repeatedly to restore him to communion, but
   that he was inexorable. Apolinarius, overcome with grief, disturbed the
   Church, and by innovations in doctrines introduced the aforesaid
   heresy; [1482] and he thought by means of his eloquence to revenge
   himself on his enemy by proving that George had deposed one who was
   more deeply acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures than himself. Thus do
   the private animosities of the clergy from time to time greatly injure
   the Church, and divide religion into many heresies. And this is a
   proof; for had George, like Theodotus, received Apolinarius on his
   repentance into communion, I believe that we should never have heard of
   the heresy that bears his name. Men are prone, when loaded with
   opprobrium and contempt, to resort to rivalries and innovations;
   whereas when treated with justice, they become moderate, and remain in
   the same position.

   Chapter XXVI.--Eunomius and his Teacher Aëtius, their Affairs and
   Doctrines. They were the first who broached One Immersion for the
   Baptism.

   About this time, Eunomius, [1483] who had held the church in Cyzicus in
   place of Eleusius, and who presided over the Arian heresy, devised
   another heresy besides this, which some have called by his name, but
   which is sometimes denominated the Anomian heresy. Some assert that
   Eunomius was the first who ventured to maintain that divine baptism
   ought to be performed by one immersion, and to corrupt, in this manner,
   the apostolical tradition which has been carefully handed down to the
   present day. He invented, it is said, a mode of discipline contrary to
   that of the Church, and disguised the innovation under gravity and
   greater severity. He was an artist in words and contentions, and
   delighted in arguments. The generality of those who entertain his
   sentiments have the same predilections. They do not applaud a good
   course of life or manner, or mercy towards the needy, unless exhibited
   by persons of their own sect, so much as skill in disputation and the
   power of triumphing in debates. Persons possessed of these
   accomplishments are accounted pious above all others among them. Others
   assert, I believe more truthfully, that Theophronius, a native of
   Cappadocia, and Eutychius, both zealous propagators of this heresy,
   seceded from communion with Eunomius during the succeeding reign, and
   innovated about the other doctrines of Eunomius and about the divine
   baptism. They asserted that baptism ought not to be administered in the
   name of the Trinity, but in the name of the death of Christ. It appears
   that Eunomius broached no new opinion on the subject, but was from the
   beginning firmly attached to the sentiments of Arius, and remained so.
   After his elevation to the bishopric of Cyzicus, he was accused by his
   own clergy of introducing innovations in doctrine. Eudoxius, ruler of
   the Arian heresy at Constantinople, summoned him and obliged him to
   give an account of his doctrines to the people; finding, however, no
   fault in him, Eudoxius exhorted him to return to Cyzicus. Eunomius,
   however, replied, that he could not remain with people who regarded him
   with suspicion; and, it is said, seized the opportunity for secession,
   although it seems that, in taking this step he was really actuated by
   the resentment he felt at the refusal which Aëtius, his teacher, had
   met with, of being received into communion. Eunomius, it is added,
   dwelt with Aëtius, and never deviated from his original sentiments.
   Such are the conflicting accounts of various individuals; some narrate
   the circumstances in one way, and some in another. But whether it was
   Eunomius, or any other person, who first made these innovations upon
   the tradition of baptism, it seems to me that such innovators, whoever
   they may have been, were alone in danger, according to their own
   representation, of quitting this life without having received the
   divine baptism; for if, after they had been baptized according to the
   mode recommended from the beginning, they found it impossible to
   rebaptize themselves, it must be admitted that they introduced a
   practice to which they had not themselves submitted, and thus undertook
   to administer to others what had never been administered to them by
   themselves nor by others. Thus, after having laid down the dogma by
   some non-existent principle and private assumption, they proceeded to
   bestow upon others what they had not themselves received. The absurdity
   of this assumption is manifest from their own confession; for they
   admit that the uninitiated have not the power to baptize others. Now,
   according to their opinion, he who has not been baptized in conformity
   with their tradition is unbaptized as one not properly initiated, and
   they confirm this opinion by their practice, inasmuch as they rebaptize
   all those who join their sect, although previously initiated according
   to the tradition of the Catholic Church. These varying dogmas are the
   sources of innumerable troubles to religion; and many are deterred from
   embracing Christianity by the diversity of opinion which prevails in
   matters of doctrine.

   The disputes daily became stronger, and, as in the beginning of
   heresies, they grew; for they had leaders who were not deficient in
   zeal or power of words; indeed, it appears that the greater part of the
   Catholic Church would have been subverted by this heresy, had it not
   found opponents in Basil and Gregory, the Cappadocians. The reign of
   Theodosius began a little while after; he banished the founders of
   heretical sects from the populous parts of the empire to the more
   desert regions.

   But, lest those who read my history should be ignorant of the precise
   nature of the two heresies to which I have more especially alluded, I
   think it necessary to state that Aëtius, the Syrian, was the originator
   of the heresy usually attributed to Eunomius; and that, like Arius, he
   maintained that the Son is dissimilar from the Father, that He is a
   created being, and was created out of what had no previous existence.
   Those who held these views were formerly called Aëtians; but
   afterwards, during the reign of Constantius, when, as we have stated,
   some parties maintained that the Son is consubstantial with the Father,
   and others that He is like in substance to the Father, and when the
   council of Ariminum had decreed that the Son is only to be considered
   like unto the Father, Aëtius was condemned to banishment, as guilty of
   impiety and blasphemy against God. For some time subsequently his
   heresy seemed to have been suppressed; for neither any other man of
   note, nor even Eunomius, ventured openly upon undertaking its defense.
   But when Eunomius was raised to the church of Cyzicus in place of
   Eleusius, he could no longer quietly restrain himself, and in open
   debate he brought forward again the tenets of Aëtius. Hence, as it
   often happens that the names of the original founders of heretical
   sects pass into oblivion, the followers of Eunomius were designated by
   his own name, although he merely renewed the heresy of Aëtius, and
   promulgated it with greater boldness than was done by him who first
   handed it down.

   Chapter XXVII.--Account Given, by Gregory the Theologian, of
   Apolinarius and Eunomius, in a Letter to Nectarius. Their Heresy was
   distinguished by the Philosophy of the Monks who were then Living, for
   the Heresy of these two held Nearly the Entire East.

   It is obvious that Eunomius and Aëtius held the same opinions. In
   several passages of his writings, Eunomius boasts and frequently
   testifies that Aëtius was his instructor. Gregory, bishop of Nazianzen,
   speaks in the following terms of Apolinarius in a letter addressed to
   Nectarius, the leader of the church in Constantinople: [1484]
   "Eunomius, who is a constant source of trouble among us, is not content
   with being a burden to us himself, but would consider himself to blame
   if he did not strive to drag every one with him to the destruction
   whither he is hastening. Such conduct, however, may be tolerated in
   some degree. The most grievous calamity against which the Church has
   now to struggle arises from the audacity of the Apolinarians. I know
   not how your Holiness could have agreed that they should be as free to
   hold meetings as we ourselves. You have been fully instructed by the
   grace of God, in the Divine mysteries, and not only understand the
   defense of the Word of God, but also whatever innovations have been
   made by heretics against the sound faith; yet it may not be amiss for
   your revered Excellency to hear from our narrowness, that a book
   written by Apolinarius has fallen into my hands, in which the
   proposition surpasses all forms of heretical pravity. He affirms that
   the flesh assumed for the transformation of our nature, under the
   dispensation of the only begotten Son of God was not acquired for this
   end; but that this carnal nature existed in the Son from the beginning.
   He substantiates this evil hypothesis by a misapplication of the
   following words of Scripture: No man hath ascended up into heaven.'
   [1485] He alleges from this text, that Christ was the Son of man before
   He descended from heaven, and that when He did descend, He brought with
   Him His own flesh which He had already possessed in heaven which was
   before the ages and essentially united. He also states another
   apostolic saying: The second man is from heaven.' [1486] He, moreover,
   maintains that the man who came down from heaven was destitute of
   intellect (nous), but that the Deity of the only begotten Son fulfilled
   the nature of intellect, and constituted the third part of the human
   compound. The body and soul (psuche) formed two parts, as in other men,
   but there was no intellect, but the Word of God filled the place of
   intellect. Nor does this end the awful spectacle; for the most grievous
   point of the heresy is, that he asserts that the only-begotten God, the
   Judge of all men, the Giver of life, and the Destroyer of death, is
   Himself subject to death; that He suffered in His own Godhead, and that
   in the resurrection of the body in the third day, the Godhead also was
   raised from the dead with the body; and that it was raised again from
   the dead by the Father. It would take too long to recount all the other
   extravagant doctrines propounded by these heretics." What I have said
   may, I think, suffice to show the nature of the sentiments maintained
   by Apolinarius and Eunomius. If any one desire more detailed
   information, I can only refer him to the works on the subject written
   either by them or by others concerning these men. I do not profess
   easily to understand or to expound these matters, as it seems to me the
   fact that these dogmas did not prevail and make further advance is to
   be attributed, in addition to the causes mentioned, especially to the
   monks of that period; for all those philosophers in Syria, Cappadocia,
   and the neighboring provinces, were sincerely attached to the Nicene
   faith. The eastern regions, however, from Cilicia to Phoenicia, were
   endangered by the heresy of Apolinarius. The heresy of Eunomius was
   spread from Cilicia and the mountains of Taurus as far as the
   Hellespont and Constantinople. These two heretics found it easy to
   attract to their respective parties the persons among whom they dwelt,
   and those of the neighborhood. But the same fate awaited them that had
   been experienced by the Arians; for the people admired the monks who
   manifested their virtue by works and believed that they held right
   opinions, while they turned away from those who held other opinions, as
   impious and as holding spurious doctrines. In the same way the
   Egyptians were led by the monks to oppose the Arians.

   Chapter XXVIII.--Of the Holy Men who flourished at this Period in
   Egypt. John, or Amon, [1487] Benus, Theonas, Copres, Helles, Elias,
   Apelles, Isidore, Serapion, Dioscorus, and Eulogius.

   As this period was distinguished by many holy men, [1488] who devoted
   themselves to a life of philosophy, it seems requisite to give some
   account of them, for in that time there flourished a very great
   abundance of men beloved of God. There was not, it appears, a more
   celebrated man in Egypt than John. He had received from God the power
   of discerning the future and the most hidden things as clearly as the
   ancient prophets, and he had, moreover, the gift of healing those who
   suffered with incurable afflictions and diseases. Or was another
   eminent man of this period; he had lived in solitude from his earliest
   youth, occupying himself continually in singing the praises of God. He
   subsisted on herbs and roots, and his drink was water, when he could
   find it. In his old age he went, by the command of God, to Thebaïs,
   where he presided over several monasteries, nor was he without part in
   divine works. By means of prayer alone he expelled diseases and devils.
   He knew nothing of letters, nor did he need books to support his
   memory; for whatever he received into his mind was never afterwards
   forgotten.

   Ammon, the leader of the monks called Tabennesiotians, dwelt in the
   same region, and was followed by about three thousand disciples. Benus
   and Theonas likewise presided over monastic orders, and possessed the
   gift of foreknowledge and of prophecy. It is said that though Theonas
   was versed in all the learning of the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the
   Romans, he practiced silence for the space of thirty years. Benus was
   never seen to manifest any signs of anger, and never heard to swear, or
   to utter a false, a vain, a rash, or a useless word.

   Copres, Helles, and Elias also flourished at this period. It is said
   that Copres had received from God the power of healing sickness and
   divers diseases, and of overcoming demons. Helles had from his youth
   upwards been trained in the monastic life, and he wrought many
   wonderful works. He could carry fire in his bosom without burning his
   clothes. He excited his fellow-monks to the practice of virtue by
   representing that with a good conduct, the display of miracles would
   follow. Elias, who practiced philosophy near the city of Antinoüs, was
   at this period about a hundred and ten years of age; before this he
   said he had passed seventy years alone in the desert. Notwithstanding
   his advanced age, he was unremitting in the practice of fasting and
   courageous discipline.

   Apelles flourished at the same period, and performed numerous miracles
   in the Egyptian monasteries, near the city of Acoris. He at one time
   worked as a smith, for this was his trade; and one night the devil
   undertook to tempt him to incontinence, by appearing before him in the
   form of a beautiful woman; Apelles, however, seized the iron which was
   heating in the furnace, and burnt the face of the devil, who screamed
   like a wild bird and ran away.

   Isidore, Serapion, and Dioscorus, at this period, were among the most
   celebrated fathers of the monks. Isidore caused his monastery to be
   closed, so that no one could obtain egress or ingress, and supplied the
   wants of those within the walls. Serapion lived in the neighborhood of
   Arsenoites, and had about a thousand monks under his guidance. He
   taught all to earn their provisions by their labors and to provide for
   others who were poor. During harvest-time they busied themselves in
   reaping for pay; they set aside sufficient corn for their own use, and
   shared it with the rest of the monks. Dioscorus had not more than a
   hundred disciples; he was a presbyter, and applied himself with great
   exactness to the duties of his priesthood; he examined and carefully
   questioned those who presented themselves as candidates for
   participation in the holy mysteries, so that they might purify their
   minds and not be without a consciousness of any evil they might have
   committed. The presbyter Eulogius was still more scrupulous in the
   dispensation of the Divine mysteries. It is said that, when he was
   officiating in the priestly office, he could discern what was in the
   minds of those who came to him, so that he could clearly detect sin,
   and the secret thoughts of each one of his audience. He excluded from
   the altar all who had perpetrated crime or formed evil resolutions, and
   publicly convicted them of sin; but, on their purifying themselves by
   repentance, he again received them into communion.

   Chapter XXIX.--Concerning the Monks of Thebaïs: Apollos, Dorotheus;
   concerning Piammon, John, Mark, Macarius, Apollodorus, Moses, Paul, who
   was in Ferma, Pacho, Stephen, and Pior.

   Apollos flourished about the same period in Thebaïs. He early devoted
   himself to a life of philosophy; and after having passed forty years in
   the desert, he shut himself up, by the command of God, in a cave formed
   at the foot of a mountain, near a very populous district. By the
   multitude of his miracles, he soon became distinguished, and was the
   head of many monks; for he directed them profitably by his
   instructions. Timothy, who conducted the church of Alexandria, has
   given us a history of his method of discipline and of what divine and
   marvelous deeds he was a worker; he also narrates the lives of other
   approved monks, many of whom I have mentioned. [1489]

   In that time many good monks, to the number of about two thousand,
   preached philosophy in the neighborhood of Alexandria; some in a
   district called the Hermitage, and others more towards Mareotis and
   Libya. Dorotheus, a native of Thebes, was among the most celebrated of
   these monks. He spent the day in collecting stones upon the seashore,
   which he used in erecting cells to be given to those who were unable to
   build them. During the night, he employed himself in weaving baskets of
   palm leaves; and these he sold, to obtain the means of subsistence. He
   ate six ounces of bread with a few vegetables daily, and drank nothing
   but water. Having accustomed himself to this extreme abstinence from
   his youth, he continued to observe it in old age. He was never seen to
   recline on a mat or a bed, nor even to place his limbs in an easy
   attitude, or willingly to surrender himself to sleep. Sometimes, from
   natural lassitude, his eyes would involuntarily close when he was at
   his daily labor or his meals; and when nodding during his eating, the
   food would fall from his mouth. One day, being utterly overcome by
   drowsiness, he fell down on the mat; he was displeased at finding
   himself in this position, and said, in an undertone of voice, "If
   angels are persuaded to sleep, you will persuade also the zealous."
   Perhaps he might have said this to himself, or perhaps to the demon who
   had become an impediment to his zealous exercises. He was once asked by
   a person who came to him while he was exhausting himself, why he
   destroyed his body. "Because it destroys me," was his reply.

   Piammon and John presided over two celebrated Egyptian monasteries near
   Diolcus. They were presbyters who discharged their priesthood very
   carefully and reverently. It is said that one day, when Piammon was
   officiating as priest, he beheld an angel standing near the holy table
   and writing down in a book the names of the monks who were present,
   while he erased the names of those who were absent. John had received
   from God such power over sufferings and diseases, that he healed the
   gouty and restored the paralytic.

   A very old man, named Benjamin, was practicing philosophy very
   brilliantly about this period, in the desert near Scetis. God had
   bestowed upon him the power of relieving the sick of every disease
   without medicine, by the touch only of his hand, or by means of a
   little oil consecrated by prayer. The story is, that he was attacked by
   a dropsy, and his body was swollen to such a size that it became
   necessary, in order to carry him from his cell, to enlarge the door. As
   his malady would not admit of his lying in a recumbent posture, he
   remained, during eight months, seated on a very large skin, and
   continued to heal the sick, without regretting that his own recovery
   was not effected. He comforted those who came to visit him, and
   requested them to pray for his soul; adding that he cared little for
   his body, for it had been of no service to him when in health, and
   could not, now that it was diseased, be of any injury to him.

   About the same time the celebrated Mark, Marcarius the younger,
   Apollonius, and Moses, an Egyptian, dwelt at Scetis. It is said that
   Mark was, from his youth upwards, distinguished by extreme mildness and
   prudence; he committed the Sacred Scriptures to memory, and manifested
   such eminent piety that Macarius himself, the presbyter of Celliæ,
   [1490] declared that he had never given to him what priests present to
   the initiated at the holy table, but that an angel administered it to
   him whose hand up to the forearm he declares himself to have seen.

   Macarius had received from God the power of dispelling demons. A murder
   which he had unintentionally committed was the original cause of his
   embracing a life of philosophy. He was a shepherd, and led his flock to
   graze on the banks of Lake Mareotis, when in sport he slew one of his
   companions. Fearful of being delivered up to justice, he fled to the
   desert. Here he concealed himself during three years, and afterwards
   erected a small dwelling on the spot, in which he dwelt twenty-five
   years. He was accustomed to say that he owed much to the calamity that
   had befallen him in early life, and even called the unintentional
   murder he had committed a salutary deed, inasmuch as it had been the
   cause of his embracing philosophy and a blessed mode of life.

   Apollonius, after passing his life in the pursuits of commerce, retired
   in his old age to Scetis. On reflecting that he was too old to learn
   writing or any other art, he purchased with his own money a supply of
   every kind of drug, and of food suited for the sick, some of which he
   carried until the ninth hour to the door of every monastery, for the
   relief of those who were suffering from disease. Finding this practice
   advantageous to himself, he adopted this mode of life; and when he felt
   death approaching he delivered his drugs to one whom he exhorted to go
   and do as he had done.

   Moses was originally a slave, but was driven from his master's house on
   account of his immorality. He joined some robbers, and became leader of
   the band. After having perpetrated many evil deeds and dared some
   murders, by some sudden conversion he embraced the monastic life, and
   attained the highest point of philosophy. As the healthful and vigorous
   habit of body which had been induced by his former avocations acted as
   a stimulus to his imagination and excited a desire for pleasure, he
   resorted to every possible means of macerating his body; thus, he
   subsisted on a little bread without cooked food, subjected himself to
   severe labor, and prayed fifty times daily; he prayed standing, without
   bending his knees or closing his eyes in sleep. He sometimes went
   during the night to the cells of the monks and secretly filled their
   pitchers with water, and this was very laborious, for he had sometimes
   to go ten, sometimes twenty, and sometimes thirty and more, stadia in
   quest of water. Notwithstanding all his efforts to macerate his body,
   it was long before he could subdue his natural vigor of constitution.
   It is reported that robbers once broke into the dwelling where he was
   practicing philosophy; he seized and bound them, threw the four men
   across his shoulders, and bore them to the church, that the monks who
   were there assembled might deal with them as they thought fit, for he
   did not consider himself authorized to punish any one. For they say so
   sudden a conversion from vice to virtue was never before witnessed, nor
   such rapid attainments in monastical philosophy. Hence God rendered him
   an object of dread to the demons, and he was ordained presbyter over
   the monks at Scetis. After a life spent in this manner, he died at the
   age of seventy-five, leaving behind him numerous eminent disciples.

   Paul, Pachon, Stephen, and Moses, of whom the two latter were Libyans,
   and Pior, who was an Egyptian, flourished during this reign. Paul dwelt
   at Ferme, a mountain of Scetis, and presided over five hundred
   ascetics. He did not labor with his hands, neither did he receive alms
   of any one, except such food as was necessary for his subsistence. He
   did nothing but pray, and daily offered up to God three hundred
   prayers. He placed three hundred pebbles in his bosom, for fear of
   omitting any of these prayers; and, at the conclusion of each, he took
   away one of the pebbles. When there were no pebbles remaining, he knew
   that he had gone through the whole course of his prescribed prayers.

   Pachon also flourished during this period at Scetis. He followed this
   career from youth to extreme old age, without ever being found unmanly
   in self-control by the appetites of the body, the passions of the soul,
   or a demon,--in short, in all those things which the philosopher should
   conquer.

   Stephen dwelt at Mareotis near Marmarica. During sixty years, through
   exactness, he attained the perfection of asceticism, became very noted
   as a monk, and was intimate with Antony the Great. He was very mild and
   prudent, and his usual style of conversation was sweet and profitable,
   and well calculated to comfort the souls of the afflicted, to transform
   them into good spirits, if even they had previously been depressed by
   griefs which seemed necessary. He behaved similarly about his own
   afflictions. He was troubled with a severe and incurable ulcer, and
   surgeons were employed to operate upon the diseased members. During the
   operation Stephen employed himself in weaving palm leaves, and exhorted
   those who were around him not to concern themselves about his
   sufferings. He told them to have no other thought than that God does
   nothing but for our good, and that his affliction would tend to his
   real welfare, inasmuch as it would perhaps atone for his sins, it being
   better to be judged in this life than in the life to come.

   Moses was celebrated for his meekness, his love, and his power of
   healing of sufferings by prayer. Pior determined, from his youth, to
   devote himself to a life of philosophy; and, with this view, quitted
   his father's house after having made a vow that he would never again
   look upon any of his relations. After fifty years had expired, one of
   his sisters heard that he was still alive, and she was so transported
   with joy at this unexpected intelligence, that she could not rest till
   she had seen him. The bishop of the place where she resided was so
   affected by the groans and tears of the aged woman, that he wrote to
   the leaders of the monks in the desert of Scetis, desiring them to send
   Pior to him. The superiors accordingly directed him to repair to the
   city of his birth, and he could not say nay, for disobedience was
   regarded as unlawful by the monks of Egypt, and I think also by other
   monks. He went with another monk to the door of his father's house, and
   caused himself to be announced. When he heard the door being opened, he
   closed his eyes, and calling his sister by name, he said to her, "I am
   Pior, your brother; look at me as much as you please." His sister was
   delighted beyond measure at again beholding him, and returned thanks to
   God. He prayed at the door where he stood, and then returned to the
   place where he lived; there he dug a well, and found that the water was
   bitter, but he persevered in the use of it till his death. Then the
   height to which he had carried his self-denial was known; for after he
   died, several attempted to practice philosophy in the place where he
   had dwelt, but found it impossible to remain there. I am convinced
   that, had it not been for the principles of philosophy which he had
   espoused, he could easily have changed the water to a sweet taste by
   prayer; for he caused water to flow in a spot where none had existed
   previously. It is said that some monks, under the guidance of Moses,
   undertook to dig a well, but the expected vein did not appear, nor did
   any depth yield the water, and they were about to abandon the task,
   when, about midday, Pior joined them; he first embraced them, and then
   rebuked their want of faith and littleness of soul; he then descended
   into the pit they had excavated; and, after engaging in prayer, struck
   the ground thrice with a rod. A spring of water soon after rose to the
   surface, and filled the whole excavation. After prayer, Pior departed;
   and though the monks urged him to break his fast with them, he refused,
   alleging that he had not been sent to them for that purpose, but merely
   in order to perform the act he had effected. [1491]

   Chapter XXX.--Monks of Scetis: Origen, Didymus, Cronion, Orsisius,
   Putubatus, Arsion, Serapion, Ammon, Eusebius, and Dioscorus, the
   Brethren who are called Long, and Evagrius the Philosopher.

   At this period, Origen, one of the disciples of Antony the Great, was
   still living at a great age, in the monasteries of Scetis. [1492] Also,
   Didymus, and Cronion, who was about one hundred and ten years of age,
   Arsisius the Great, Putubatus, Arsion, and Serapion, all of whom had
   been contemporary with Antony the Great. They had grown old in the
   exercise of philosophy, and were at this period presiding over the
   monasteries. There were some holy men among them who were young and
   middle aged, but who were celebrated for their excellent and good
   qualities. Among these were Ammonius, Eusebius, and Dioscorus. They
   were brothers, but on account of their height of stature were called
   the "Long Brothers." [1493] It is said that Ammon attained the summit
   of philosophy, and consequently overcame the love of ease and pleasure.
   He was very studious, and had read the works of Origen, of Didymus, and
   of other ecclesiastical writers. From his youth to the day of his death
   he never tasted anything, with the exception of bread, that had been
   prepared by means of fire. He was once chosen to be ordained bishop;
   and after urging every argument that could be devised in rejection of
   the honor, but in vain, he cut off one of his ears, and said to those
   who had come for him, "Go away. Henceforward the priestly law forbids
   my ordination, for the person of a priest should be perfect." Those who
   had been sent for him accordingly departed; but, on ascertaining that
   the Church does not observe the Jewish law in requiring a priest to be
   perfect in all his members, but merely requires him to be
   irreprehensible in point of morals, they returned to Ammon, and
   endeavored to take him by force. He protested to them that, if they
   attempted any violence against him, he would cut out his tongue; and,
   terrified at this menace, they immediately took their departure. Ammon
   was ever after surnamed Parotes. Some time afterwards, during the
   ensuing reign, the wise Evagrius formed an intimacy with him. Evagrius
   [1494] was a wise man, powerful in thought and in word, and skillful in
   discerning the arguments which led to virtue and to vice, and capable
   in urging others to imitate the one, and to eschew the other. His
   eloquence is fully attested by the works he has left behind him. [1495]
   With respect to his moral character, it is said that he was totally
   free from all pride or superciliousness, so that he was not elated when
   just commendations were awarded him, nor displeased when unjust
   reproaches were brought against him. He was a citizen of Iberia, near
   the Euxine. He had philosophized and studied the Sacred Scriptures
   under Gregory, bishop of Nazianzen, and had filled the office of
   archdeacon when Gregory administered the church in Constantinople. He
   was handsome in person, and careful in his mode of attire; and hence an
   acquaintanceship he had formed with a certain lady excited the jealousy
   of her husband, who plotted his death. While the plot was about being
   carried forward into deed, God sent him while sleeping, a fearful and
   saving vision in a dream. It appeared to him that he had been arrested
   in the act of committing some crime, and that he was bound hand and
   foot in irons. As he was being led before the magistrates to receive
   the sentence of condemnation, a man who held in his hand the book of
   the Holy Gospels addressed him, and promised to deliver him from his
   bonds, and confirmed this with an oath, provided he would quit the
   city. Evagrius touched the book, and made oath that he would do so.
   Immediately his chains appeared to fall off, and he awoke. He was
   convinced by this divine dream, and fled the danger. He resolved upon
   devoting himself to a life of asceticism, and proceeded from
   Constantinople to Jerusalem. Some time after he went to visit the
   philosophers of Scetis, and gladly determined to live there.

   Chapter XXXI.--Concerning the Monks of Nitria, and the Monasteries
   called Cells; about the One in Rhinocorura; about Melas, Dionysius, and
   Solon.

   They call this place Nitria. It is inhabited by a great number of
   persons devoted to a life of philosophy, and derives its name from its
   vicinity to a village in which nitre is gathered. It contains about
   fifty monasteries, built tolerably near to each other, some of which
   are inhabited by monks who live together in society, and others by
   monks who have adopted a solitary mode of existence. More in the
   interior of the desert, about seventy stadia from this locality, is
   another place called Cellia, [1496] throughout which numerous little
   dwellings are dispersed hither and thither, and hence its name; but at
   such a distance that those who dwell in them can neither see nor hear
   each other. They assemble together on the first and last days of each
   week; and if any monk happen to be absent, it is evident that he has
   been left behind involuntarily, having been hindered by suffering some
   disease; they do not all go immediately to see and nurse him, but each
   one in turn at different times, and bearing whatever each has suitable
   for disease. Except for such a cause, they seldom converse together,
   unless, indeed, there be one among them capable of communicating
   further knowledge concerning God and the salvation of the soul. Those
   who dwell in the cells are those who have attained the summit of
   philosophy, and who are therefore able to regulate their own conduct,
   to live alone, and are separated from the others for the sake of
   quietude. This is what I had briefly to state concerning Scetis and its
   philosophers. Some one would probably censure my writing as prolix,
   were I to enter into further details concerning their mode of life; for
   they have established individual courses of life, labors, customs,
   exercises, abstinence, and time, divided naturally according to the age
   of the individual.

   Rhinocorura was also celebrated at this period, on account of the holy
   men, not from abroad, but who were natives of the place. I have heard
   [1497] that the most eminent philosophers among them were Melas, who
   then administered the church of the country; Dionysius, who presided
   over a monastery situated to the north of the city; and Solon, the
   brother and successor to the bishopric of Melas. It is said that when
   the decree for the ejection of all priests opposed to Arianism was
   issued, the officers appointed to apprehend Melas found him engaged as
   the lowest servant, in trimming the lights of the church, with a girdle
   soiled with oil on his cloak, and carrying the wicks. When they asked
   him for the bishop, he replied that he was within, and that he would
   conduct them to him. As they were fatigued with their journey, he led
   them to the episcopal dwelling, made them sit down at table, and gave
   them to eat of such things as he had. After the repast, he supplied
   them with water to wash their hands; for he served the guests, and then
   told them who he was. Amazed at his conduct, they confessed the mission
   on which they had arrived; but from respect to him, gave him full
   liberty to go whereever he would. He, however, replied that he would
   not shrink from the sufferings to which the other bishops who
   maintained the same sentiments as himself were exposed, and that he was
   willing to go into exile. Having philosophized from his youth, he had
   exercised himself in all the monastic virtues.

   Solon quitted the pursuits of commerce to embrace a monastic life, a
   measure which tended greatly to his welfare; for under the instruction
   of his brother and other ascetics, he progressed rapidly in piety
   towards God, and in goodness towards his neighbor. The church of
   Rhinocorura having been thus, from the beginning, under the guidance of
   such exemplary bishops, never afterwards swerved from their precepts,
   and produced good men. The clergy of this church dwell in one house,
   sit at the same table, and have everything in common.

   Chapter XXXII.--Monks of Palestine: Hesycas, Epiphanius, who was
   afterwards in Cyprus, Ammonius, and Silvanus.

   Many monastical institutions flourished in Palestine. [1498] Many of
   those whom I enumerated under the reign of Constantius were still
   cultivating the science. They and their associates attained the summit
   of philosophical perfection, and added still greater reputation to
   their monasteries; and among them Hesycas, [1499] a companion of
   Hilarion, and Epiphanius, afterwards bishop of Salamis in Cyprus,
   deserve to be particularly noticed. Hesycas devoted himself to a life
   of philosophy in the same locality where his master had formerly
   resided; and Epiphanius [1500] fixed his abode near the village of
   Besauduc, which was his birthplace, in the government of
   Eleutheropolis. Having been instructed from his youth by the most
   celebrated ascetics, and having on this account passed the most of his
   time in Egypt, Epiphanius became most celebrated in Egypt and Palestine
   by his attainments in monastic philosophy, and was chosen by the
   inhabitants of Cyprus to act as bishop of the metropolis of their
   island. Hence he is, I think, the most revered man under the whole
   heaven, so to speak; for he fulfilled his priesthood in the concourse
   of a large city and in a seaport; and when he threw himself into civil
   affairs, he conducted them with so much virtue that he became known in
   a little while to all citizens and every variety of foreigner; to some,
   because they had seen the man himself, and had experience of his manner
   of living; and to others, who had learned it from these spectators.
   Before he went to Cyprus, he resided for some time, during the present
   reign, in Palestine.

   At the same period in the monasteries, Salamines, Phuscon, Malachion,
   and Crispion, four brethren, were highly distinguished: they practiced
   philosophy near Bethelia, a village of Gaza; they were of a resident
   noble family, and had been instructed in philosophy by Hilarion. It is
   related that the brothers were once journeying homewards, when
   Malachion was suddenly snatched away and became invisible; soon
   afterwards, however, he reappeared and continued the journey with his
   brothers. He did not long survive this occurrence, but died in the
   flower of his youth. He was not behind men of advanced age in the
   philosophy of virtuous life and of piety.

   Ammonius lived at a distance of ten stadia from those last mentioned;
   he dwelt near Capharcobra, the place of his birth, a town of Gaza. He
   was very exact and courageous in carrying through asceticism. I think
   that Silvanus, a native of Palestine, to whom, on account of his high
   virtue, an angel was once seen to minister, practiced philosophy about
   the same time in Egypt. Then he lived at Mount Sinai, and afterwards
   founded at Gerari, in the wady, a very extensive and most noted
   coenobium for many good men, over which the excellent Zacharias
   subsequently presided.

   Chapter XXXIII.--Monks of Syria and Persia: Battheus, Eusebius, Barges,
   Halas, Abbo, Lazarus, Abdaleus, Zeno, Heliodorus, Eusebius of Carræ,
   Protogenes, and Aones.

   Let us pass thence to Syria and Persia, [1501] the parts adjacent to
   Syria. We shall find that the monks of these countries emulated those
   of Egypt in the practice of philosophy. Battheus, Eusebius, Barges,
   Halas, Abbos, Lazarus, who attained the episcopal dignity, Abdaleus,
   Zeno, and Heliodorus, flourished in Nisibis, near the mountain called
   Sigoron. When they first entered upon the philosophic career, they were
   denominated shepherds, because they had no houses, ate neither bread
   nor meat, and drank no wine; but dwelt constantly on the mountains, and
   passed their time in praising God by prayers and hymns, according to
   the law of the Church. At the usual hours of meals, they each took a
   sickle, and went to the mountain to cut some grass on the mountains, as
   though they were flocks in pasture; and this served for their repast.
   Such was their course of philosophy. Eusebius voluntarily shut himself
   up in a cell to philosophize, near Carræ. [1502] Protogenes dwelt in
   the same locality, and ruled the church there after Vitus who was then
   bishop. This is the celebrated Vitus of whom they say that when the
   Emperor Constantine first saw him, he confessed that God had frequently
   shown this man in appearances to him and enjoined him to obey
   implicitly what he should say. Aones had a monastery in Phadana; this
   was the spot where Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, on his journey from
   Palestine, met the damsel whom he afterwards married, and where he
   rolled away the stone, that her flock might drink of the water of the
   well. It is said that Aones was the first who introduced the life apart
   from all men, and the severe philosophy into Syria, just as it was
   first introduced by Antony into Egypt.

   Chapter XXXIV.--Monks of Edessa: Julianus, Ephraim Syrus, Barus, and
   Eulogius; Further, the Monks of Coele-Syria: Valentinus, Theodore,
   Merosas, Bassus, Bassonius; and the Holy Men of Galatia and Cappadocia,
   and Elsewhere; why those Saints until recently were Long-Lived.

   Gaddanas and Azizus dwelt with Aones, and emulated his virtues. [1503]
   Ephraim the Syrian, who was an historian, and has been noticed [1504]
   in our own recital of events under the reign of Constantius, was the
   most renowned philosopher in this time, together with Julian, in the
   neighborhood of Edessa and its adjacent regions. Barses [1505] and
   Eulogius were both, at a later period than that to which we are
   referring, ordained bishops, but not of any city; for the title was
   merely an honorary one, conferred on them as a compensation for their
   excellent conduct; and they were ordained in their own monasteries.
   Lazarus, to whom we have already alluded, was ordained bishop in the
   same manner. Such were the most celebrated philosophers of asceticism
   who flourished in Syria, Persia, and the neighboring countries, so far,
   at least, as I have been able to ascertain. The course common to all,
   so to speak, consisted in diligent attention to the state of the soul,
   which by means of fasting, prayer, and hymns to God, they kept in
   constant preparation to quit the things of this world. They devoted the
   greater part of their time to these holy exercises, and they wholly
   despised worldly possessions, temporal affairs, and the ease and
   adornment of the body. Some of the monks carried their self-denial to
   an extraordinary height. Battheus, for instance, by excessive
   abstinence and fasting, had worms crawl from his teeth; Halas, again,
   had not tasted bread for eighty years; and Heliodorus passed many
   nights without yielding to sleep, and added thereto seven days of
   fasting.

   Although Coele-Syria and Upper Syria, with the exception of the city of
   Antioch, was slowly converted to Christianity, it was not lacking in
   ecclesiastical philosophers, whose conduct appeared the more heroic
   from their having to encounter the enmity and hatred of the inhabitants
   of the place. And they nobly refrained from resistance, or resorting to
   the law, but spiritedly endured the insults and blows inflicted by the
   pagans. Such, I found, was the course pursued by Valentian, who,
   according to some accounts, was born at Emesa, but according to others,
   at Arethusa. Another individual of the same name distinguished himself
   by similar conduct, as likewise Theodore. Both were from Titti, which
   is of the nome of the Apameans; not less distinguished were Marosas, a
   native of Nechilis, Bassus, Bassones, and Paul. This latter was from
   the village of Telmison. He rounded many communities in many places,
   and introduced the method essential to the knowledge of philosophy, and
   finally established the greatest and most distinguished community of
   monks in a place called Jugatum. Here, after a long and honorable life,
   he died, and was interred. Some of the monks who have practiced
   philosophy in a distinguished and divine way have survived to our own
   days; indeed, most of those to whom allusion has been made enjoyed a
   very long term of existence; and I am convinced that God added to the
   length of their days for the express purpose of furthering the
   interests of religion. They were instrumental in leading nearly the
   whole Syrian nation, and most of the Persians and Saracens, to the
   proper religion, and caused them to cease from paganism. After
   beginning the monastic philosophy there, they brought forward many like
   themselves.

   I suppose that Galatia, Cappadocia, and the neighboring provinces
   contained many other ecclesiastical philosophers at that time, for
   these regions formerly had zealously embraced our doctrine. These
   monks, for the most part, dwelt in communities in cities and villages,
   for they did not habituate themselves to the tradition of their
   predecessors. The severity of the winter, which is always a natural
   feature of that country, would probably make a hermit life
   impracticable. Leontius and Prapidius were, I understand, the most
   celebrated of these monks. The former afterwards administered the
   church of Ancyra, and the latter, a man of very advanced age, performed
   the episcopal functions in several villages. He also presided over the
   Basileias, the most celebrated hospice for the poor. It was established
   by Basil, bishop of Cæsarea, from whom it received its name in the
   beginning, and retains it until to-day.

   Chapter XXXV.--The Wooden Tripod and the Succession of the Emperor,
   through a Knowledge of its Letters. Destruction of the Philosophers;
   Astronomy.

   Such is the information which I have been enabled to collect concerning
   the ecclesiastical philosophers of that time. As to the pagans, they
   were nearly all exterminated about the period to which we have been
   referring. [1506] Some among them, who were reputed to excel in
   philosophy, and who viewed with extreme displeasure the progress of the
   Christian religion, were devising who would be the successor of Valens
   on the throne of the Roman Empire, and resorted to every variety of
   mantic art for the purpose of attaining this insight into futurity.
   After various incantations, they constructed a tripod of laurel wood,
   and they wound up with the invocations and words to which they are
   accustomed; so that the name of the emperor might be shown by the
   collection of letters which were indicated, letter by letter, through
   the machinery of the tripod and the prophecy. They were gaping with
   open mouth for Theodore, a man who held a distinguished military
   appointment in the palace. He was a pagan and a learned man. The
   disposition of the letters, coming as far as the delta of his name,
   deceived the philosophers. They hence expected that Theodore would very
   soon be the emperor. When their undertaking was informed upon, Valens
   was as unbearably incensed, as if a conspiracy had been formed against
   his safety. Therefore all were arrested; Theodore and the constructors
   of the tripod were commanded to be put to death, some with fire, others
   with the sword. Likewise for the same reason the most brilliant
   philosophers of the empire were slain; since the wrath of the emperor
   was unchecked, the death penalty advanced even to those who were not
   philosophers, but who wore garments similar to theirs; hence those who
   applied themselves to other pursuits would not clothe themselves with
   the crocotium or tribonium, on account of the suspicion and fear of
   danger, so that they might not seem to be pursuing magic and sorcery. I
   do not in the least think that the emperor will be more blamed by
   right-thinking people for such wrath and cruelty than the philosophers,
   for their rashness and their unphilosophical undertaking. The emperor,
   absurdly supposing that he could put his successor to death, spared
   neither those who had prophesied nor the subject of their prophecy, as
   they say he did not spare those who bore the same name of
   Theodore,--and some were men of distinction,--whether they were
   precisely the same or similar in beginning with th and ending with d.
   The philosophers, on the other hand, acted as if the deposition and
   restoration of emperors had depended solely on them; for if the
   imperial succession was to be considered dependent on the arrangement
   of the stars, what was requisite but to await the accession of the
   future emperor, whoever he might be? or if the succession was regarded
   as dependent on the will of God, what right had man to meddle? For it
   is not the function of human foreknowledge or zeal to understand God's
   thought; nor if it were right, would it be well for men, even if they
   be the wisest of all, to think that they can plan better than God. If
   it were merely from rash curiosity to discern the things of futurity
   that they showed such lack of judgment as to be ready to be caught in
   danger, and to despise the laws anciently established among the Romans,
   and at a time when it was not dangerous to conduct pagan worship and to
   sacrifice; in this they thought differently from Socrates; for when
   unjustly condemned to drink poison, he refused to save himself by
   violating the laws in which he had been born and educated, nor would he
   escape from prison, although it was in his power to do so.

   Chapter XXXVI.--Expedition against the Sarmatians; Death of Valentinian
   in Rome; Valentinian the Younger proclaimed; Persecution of the
   Priests; Oration of the Philosopher Themistius, on account of which
   Valens was disposed to treat those who differed from him more Humanely.

   Such subjects as the above, however, are best left to the examination
   and decision of individual judgment.

   The Sarmatians [1507] having invaded the western parts of the empire,
   Valentinian levied an army to oppose them. As soon, however, as they
   heard of the number and strength of the troops raised against them,
   they sent an embassy to solicit peace. When the ambassadors were
   ushered into the presence of Valentinian, he asked them whether all the
   Sarmatians were similar to them. On their replying that the principal
   men of the nation had been selected to form the embassy, the emperor
   exclaimed, in great fury, "A terrible thing do our subjects endure, and
   a calamity is surrounding the Roman government, if the Sarmatians, a
   barbarous race, of whom these are your best men, do not love to abide
   by themselves, but are emboldened to invade my government, and presume
   to make war at all against the Romans." He spoke in this strain for
   some time in a very high pitch of voice, and his rage was so violent
   and so unbounded, that at length he burst simultaneously a blood-vessel
   and an artery. He lost, in consequence, a great quantity of blood, and
   expired soon after in a fortress of Gaul. [1508] He was about
   fifty-four years of age, and had, during thirteen years, guided the
   reins of government with good results and much distinction. Six days
   after his death his youngest son, who bore the same name as himself,
   was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers; and soon afterwards Valens and
   Gratian, his brother, formally assented to this election, although they
   were at first irritated at the soldiers having transferred the symbols
   of government to him without their previous consent.

   During this period Valens had fixed his residence at Antioch in Syria,
   and became more hostile to those who differed from him in opinion
   concerning the divine nature, and he vexed them more severely and
   persecuted them. The philosopher Themistius pronounced an oration in
   his presence, in which he admonished him that he ought not to wonder at
   the dissension concerning ecclesiastical doctrines, for it was more
   moderate and less than among the pagans, for the opinions among them
   are multiform; and that, in the number of dogmas leading to perpetual
   disputes, necessarily the difference about them makes more contentions
   and discussions; and accordingly it might probably be pleasing to God
   not to be so easily known, and to have a divergence of opinion, so that
   each might fear Him the rather, since an accurate knowledge of Him is
   so unattainable. And in the attempt to summarize this vastness, one
   would tend to conclude how great He is and how good He is. [1509]

   Chapter XXXVII.--Concerning the Barbarians beyond the Danube, who were
   driven out by the Huns, and advanced to the Romans, and their
   Conversion to Christianity; Ulphilas and Athanarichus; Occurrences
   between them; whence the Goths received Arianism.

   This remarkable oration of Themistius disposed the emperor to be
   somewhat more humane, and the punishments became in consequence less
   severe than before. He would not have wholly withdrawn his wrath from
   the priests unless the anxieties of public affairs had supervened, and
   not permitted him to pursue them further. [1510] For the Goths, who
   inhabited the regions beyond the Ister, and had conquered other
   barbarians, having been vanquished and driven from their country by the
   Huns, had passed over into the Roman boundaries. The Huns, it is said,
   were unknown to the Thracians of the Ister and the Goths before this
   period; for though they were dwelling secretly near to one another, a
   lake of vast extent was between them, and the inhabitants on each side
   of the lake respectively imagined that their own country was situated
   at the extremity of the earth, and that there was nothing beyond them
   but the sea and water. It so happened, however, that an ox, tormented
   by insects, plunged into the lake, and was pursued by the herdsman;
   who, perceiving for the first time that the opposite bank was
   inhabited, made known the circumstance to his fellow-tribesmen. Some,
   however, relate that a stag was fleeing, and showed some of the hunters
   who were of the race of the Huns the way which was concealed
   superficially by the water. On arriving at the opposite bank, the
   hunters were struck with the beauty of the country, the serenity of the
   air, and the adaptedness for cultivation; and they reported what they
   had seen to their king. The Huns then made an attempt to attack the
   Goths with a few soldiers; but they afterwards raised a powerful army,
   conquered the Goths in battle, and took possession of their whole
   country. The vanquished nation, being pursued by their enemies, crossed
   over into the Roman territories. They passed over the river, and
   dispatched an embassy to the emperor, assuring him of their
   co-operation in any warfare in which he might engage, provided that he
   would assign a portion of land for them to inhabit. Ulphilas, the
   bishop of the nation, was the chief of the embassy. The object of his
   embassy was fully accomplished, and the Goths were permitted to take up
   their abode in Thrace. Soon after contentions broke out among them,
   which led to their division into two parts, one of which was headed by
   Athanaric, and the other by Phritigernes. They took up arms against
   each other, and Phritigernes was vanquished, and implored the
   assistance of the Romans. The emperor having commanded the troops in
   Thrace to assist and to ally with him, a second battle was fought, and
   Athanaric and his party were put to flight. In acknowledgment of the
   timely succor afforded by Valens, and in proof of his fidelity to the
   Romans, Phritigernes embraced the religion of the emperor, and
   persuaded the barbarians over whom he ruled to follow his example. It
   does not, however, appear to me that this is the only reason that can
   be advanced to account for the Goths having retained, even to the
   present day, the tenets of Arianism. For Ulphilas, their bishop,
   originally held no opinions at variance with those of the Catholic
   Church; for during the reign of Constantius, though he took part, as I
   am convinced, from thoughtlessness, at the council of Constantinople,
   in conjunction with Eudoxius and Acacius, yet he did not swerve from
   the doctrines of the Nicæan council. He afterwards, it appears,
   returned to Constantinople, and, it is said, entered into disputations
   on doctrinal topics with the chiefs of the Arian faction; and they
   promised to lay his requests before the emperor, and forward the object
   of his embassy, if he would conform to their opinions. Compelled by the
   urgency of the occasion, or, possibly, thinking that it was better to
   hold such views concerning the Divine nature, Ulphilas entered into
   communion with the Arians, and separated himself and his whole nation
   from all connection with the Catholic Church. For as he had instructed
   the Goths in the elements of religion, and through him they shared in a
   gentler mode of life, they placed the most implicit confidence in his
   directions, and were firmly convinced that he could neither do nor say
   anything that was evil. He had, in fact, given many signal proofs of
   the greatness of his virtue. He had exposed himself to innumerable
   perils in defense of the faith, during the period that the aforesaid
   barbarians were given to pagan worship. He taught them the use of
   letters, and translated the Sacred Scriptures into their own language.
   It was on this account, that the barbarians on the banks of the Ister
   followed the tenets of Arius. At the same period, there were many of
   the subjects of Phritigernes who testified to Christ, and were
   martyred. Athanaric resented that his subjects had become Christian
   under the persuasion of Ulphilas; and because they had abandoned the
   cult of their fathers, he subjected many individuals to many
   punishments; some he put to death after they had been dragged before
   tribunals and had nobly confessed the doctrine, and others were slain
   without being permitted to utter a single word in their own defense. It
   is said that the officers appointed by Athanaric to execute his cruel
   mandates, caused a statue to be constructed, which they placed on a
   chariot, and had it conveyed to the tents of those who were suspected
   of having embraced Christianity, and who were therefore commanded to
   worship the statue and offer sacrifice; if they refused to do so, the
   men and the tents were burnt together. But I have heard that an outrage
   of still greater atrocity was perpetrated at this period. Many refused
   to obey those who were compelling them by force to sacrifice. Among
   them were men and women; of the latter some were leading their little
   children, others were nourishing their new-born infants at the breast;
   they fled to their church, which was a tent. The pagans set fire to it,
   and all were destroyed.

   The Goths were not long in making peace among themselves; and in
   unreasonable excitement, they then began to ravage Thrace and to
   pillage the cities and villages. Valens, on inquiry, learned by
   experiment how great a mistake he had made; for he had calculated that
   the Goths would always be useful to the empire and formidable to its
   enemies, and had therefore neglected the reinforcement of the Roman
   ranks. He had taken gold from the cities and villages under the Romans,
   instead of the usual complement of men for the military service. On his
   expectation being thus frustrated, he quitted Antioch and hastened to
   Constantinople. Hence the persecution which he had been carrying on
   against Christians differing in opinion from himself, had a truce.
   Euzoïus, president of the Arians, died, and Dorotheus was proposed for
   his government.

   Chapter XXXVIII.--Concerning Mania, the Phylarch of the Saracens. When
   the Treaty with the Romans was dissolved, Moses, their Bishop, who had
   been ordained by the Christians, renewed it. Narrative concerning the
   Ishmaelites and the Saracens, and their Goods; and how they began to be
   Christianized through Zocomus, Their Phylarch.

   About this period the king of the Saracens died, [1511] and the peace
   which had previously existed between that nation and the Romans was
   dissolved. Mania, [1512] the widow of the late monarch, after attaining
   to the government of her race, led her troops into Phoenicia and
   Palestine, as far as the regions of Egypt lying to the left of those
   who sail towards the source of the Nile, and which are generally
   denominated Arabia. This war was by no means a contemptible one,
   although conducted by a woman. The Romans, it is said, considered it so
   arduous and so perilous, that the general of the Phoenician troops
   applied for assistance to the general of the entire cavalry and
   infantry of the East. This latter ridiculed the summons, and undertook
   to give battle alone. He accordingly attacked Mania, who commanded her
   own troops in person; and he was rescued with difficulty by the general
   of the troops of Palestine and Phoenicia. Perceiving the extremity of
   the danger, this general deemed it unnecessary to obey the orders he
   had received to keep aloof from the combat; he therefore rushed upon
   the barbarians, and furnished his superior an opportunity for safe
   retreat, while he himself yielded ground and shot at those who fled,
   and beat off with his arrows the enemies who were pressing upon him.
   This occurrence is still held in remembrance among the people of the
   country, and is celebrated in songs by the Saracens.

   As the war was still pursued with vigor, the Romans found it necessary
   to send an embassy to Mania to solicit peace. It is said that she
   refused to comply with the request of the embassy, unless consent were
   given for the ordination of a certain man named Moses, who practiced
   philosophy in a neighboring desert, as bishop over her subjects. This
   Moses was a man of virtuous life, and noted for performing the divine
   and miraculous signs. On these conditions being announced to the
   emperor, the chiefs of the army were commanded to seize Moses, and
   conduct him to Lucius. The monk exclaimed, in the presence of the
   rulers and the assembled people, "I am not worthy of the honor of
   bearing the name and dignity of chief priest; but if, notwithstanding
   my unworthiness God destines me to this office, I take Him to witness
   who created the heavens and the earth, that I will not be ordained by
   the imposition of the hands of Lucius, which are defiled with the blood
   of holy men." Lucius immediately rejoined, "If you are unacquainted
   with the nature of my creed, you do wrong in judging me before you are
   in possession of all the circumstances of the case. If you have been
   prejudiced by the calumnies that have been circulated against me, at
   least allow me to declare to you what are my sentiments; and do you be
   the judge of them." "Your creed is already well known to me," replied
   Moses; "and its nature is testified by bishops, presbyters, and
   deacons, who are suffering grievously in exile, and the mines. It is
   clear that your sentiments are opposed to the faith of Christ, and to
   all orthodox doctrines concerning the Godhead." [1513] Having again
   protested, upon oath, that he would not receive ordination from them,
   he went to the Saracens. He reconciled them to the Romans, and
   converted many to Christianity, and passed his life among them as a
   priest, although he found few who shared in his belief.

   This is the tribe which took its origin and had its name from Ishmael,
   the son of Abraham; and the ancients called them Ishmaelites after
   their progenitor. As their mother Hagar was a slave, they afterwards,
   to conceal the opprobrium of their origin, assumed the name of
   Saracens, as if they were descended from Sara, the wife of Abraham.
   Such being their origin, they practice circumcision like the Jews,
   refrain from the use of pork, and observe many other Jewish rites and
   customs. If, indeed, they deviate in any respect from the observances
   of that nation, it must be ascribed to the lapse of time, and to their
   intercourse with the neighboring nations. Moses, who lived many
   centuries after Abraham, only legislated for those whom he led out of
   Egypt. The inhabitants of the neighboring countries, being strongly
   addicted to superstition, probably soon corrupted the laws imposed upon
   them by their forefather Ishmael. The ancient Hebrews had their
   community life under this law only, using therefore unwritten customs,
   before the Mosaic legislation. These people certainly served the same
   gods as the neighboring nations, honoring and naming them similarly, so
   that by this likeness with their forefathers in religion, there is
   evidenced their departure from the laws of their forefathers. As is
   usual, in the lapse of time, their ancient customs fell into oblivion,
   and other practices gradually got the precedence among them. Some of
   their tribe afterwards happening to come in contact with the Jews,
   gathered from them the facts of their true origin, returned to their
   kinsmen, and inclined to the Hebrew customs and laws. From that time
   on, until now, many of them regulate their lives according to the
   Jewish precepts. Some of the Saracens were converted to Christianity
   not long before the present reign. They shared in the faith of Christ
   by intercourse with the priests and monks who dwelt near them, and
   practiced philosophy in the neighboring deserts, and who were
   distinguished by the excellence of their life, and by their miraculous
   works. It is said that a whole tribe, and Zocomus, their chief, were
   converted to Christianity and baptized about this period, under the
   following circumstances: Zocomus was childless, and went to a certain
   monk of great celebrity to complain to him of this calamity; for among
   the Saracens, and I believe other barbarian nations, it was accounted
   of great importance to have children. The monk desired Zocomus to be of
   good cheer, engaged in prayer on his behalf, and sent him away with the
   promise that if he would believe in Christ, he would have a son. When
   this promise was confirmed by God, and when a son was born to him,
   Zocomus was initiated, and all his subjects with him. From that period
   this tribe was peculiarly fortunate, and became strong in point of
   number, and formidable to the Persians as well as to the other
   Saracens. Such are the details that I have been enabled to collect
   concerning the conversion of the Saracens and their first bishop.

   Chapter XXXIX.--Peter, having returned from Rome, regains the Churches
   of Egypt, after Lucius had given way; Expedition of Valens into the
   West against the Scythians.

   Those in every city who maintained the Nicene doctrine now began to
   take courage, and more particularly the inhabitants of Alexandria in
   Egypt. Peter [1514] had returned thither from Rome with a letter from
   Damasus, confirmatory of the tenets of Nicæa and of his own ordination;
   and he was installed in the government of the churches in the place of
   Lucius, who sailed away to Constantinople after his eviction. The
   Emperor Valens very naturally was so distracted by other affairs, that
   he had no leisure to attend to these transactions. He had no sooner
   arrived at Constantinople than he incurred the suspicion and hatred of
   the people. The barbarians were pillaging Thrace, and were even
   advancing to the very suburbs, and attempted to make an assault on the
   very walls, with no one to hinder them. The city was indignant at this
   inertness; and the people even charged the emperor with being a party
   to their attack, because he did not sally forth, but delayed offering
   battle. At length, when he was present at the sports of the Hippodrome,
   the people openly and loudly accused him of neglecting the affairs of
   the state, and demanded arms that they might fight in their own
   defense. Valens, offended at these reproaches, immediately undertook an
   expedition against the barbarians; but he threatened to punish the
   insolence of the people on his return, and also to take vengeance on
   them for having formerly supported the tyrant Procopius.

   Chapter XL.--Saint Isaac, the Monk, predicts the Death of Valens.
   Valens in his Flight enters a Chaff-House, is consumed, and so yields
   up his Life.

   When Valens was on the point of departing from Constantinople, [1515]
   Isaac, a monk of great virtue, who feared no danger in the cause of
   God, presented himself before him, and addressed him in the following
   words: "Give back, O emperor, to the orthodox, and to those who
   maintain the Nicene doctrines, the churches of which you have deprived
   them, and the victory will be yours." The emperor was offended at this
   act of boldness, and commanded that Isaac should be arrested and kept
   in chains until his return, when he meant to bring him to justice for
   his temerity. Isaac, however, replied, "You will not return unless you
   restore the churches." And so in fact it came to pass. For when Valens
   marched out with his army, the Goths retreated while pursued. In his
   advances he passed by Thrace, and came to Adrianople. When at not great
   distance from the barbarians, he found them encamped in a secure
   position; and yet he had the rashness to attack them before he had
   arranged his own legions in proper order. His cavalry was dispersed,
   his infantry compelled to retreat; and, pursued by the enemy, he
   dismounted from his horse, and with a few attendants entered into a
   small house or tower, where he secreted himself. The barbarians were in
   full pursuit, and went beyond the tower, not suspecting that he had
   selected it for his place of concealment. As the last detachment of the
   barbarians was passing by the tower, the attendants of the emperor let
   fly a volley of arrows from their covert, which immediately led to the
   exclamation that Valens was concealed within the building. Those who
   were a little in advance heard this exclamation, and made known the
   news with a shout to those companions who were in advance of them; and
   thus the news was conveyed till it reached the detachments which were
   foremost in the pursuit. They returned, and encompassed the tower. They
   collected vast quantities of wood from the country around, which they
   piled up against the tower, and finally set fire to the mass. A wind
   which had happened to arise favored the progress of the conflagration;
   and in a short period the tower, with all that it contained, including
   the emperor and his attendants, was utterly destroyed. Valens was fifty
   years of age. He had reigned thirteen years conjointly with his
   brother, and three by himself.

   Book VII.

   Chapter I.--When the Romans are pressed by the Barbarians, Mavia sends
   Assistance, and some of the Populace effect a Victory. Gratian commands
   each to believe as he wishes.

   Such was the fate of Valens. The barbarians, [1516] flushed with
   victory, overran Thrace, and advanced to the gates of Constantinople.
   In this emergency, a few of the confederate Saracens sent by Mavia,
   together with many of the populace, were of great service. It is
   reported that Dominica, wife of Valens, furnished money out of the
   public treasury, and some of the people, after hastily arming
   themselves, attacked the barbarians, and drove them from the city.

   Gratian, who at this period reigned conjointly with his brother over
   the whole Roman Empire, disapproved of the late persecution that had
   been carried on to check the diversity in religious creeds, and
   recalled all those who had been banished on account of their religion.
   He also enacted a law by which it was decreed that every individual
   should be freely permitted the exercise of his own religion, and should
   be allowed to hold assemblies, with the exception of the Manichæans and
   the followers of Photinus and Eunomius. [1517]

   Chapter II.--Gratian elects Theodosius of Spain to reign with him,
   Arianism prevails throughout the Eastern Churches except that of
   Jerusalem. Council of Antioch. The Settlement of the Presidency of the
   Churches.

   On reflecting that, while it was indispensably requisite to check the
   incursions of the barbarians of the Ister in Illyria and Thrace, his
   presence was equally necessary in Gaul to repel the inroads of the
   Alemanni, Gratian associated Theodosius [1518] with himself at Sirmich,
   in the government of the empire. Theodosius belonged to an illustrious
   family of the Pyrenees in Iberia, and had acquired so much renown in
   war, that before he was raised to the imperial power, he was
   universally considered capable of guiding the reins of the empire.

   At this period all the churches of the East, with the exception of that
   of Jerusalem, were in the hands of the Arians. The Macedonians differed
   but little in opinion from those who maintained the doctrine of Nicæa,
   and held intercourse and communion with them in all the cities; and
   this had been more especially the case with the Macedonians of
   Constantinople, ever since their reconciliation with Liberius. But
   after the enactment of Gratian's law, some bishops of the Macedonian
   heresy took courage and repossessed the churches from which they had
   been ejected by Valens. They assembled together at Antioch in Caria,
   and protested that the Son is not to be declared "consubstantial" with
   the Father, but only like unto Him in substance. From that period, many
   of the Macedonians seceded from the others, and held separate churches;
   while others, condemning this opposition and contentiousness of those
   who had made these decisions, united themselves still more firmly with
   the followers of the Nicene doctrines.

   Many of the bishops who had been banished by Valens, and who were
   recalled about this period in consequence of the law of Gratian,
   manifested no ambition to be restored to the highest offices of the
   Church; but they preferred the unity of the people, and therefore
   begged the Arian bishops to retain the posts they occupied, and not to
   rend by dissension the Church, which had been transmitted by God and
   the apostles as one, but which contentiousness and ambition for
   precedence had divided into many parts. Eulalius, bishop of Amasia in
   Pontus, was one of those who pursued this course of conduct. It is said
   that when he returned from exile, he found that his church was presided
   over by an Arian bishop, and that scarcely fifty inhabitants of the
   city had submitted to the control of this new bishop. Eulalius,
   desiring unity above all other considerations, offered to take part
   with the Arian bishop in the government of the church, and expressly
   agreed to allow him the precedence. But as the Arian would not comply
   with this proposition, it was not long before he found himself deserted
   by the few who had followed him, and who went over to the other party.

   Chapter III.--Concerning St. Meletius and Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch.
   Their Oath respecting the Episcopal See.

   In consequence of this law, Meletius returned about this period to
   Antioch in Syria; and his presence gave rise to great contention among
   the people. [1519] Paulinus, whom Valens, from veneration for his
   piety, had not ventured to banish, was still alive. The partisans of
   Meletius, therefore, proposed his association with Paulinus, who
   condemned the ordination of Meletius, because it had been conferred by
   Arian bishops; and yet the supporters of Meletius went forward by force
   into the work they had devised; for they were not few in number, and so
   placed Meletius on the episcopal throne in one of the suburban
   churches. The mutual animosity of the two parties increased, and
   sedition was expected, had not a remarkable plan for the restoration of
   concord prevailed. For it seemed best, to take oaths from those who
   were considered eligible, or who were expected to occupy the episcopal
   see of that place. Of these there were five besides Flavian. These
   promised that they would neither strive for, nor accept the episcopate
   should an ordination take place among them during the life of Paulinus
   and Meletius, and that in the event of the decease of either of these
   great men, the other alone should succeed to the bishopric. On their
   ratifying this promise with oaths, unanimity was restored among almost
   all the people; a few of the Luciferites still diverged because
   Meletius had been ordained by heretics. On the termination of this
   contest, Meletius proceeded to Constantinople, where many other bishops
   had assembled together to deliberate on the necessity of translating
   Gregory from the bishopric of Nazianzen to that of this city.

   Chapter IV.--Reign of Theodosius the Great; he was initiated into
   Divine Baptism by Ascholius, Bishop of Thessalonica. The Letters he
   addressed to those who did not hold the Definition of the Council of
   Nice.

   As Gaul was about this period infested by the incursions of the
   Alemanni, [1520] Gratian returned to his paternal dominions, which he
   had reserved for himself and his brother, when he bestowed the
   government of Illyria and of the Eastern provinces upon Theodosius. He
   effected his purpose with regard to the barbarians; and Theodosius was
   equally successful against the tribes from the banks of the Ister; he
   defeated them, compelled them to sue for peace, and, after accepting
   hostages from them, proceeded to Thessalonica. He fell ill while in
   this city, and after receiving instruction from Ascholius, the bishop,
   he was initiated, and was soon after restored to health. The parents of
   Theodosius were Christians, and were attached to the Nicene doctrines;
   he was pleased with Ascholius, who maintained the same doctrines, and
   was, in a word, endowed with every virtue of the priesthood. He also
   rejoiced at finding that the Arian heresy had not been participated in
   by Illyria. [1521] He inquired concerning the religious sentiments
   which were prevalent in the other provinces, and ascertained that, as
   far as Macedonia, [1522] all the churches were like minded, and all
   held that equal homage ought to be rendered to God the Word, and to the
   Holy Ghost, as to God the Father; but that towards the East, and
   particularly at Constantinople, the people were divided into many
   different heresies. Reflecting that it would be better to propound his
   own religious views to his subjects, so as not to appear to be using
   force by commanding the unwilling subject to worship contrary to his
   judgment, Theodosius enacted a law at Thessalonica, which he caused to
   be published at Constantinople, well knowing that the rescript would
   speedily become public to all the other cities, if issued from that
   city, which is as a citadel of the whole empire. He made known by this
   law his intention of leading all his subjects to the reception of that
   faith which Peter, the chief of the apostles, had, from the beginning,
   preached to the Romans, and which was professed by Damasus, bishop of
   Rome, and by Peter, bishop of Alexandria. He enacted [1523] that the
   title of "Catholic Church" should be exclusively confined to those who
   rendered equal homage to the Three Persons of the Trinity, and that
   those individuals who entertained opposite opinions should be treated
   as heretics, regarded with contempt, and delivered over to punishment.

   Chapter V.--Gregory, the Theologian, receives from Theodosius the
   Government of the Churches. Expulsion of Demophilus, and of all who
   deny that the Son is "Consubstantial" with the Father.

   Soon after the enactment of this law, Theodosius went to
   Constantinople. [1524] The Arians, under the guidance of Demophilus,
   still retained possession of the churches. Gregory of Nazianzen
   presided over those who maintain the "consubstantiality" of the Holy
   Trinity, and assembled them together in a little dwelling, which had
   been altered into the form of a house of prayer, by those who held the
   same opinions and had a like form of worship. It subsequently became
   one of the most conspicuous in the city, and is so now, not only for
   the beauty and number of its structures, but also for the advantages
   accruing to it from the visible manifestations of God. For the power of
   God was there manifested, and was helpful both in waking visions and in
   dreams, often for the relief of many diseases and for those afflicted
   by some sudden transmutation in their affairs. The power was accredited
   to Mary, the Mother of God, the holy virgin, for she does manifest
   herself in this way. The name of Anastasia was given to this church,
   because, as I believe, the Nicene doctrines which were fallen into
   disuse in Constantinople, and, so to speak, buried by reason of the
   power of the heterodox, arose from the dead and were again quickened
   through the discourses of Gregory; or, as I have heard, some affirm
   with assurance that one day, when the people were met together for
   worship in this edifice, a pregnant woman fell from the highest
   gallery, and was found dead on the spot; but that, at the prayer of the
   whole congregation, she was restored to life, and she and the infant
   were saved. On account of the occurrence of this divine marvel, the
   place, as some assert, obtained its name.

   The emperor sent to command Demophilus to conform to the doctrines of
   Nicæa, and to lead the people to embrace the same sentiments, or else
   to vacate the churches. Demophilus assembled the people, acquainted
   them with the imperial edict, and informed them that it was his
   intention to hold a church the next day without the walls of the city,
   in accordance, he said, with the Divine law, which commands us when we
   are persecuted in one city to "flee unto another." [1525] From that day
   he always held church without the city with Lucius, who was formerly
   the bishop of the Arians at Alexandria; and who, after having been
   expelled, as above related, from that city, fled to Constantinople and
   fixed his residence there. When Demophilus and his followers had
   quitted the church, the emperor entered therein and engaged in prayer;
   and from that period those who maintained the consubstantiality of the
   Holy Trinity held possession of the houses of prayer. These events
   occurred in the fifth year of the consulate of Gratian, and in the
   first of that of Theodosius, and after the churches had been during
   forty years in the hands of the Arians.

   Chapter VI.--Concerning the Arians; and Further, the Success of
   Eunomius. Boldness of St. Amphilochius toward the Emperor.

   The Arians, who were still very strong in point of numbers, [1526] and
   who, through the protection formerly granted by Constantius and Valens,
   were still convening without fear, and discoursing publicly concerning
   God and the Divine nature, now determined upon making an attempt to
   gain over the emperor to their party, through the intervention of
   individuals of their sect who held appointments at court; and they
   entertained hopes of succeeding in this project, as well as they had
   succeeded in the case of Constantius. These machinations excited great
   anxiety and fear among the members of the Catholic Church; but the
   chief cause of their apprehension was the reasoning power of Eunomius.
   It appears that, during the reign of Valens, Eunomius had some dispute
   with his own clergy at Cyzicus, and had in consequence seceded from the
   Arians, and retired to Bithynia, near Constantinople. Here multitudes
   resorted to him; some also gathered from different quarters, a few with
   the design of testing his principles, and others merely from the desire
   of listening to his discourses. His reputation reached the ears of the
   emperor, who would gladly have held a conference with him. But the
   Empress Flacilla [1527] studiously prevented an interview from taking
   place between them; for she was the most faithful guard of the Nicene
   doctrines, and feared lest Eunomius might, by his powers of
   disputation, induce a change in the sentiments of the emperor.

   In the meantime, while these intrigues were being carried on by each
   party, it is said that the bishops then residing in Constantinople went
   to the emperor, to render him the customary salutations. An old priest
   from a city of little note, [1528] and who was simple and unworldly,
   yet well instructed in Divine subjects, formed one of this party. The
   rest saluted the emperor with uncovered head and very reverently. The
   aged priest greeted him in the same form; but, instead of rendering
   equal honor to the prince, who was seated beside his father, the old
   priest approached him, patted him familiarly, and called him his dear
   child. The emperor was incensed and enraged at the indignity offered to
   his son, in that he had not been accorded like honor; and commanded
   that the old man should be thrust from his presence with violence.
   While being pushed away, hither and thither, however, the old priest
   turned around and exclaimed, "Reflect, O emperor, on the wrath of the
   Heavenly Father against those who do not honor His Son as Himself, and
   who have the audacity to assert that the Son is inferior to the
   Father." The emperor felt the force of this observation, recalled the
   priest, apologized to him for what had occurred, and confessed that he
   had spoken the truth. The emperor was henceforward less disposed to
   hold intercourse with heretics, and he prohibited contests and
   assemblies in the markets. He made it dangerous to hold discussions of
   this kind about the substance and nature of God, by enacting a law, and
   defining the punishments in this matter. [1529]

   Chapter VII.--Concerning the Second Holy General Council, and the Place
   and Cause of its Convention. Abdication of Gregory the Theologian.

   The emperor soon after convened a council of orthodox bishops, for the
   purpose of confirming the decrees of Nicæa, and of electing a bishop to
   the vacant see of Constantinople. [1530] He likewise summoned the
   Macedonians to this assembly; for as their doctrines differed but
   little from those of the Catholic Church, he judged that it would be
   easy to effect a reunion with them. About a hundred and fifty bishops
   who maintained the consubstantiality of the Holy Trinity, were present
   at this council, as likewise thirty-six of the Macedonian bishops,
   chiefly from the cities of the Hellespont; of whom the principal were
   Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus, and Marcian, bishop of Lampsacus. The
   other party was under the guidance of Timothy, who had succeeded his
   brother Peter in the see of Alexandria; of Meletius, bishop of Antioch,
   who had repaired to Constantinople a short time previously, on account
   of the election of Gregory, and of Cyril, bishop of Jerusalem, who had
   at this period renounced the tenets of the Macedonians which he
   previously held. Ascholius, bishop of Thessalonica, Diodorus, bishop of
   Tarsus, and Acacius, bishop of Berea, were also present at the council.
   These latter unanimously maintained the decrees of Nicæa, and urged
   Eleusius and his partisans to conform to these sentiments, reminding
   them, at the same time, of the embassy they had formerly deputed to
   Liberius, and of the confession they conveyed to him through the medium
   of Eustathius, Silvanus, and Theophilus, as has been narrated. The
   Macedonians, however, declared openly that they would never admit the
   Son to be of the same substance as the Father, whatever confession they
   might formerly have made to Liberius, and immediately withdrew. They
   then wrote to those of their adherents in every city, exhorting them
   not to conform to the doctrines of Nicæa.

   The bishops who remained at Constantinople now turned their attention
   to the election of a prelate to the see of that city. It is said that
   the emperor, from profound admiration of the sanctity and eloquence of
   Gregory, judged that he was worthy of this bishopric, and that, from
   reverence of his virtue, the greater number of the Synod was of the
   same opinion. Gregory at first consented to accept the presidency of
   the church of Constantinople; but afterwards, on ascertaining that some
   of the bishops, particularly those of Egypt, objected to the election,
   he withdrew his consent. For my part, this wisest of men is worthy of
   admiration, not only for universal qualifications, but not the least
   for his conduct under the present circumstances. His eloquence did not
   inspire him with pride, nor did vainglory lead him to desire the
   control of a church, which he had received when it was no longer in
   danger. He surrendered his appointment to the bishops when it was
   required of him, and never complained of his many labors, or of the
   dangers he had incurred in the suppression of heresies. Had he retained
   possession of the bishopric of Constantinople, it would have been no
   detriment to the interests of any individual, as another bishop had
   been appointed in his stead at Nazianzen. But the council, in strict
   obedience to the laws of the fathers and ecclesiastical order, withdrew
   from him, with his own acquiescence, the deposit which had been
   confided to him, without making an exception in favor of so eminent a
   man. The emperor and the priests therefore proceeded to the election of
   another bishop, which they regarded as the most important affair then
   requiring attention; and the emperor was urgent that diligent
   investigations might be instituted, so that the most excellent and best
   individual might be intrusted with the high-priesthood of the great and
   royal city. The council, however, was divided in sentiment; for each of
   the members desired to see one of his own friends ordained over the
   church.

   Chapter VIII.--Election of Nectarius to the See of Constantinople; his
   Birthplace and Education.

   A certain man of Tarsus in Cilicia, of the illustrious order of
   senator, was at this period residing at Constantinople. [1531] Being
   about to return to his own country, he called upon Diodorus, bishop of
   Tarsus, to inquire whether he had any letters to send by him. Diodorus
   was fully intent upon the ordination, which was the subject then
   engrossing universal attention of the men. He had no sooner seen
   Nectarius than he considered him worthy of the bishopric, and
   straightway determined this in his own mind as he reflected on the
   venerable age of the man, his form so befitting a priest, and the
   suavity of his manners. He conducted him, as if upon some other
   business, to the bishop of Antioch, and requested him to use his
   influence to procure this election. The bishop of Antioch derided this
   request, for the names of the most eminent men had already been
   proposed for consideration. He, however, called Nectarius to him, and
   desired him to remain for a short time with him. Some time after, the
   emperor commanded the priests to draw up a list of the names of those
   whom they thought worthy of the ordination, reserving to himself the
   right of choosing any one of those whose names were thus submitted to
   him. All the bishops complied with this mandate; and, among the others,
   the bishop of Antioch wrote down the names of those whom he proposed as
   candidates for the bishopric, and, at the end of his list, from
   consideration for Diodorus, he inserted the name of Nectarius. The
   emperor read the list of those inscribed and stopped at the name of
   Nectarius at the end of the document, on which he placed his finger,
   and seemed for some time lost in reflection; ran it up to the
   beginning, and again went through the whole, and chose Nectarius. This
   nomination excited great astonishment and all the people were anxious
   to ascertain who Nectarius was, his manner of life, and birthplace.
   When they heard that he had not been initiated their amazement was
   increased at the decision of the emperor. I believe that Diodorus
   himself was not aware that Nectarius had not been baptized; for, had he
   been acquainted with this fact, he would not have ventured to give his
   vote for the priesthood to one uninitiated. It appears reasonable to
   suppose, that on perceiving that Nectarius was of advanced age, he took
   it for granted that he had been initiated long previously. But these
   events did not take place without the interposition of God. For when
   the emperor was informed that Nectarius had not been initiated, he
   remained of the same opinion, although opposed by many priests. When at
   last, consent had been given to the imperial mandate, Nectarius was
   initiated, and while yet clad in his initiatory robes, was proclaimed
   bishop of Constantinople by the unanimous voice of the Synod. Many have
   conjectured that the emperor was led to make this election by a Divine
   revelation. I shall not decide whether this conjecture be true or
   false; but I feel convinced, when I reflect on the extraordinary
   circumstances attending this ordination, that the events were not
   brought about without the Divine strength; and that God led this mild
   and virtuous and excellent man into the priesthood. Such are the
   details which I have been able to ascertain concerning the ordination
   of Nectarius.

   Chapter IX.--Decrees of the Second General Council. Maximus, the
   Cynical Philosopher.

   After these transactions, Nectarius and the other priests assembled
   together, [1532] and decreed that the faith established by the council
   of Nicæa should remain dominant, and that all heresies should be
   condemned; that the churches everywhere should be governed according to
   the ancient canons; that each bishop should remain in his own church,
   and not go elsewhere under any light pretext; or, without invitation,
   perform ordinations in which he had no right to interfere, as had
   frequently been the case in the Catholic Church during the times of
   persecution. They likewise decreed that the affairs of each church
   should be subjected to the investigation and control of a council of
   the province; and that the bishop of Constantinople should rank next in
   point of precedence to the bishop of Rome, as occupying the see of New
   Rome; for Constantinople was not only already favored with this
   appellation, but was also in the enjoyment of many privileges,--such as
   a senate of its own, and the division of the citizens into ranks and
   orders; it was also governed by its own magistrates, and possessed
   contracts, laws, and immunities in equal degree with those of Rome in
   Italy.

   The council also decreed that Maximus had not been nor was now a
   bishop; and that those individuals whom he had ordained were not of the
   clergy; and that all that had been done by him, or in his name, was
   null and void. Maximus was a native of Alexandria, and, by profession,
   a cynical philosopher. He was zealously attached to the Nicene
   doctrines, and had been secretly ordained bishop of Constantinople by
   bishops who had assembled in that city from Egypt.

   Such were the decrees of the council. They were confirmed by the
   emperor, who enacted [1533] that the faith established at Nicæa should
   be dominant, and that the churches everywhere should be placed in the
   hands of those who acknowledged one and the same Godhead in the
   hypostasis of three Persons of equal honor and of equal power; namely,
   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. To designate them still more
   precisely, the emperor declared that he referred to those who held
   communion with Nectarius, at Constantinople, and with Timothy, bishop
   of Alexandria, in Egypt; in the churches of the East with Diodorus,
   bishop of Tarsus, and in Syria with Pelagius, bishop of Laodicea, and
   in Asia with Amphilochius, president of the churches in Iconium; to
   those in the cities by the Pontus, from Bithynia to Armenia, who held
   communion with Helladius, bishop of the church of Cæsarea in
   Cappadocia; with Gregory, bishop of Nyssa; and with Otreinus, bishop of
   Melitine; and to the cities of Thrace and Scythia, who held communion
   with Terentius, bishop of Tomi, and with Martyrius, bishop of
   Marcianopolis. The emperor was personally acquainted with all these
   bishops, and had ascertained that they governed their respective
   churches wisely and piously. After these transactions, the council was
   dissolved, and each of the bishops returned homewards.

   Chapter X.--Concerning Martyrius of Cilicia. Translation of the Remains
   of St. Paul the Confessor, and of Meletius, Bishop of Antioch.

   Nectarius made himself acquainted with the routine of sacerdotal
   ceremonies under the instruction of Cyriacus, [1534] bishop of Adana,
   whom he had requested Diodorus, bishop of Tarsus, to leave with him for
   a short period. Nectarius also retained several other Cilicians with
   him, amongst whom was Martyrius, his physician, who had been a witness
   of the irregularities of his youth. Nectarius was desirous of ordaining
   him deacon; but Martyrius refused the honor under the plea of his own
   unworthiness of such a divine service, and called upon Nectarius
   himself to witness as to the course of his past life. To this Nectarius
   replied as follows: "Although I am now a priest, do you not know that
   my past career was a more guilty one than yours, inasmuch as you were
   but an instrument in my numerous profligacies?" "But you, O blessed
   one," replied Martyrius, "were cleansed by baptism, and were then
   accounted worthy of the priesthood. Both these ordinances are appointed
   by the Divine law for purification from sin, and it seems to me that
   you now differ in no respect from a new-born infant; but I long ago
   received holy baptism, and have since continued in the same abusive
   course." It was under this plea that he excused himself from receiving
   ordination; and I commend the man for his refusal, and therefore would
   give him a part in my history.

   The Emperor Theodosius, on being informed of various events connected
   with Paul, [1535] formerly bishop of Constantinople, caused his body to
   be removed to the church erected by Macedonius, his enemy, and buried
   there. This temple is a spacious and most distinguished edifice, and is
   still named after Paul. Hence many persons who are ignorant of the
   facts of the case, particularly women and the mass of the people,
   imagine that Paul, the apostle, is interred therein. The remains of
   Meletius were at the same time conveyed to Antioch, and deposited near
   the tomb of Babylas the martyr. It is said that through every public
   way, by the command of the emperor, the relics were received within the
   walls in every city, contrary to Roman custom, and were honored with
   singing of psalms antiphonally in such places, until they were
   transferred to Antioch.

   Chapter XI.--Ordination of Flavian as Bishop of Antioch, and Subsequent
   Occurrences on Account of the Oath.

   After the pompous interment of the remains of Meletius, Flavian was
   ordained in his stead, and that, too, in direct violation of the oath
   he had taken; [1536] for Paulinus was still alive. This gave rise to
   fresh troubles in the church of Antioch. Many persons refused to
   maintain communion with Flavian, and held their church apart with
   Paulinus. Even the priests differed among themselves on this subject.
   The Egyptians, Arabians, and Cypriots were indignant at the injustice
   that had been manifested towards Paulinus. On the other hand, the
   Syrians, the Palestinians, the Phoenicians, and the greater part of
   Armenia, Cappadocia, Galatia, and Pontus, sided with Flavian. The
   bishop of Rome, and all the Western priests, regarded the conduct of
   Flavian with the utmost displeasure. They addressed the customary
   epistles, called synodical, to Paulinus as bishop of Antioch, and took
   no notice of Flavian. They also withdrew from communion with Diodorus,
   bishop of Tarsus, and Acacius, bishop of Berea, because they had
   ordained Flavian. [1537] To take further cognizance of the affair, the
   Western bishops and the Emperor Gratian wrote to the bishops of the
   East, and summoned them to attend a council in the West.

   Chapter XII.--Project of Theodosius to unify all the Heresies. The
   Propositions made by Agelius and Sisinius, the Novatians. At another
   Synod, the Emperor received those only who represent Consubstantiality;
   those who held a different View he ejected from the Churches.

   Although all the houses of prayer were at this period in the possession
   of the Catholic Church, many troubles occurred in various parts of the
   empire, instigated by the Arians. [1538] The Emperor Theodosius,
   therefore, soon after the council above mentioned, again summoned
   together the presidents of the sects which were flourishing, in order
   that they might either bring others to their own state of conviction on
   disputed topics, or be convinced themselves; for he imagined that all
   would be brought to oneness of opinion, if a free discussion were
   entered into, concerning ambiguous points of doctrine. The council,
   therefore, was convened. This occurred in the year of the second
   consulate of Merobaudes, and the first of Saturninus, and at the same
   period that Arcadius was associated with his father in the government
   of the empire. Theodosius sent for Nectarius, consulted with him
   concerning the coming Synod, and commanded him to introduce the
   discussion of all questions which had given rise to heresies, so that
   the church of the believers in Christ might be one, and might agree on
   the doctrine according to which piety ought to be observed. When
   Nectarius returned home, feeling anxious about the affair confided to
   him, he made known the mandate of the emperor to Agelius, the president
   of the church of the Novatians, who held the same religious sentiments
   as himself. Agelius proved the virtue of his life by works, but was
   unaccustomed to the finesse and deception of words; he therefore
   proposed as a substitute, one of his readers, by name Sisinius, who
   afterwards succeeded him as bishop, a man who could see what was
   practical, and could debate, if that were necessary. Sisinius possessed
   powers of intellect and of expression; he had an accurate knowledge of
   the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, and was well acquainted with
   profane and with ecclesiastical literature. He proposed that all
   disputation with the heterodox, as being a fruitful source of
   contention and war, should be avoided; but recommended that inquiries
   should rather be instituted, as to whether the heretics admitted the
   testimony of the expositors and teachers of the sacred words, who lived
   before the Church was rent in division. "If they reject the testimony
   of these great men," said he, "they will be condemned by their own
   followers; but if they admit their authority as being adequate to
   resolve ambiguous points of doctrine, we will produce their books." For
   Sisinius was well aware that, as the ancients recognized the Son to be
   eternal like the Father, they had never presumed to assert that He had
   had an origin from some beginning. This suggestion received the
   approbation of Nectarius, and afterwards of the emperor; and
   investigations were set on foot as to the opinions entertained by
   heretics concerning the ancient interpreters of Scripture. As it was
   found that the heretics professed to hold these early writers in great
   admiration, the emperor asked them openly whether they would defer to
   the authority of the aforesaid on controverted topics, and test their
   own doctrines by the sentiments propounded in those works. This
   proposition excited great contention among the leaders of the various
   heretical sects, for they did not all hold the same view about the
   books of the ancients; the emperor knew that they were convicted by the
   debates over their own words alone, and withdrew the proposition. He
   blamed them for their opinion, and commanded each party to draw up a
   written exposition of its own creed. On the day appointed for the
   presentation of these documents, Nectarius and Agelius appeared at the
   palace, as representatives of those who maintain the consubstantiality
   of the Holy Trinity; Demophilus, the Arian president, came forward as
   the deputy of the Arians; Eunomius represented the Eunomians; and
   Eleusius, bishop of Cyzicus, appeared for the sectarians denominated
   Macedonians. The emperor, after receiving their formularies, expressed
   himself in favor of that one alone in which consubstantiality of the
   Trinity was recognized, and destroyed the others. The interests of the
   Novatians were not affected by this transaction, for they held the same
   doctrines as the Catholic Church concerning the Divine nature. The
   members of the other sects were indignant with the priests for having
   entered into unwise disputations in the presence of the emperor. Many
   renounced their former opinions, and embraced the authorized form of
   religion. The emperor enacted a law, prohibiting heretics from holding
   churches, from giving public instructions in the faith, and from
   conferring ordination on bishops or others. [1539] Some of the
   heterodox were expelled from the cities and villages, while others were
   disgraced and deprived of the privileges enjoyed by other subjects of
   the empire. Great as were the punishments adjudged by the laws against
   heretics, they were not always carried into execution, for the emperor
   had no desire to persecute his subjects; he only desired to enforce
   uniformity of view about God through the medium of intimidation. Those
   who voluntarily renounced heretical opinions received commendation from
   him.

   Chapter XIII.--Maximus the Tyrant. Concerning the Occurrences between
   the Empress Justina and St. Ambrose. The Emperor Gratian was killed by
   Guile. Valentinian and his Mother fled to Theodosius in Thessalonica.

   As the Emperor Gratian was at this period occupied with a war against
   the Alamanni, [1540] Maximus quitted Britain, with the design of
   usurping the imperial power. Valentinian was then residing in Italy,
   but as he was a minor, the affairs of state were transacted by Probus,
   a prætorian prefect, who had formerly been consul.

   Justina, the mother of the emperor, having espoused the Arian heresy,
   persecuted Ambrose, bishop of Milan, and disquieted the churches by her
   efforts to introduce alterations in the Nicene doctrines, and to obtain
   the predominance of the form of belief set forth at Ariminum. She was
   incensed against Ambrose because he strenuously opposed her attempts at
   innovation, and she represented to her son that he had insulted her.
   Valentinian believed this calumny, and, determined to avenge the
   supposed wrongs of his mother, he sent a party of soldiers against the
   church. On their reaching the temple, they forced their way into the
   interior, arrested Ambrose, and were about to lead him into exile at
   that very moment, when the people assembled in crowds at the church,
   and evinced a resolution to die rather than submit to the banishment of
   their priest. Justina was still further incensed at this occurrence;
   and with a view of enforcing her project by law, she sent for
   Menivolus, [1541] one of the legal secretaries, and commanded him to
   draw up, as quickly as possible, an edict confirmatory of the decrees
   of Ariminum. Menivolus, being firmly attached to the Catholic Church,
   refused to write the document, and the empress tried to bribe him by
   promises of greater honors. He still, however, refused compliance, and,
   tearing off his belt, he threw it at the feet of Justina, and declared
   that he would neither retain his present office, nor accept of
   promotion, as the reward of impiety. As he remained firm in his
   refusal, others were intrusted with the compilation of the law. By this
   law, all who conformed to the doctrines set forth at Ariminum and
   ratified at Constantinople were exhorted to convene boldly; and it was
   enacted that death should be the punishment of those who should hinder
   or be running counter to this law of the emperor.

   While the mother of the emperor was planning the means of carrying this
   cruel law into execution, intelligence was brought of the murder of
   Gratian, through the treachery of Andragathius, the general of Maximus.
   Andragathius obtained possession of the imperial chariot, and sent word
   to the emperor that his consort was traveling towards his camp.
   Gratian, who was but recently married and youthful, as well as
   passionately attached to his wife, hastened incautiously across the
   river, and in his anxiety to meet her fell without forethought into the
   hands of Andragathius; he was seized, and, in a little while, put to
   death. He was in the twenty-fourth year of his age, and had reigned
   fifteen years. This calamity quieted Justina's wrath against Ambrose.

   Maximus, in the meantime, raised a large army of Britons, neighboring
   Gauls, Celts, and other nations, and marched into Italy. The pretext
   which he advanced for this measure was, that he desired to prevent the
   introduction of innovations in the ancient form of religion and of
   ecclesiastical order; but he was in reality actuated by the desire of
   dispelling any suspicion that might have been excited as to his
   aspirations after tyranny. He was watching and intriguing for the
   imperial rule in such a way that it might appear as if he had acquired
   the Roman government by law, and not by force. Valentinian was
   compelled by the exigencies of the times to recognize the symbols of
   his rule; but soon after, in fear of suffering, fled with his mother
   Justina, and Probus, the prætorian prefect in Italy, to Thessalonica.

   Chapter XIV.--Birth of Honorius. Theodosius leaves Arcadius at
   Constantinople, and proceeds to Italy. Succession of the Novatian and
   other Patriarchs. Audacity of the Arians. Theodosius, after destroying
   the Tyrant, celebrates a Magnificent Triumph in Rome.

   While Theodosius was making preparations for a war against Maximus, his
   son Honorius was born. [1542] On the completion of these warlike
   preparations, he left his son Arcadius to govern at Constantinople, and
   proceeded to Thessalonica, where he received Valentinian. He refused
   either to dismiss openly, or to give audience to the embassy sent by
   Maximus, but continued his journey at the head of his troops towards
   Italy.

   About this period, Agelius, bishop of the Novatians at Constantinople,
   feeling his end approaching, nominated Sisinius, one of the presbyters
   of his church, as his successor. The people, however, murmured that the
   preference had not rather been given to Marcian, who was noted on
   account of his piety, and Agelius therefore ordained him, and addressed
   the people who were assembled in the church in the following words:
   "After me you shall have Marcian for your bishop, and after him,
   Sisinius." Agelius died soon after he had uttered these words. He had
   governed his church forty years with the greatest approbation from his
   own heretical party; and some assert that during the times of Pagan
   persecution, he had openly confessed the name of Christ.

   Not long after Timothy and Cyril died; Theophilus succeeded to the see
   of Alexandria, and John to that of Jerusalem. Demophilus, leader of the
   Arians at Constantinople, likewise died and was succeeded by Marinus of
   Thrace; but he was superseded by Dorotheus, who soon after arrived from
   Antioch in Syria, and who was considered by his sect to be better
   qualified for the office than Marinus.

   Theodosius, having in the meantime entered Italy, various conflicting
   reports were spread as to the success of his arms. It was rumored among
   the Arians that the greater part of his army had been cut to pieces in
   battle, and that he himself had been captured by the tyrant; and
   assuming this report to be true, these sectarians became bold and ran
   to the house of Nectarius and set it on fire, from indignation at the
   power which the bishop had obtained over the churches. The emperor,
   however, carried out his purpose in the war, for the soldiers of
   Maximus, impelled by fear of the preparations against them, or
   treachery, seized and slew the tyrant. Andragathius, the murderer of
   Gratian, no sooner heard of the death of Maximus, than he leaped into
   the river with his armor, and perished. The war having been thus
   terminated, and the death of Gratian avenged, Theodosius, accompanied
   by Valentinian, celebrated a triumph in Rome, and restored order in the
   churches of Italy, for the Empress Justina was dead.

   Chapter XV.--Flavian and Evagrius, Bishops of Antioch. The Events at
   Alexandria upon the Destruction of the Temple of Dionysus. The Serapeum
   and the other Idolatrous Temples which were destroyed.

   Paulinus, [1543] bishop of Antioch, died about this period, and those
   who had been convened into a church with him persisted in their
   aversion to Flavian, although his religious sentiments were precisely
   the same as their own, because he had violated the oath he had formerly
   made to Meletius. They, therefore, elected Evagrius as their bishop.
   Evagrius did not long survive this appointment, and although Flavian
   prevented the election of another bishop, those who had seceded from
   communion with him, still continued to hold their assemblies apart.

   About this period, the bishop of Alexandria, to whom the temple of
   Dionysus had, at his own request, been granted by the emperor,
   converted the edifice into a church. The statues were removed, the
   adyta were exposed; and, in order to cast contumely on the pagan
   mysteries, he made a procession for the display of these objects; the
   phalli, and whatever other object had been concealed in the adyta which
   really was, or seemed to be, ridiculous, he made a public exhibition
   of. The pagans, amazed at so unexpected an exposure, could not suffer
   it in silence, but conspired together to attack the Christians. They
   killed many of the Christians, wounded others, and seized the Serapion,
   a temple which was conspicuous for beauty and vastness and which was
   seated on an eminence. This they converted into a temporary citadel;
   and hither they conveyed many of the Christians, put them to the
   torture, and compelled them to offer sacrifice. Those who refused
   compliance were crucified, had both legs broken, or were put to death
   in some cruel manner. When the sedition had prevailed for some time,
   the rulers came and urged the people to remember the laws, to lay down
   their arms, and to give up the Serapion. There came then Romanus, the
   general of the military legions in Egypt; and Evagrius was the prefect
   of Alexandria [1544] As their efforts, however, to reduce the people to
   submission were utterly in vain, they made known what had transpired to
   the emperor. Those who had shut themselves up in the Serapion prepared
   a more spirited resistance, from fear of the punishment that they knew
   would await their audacious proceedings, and they were further
   instigated to revolt by the inflammatory discourses of a man named
   Olympius, attired in the garments of a philosopher, who told them that
   they ought to die rather than neglect the gods of their fathers.
   Perceiving that they were greatly dispirited by the destruction of the
   idolatrous statues, he assured them that such a circumstance did not
   warrant their renouncing their religion; for that the statues were
   composed of corruptible materials, and were mere pictures, and
   therefore would disappear; whereas, the powers which had dwelt within
   them, had flown to heaven. By such representations as these, he
   retained the multitude with him in the Serapion.

   When the emperor was informed of these occurrences, he declared that
   the Christians who had been slain were blessed, inasmuch as they had
   been admitted to the honor of martyrdom, and had suffered in defense of
   the faith. He offered free pardon [1545] to those who had slain them,
   hoping that by this act of clemency they would be the more readily
   induced to embrace Christianity; and he commanded the demolition of the
   temples in Alexandria which had been the cause of the popular sedition.
   It is said that, when this imperial edict was read in public, the
   Christians uttered loud shouts of joy, because the emperor laid the
   odium of what had occurred upon the pagans. The people who were
   guarding the Serapion were so terrified at hearing these shouts, that
   they took to flight, and the Christians immediately obtained possession
   of the spot, which they have retained ever since. I have been informed
   that, on the night preceding this occurrence, Olympius heard the voice
   of one singing hallelujah in the Serapion. The doors were shut and
   everything was still; and as he could see no one, but could only hear
   the voice of the singer, he at once understood what the sign signified;
   and unknown to any one he quitted the Serapion and embarked for Italy.
   It is said that when the temple was being demolished, some stones were
   found, on which were hieroglyphic characters in the form of a cross,
   which on being submitted to the inspection of the learned, were
   interpreted as signifying the life to come. [1546] These characters led
   to the conversion of several of the pagans, as did likewise other
   inscriptions found in the same place, and which contained predictions
   of the destruction of the temple. It was thus that the Serapion was
   taken, and, a little while after, converted into a church; it received
   the name of the Emperor Arcadius.

   There were still pagans in many cities, who contended zealously in
   behalf of their temples; as, for instance, the inhabitants of Petræa
   and of Areopolis, in Arabia; of Raphi and Gaza, in Palestine; of
   Heriopolis in Phoenicia; and of Apamea, on the river Axius, in Syria. I
   have been informed that the inhabitants of the last-named city often
   armed the men of Galilee and the peasants of Lebanon in defense of
   their temples; and that at last, they even carried their audacity to
   such a height, as to slay a bishop named Marcellus. This bishop had
   commanded the demolition of all the temples in the city and villages,
   under the supposition that it would not be easy otherwise for them to
   be converted from their former religion. Having heard that there was a
   very spacious temple at Aulon, a district of Apamea, he repaired
   thither with a body of soldiers and gladiators. He stationed himself at
   a distance from the scene of conflict, beyond the reach of the arrows;
   for he was afflicted with the gout, and was unable to fight, to pursue,
   or to flee. Whilst the soldiers and gladiators were engaged in the
   assault against the temple, some pagans, discovering that he was alone,
   hastened to the place where he was separated from the combat; they
   arose suddenly and seized him, and burnt him alive. The perpetrators of
   this deed were not then known, but, in course of time, they were
   detected, and the sons of Marcellus determined upon avenging his death.
   The council of the province, however, prohibited them from executing
   this design, and declared that it was not just that the relatives or
   friends of Marcellus should seek to avenge his death; when they should
   rather return thanks to God for having accounted him worthy to die in
   such a cause.

   Chapter XVI.--In What Manner, and from What Cause, the Functions of the
   Presbyter, Appointed to Preside over the Imposition of Penance, were
   abolished. Dissertation on the Mode of Imposing Penance.

   Nectarius, about this period, abolished the office of the presbyter
   whose duty it was to preside over the imposition of penance; and this
   is the first instance of the suppression of this office in the Church.
   [1547] This example was followed by the bishops of every region.
   Various accounts have been given of the nature, the origin, and the
   cause of the abolition of this office. I shall state my own views on
   the subject. Impeccability is a Divine attribute, and belongs not to
   human nature; therefore God has decreed that pardon should be extended
   to the penitent, even after many transgressions. As in supplicating for
   pardon, it is requisite to confess the sin, it seems probable that the
   priests, from the beginning, considered it irksome to make this
   confession in public, before the whole assembly of the people. They
   therefore appointed a presbyter, of the utmost sanctity, and the most
   undoubted prudence, to act on these occasions; the penitents went to
   him, and confessed their transgressions; and it was his office to
   indicate the kind of penance adapted to each sin, and then when
   satisfaction had been made, to pronounce absolution. As the custom of
   doing penance never gained ground among the Novatians, regulations of
   this nature were of course unnecessary among them; but the custom
   prevailed among all other heretics, and prevails even to the present
   day. It is observed with great rigor by the Western churches, [1548]
   particularly at Rome, where there is a place appropriated to the
   reception of penitents, in which spot they stand and mourn until the
   completion of the services, for it is not lawful for them to take part
   in the mysteries; then they cast themselves, with groans and
   lamentations, prostrate on the ground. The bishop conducts the
   ceremony, sheds tears, and prostrates himself in like manner; and all
   the people burst into tears, and groan aloud. Afterwards, the bishop
   rises first from the ground, and raises up the others; he offers up
   prayer on behalf of the penitents, and then dismisses them. Each of the
   penitents subjects himself in private to voluntary suffering, either by
   fastings, by abstaining from the bath or from divers kinds of meats, or
   by other prescribed means, until a certain period appointed by the
   bishop. When the time arrives, he is made free from the consequences of
   his sin, and assembles at the church with the people. The Roman priests
   have carefully observed this custom from the beginning to the present
   time. In the church at Constantinople, a presbyter was always appointed
   to preside over the penitents, until a lady of the nobility made a
   deposition to the effect, that when she resorted as a penitent to the
   presbyter, to fast and offer supplications to God, and tarried for that
   purpose, in the church, a rape had been committed on her person by the
   deacon. Great displeasure was manifested by the people when this
   occurrence was made known to them, on account of the discredit that
   would result to the church; and the priests, in particular, were
   thereby greatly scandalized. Nectarius, after much hesitation as to
   what means ought to be adopted, deposed the deacon; and, at the advice
   of certain persons, who urged the necessity of leaving each individual
   to examine himself before participating in the sacred mysteries, he
   abolished the office of the presbyter presiding over penance. From that
   period, therefore, the performance of penance fell into disuse; and it
   seems to me, that extreme laxity of principle was thus substituted for
   the severity and rigor of antiquity. Under the ancient system, I think,
   offences were of rarer occurrence; for people were deterred from their
   commission, by the dread of confessing them, and of exposing them to
   the scrutiny of a severe judge. I believe it was from similar
   considerations, that the Emperor Theodosius, who was always zealous in
   promoting the glory of the Church, issued a law, [1549] enacting that
   women should not be admitted into the ministry, unless they had had
   children, and were upwards of sixty years of age, according to the
   precept of the Apostle Paul. [1550] By this law it was also decreed,
   that women who had shaved their heads should be ejected from the
   churches; and that the bishop by whom such women were admitted should
   be deposed from the bishopric.

   Chapter XVII.--Banishment of Eunomius by Theodosius the Great.
   Theophronius, his Successor; of Eutychus, and of Dorotheus, and their
   Heresies; of those called Psathyrians; Division of the Arians into
   Different Parties; those in Constantinople were more Limited.

   Such subjects as the above, however, are best left to the decision of
   individual judgment.

   The emperor, about this period, condemned Eunomius to banishment.
   [1551] This heretic had fixed his residence in the suburbs of
   Constantinople, and held frequent churches in private houses, where he
   read his own writings. He induced many to embrace his sentiments, so
   that the sectarians, who were named after him, became very numerous. He
   died not long after his banishment, and was interred at Dacora, his
   birthplace, a village of Cappadocia, situated near Mount Argeus, in the
   territory of Cæsarea. Theophronius, who was also a native of
   Cappadocia, and who had been his disciple, continued to promulgate his
   doctrines. Having gotten a smattering, through the writings of
   Aristotle, he composed an introduction to the study of the syllogisms
   in them, which he entitled "Exercises for the Mind." But he afterwards
   engaged, I have understood, in many unprofitable disputations, and soon
   ceased to confine himself to the doctrines of his master. But being
   eager for new things, he endeavored to prove, from the terms which are
   placed in the Sacred Scriptures, that though God foreknows that which
   is not, and knows that which is, and remembers what has happened, he
   does not always have that knowledge in the same manner with respect to
   the future and present, and changes his knowledge of the past. As this
   hypothesis appeared positively absurd to the Eunomians, they
   excommunicated him from their church; and he constituted himself the
   leader of a new sect, called, after his name, Theophronians. Not long
   after, Eutychus, one of the Eunomians, originated another sect in
   Constantinople, to which his own name was given. For the question had
   been proposed, as to whether the Son of God is or is not acquainted
   with the last hour; and for its solution, the words of the evangelist
   were quoted, in which it is stated that the day and hour are known only
   to the Father. [1552] Eutychus, however, contended that this knowledge
   belongs also to the Son, inasmuch as He has received all things from
   the Father. The Eunomian presidents, having condemned this opinion, he
   seceded from communion with them, and went to join Eunomius in his
   place of banishment. A deacon, and some other individuals, who had been
   dispatched from Constantinople to accuse Eutychus, and, if necessary,
   to oppose him in argument, arrived first at the place of destination.
   When Eunomius was made acquainted with the object of their journey, he
   expressed himself in favor of the sentiments propounded by Eutychus;
   and, on his arrival, prayed with him, although it was not lawful to
   pray with any one who travels unprovided with letters written in sacred
   characters, attesting his being in communion. Eunomius died soon after
   this contention; and the Eunomian president, at Constantinople, refused
   to receive Eutychus into communion; for he antagonized him from
   jealousy because he was not even of clerical rank, and because he could
   not answer his arguments, and did not find it possible to solve his
   problems. Eutychus, therefore, separated those who had espoused his
   sentiments into a personal heresy. Many assert that he and Theophronius
   were the first who propounded the peculiar views entertained by the
   Eunomians concerning divine baptism. The above is a brief account of
   such details as I have been able to give in order to afford a succinct
   knowledge of the causes which led the Eunomians to be divided among
   themselves. I should be prolix were I to enter into further
   particulars; and, indeed, the subject would be by no means an easy one
   to me, since I have no such dialectic skill.

   The following question was, in the meantime, agitated among the Arians
   of Constantinople: Prior to the existence of the Son (whom they regard
   as having proceeded out of nothing), is God to be termed the Father?
   Dorotheus, who had been summoned from Antioch to rule over them in the
   place of Marinus, was of opinion that God could not have been called
   the Father prior to the existence of the Son, because the name of
   Father has a necessary connection with that of Son. Marinus, on the
   other hand, maintained that the Father was the Father, even when the
   Son existed not; and he advanced this opinion either from conviction,
   or else from the desire of contention, and from jealousy at the
   preference that had been shown to Dorotheus in the Church. The Arians
   were thus divided into two parties; Dorotheus and his followers
   retained possession of the houses of prayer, while Marinus, and those
   who seceded with him, erected new edifices in which to hold their own
   churches. The name "Psathyrians" and "Goths" were given to the
   partisans of Marinus; Psathyrians, because Theoctistus, a certain
   cake-vender (psathuropoles ) was a zealous advocate of their opinions;
   and Goths, because their sentiments were approved by Selinus, bishop of
   that nation. Almost all these barbarians followed the instructions of
   Selinus, and they gathered in churches with the followers of Marinus.
   The Goths were drawn to Selinus particularly because he had formerly
   been the secretary of Ulphilas, and had succeeded him as bishop. He was
   capable of teaching in their churches, not only in the vernacular, but
   also in the Greek language.

   Soon after a contest for precedency arose between Marinus and Agapius,
   whom Marinus himself had ordained bishop over the Arians at Ephesus;
   and in the quarrel which ensued, the Goths took the part of Agapius. It
   is said that many of the Arian clergy of that city were so much
   irritated through the ambition displayed by these two bishops, that
   they communed with the Catholic Church. Such was the origin of the
   division of the Arians into two factions,--a division which still
   subsists; so that, in every city, they have separate churches. The
   Arians at Constantinople, however, after a separation of thirty-five
   years, were reconciled to each other by Plinthas, formerly a consul,
   [1553] general of the cavalry and infantry, a man possessed of great
   influence at court. To prevent the revival of the former dissensions
   among them, the question which had been the cause of the division was
   forbidden to be mooted. And these occurrences took place later.

   Chapter XVIII.--Another Heresy, that of the Sabbatians, is originated
   by the Novatians. Their Synod in Sangarus. Account in Greater Detail of
   the Easter Festival.

   A division arose during the same reign among the Novatians [1554]
   concerning the celebration of the festival of Easter, and from this
   dispute originated another, called the Sabbatian. Sabbatius, who, with
   Theoctistus and Macarius, had been ordained presbyter by Marcian,
   adopted the opinion of the co-presbyters, who had been convened at
   Pazoucoma [1555] during the reign of Valens, and maintained that the
   feast of the Passover (Easter) ought to be celebrated by Christians as
   by Jews. He seceded from the Church at first for the purpose of
   exercising greater austerity, for he professed to adopt a very austere
   mode of life. He also declared that one motive of his secession was,
   that many persons who participated in the mysteries appeared to him to
   be unworthy of the honor. When, however, his design of introducing
   innovations was detected, Marcian expressed his regret at having
   ordained him, and, it is said, was often heard to exclaim that he would
   rather have laid his hands upon thorns than upon the head of Sabbatius.
   Perceiving that the people of his diocese were being rent into two
   factions, Marcian summoned all the bishops of his own persuasion to
   Sangarus, a town of Bithynia, near the seashore, not far from the city
   of Helenopolis. When they had assembled, they summoned Sabbatius, and
   asked him to state the cause of his grievance; and as he merely
   complained of the diversity prevailing in regard to the feast, they
   suspected that he made this a pretext to disguise his love of
   precedency, and made him declare upon oath that he would never accept
   the episcopal office. When he had taken the required oath, all were of
   the same opinion, and they voted to hold the church together, for the
   difference prevailing in the celebration of the Paschal feast ought by
   no means to be made an occasion for separation from communion; and they
   decided that each individual should be at liberty to observe the feast
   according to his own judgment. They enacted a canon on the subject,
   which they styled the "Indifferent (hadiaphoros) Canon." Such were the
   transactions of the assembly at Sangarus. From that period Sabbatius
   adhered to the usage of the Jews; and unless all happened to observe
   the feast at the same time, he fasted, according to the custom, but in
   advance, and celebrated the Passover with the usual prescriptions by
   himself. He passed the Saturday, from the evening to the appointed
   time, in watching and in offering up the prescribed prayers; and on the
   following day he assembled with the multitude, and partook of the
   mysteries. This mode of observing the feast was at first unnoticed by
   the people but as, in process of time, it began to attract observation,
   and to become more generally known, he found a great many imitators,
   particularly in Phrygia and Galatia, to whom this celebration of the
   feast became a national custom. Eventually he openly seceded from
   communion, and became the bishop of those who had espoused his
   sentiments, as we shall have occasion to show in the proper place.

   I am, for my own part, astonished that Sabbatius and his followers
   attempted to introduce this innovation. The ancient Hebrews, as is
   related by Eusebius, [1556] on the testimony of Philo, Josephus,
   Aristobulus, and several others, offered the sacrifices after the
   vernal equinox, when the sun is in the first sign of the zodiac, called
   by the Greeks the Ram, and when the moon is in the opposite quarter of
   the heavens, and in the fourteenth day of her age. Even the Novatians
   themselves, who have studied the subject with some accuracy, declare
   that the founder of their heresy and his first disciples did not follow
   this custom, which was introduced for the first time by those who
   assembled at Pazoucoma; and that at old Rome the members of this sect
   still observe the same practice as the Romans, who have not deviated
   from their original usage in this particular, the custom having been
   handed down to them by the holy apostles Peter and Paul. Further, the
   Samaritans, who are scrupulous observers of the laws of Moses, never
   celebrate this festival till the first-fruits have reached maturity;
   they say it is, in the law, called the Feast of First-Fruits, and
   before these appear, it is not lawful to observe the feast; and,
   therefore, necessarily the vernal equinox must precede. Hence arises my
   astonishment that those who profess to adopt the Jewish custom in the
   celebration of this feast, do not conform to the ancient practice of
   the Jews. With the exception of the people above mentioned, and the
   Quartodecimani of Asia, all heresies, I believe, celebrate the Passover
   in the same manner as the Romans and the Egyptians. The Quartodecimani
   are so called because they observe this festival, like the Jews, on the
   fourteenth day of the moon, and hence their name. The Novatians observe
   the day of the resurrection. They follow the custom of the Jews and the
   Quartodecimani, except when the fourteenth day of the moon falls upon
   the first day of the week, in which case they celebrate the feast so
   many days after the Jews, as there are intervening days between the
   fourteenth day of the moon and the following Lord's day. The
   Montanists, who are called Pepuzites and Phrygians, celebrate the
   Passover according to a strange fashion which they introduced. They
   blame those who regulate the time of observing the feast according to
   the course of the moon, and affirm that it is right to attend
   exclusively to the cycles of the sun. They reckon each month to consist
   of thirty days, and account the day after the vernal equinox as the
   first day of the year, which, according to the Roman method of
   computation, would be called the ninth day before the calends of April.
   It was on this day, they say, that the two great luminaries appointed
   for the indication of times and of years were created. This they prove
   by the fact that every eight years the sun and the moon meet together
   in the same point of the heavens. The moon's cycle of eight years is
   accomplished in ninety-nine months, and in two thousand nine hundred
   and twenty-two days; and during that time there are eight revolutions
   made by the sun, each comprising three hundred and sixty-five days, and
   the fourth part of a day. For they compute the day of the creation of
   the sun, mentioned in Sacred Writ, to have been the fourteenth day of
   the moon, occurring after the ninth day before the calends of the month
   of April, and answering to the eighth day prior to ides of the same
   month. They always celebrate the Passover on this day, when it falls on
   the day of the resurrection; otherwise they celebrate it on the
   following Lord's day; for it is written according to their assertion
   that the feast may be held on any day between the fourteenth and
   twenty-first.

   Chapter XIX.--A List Worthy of Study, Given by the Historian, of
   Customs among Different Nations and Churches.

   We have now described the various usages that prevailed in the
   celebration of the Passover. [1557] It appears to me that Victor,
   bishop of Rome, and Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, came to a very wise
   decision on the controversy that had arisen between them. [1558] For as
   the bishops of the West did not deem it necessary to dishonor the
   tradition handed down to them by Peter and by Paul, and as, on the
   other hand, the Asiatic bishops persisted in following the rules laid
   down by John the evangelist, they unanimously agreed to continue in the
   observance of the festival according to their respective customs,
   without separation from communion with each other. They faithfully and
   justly assumed, that those who accorded in the essentials of worship
   ought not to separate from one another on account of customs. For
   exactly similar traditions on every point are to be found in all the
   churches, even though they hold the same opinions. There are, for
   instance, many cities in Scythia, and yet they all have but one bishop;
   whereas, in other nations a bishop serves as priest even over a
   village, as I have myself observed in Arabia, and in Cyprus, and among
   the Novatians and Montanists of Phrygia. Again, there are even now but
   seven deacons at Rome, answering precisely to the number ordained by
   the apostles, of whom Stephen was the first martyr; whereas, in other
   churches, the number of deacons is a matter of indifference. At Rome
   hallelujah is sung once annually, namely, on the first day of the
   festival of the Passover; so that it is a common thing among the Romans
   to swear by the fact of hearing or singing this hymn. In that city the
   people are not taught by the bishop, nor by any one in the Church. At
   Alexandria the bishop of the city alone teaches the people, and it is
   said that this custom has prevailed there ever since the days of Arius,
   who, though but a presbyter, broached a new doctrine. Another strange
   custom also prevails at Alexandria which I have never witnessed nor
   heard of elsewhere, and this is, that when the Gospel is read the
   bishop does not rise from his seat. The archdeacon alone reads the
   Gospel in this city, whereas in some places it is read by the deacons,
   and in many churches only by the priests; while on noted days it is
   read by the bishops, as, for instance, at Constantinople, on the first
   day of the festival of the resurrection. [1559] In some churches the
   interval called Quadragesima, which occurs before this festival, and is
   devoted by the people to fasting, is made to consist of six weeks; and
   this is the case in Illyria and the Western regions, in Libya,
   throughout Egypt, and in Palestine; whereas it is made to comprise
   seven weeks at Constantinople, and in the neighboring provinces as far
   as Phoenicia. In some churches the people fast three alternate weeks,
   during the space of six or seven weeks, whereas in others they fast
   continuously during the three weeks immediately preceding the festival.
   Some people, as the Montanists, only fast two weeks. Assemblies are not
   held in all churches on the same time or manner. The people of
   Constantinople, and almost everywhere, assemble together on the
   Sabbath, as well as on the first day of the week, which custom is never
   observed at Rome or at Alexandria. There are several cities and
   villages in Egypt where, contrary to the usage established elsewhere,
   the people meet together on Sabbath evenings, and, although they have
   dined previously, partake of the mysteries. The same prayers and psalms
   are not recited nor the same lections read on the same occasions in all
   churches. Thus the book entitled "The Apocalypse of Peter," which was
   considered altogether spurious by the ancients, is still read in some
   of the churches of Palestine, on the day of preparation, when the
   people observe a fast in memory of the passion of the Saviour. So the
   work entitled "The Apocalypse of the Apostle Paul," though unrecognized
   by the ancients, is still esteemed by most of the monks. Some persons
   affirm that the book was found during this reign, by Divine revelation,
   in a marble box, buried beneath the soil in the house of Paul at Tarsus
   in Cilicia. I have been informed that this report is false by Cilix, a
   presbyter of the church in Tarsus, a man of very advanced age, as is
   indicated by his gray hairs, who says that no such occurrence is known
   among them, and wonders if the heretics did not invent the story. What
   I have said upon this subject must now suffice. Many other customs are
   still to be observed in cities and villages; and those who have been
   brought up in their observance would, from respect to the great men who
   instituted and perpetuated these customs, consider it wrong to abolish
   them. Similar motives must be attributed to those who observe different
   practices in the celebration of the feast which has led us into this
   long digression.

   Chapter XX.--Extension of our Doctrines, and Complete Demolition of
   Idolatrous Temples. Inundation of the Nile.

   While the heretics were disrupted among themselves, the Catholic Church
   increased more and more by many accessions from the heterodox, on
   account of the dissensions among them and especially from multitudes of
   pagans. [1560] The emperor having observed that the practice of
   idolatry had been greatly promoted by the facility of constant ingress
   and egress to and from the temple, directed the entrances of all
   temples to be closed; and eventually he commanded the demolition of
   many of these edifices. [1561] When the pagans found themselves
   deprived of their own houses of prayer, they began to frequent our
   churches; for they did not dare to offer sacrifices after the pagan
   form in secret, for it was dangerous, since the sacrifice was under the
   penalty of death and of confiscation of property.

   It is said that the river of Egypt did not overflow its banks this year
   at the proper season; and that the Egyptians angrily ascribed this
   circumstance to the prohibition of sacrifices to it, according to the
   ancestral law. The governor of the province, apprehensive lest the
   general discontent should terminate in sedition, sent a message to the
   emperor on the subject. But the emperor, far from attaching more
   importance to the temporary fertility produced by the Nile, than to the
   fidelity he owed to God and the interests of religion, replied as
   follows: "Let that river cease to flow, if enchantments are requisite
   to insure the regularity of its course; or if it delights in
   sacrifices, or if blood must be mingled with the waters that derive
   their source from the paradise of God." Soon afterwards, the Nile
   overflowed its banks with such violence, that the highest eminences
   were submerged. When it reached the farthest limit and almost had
   attained the fullest measure, the water did not the less press upward,
   so that the Egyptians were thrown into the contrary fear. The dread was
   lest the city of Alexandria and part of Libya should be submerged. The
   pagans of Alexandria, irritated at this unexpected occurrence,
   exclaimed in derision at the public theatres, that the river, like an
   old man or fool, could not moderate its proceedings. Many of the
   Egyptians were hence induced to abandon the superstitions of their
   forefathers, and embrace Christianity. These incidents are given as I
   have learned them.

   Chapter XXI.--Discovery of the Honored Head of the Forerunner of our
   Lord, and the Events about it.

   About this time the head of John the Baptist, which Herodias had asked
   of Herod the tetrarch, was removed to Constantinople. [1562] It is said
   that it was discovered by some monks of the Macedonian heresy, who
   originally dwelt at Constantinople, and afterwards fixed their abode in
   Cilicia. Mardonius, the first eunuch of the palace, made known this
   discovery at court, during the preceding reign; and Valens commanded
   that the relic should be removed to Constantinople. The officers
   appointed to carry it thither, placed it in a public chariot, and
   proceeded with it as far as Pantichium, a district in the territory of
   Chalcedon. Here the mules of the chariot suddenly stopped; and neither
   the application of the lash, nor the threats of the hostlers, could
   induce them to advance further. So extraordinary an event was
   considered by all, and even by the emperor himself, to be of God; and
   the holy head was therefore deposited at Cosilaos, a village in the
   neighborhood, which belonged to Mardonius. Soon after, the Emperor
   Theodosius, impelled by an impulse from God, or from the prophet,
   repaired to the village. He determined upon removing the remains of the
   Baptist, and it is said met with no opposition, except from a holy
   virgin, Matrona, who had been the servant and guardian of the relic. He
   laid aside all authority and force, and after many entreaties, extorted
   a reluctant consent from her to remove the head; for she bore in mind
   what had occurred at the period when Valens commanded its removal. The
   emperor placed it, with the box in which it was encased, in his purple
   robe, and conveyed it to a place called Hebdomos, in the suburbs of
   Constantinople, where he erected a spacious and magnificent temple. The
   woman who had been appointed to the charge of the relic could not be
   persuaded by the emperor to renounce her religious sentiments, although
   he had recourse to entreaty and promises; for she was, it appears, of
   the Macedonian heresy. A presbyter of the same tendency, named Vincent,
   who also took charge of the coffin of the prophet, and performed the
   sacerdotal functions over it, followed the religious opinions of the
   emperor, and entered into communion with the Catholic Church. He had
   taken an oath, as the Macedonians affirm, never to swerve from their
   doctrines; but he afterwards openly declared that, if the Baptist would
   follow the emperor, he also would enter into communion with him and be
   separated. He was a Persian, and had left his country in company with a
   relative named Addas, during the reign of Constantius, in order to
   avoid the persecution which the Christians were then suffering in
   Persia. On his arrival in the Roman territories, he was placed in the
   ranks of the clergy, and advanced to the office of presbyter. Addas
   married and rendered great service to the Church. He left a son named
   Auxentius, who was noted for his very faithful piety, his zeal for his
   friends, the moderation of his life, his love of letters, and the
   greatness of his attainments in pagan and ecclesiastical literature. He
   was modest and retiring in deportment, although admitted to familiarity
   with the emperor and the courtiers, and possessed of a very illustrious
   appointment. His memory is still revered by the monks and zealous men,
   who were all acquainted with him. The woman who had been entrusted with
   the relic remained during the rest of her life at Cosilaos. She was
   greatly distinguished by her piety and wisdom, and instructed many holy
   virgins; and I have been assured that many still survive who reflect
   the honorable character which was the result of training under Matrona.

   Chapter XXII.--Death of Valentinian the Younger, Emperor in Rome,
   through Strangling. The Tyrant Eugenius. Prophecy of John, the Monk of
   Thebaïs.

   While Theodosius was thus occupied in the wise and peaceful government
   of his subjects in the East, and in the service of God, intelligence
   was brought that Valentinian had been strangled. [1563] Some say that
   he was put to death by the eunuchs of the bedchamber, at the
   solicitation of Arbogastes, a military chief, and of certain courtiers,
   who were displeased because the young prince had begun to walk in the
   footsteps of his father, concerning the government, and contrary to the
   opinions approved by them. Others assert, however, that Valentinian
   committed the fatal deed with his own hands, because he found himself
   impeded in attempting deeds which are not lawful in one of his years;
   and on this account he did not deem it worth while to live; for
   although an emperor, he was not allowed to do what he wished. It is
   said that the boy was noble in person, and excellent in royal manners;
   and that, had he lived to the age of manhood, he would have shown
   himself worthy of holding the reins of empire, and would have surpassed
   his father in magnanimity and justice. But though endowed with these
   promising qualities, he died in the manner above related.

   A certain man named Eugenius, who was by no means sincere in his
   professions of Christianity, aspired to sovereignty, and assumed the
   symbols of imperial power. He was hoping to succeed in the attempt
   safely; for he was led by the predictions of individuals who professed
   to foresee the future, by the examination of the entrails and livers of
   animals and the course of the stars. Men of the highest rank among the
   Romans were addicted to these superstitions. Flavian, then a prætorian
   prefect, a learned man, and one who appeared to have an aptitude for
   politics, was noted for being conversant with every means of
   foretelling the future. He persuaded Eugenius to take up arms by
   assuring him that he was destined for the throne, that his warlike
   undertakings would be crowned with victory, and that the Christian
   religion would be abolished. Deceived by these flattering
   representations, Eugenius raised an army and took possession of the
   gates into Italy, as the Romans call the Julian Alps, an elevated and
   precipitous range of mountains; these he seized beforehand and
   fortified, for they had but one path in the narrows, and were shut in
   on each side by precipices and the loftiest mountains. Theodosius was
   perplexed as to whether he ought to await the issue of the war, or
   whether it would be better in the first place to attack Eugenius; and
   in this dilemma, he determined to consult John, a monk of Thebaïs, who,
   as I have before stated, was celebrated for his knowledge of the
   future. He therefore sent Eutropius, a eunuch of the palace, and of
   tried fidelity, to Egypt, with orders to bring John, if possible, to
   court; but, in case of his refusal, to learn what ought to be done.
   When he came to John, the monk could not be persuaded to go to the
   emperor, but he sent word by Eutropius that the war would terminate in
   favor of Theodosius, and that the tyrant would be slain; but that,
   after the victory, Theodosius himself would die in Italy. The truth of
   both of these predictions was confirmed by events.

   Chapter XXIII.--Exaction of Tribute in Antioch, and Demolition of the
   Statues of the Emperor. Embassy headed by Flavian the Chief Priest.

   In this time, on account of the necessities of war, it seemed best to
   the officials whose concern it was, to impose more than the customary
   taxes; for this reason the populace of Antioch in Syria revolted;
   [1564] the statues of the emperor and empress were thrown down and
   dragged by ropes through the city, and, as is usual on such occasions,
   the enraged multitude uttered every insulting epithet that passion
   could suggest. The emperor determined to avenge this insult by the
   death of many of the citizens of Antioch; the people were struck dumb
   at the mere announcement; the rage of the citizens had subsided, and
   had given place to repentance; and, as if already subjected to the
   threatened punishment, they abandoned themselves to groans and tears,
   and supplicated God to turn away the anger of the emperor, and made use
   of some threnodic hymns for their litanies. They deputed Flavian, their
   bishop, to go on an embassy to Theodosius; but on his arrival, finding
   that the resentment of the emperor at what had occurred was unabated,
   he had recourse to the following artifice. He caused some young men
   accustomed to sing at the table of the emperor to utter these hymns
   with the litanies of the Antiochans. It is said that the humanity of
   the emperor was excited; he was overcome by pity at once; his wrath was
   subdued, and as his heart yearned over the city, he shed tears on the
   cup which he held in his hand. It is reported that, on the night before
   the sedition occurred, a spectre was seen in the form of a woman of
   prodigious height and terrible aspect, pacing through the streets of
   the city, lashing the air with an ill-sounding whip, similar to that
   which is used in goading on the beasts brought forward at the public
   theatres. It might have been inferred that the sedition was excited by
   the agency of some evil and malicious demon. There is no doubt but that
   much bloodshed would have ensued, had not the wrath of the emperor been
   stayed by his respect for this sacerdotal entreaty.

   Chapter XXIV.--Victory of Theodosius the Emperor over Eugenius.

   When he had completed his preparations for war, [1565] Theodosius
   declared his younger son Honorius emperor, and leaving him to reign at
   Constantinople conjointly with Arcadius, who had previously been
   appointed emperor, he departed from the East to the West at the head of
   his troops. His army consisted not only of Roman soldiers, but of bands
   of barbarians from the banks of the Ister. It is said that when he left
   Constantinople, he came to the seventh milestone, and went to pray to
   God in the church which he had erected in honor of John the Baptist;
   and in his name prayed that success might attend the Roman arms, and
   besought the Baptist himself to aid him. After offering up these
   prayers he proceeded towards Italy, crossed the Alps, and took the
   first guard-posts. On descending from the heights of these mountains,
   he perceived a plain before him covered with infantry and cavalry, and
   became at the same time aware that some of the enemy's troops were
   lying in ambush behind him, among the recesses of the mountains. The
   advance guard of his army attacked the infantry stationed in the plain,
   and a desperate and very doubtful conflict ensued. Further, when the
   army surrounded him, he considered that he had come into the power of
   men, and could not be saved even by those who would desire to do so,
   since those who had been posted in his rear were seizing the heights;
   he fell prone upon the earth, and prayed with tears, and God instantly
   answered him; for the officers of the troops stationed in ambush on the
   height sent to offer him their services as his allies, provided that he
   would assign them honorable posts in his army. As he had neither paper
   nor ink within reach, he took up some tablets, and wrote on them the
   high and befitting appointments he would confer upon them, provided
   that they would fulfill their promise to him. Under these conditions
   they advanced to the emperor. The issue did not yet incline to either
   side, but the battle was still evenly balanced in the plain, when a
   tremendous wind descended into the face of the enemy. It was such an
   one as we have never before recorded, and broke up the ranks of the
   enemies. The arrows and darts which were sent against the Romans, as if
   projected by the opposing ranks, were turned upon the bodies of those
   who had cast them; and their shields were wrenched from their hands,
   and whirled against them with filth and dust. Standing thus exposed, in
   a defenseless condition, to the weapons of the Romans, many of them
   perished, while the few who attempted to effect an escape were soon
   captured. Eugenius threw himself at the feet of the emperor, and
   implored him to spare his life; but while in the act of offering up
   these entreaties, a soldier struck off his head. Arbogastes fled after
   the battle, and fell by his own hands. It is said that while the battle
   was being fought, a demoniac presented himself in the temple of God
   which is in the Hebdomos, where the emperor had engaged in prayer on
   starting out, and insulted John the Baptist, taunting him with having
   his head cut off, and shouted the following words: "You conquer me, and
   lay snares for my army." The persons who happened to be on the spot,
   and who were waiting impatiently to learn some news of the war, were
   amazed, and wrote an account of it on the day that it occurred, and
   afterwards ascertained that it was the same day as that on which the
   battle had been fought. Such is the history of these transactions.

   Chapter XXV.--Intrepid Bearing of St. Ambrose in the Presence of the
   Emperor Theodosius. Massacre at Thessalonica. Narrative of the other
   Righteous Deeds of this Saint.

   After the death of Eugenius, the emperor went to Milan, and repaired
   towards the church to pray within its walls. [1566] When he drew near
   the gates of the edifice, he was met by Ambrose, the bishop of the
   city, who took hold of him by his purple robe, and said to him, in the
   presence of the multitude, "Stand back! a man defiled by sin, and with
   hands imbrued in blood unjustly shed, is not worthy, without
   repentance, to enter within these sacred precincts, or partake of the
   holy mysteries." The emperor, struck with admiration at the boldness of
   the bishop, began to reflect on his own conduct, and, with much
   contrition, retraced his steps. The occasion of the sin was as follows.
   When Buthericus was general of the troops in Illyria, a charioteer saw
   him shamefully exposed at a tavern, and attempted an outrage; he was
   apprehended and put in custody. Some time after, some magnificent races
   were to be held at the hippodrome, and the populace of Thessalonica
   demanded the release of the prisoner, considering him necessary to the
   celebration of the contest. As their request was not attended to, they
   rose up in sedition and finally slew Buthericus. On hearing of this
   deed, the wrath of the emperor was excited immediately, and he
   commanded that a certain number of the citizens should be put to death.
   The city was filled with the blood of many unjustly shed; for
   strangers, who had but just arrived there on their journey to other
   lands, were sacrificed with the others. There were many cases of
   suffering well worthy of commiseration, of which the following is an
   instance. A merchant offered himself to be slain as a substitute for
   his two sons who had both been selected as victims, and promised the
   soldiers to give them all the gold he possessed, on condition of their
   effecting the exchange. They could not but compassionate his
   misfortune, and consented to take him as a substitute for one of his
   sons, but declared that they did not dare to let off both the young
   men, as that would render the appointed number of the slain incomplete.
   The father gazed on his sons, groaning and weeping; he could not save
   either from death, but he continued hesitating until they had been put
   to death, being overcome by an equal love for each. I have also been
   informed, that a faithful slave voluntarily offered to die instead of
   his master, who was being led to the place of execution. It appears
   that it was for these and other acts of cruelty that Ambrose rebuked
   the emperor, forbade him to enter the church, and excommunicated him.
   Theodosius publicly confessed his sin in the church, and during the
   time set apart for penance, refrained from wearing his imperial
   ornaments, according to the usage of mourners. He also enacted a law
   [1567] prohibiting the officers entrusted with the execution of the
   imperial mandates, from inflicting the punishment of death till thirty
   days after the mandate had been issued, in order that the wrath of the
   emperor might have time to be appeased, and that room might be made for
   the exercise of mercy and repentance.

   Ambrose, no doubt, performed many other actions worthy of his priestly
   office, which are known, as is likely, only to the inhabitants of the
   country. Among the illustrious deeds that are attributed to him, I have
   been made acquainted with the following. It was the custom of the
   emperor to take a seat in assemblies of the church within the palisades
   of the altar, so that he sat apart from the rest of the people.
   Ambrose, considering that this custom had originated either from
   subserviency or from want of discipline, caused the emperor to be
   seated without the trellis work of the altar, so that he sat in front
   of the people, and behind the priests. The emperor Theodosius approved
   of this best tradition, as did likewise his successors; and we are told
   that it has been ever since scrupulously observed.

   I think it necessary to make a record of another action worthy of
   mention performed by this bishop. A pagan of distinction insulted
   Gratian, affirming that he was unworthy of his father; and he was in
   consequence condemned to death. As he was being led out to execution,
   Ambrose went to the palace to implore a pardon. Gratian was then
   engaged in witnessing a private exhibition of the hunt, such as the
   emperors were wont to celebrate for their private pleasure, and not for
   the public pastime. On finding this to be the case, the bishop went to
   the gate where they led in the beasts; he hid himself, and entered with
   the hunters who took charge of the animals, and did not intermit,
   although Gratian and his attendants resisted, till he had obtained an
   immediate and saving consent of the emperor, which released the man who
   was to be led out to death. Ambrose was very diligent in the observance
   of the laws of the Church, and in maintaining discipline among his
   clergy. I have selected the above two incidents from among the records
   of his numerous magnanimous deeds, in order to show with what
   intrepidity he addressed those in power when the service of God was in
   question.

   Chapter XXVI.--St. Donatus, Bishop of Euroea, and Theotimus,
   High-Priest of Scythia.

   There were at this period many other bishops [1568] in various parts of
   the empire highly celebrated for their sanctity and high
   qualifications, of whom Donatus, bishop of Euroea [1569] in Epirus,
   deserves to be particularly instanced. The inhabitants of the country
   relate many extraordinary miracles which he performed, of which the
   most celebrated seems to have been the destruction of a dragon of
   enormous size. It had stationed itself on the high road, at a place
   called Chamægephyræ and devoured sheep, goats, oxen, horses, and men.
   Donatus came upon this beast, attacked it unarmed, without sword,
   lance, or javelin; it raised its head, and was about to dash upon him,
   when Donatus made the sign of the cross with his finger in the air, and
   spat upon the dragon. The saliva entered its mouth, and it immediately
   expired. As it lay extended on the earth it did not appear inferior in
   size to the noted serpents of India. I have been informed that the
   people of the country yoked eight pair of oxen to transport the body to
   a neighboring field, where they burnt it, that it might not during the
   process of decomposition corrupt the air and generate disease. The tomb
   of this bishop is deposited in a magnificent house of prayer which
   bears his name. It is situated near a fountain of many waters, which
   God caused to rise from the ground in answer to his prayer, in an arid
   spot where no water had previously existed. For it is said that one
   day, when on a journey, he had to pass through this locality; and,
   perceiving that his companions were suffering from thirst, he moved the
   soil with his hands and engaged in prayer; before his prayer was
   concluded, a spring of water arose from the ground, which has never
   since been dried up. The inhabitants of Isoria, a village in the
   territory of Euroea, bear testimony to the truth of this narration.

   The church of Tomi, and indeed all the churches of Scythia, were at
   this period under the government of Theotimus, a Scythian. He had been
   brought up in the practice of philosophy; and his virtues had so won
   the admiration of the barbarian Huns, who dwelt on the banks of the
   Ister, that they called him the god of the Romans, for they had
   experience of divine deeds wrought by him. It is said that one day,
   when traveling toward the country of the barbarians, he perceived some
   of them advancing towards Tomi. His attendants burst forth into
   lamentations, and gave themselves up at once for lost; but he merely
   descended from horseback, and prayed. The consequence was, that the
   barbarians passed by without seeing him, his attendants, or the horses
   from which they had dismounted. As these tribes frequently devastated
   Scythia by their predatory incursions, he tried to subdue the ferocity
   of their disposition by presenting them with food and gifts. One of the
   barbarians hence concluded that he was a man of wealth, and,
   determining to take him prisoner, leaned upon his shield, as was his
   custom when parleying with his enemies; the man raised up his right
   hand in order to throw a rope, which he firmly grasped, over the
   bishop, for he intended to drag him away to his own country; but in the
   attempt, his hand remained extended in the air, and the barbarian was
   not released from his terrible bonds until his companions had implored
   Theotimus to intercede with God in his behalf.

   It is said that Theotimus always retained the long hair which he wore
   when he first devoted himself to the practice of philosophy. He was
   very temperate, had no stated hours for his repasts, but ate and drank
   when compelled to do so by the calls of hunger and of thirst. I
   consider it to be the part of a philosopher to yield to the demands of
   these appetites from necessity, and not from the love of sensual
   gratification.

   Chapter XXVII.--St. Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus, and a Particular
   Account of his Acts.

   Epiphanius was at this period at the head of the metropolitan church of
   Cyprus. [1570] He was celebrated, not only for the virtues he
   manifested and miraculous deeds during his life, but also for the honor
   that was rendered to him by God after his death; for it was said that
   demons were expelled, and diseases healed at his tomb. Many wonderful
   actions wrought while he lived are attributed to him, of which the
   following is one of the most remarkable that has come to our knowledge.
   He was extremely liberal towards the needy, either to those who had
   suffered from shipwreck or any other calamity; and after expending the
   whole of his own patrimony in the relief of such cases, he applied the
   treasures of the church to the same purpose. These treasures had been
   greatly increased by the donations of pious men of various provinces,
   who had been induced by their admiration of Epiphanius to entrust him
   with the distribution of their alms during their lives, or to bequeath
   their property to him for this purpose at their death. It is said that
   on one occasion the treasurer, who was a godly man, discovered that the
   revenues of the church had been nearly drained, and so little remained
   in the treasury that he considered it his duty to rebuke the bishop as
   a spendthrift. Epiphanius, however, having, notwithstanding these
   remonstrances, given away the small sum that had remained, a stranger
   went to the little house where the treasurer lived, and placed in his
   hands a bag containing many gold coins. Since neither the giver nor the
   sender was visible, it seemed very naturally miraculous, that in a gift
   of so much money a man should keep himself unknown; thus everybody
   thought it to be a Divine work.

   I desire also to relate another miracle that is attributed to
   Epiphanius. I have heard that a similar action has been related of
   Gregory, who formerly governed Neocæsarea; and I see no reason to doubt
   the veracity of the account; but it does not disprove the authenticity
   of the miracle attributed to Epiphanius. Peter, the apostle, was not
   the only man who raised another from the dead; John, the evangelist,
   wrought a similar miracle at Ephesus; as did likewise the daughters of
   Philip at Hierapolis. Similar actions have been performed in different
   ages by the men of God. The miracle which I wish to instance is the
   following. Two beggars having ascertained when Epiphanius would pass
   that way, agreed to extract a larger donation than usual from him by
   having recourse to stratagem. As soon as the bishop was seen
   approaching, one of the beggars flung himself on the ground and
   simulated death; the other stood by and uttered loud lamentations,
   deploring the loss of his companion, and his own poverty, which made
   him unable to procure sepulture for him. Epiphanius prayed to God that
   the deceased might rise in peace; he gave the survivor sufficient money
   for the interment, and said to the weeper, "Take measures, my son, for
   the burial of your companion, and weep no more; he cannot now arise
   from the dead; the calamity was inevitable, therefore you ought to bear
   it with resignation." Saying these words, the bishop departed from the
   spot. As soon as there was no one in sight, the beggar who had
   addressed Epiphanius touched the other with his foot, as he lay
   extended on the ground, and said to him, "You have well performed your
   part; arise now, for through your labor, we have a good provision for
   to-day." He, however, lay in the same way, neither heard any cry, nor
   perceived him who moved him with all his strength; the other beggar ran
   after the priest and confessed their artifice, and, with lamentations
   and tearing of his hair, he besought Epiphanius to restore his
   companion. Epiphanius merely exhorted him to submit with patience to
   the catastrophe, and sent him away. God did not undo what had happened,
   because, I feel persuaded, it was his design to show that those who
   practice deception on his servants are accounted as guilty of the fraud
   as if it had been perpetrated against Him who sees all, and who hears
   all.

   Chapter XXVIII.--Acacius, Bishop of Beroea, Zeno, and Ajax, Men
   Distinguished and Renowned for Virtue.

   The following details are also the results of inquiry. [1571] Acacius
   [1572] was conspicuous among the bishops; he had already previously
   administered the episcopate of Beroea in Syria. There are of course
   many actions of his, which are worthy of record. He was from his youth
   brought up to the profession of ascetic monasticism, and was rigid in
   observing all the regulations of this mode of life. When he was raised
   to the bishopric, he gave this evidence of greatest virtue, in that he
   kept the episcopal residence open at all hours of the day, so that the
   citizens and strangers were always free to visit him, even when he was
   at meals or at repose. This course of conduct is, in my opinion, very
   admirable; for either he was living in such a way as to be always sure
   of himself, or he devised this as a means of preparation against the
   evil in one's nature, so that in expecting to be caught by the sudden
   entrance of persons, it would be necessary for him to be on continuous
   guard, not to err in his duties, but rather to be engaged in covenanted
   acts.

   Zeno and Ajax, [1573] two celebrated brothers, flourished about the
   same period. They devoted themselves to a life of philosophy, but did
   not fix their abode as hermits in the desert, but at Gaza, a maritime
   city, which was also called Majuma. They both defended the truth of
   their religion with greatest fidelity, and confessed God with courage,
   so that they were frequently subjected to very cruel and harsh
   treatment by the pagans. It is said that Ajax married a very lovely
   woman, and after he had known her thrice in all that time, had three
   sons; and that subsequently he held no further intercourse with her,
   but persevered in the exercises of monasticism. He brought up two of
   his sons to the divine life and celibacy, and the third he permitted to
   marry. He governed the church of Botolium with propriety and
   distinction.

   Zeno, who had from his youth renounced the world and marriage,
   persevered in steadfast adherence to the service of God. It is said,
   and I myself am witness of the truth of the assertion, that when he was
   bishop of the church in Majuma, he was never absent at morning or
   evening hymns, or any other worship of God, unless attacked by some
   malady; and yet he was at this period an old man, being nearly a
   hundred years of age. He continued his course of life in the monastic
   philosophy, but, by pursuing his trade of weaving linen, continued to
   earn the means of supplying his own wants and of providing for others.
   He never deviated from this course of conduct till the close of his
   life, although he exceeded all the other priests of that province in
   age; and although he presided over the people and property of the
   largest church.

   I have mentioned these as examples of those who served as priests at
   this period. It would be a task to enumerate all where the main part of
   them were good, and God bore testimony to their lives by readily
   hearing their prayers and by working many miracles.

   Chapter XXIX.--Discovery of the Remains of the Prophets Habakkuk and
   Micah. Death of the Emperor Theodosius the Great.

   While the Church everywhere was under the sway of these eminent men,
   the clergy and people were excited to the imitation of their virtue and
   zeal. Nor was the Church of this era distinguished only by these
   illustrious examples of piety; for the relics of the proto-prophets,
   [1574] Habakkuk, and a little while after, Micah, were brought to light
   about this time. As I understand, God made known the place where both
   these bodies were deposited by a divine vision in a dream to Zebennus,
   who was then acting as bishop of the church of Eleutheropolis. The
   relics of Habakkuk were found at Cela, a city formerly called Ceila.
   The tomb of Micah was discovered at a distance of ten stadia from Cela,
   at a place called Berathsatia. [1575] This tomb was ignorantly styled
   by the people of the country, "the tomb of the faithful"; or, in their
   native language, Nephsameemana. These events, which occurred during the
   reign of Theodosius, were sufficient for the good repute of the
   Christian religion.

   After conquering Eugenius, [1576] Theodosius the emperor remained for
   some time at Milan, and here he was attacked with a serious malady. He
   recalled to mind the prediction of the monk, John, and conjectured that
   his sickness was unto death. He sent in haste for his son Honorius from
   Constantinople; and on seeing him by, he seemed to be easier, so that
   he was able to be present at the sports of the Hippodrome. After
   dinner, however, he suddenly grew worse, and sent to desire his son to
   preside at the spectacle. He died on the following night. This event
   happened during the consulate of the brothers Olybrius and Probianus.

   Chapter I.--Successors of Theodosius the Great. Rufinus, the Prætorian
   Prefect, is Slain. The Chief Priests of the Principal Cities.
   Differences among the Heretics. Account of Sisinius, Bishop of the
   Novatians.

   Such was the death of Theodosius, who had contributed so efficiently to
   the aggrandizement of the Church. [1578] He expired in the sixtieth
   year of his age, and the sixteenth of his reign. He left his two sons
   as his successors. Arcadius, the elder, reigned in the East, and
   Honorius in the West. They both held the same religious sentiments as
   their father.

   Damasus was dead; and at this period Siricius was the leader of the
   church of Rome; Nectarius, of the church in Constantinople; Theophilus,
   over the church of Alexandria; Flavian, over the church of Antioch; and
   John, over that of Jerusalem. Armenia and the Eastern provinces were at
   this time overrun by the barbarian Huns. [1579] Rufinus, prefect of the
   East, was suspected of having clandestinely invited them to devastate
   the Roman territories, in furtherance of his own ambitious designs; for
   he was said to aspire to tyranny. For this reason, he was soon after
   slain; for, on the return of the troops from the conquest of Eugenius,
   the Emperor Arcadius, according to custom, went forth from
   Constantinople to meet them; and the soldiers took this opportunity to
   massacre Rufinus. These circumstances tended greatly to the extension
   of religion. The emperors attributed to the piety of their father, the
   ease with which the tyrant had been vanquished, and the plot of Rufinus
   to gain their government arrested; and they readily confirmed all the
   laws which had been enacted by their predecessors in favor of the
   churches, and bestowed their own gifts in addition. Their subjects
   profited by their example, so that even the pagans were converted
   without difficulty to Christianity, and the heretics united themselves
   to the Catholic Church.

   Owing to the disputes which had arisen among the Arians and Eunomians,
   and to which I have already alluded, these heretics daily diminished in
   number. Many of them, in reflecting upon the diversity of sentiments
   which prevailed among those of their own persuasion, judged that the
   truth of God could not be present with them, and went over to those who
   held the same faith as the emperors.

   The interests of the Macedonians of Constantinople were materially
   affected by their possessing no bishop in that juncture; for, ever
   since they had been deprived of their churches by Eudoxius, under the
   reign of Constantius, they had been governed only by presbyters, and
   remained so until the next reign. The Novatians, on the other hand,
   although they had been agitated by the controversy concerning the
   Passover, which was an innovation made by Sabbatius, yet the most of
   them remained in quiet possession of their churches, and had not been
   molested by any of the punishments or laws enacted against other
   heretics, because they maintained that the Three Persons of the Trinity
   are of the same substance. The virtue of their leaders also tended
   greatly to the maintenance of concord among them. After the presidency
   of Agelius they were governed by Marcian, a good man; and on his
   decease, [1580] a little while before the time now under consideration,
   the bishopric devolved upon Sisinius, [1581] a very eloquent man, well
   versed in the doctrines of philosophy and of the Holy Scriptures, and
   so expert in disputation that even Eunomius, who was well approved in
   this art and effective in this work, often refused to hold debates with
   him. His course of life was prudent and above the reach of calumny; yet
   he indulged in luxury, and even in superfluities; so that those who
   knew him not were incredulous as to whether he could remain temperate
   in the midst of so much abundance. His manners were gracious and suave
   in assemblies, and on this account he was esteemed by the bishops of
   the Catholic Church, by the rulers, and by the learned. His jests were
   replete with good nature, and he could bear ridicule without
   manifesting the least resentment. He was very prompt and witty in his
   rejoinders. Being once asked wherefore, as he was bishop, he bathed
   twice daily, he replied, "Because I do not bathe thrice." On another
   occasion, being ridiculed by a member of the Catholic Church because he
   dressed in white, he asked where it was commanded that he should dress
   in black; and, as the other hesitated for a reply, he continued, "You
   can give no argument in support of your position; but I refer you to
   Solomon, the wisest of men, who says, Let your garments be always
   white.' Moreover Christ is described in the Gospel as having appeared
   in white, and Moses and Elias manifested themselves to the apostles in
   robes of white." It appears to me that the following reply was also
   very ingenious. Leontius, bishop of Ancyra, in Galatia, settled in
   Constantinople after he had deprived the Novatians in his province of
   their churches. Sisinius went to him to request that the churches might
   be restored; but far from yielding compliance, he reviled the
   Novatians, and said that they were not worthy of holding churches,
   because, by abolishing the observance of penance, they intercepted the
   philanthropy of God. To this Sisinius replied, "No one does penance as
   I do." Leontius asked him in what way he did penance. "In coming to see
   you," retorted Sisinius. Many other witty speeches are attributed to
   him, and he is even said to have written several works with some
   elegance. But his discourses obtained greater applause than his
   writings, since he was best at declamation, and was capable of
   attracting the hearer by his voice and look and pleasing countenance.
   This brief description may serve as a proof of the disposition and mode
   of life of this great man.

   Chapter II.--Education, Training, Conduct, and Wisdom of the Great John
   Chrysostom; his Promotion to the See; Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria,
   becomes his Confirmed Opponent.

   Nectarius died about this period, [1582] and lengthened debates were
   held on the ordination of a successor. They all voted for different
   individuals, and it seemed impossible for all to unite on one, and the
   time passed heavily. There was, however, at Antioch on the Orontes, a
   certain presbyter named John, a man of noble birth and of exemplary
   life, and possessed of such wonderful powers of eloquence and
   persuasion that he was declared by the sophist, Libanius the Syrian, to
   surpass all the orators of the age. When this sophist was on his
   death-bed he was asked by his friends who should take his place. "It
   would have been John," replied he, "had not the Christians taken him
   from us." Many of those who heard the discourses of John in the church
   were thereby excited to the love of virtue and to the reception of his
   own religious sentiments. [1583] For by living a divine life he
   imparted zeal from his own virtues to his hearers. He produced
   convictions similar to his own, because he did not enforce them by
   rhetorical art and strength, but expounded the sacred books with truth
   and sincerity. For a word which is ornamented by deeds customarily
   shows itself as worthy of belief; but without these the speaker appears
   as an impostor and a traitor to his own words, even though he teach
   earnestly. Approbation in both regards was due to John. He devoted
   himself to a prudent course of life and to a severe public career,
   while he also used a clear diction, united with brilliance in speech.

   His natural abilities were excellent, and he improved them by studying
   under the best masters. He learned rhetoric from Libanius, and
   philosophy from Andragathius. When it was expected that he would
   embrace the legal profession and take part in the career of an
   advocate, he determined to exercise himself in the sacred books and to
   practice philosophy according to the law of the Church. He had as
   teachers of this philosophy, Carterius and Diodorus, two celebrated
   presidents of ascetic institutions. Diodorus was afterwards the
   governor of the church of Tarsus, and, I have been informed, left many
   books of his own writings in which he explained the significance of the
   sacred words and avoided allegory. John did not receive the
   instructions of these men by himself, but persuaded Theodore and
   Maximus, who had been his companions under the instruction of Libanius,
   to accompany him. Maximus afterwards became bishop of Seleucia, in
   Isauria; and Theodore, bishop of Mompsuestia, in Cilicia. Theodore was
   well conversant with the sacred books and with the rest of the
   discipline of rhetoricians and philosophers. After studying the
   ecclesiastical laws, and frequenting the society of holy men, he was
   filled with admiration of the ascetic mode of life and condemned city
   life. He did not persevere in the same purpose, but after changing it,
   he was drawn to his former course of life; and, to justify his conduct,
   cited many examples from ancient history, with which he was well
   acquainted, and went back into the city. On hearing that he was engaged
   in business and intent on marriage, John composed an epistle, [1584]
   more divine in language and thought than the mind of man could produce,
   and sent it to him. Upon reading it, he repented and immediately gave
   up his possessions, renounced his intention of marrying, and was saved
   by the advice of John, and returned to the philosophic career. This
   seems to me a remarkable instance of the power of John's eloquence; for
   he readily forced conviction on the mind of one who was himself
   habituated to persuade and convince others. By the same eloquence, John
   attracted the admiration of the people; while he strenuously convicted
   sinners even in the churches, and antagonized with boldness all acts of
   injustice, as if they had been perpetrated against himself. This
   boldness pleased the people, but grieved the wealthy and the powerful,
   who were guilty of most of the vices which he denounced.

   Being, then, held in such high estimation by those who knew him by
   experience, and by those who were acquainted with him through the
   reports of others, John was adjudged worthy, in word and in deed, by
   all the subjects of the Roman Empire, to be the bishop of the church of
   Constantinople. The clergy and people were unanimous in electing him;
   their choice was approved by the emperor, who also sent the embassy
   which should conduct him; and, to confer greater solemnity on his
   ordination, a council was convened. Not long after the letter of the
   emperor reached Asterius, the general of the East; he sent to desire
   John to repair to him, as if he had need of him. On his arrival, he at
   once made him get into his chariot, and conveyed him with dispatch to a
   military station, Pagras so-called, where he delivered him to the
   officers whom the emperor had sent in quest of him. Asterius acted very
   prudently in sending for John before the citizens of Antioch knew what
   was about to occur; for they would probably have excited a sedition,
   and have inflicted injury on others, or subjected themselves to acts of
   violence, rather than have suffered John to be taken from them.

   When John had arrived at Constantinople, and when the priests were
   assembled together, Theophilus opposed his ordination; and proposed as
   a candidate in his stead, a presbyter of his church named Isidore, who
   took charge of strangers and of the poor at Alexandria. I have been
   informed by persons who were acquainted with Isidore, that from his
   youth upwards he practiced the philosophic virtues, near Scetis. Others
   say that he had gained the friendship of Theophilus by being a
   participant and a familiar in a very perilous undertaking. For it is
   reported that during the war against Maximus, Theophilus intrusted
   Isidore with gifts and letters respectively addressed to the emperor
   and to the tyrant, and sent him to Rome, desiring him to remain there
   until the termination of the war, when he was to deliver the gifts,
   with the letters, to him, who might prove the victor. Isidore acted
   according to his instructions, but the artifice was detected; and,
   fearful of being arrested, he fled to Alexandria. Theophilus from that
   period evinced much attachment towards him, and, with a view of
   recompensing his services, strove to raise him to the bishopric of
   Constantinople. But whether there was really any truth in this report,
   or whether Theophilus desired to ordain this man because of his
   excellence, it is certain that he eventually yielded to those who
   decided for John. [1585] He feared Eutropius, who was artfully eager
   for this ordination. Eutropius then presided over the imperial house,
   and they say he threatened Theophilus, that unless he would vote with
   the other bishops, he would have to defend himself against those who
   desired to accuse him; for many written accusations against him were at
   that time before the council.

   Vehement Grappling with its Affairs. He re-establishes Discipline in
   the Churches everywhere. By sending an Embassy to Rome, he abolished
   the Hostility to Flavian.

   As soon as John was raised to the episcopal dignity, he devoted his
   attention first to the reformation of the lives of his clergy; [1586]
   he reproved and amended their ways and diet and every procedure of
   their manifold transactions. He also ejected some of the clergy from
   the Church. He was naturally disposed to reprehend the misconduct of
   others, and to antagonize righteously those who acted unjustly; and he
   gave way to these characteristics still more in the episcopate; for his
   nature, having attained power, led his tongue to reproof, and nerved
   his wrath more readily against the enemy. He did not confine his
   efforts to the reformation of his own church; but as a good and
   large-minded man, he sought to rectify abuses throughout the world.
   Immediately upon entering the episcopate, he strove to put an end to
   the dissension which had arisen concerning Paulinus, between the
   Western and Egyptian bishops and the bishops of the East; since on this
   account a general disunion was overpowering the churches in the whole
   empire. He requested the assistance of Theophilus in effecting the
   reconciliation of Flavian with the bishop of Rome. [1587] Theophilus
   agreed to co-operate with him in the restoration of concord; and
   Acacius, bishop of Berea, and Isidore, whom Theophilus had proposed as
   a candidate for ordination instead of John, were sent on an embassy to
   Rome. They soon effected the object of their journey, and sailed back
   to Egypt. Acacius repaired to Syria, bearing conciliatory letters to
   the adherents of Flavian from the priests of Egypt and of the West. And
   the churches, after a long delay once more laid aside their discord,
   and took up communion with one another. The people at Antioch, who were
   called Eustathians, continued, indeed, for some time to hold separate
   assemblies, although they possessed no bishop. Evagrius, the successor
   of Paulinus, did not, as we have stated, long survive him; and I think
   reconciliation became easier for the bishops from there being no one to
   oppose. The laity, as is customary with the populace, gradually went
   over to those who assembled together under the guidance of Flavian; and
   thus, in course of time, they were more and more united.

   Chapter IV.--Enterprise of Gaïnas, the Gothic Barbarian. Evils which he
   perpetrated.

   A barbarian, named Gaïnas, [1588] who had taken refuge among the
   Romans, and who had risen from the lowest ranks of the army to military
   command, formed a design to usurp the throne of the Roman Empire. With
   this in view, he sent for his countrymen, the Goths, from their own
   homes to come to the Roman territories, and appointed his relatives to
   be tribunes and chiliarchs. Tirbingilus, a relative of his, who
   commanded a large body of troops in Phrygia, commenced an insurrection;
   and to all persons of judgment it was patent that he was preparing the
   way. Under the pretext of resenting the devastation of many of the
   Phrygian cities, which had been committed to his superintendence,
   Gaïnas turned to their assistance; but on his arrival, when a multitude
   of barbarians had been equipped for war, he disclosed his plan which he
   had previously concealed, and pillaged the cities which he had been
   commanded to guard, and was about to attack others. He then proceeded
   to Bithynia, and encamped in the boundaries of Chalcedon, and
   threatened war. The cities of the East of Asia, and as many as lived
   between these regions and about the Euxine, being thus in danger, the
   emperor and his counsellors judged that it would not be safe to venture
   into any hazardous undertaking without preparation against men who were
   already desperate; for the emperor declared that he was ready to be
   favorable to him in every point, and sent to Gaïnas to offer him
   whatever he might demand.

   Gaïnas requested that two consuls, named Saturninus and Aurelian, whom
   he suspected of being inimical, should be delivered up to him; and when
   they were in his power, he pardoned them. He afterwards held a
   conference with the emperor near Chalcedon, in the house of prayer in
   which the tomb of Euphemia the martyr is deposited; and after he and
   the emperor had mutually bound themselves by vows of friendship to each
   other, he threw down his arms, and repaired to Constantinople, where,
   by an imperial edict, he was appointed general of the infantry and
   cavalry. Prosperity so far beyond his deserts was more than he could
   bear with moderation; and as, contrary to all expectations, he had
   succeeded so wonderfully in his former enterprise, he determined to
   undermine the peace of the Catholic Church. He was a Christian, and,
   like the rest of the barbarians, had espoused the Arian heresy. Urged
   either by the presidents of this party, or by the suggestions of his
   own ambition, he applied to the emperor to place one of the churches of
   the city in the hands of the Arians. He represented that it was neither
   just nor proper that, while he was general of the Roman troops, he
   should be compelled to retire without the walls of the city when he
   wished to engage in prayer. John did not remain inactive when made
   acquainted with these proceedings. He assembled all the bishops who
   were then residing in the city, and went with them to the palace. He
   spoke at great length in the presence of the emperor and of Gaïnas,
   reproached the latter with being a stranger and a fugitive, and
   reminded him that his life had been saved by the father of the emperor,
   to whom he had sworn fidelity, as likewise to his children, to the
   Romans, and to the laws which he was striving to make powerless. When
   he had made this speech he showed the law which Theodosius had
   established, forbidding the heterodox to hold a church within the
   walls. Then, addressing himself to the emperor, John exhorted him to
   maintain the laws which had been established against heretics; and told
   him that it would be better to be deprived of the empire, than to be
   guilty of impiety by becoming a traitor to the house of God. Thus did
   John speak boldly like a man, and gave no place to innovation in the
   churches under his care. Gaïnas, however, regardless of his oaths,
   attacked the city. His enterprise was pre-announced by the appearance
   of a comet directly over the city; this comet was of extraordinary
   magnitude, larger, it is said, than any that had previously been seen,
   and reaching almost to the earth itself. Gaïnas intended to seize first
   upon the stores of the bankers, and hoped to collect together their
   enormous wealth. But since the rumor of his plan was spread, the
   bankers concealed their ready wealth and no longer set forth silver
   upon the tables, as they were wont publicly to do. Gaïnas then sent
   some of the barbarians by night to set fire to the palace; but they
   were unskillful and overcome with fear, so they turned back. For when
   they drew near the edifice, they fancied that they saw a multitude of
   heavily armed men of immense stature, and they returned to inform
   Gaïnas that fresh troops had just arrived. Gaïnas disbelieved their
   report, for he was confident that no troops had entered the city. As,
   however, other individuals whom he despatched to the palace for the
   same purpose, on the following night, returned with the same report, he
   went out himself to be an eye-witness of the extraordinary spectacle.
   Imagining that the army before him consisted of soldiers who had been
   withdrawn from other cities, and that these troops protected the city
   and palace by night and concealed themselves by day, Gaïnas feigned to
   be possessed of a demon; and under the pretext of offering up a prayer,
   went to the church which the father of the emperor had erected in honor
   of John the Baptist, at Hebdomos. Some of the barbarians remained in
   Constantinople, and others accompanied Gaïnas; they secretly carried
   arms and pots full of darts in the women's chariots, but when they were
   discovered, they slew the guard at the gates, who attempted to hinder
   the carrying out of the arms. From this the city was filled with as
   much confusion and uproar, as if it had suddenly been captured. A good
   thought ruled this terrible moment; for the emperor without delay
   declared Gaïnas a public enemy, and commanded that all the barbarians
   left in the city should be slain. No sooner was this mandate issued,
   than the soldiers rushed upon the barbarians, and slew the greater
   number of them; they then set fire to the church which was named after
   the Goths; for as was customary, they had congregated there in the
   house of prayer, because there was no other refuge, since the gates
   were shut. On hearing of this calamity, Gaïnas passed through Thrace,
   and proceeded towards the Cherronesus, intending to cross the
   Hellespont; for he thought that if he could conquer the opposite coast
   of Asia, he could easily subjugate to himself all the provinces of the
   empire in the East. All these things proved contrary to his hopes,
   because the Romans were there favored by Divine power. For the army
   sent by the emperor was on hand by land and by sea, under the command
   of Flavita, who although a barbarian by birth, was a good man, and an
   able general. The barbarians, having no ships, imprudently attempted to
   cross the Hellespont to the opposite continent on rafts; when suddenly
   a great wind blew and violently separated them, and drove them against
   the Roman vessels. The greater part of the barbarians and their horses
   were drowned; but many were slain by the military. Gaïnas, however,
   with a few of his followers escaped; but not long after, when fleeing
   through Thrace, they fell in with another detachment of the Roman army,
   and Gaïnas, with all his barbarians, perished. Such was the termination
   of the daring schemes and life of Gaïnas.

   Flavita had rendered himself very conspicuous in this war, and was
   therefore appointed consul. [1589] During his consulate, and that of
   Vincentius, a son was born to the emperor. The young prince was named
   after his grandfather, and at the commencement of the next consulate,
   [1590] was proclaimed Augustus.

   Chapter V.--John swayed the People by his Teachings. Concerning the
   Woman, a Follower of Macedonius, on account of whom the Bread was
   turned into a Stone.

   John governed the church of Constantinople with exemplary prudence, and
   induced many of the pagans and of the heretics to unite themselves with
   him. [1591] Crowds of people daily resorted to him; some for the
   purpose of being edified by listening to his discourses, and others
   with the intention of tempting him. He, however, pleased and attracted
   all classes, and led them to embrace the same religious sentiments as
   himself. As the people pressed around him, and could not get enough of
   his words, so that when they were pushed hither and yon, and were
   pressing one another, they incurred danger; and each one was forcing
   his way to go farther, so that by standing near, he might hear more
   accurately what John was saying, he placed himself in the midst of them
   upon the platform of the readers, and, having taken a seat, taught the
   multitude. It seems to me that this is a suitable place in my history
   for the insertion of the account of a miracle which was performed
   during the life of John. A certain man of the Macedonian heresy, lived
   with a wife of the same belief; he chanced to hear John discoursing
   concerning the opinion one ought to hold about the Divine nature; he
   was convinced by the argument he heard advanced, and strove to persuade
   his wife to embrace the same sentiments. Her previous habits of mind,
   and the conversation of other women of her acquaintance, deterred her
   from complying with his wishes; and, when he found that all his efforts
   to convince her were futile, he told her that, unless she would be of
   one mind with him on Divine subjects, she should not continue to live
   with him. The woman, therefore, promised to do as she was required;
   but, at the same time, she made known the matter to one of her servant
   maids, in whose fidelity she confided, and used her as an instrument in
   deceiving her husband. At the season of the celebration of the
   mysteries (the initiated will understand what I mean), this woman kept
   what was given to her and held down her head as if engaged in prayer.
   Her servant, who was standing behind her, placed in her hand a bit of
   bread which she had brought with her; but, as soon as she had placed it
   between her teeth, it was converted into stone. Since such a divine
   affair had happened to her, she was very fearful lest any further
   calamity should befall her, and ran to the bishop, and confessed on
   herself. She showed him the stone, which bore the marks of her teeth;
   it was composed of some unknown substance, and was marked by a very
   strange color. She implored forgiveness with tears, and continued ever
   after to hold the same religious tenets as her husband. If any person
   should consider this narrative incredible, he can inspect the stone in
   question; for it is still preserved in the treasury of the church of
   Constantinople.

   Chapter VI.--Proceedings of John in Asia and Phrygia. Heraclides,
   Bishop of Ephesus, and Gerontius, Bishop of Nicomedia.

   John [1592] having been informed that the churches in Asia and the
   neighborhood were governed by unworthy persons, and that they bartered
   the priesthood for the incomes and gifts received, or bestowed that
   dignity as a matter of private favor, repaired to Ephesus, and deposed
   thirteen bishops, some in Lycia and Phrygia, and others in Asia itself,
   and appointed others in their stead. The bishop of Ephesus was dead,
   and he therefore ordained Heraclides over the church. Heraclides was a
   native of Cyprus, and was one of the deacons under John: he had
   formerly joined the monks at Scetis, and had been the disciple of the
   monk Evagrius. John also expelled Gerontius, bishop of the church in
   Nicomedia. This latter was a deacon under Ambrosius, of the church of
   Milan; he declared, I do not know why, either with an intention to
   invent a miracle, or because he had been himself deceived by the art
   and phantasms of a demon, that he had seized something resembling an
   ass (onoskelis) by night, had cut off its head, and flung it into a
   grinding-house. Ambrose regarded this mode of discourse as unworthy of
   a deacon of God, and commanded Gerontius to remain in seclusion until
   he had expiated his fault by repentance. Gerontius, however, was a very
   skillful physician; he was eloquent and persuasive, and knew well how
   to gain friends; he therefore ridiculed the command of Ambrose, and
   repaired to Constantinople. In a short time he obtained the friendship
   of some of the most powerful men at court; and, not long after, was
   elevated to the bishopric of Nicomedia. He was ordained by Helladius,
   bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, who performed this office the more
   readily for him, because he had been instrumental, through his interest
   at court, in obtaining high appointment in the army for that
   functionary's son. When Ambrose heard of this ordination, he wrote to
   Nectarius, the president of the church of Constantinople, desiring him
   to eject Gerontius from the priesthood, and not permit him and the
   ecclesiastical order to be so abused. However desirous Nectarius might
   have been to obey this injunction, he could never succeed carrying it
   into effect, owing to the determined resistance of the people of
   Nicomedia. John deposed Gerontius, and ordained Pansophius, who had
   formerly been preceptor to the wife of the emperor, and who, though a
   man of decided piety and of a mild and gentle disposition, was not
   liked by the Nicomedians. They arose in frequent sedition, and
   enumerated publicly and privately the beneficence of Gerontius, and on
   the liberal advantage derived from his science, and its generous and
   active use for the rich and poor alike; and as is usual when we applaud
   those we love, they ascribed many other virtues to him. They went about
   the streets of their own city and Constantinople as if some earthquake,
   or pestilence, or other visitation of Divine wrath had occurred, and
   sang psalms, and offered supplications that they might have Gerontius
   for their bishop. They were at length compelled to yield to necessity,
   and parted with grief and groans from Gerontius, receiving in his stead
   a bishop whom they regarded with fear and aversion. The bishops who had
   been deposed and all their followers declaimed against John, as the
   leader of a revolution in the churches, and as changing the rights of
   the ordained, contrary to the ancestral laws; and under the influence
   of their grievance, they condemned deeds done by him, which were worthy
   of praise according to the opinion of most people. Among other matters,
   they reproached him with the proceedings that had been taken against
   Eutropius.

   Chapter VII.--Concerning Eutropius, Chief of the Eunuchs, and the Law
   enacted by him. On being turned from the Church, he was put to Death.
   Murmurs against John.

   Eutropius was originally the chief of the eunuchs, and was the first
   and only person of that rank of whom we have known or heard who
   attained the consular and patrician dignity. [1593] When he was raised
   to present power, he thought not of the future, nor of the instability
   of human affairs, but caused those who sought an asylum in churches to
   be thrust out. He treated Pentadia, the wife of Timasius, in this
   manner. Timasius was a general in the army, capable and much feared;
   but Eutropius procured an edict for his banishment to Pasis in Egypt,
   under the pretext that he aspired to tyranny. I have been informed that
   Timasius fell a victim to thirst, or dreading lest anything worse might
   be in store, he was caught in the sands there, and was found dead.
   Eutropius issued a law, enacting that no one should seek refuge in
   churches, and that those who had already fled thither should be driven
   out. He was, however, the first to transgress this law; for not long
   after its enactment, he offended the empress, and immediately left the
   palace, and fled to the Church as a suppliant. While he was lying
   beneath the table, John pronounced a discourse, in which he reprehended
   the pride of power, and directed the attention of the people to the
   instability of human greatness. The enemies of John hence took occasion
   to cast reproach on him, because he had rebuked instead of
   compassionating, one who was suffering under the calamities of adverse
   fortunes. Eutropius soon after paid the penalty of his impious plan,
   and was beheaded; and the law which he had enacted was effaced from the
   public inscriptions. The wrath of God having been thus promptly visited
   on the injustice that had been perpetrated against the Church,
   prosperity was restored to it, and there was an increase in the Divine
   worship. The people of Constantinople were more sedulous then than
   before, in attendance at the singing of the morning and evening hymns.

   Chapter VIII.--Antiphonal Hymns against the Arians introduced by John.
   The Interests of the Orthodox are much augmented by the Teachings of
   John, while the Wealthy are More and More Enraged.

   The Arians, having been deprived of their churches in Constantinople
   during the reign of Theodosius, held their churches without the walls
   of the city. [1594] They previously assembled by night in the public
   porticoes, and were divided into bands, so that they sang antiphonally,
   for they had composed certain refrains which reflected their own dogma,
   and at the break of day marched in procession, singing these hymns, to
   the places in which they held their churches. They proceeded in this
   manner on all solemn festivals, and on the first and last days of the
   week. The sentiments propounded in these odes were such as were likely
   to engender disputes. As, for instance, the following: "Where are those
   who say that the Three Persons constitute one Power?" Other similar
   acrimonious observations were interspersed throughout their
   compositions. John was fearful lest any of his own church people should
   be led astray by witnessing these exhibitions, and therefore commanded
   them to sing hymns in the same manner. The orthodox became more
   distinguished, and in a short time surpassed the opposing heretics in
   number and processions; for they had silver crosses and lighted wax
   tapers borne before them. The eunuch of the empress was appointed to
   regulate these processions, to pay the cost of whatever might be
   required, and to prepare hymns. Hence the Arians, impelled either by
   jealousy or revenge, attacked the members of the Catholic Church. Much
   bloodshed ensued on both sides. Briso (for this was the name of the
   imperial eunuch) was wounded on the forehead by a stone that was cast
   at him. The resentment of the emperor was kindled, and he put a stop to
   the Arian assemblies. Having commenced the custom of singing hymns in
   the manner and from the cause above stated, the members of the Catholic
   Church did not discontinue the practice, but have retained it to the
   present day. The institution of these processions and his services in
   the Church endeared John to the people; but he was hated by the clergy
   and the powerful on account of his free boldness, for he never failed
   to rebuke the clergy when he detected them in acts of injustice, nor to
   exhort the powerful to return to the practice of virtue when they
   abused their wealth, committed impiety, or yielded to voluptuousness.

   Chapter IX.--Serapion, the Archdeacon, and St. Olympias. Some of the
   Celebrated Men insolently bear down upon John, traducing him as
   Impracticable and Passionate.

   The enmity of the clergy against John was greatly increased by
   Serapion, his archdeacon. He was an Egyptian, naturally prone to anger,
   and always ready to insult his opponents. [1595] The feelings of
   hostility were further fostered by the counsel which Olympias received
   from John. Olympias was of most illustrious birth, and although she had
   become a widow while young, and was zealously attached to the exercises
   of monastic philosophy according to the laws of the church, yet
   Nectarius had ordained her as deaconess. John, perceiving that she
   bestowed her goods liberally on any one who asked her for them, and
   that she despised everything but the service of God, said to her: "I
   applaud your intentions; but would have you know that those who aspire
   to the perfection of virtue according to God, ought to distribute their
   wealth with economy. You, however, have been bestowing wealth on the
   wealthy, which is as useless as if you had cast it into the sea. Know
   you not that you have voluntarily, for the sake of God, devoted all
   your possessions to the relief of the poor. You ought, therefore, to
   regard your wealth as belonging to your Master, and to remember that
   you have to account for its distribution. If you will be persuaded by
   me, you will in future regulate your donations according to the wants
   of those who solicit relief. You will thus be enabled to extend the
   sphere of your benevolence, and your mercy and most zealous care will
   receive reward from God."

   John had several disputes with many of the monks, particularly with
   Isaac. He highly commended those who remained in quietude in the
   monasteries and practiced philosophy there; he protected them from all
   injustice and solicitiously supplied whatever necessities they might
   have. But the monks who went out of doors and made their appearance in
   cities, he reproached and regarded as insulting philosophy. For these
   causes, he incurred the hatred of the clergy, and of many of the monks,
   who called him a hard, passionate, morose, and arrogant man. They
   therefore attempted to bring his life into public disrepute, by stating
   confidently, as if it were the truth, that he would eat with no one,
   and that he refused every invitation to a meal that was offered him. I
   know of no pretext that could have given rise to this assertion, except
   that, as I have been assured by a man of undoubted veracity, John had,
   by rigorous asceticism, rendered himself liable to pain in the head and
   stomach, and was thus prevented from being present at some of the
   choicest symposia. Hence, however, originated the greatest accusation
   that was ever devised against him.

   Chapter X.--Severian, Bishop of Gabales, and Antiochus, Bishop of
   Ptolemaïs. Dispute between Serapion and Severian. Reconciliation
   between them effected by the Empress.

   John likewise incurred the enmity of the empress, through the
   machinations of Severian, bishop of Gabali in Syria. [1596] Severian
   and Antiochus, bishop of Ptolemaïs, a city in Phoenicia, were both
   learned men, and well qualified to teach in the churches. Antiochus had
   so fine a voice and delivery that, by some persons, he was surnamed
   Chrysostom. Severian, on the other hand, had the harshness of the
   Syrians in his speech; but, in point of knowledge and the evidences of
   the Scriptures, he was considered superior to Antiochus. It appears
   that Antiochus was the first to visit Constantinople; he gained great
   applause by his discourses, amassed some property, and then returned to
   his own city. Severian followed his example, and went to
   Constantinople. He formed an intimacy with John, spoke frequently in
   the churches, and was admired. He was in honor, and became well known
   to many of those in power, and to the emperor and empress. When John
   went to Asia, he commended the Church to his care; for he was so far
   deceived by the adulation of Severian as to imagine him to be his
   zealous friend. Severian, however, thought only of gratifying his
   auditors, and of pleasing the people by his discourses. [1597] When
   John was apprised of this, he was filled with jealousy; and his
   resentment was further kindled, it is said, by the representations of
   Serapion. After the return of John from Asia, Serapion happened to see
   Severian passing; but, instead of rising to salute him, he kept his
   seat, in order to show his utter contempt for the man. Severian was
   offended by this manifestation of disrespect, and exclaimed, "If
   Serapion die a clergyman, then Christ was not incarnate." Serapion
   reported these words; and John, in consequence, expelled Severian from
   the city as insolent, and as a blaspheme against God; for witnesses
   were brought forward to attest that the above words had been really
   uttered by him. Some of the friends of Serapion even went so far as to
   suppress part of the speech of Severian, and to affirm that he had
   declared that Christ was not incarnate. John also rebuked Severian, by
   asking whether, "If Serapion should not die among the clergy, it would
   follow that Christ had not been incarnate?" As soon as the wife of the
   emperor was informed by the friends of Severian of what had occurred,
   she immediately sent for him from Chalcedon. John, notwithstanding all
   her remonstrances, positively refused to hold any intercourse with him,
   until the empress placed her son Theodosius on his knees in the church
   named after the apostles; then she entreated him persistently, and
   frequently adjured him, until John yielded a reluctant consent to
   receive Severian into friendship. Such are the accounts which I have
   received of these transactions. [1598]

   Chapter XI.--Question agitated in Egypt, as to whether God has a
   Corporeal Form. Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, and the Books of
   Origen.

   A question was at this period agitated in Egypt, which had been
   propounded a short time previously, namely, whether it is right to
   believe that God is anthropomorphic. [1599] Because they laid hold of
   the sacred words with simplicity and without any questioning, most of
   the monks of that part of the world were of this opinion; and supposed
   that God possessed eyes, a face, and hands, and other members of the
   bodily organization. But those who searched into the hidden meaning of
   the terms of Scripture held the opposite; and they maintained that
   those who denied the incorporeality of God were guilty of blasphemy.
   This later opinion was espoused by Theophilus, and preached by him in
   the church; and in the epistle [1600] which, according to custom, he
   wrote respecting the celebration of the passover, he took occasion to
   state that God ought to be regarded as incorporeal, as alien to a human
   form. When it was signified to the Egyptian monks that Theophilus had
   broached these sentiments, they went to Alexandria, assembled the
   people together in one place, excited a tumult, and determined upon
   slaying the bishop as an impious man. Theophilus, however, presented
   himself to the insurgents forthwith, and said to them, "When I look
   upon you, it is as if I beheld the face of God." This address
   sufficiently mollified the men; yielding their wrath, they replied,
   "Wherefore, then, if you really hold orthodox doctrines, do you not
   denounce the books of Origen; since those who read them are led into
   such opinions?" "Such has long been my intention," replied he, "and I
   shall do as you advise; for I blame not less than you do, all those who
   follow the doctrines of Origen." By these means he deluded the
   brethren, and broke up the sedition.

   Chapter XII.--About the Four Brothers, called "The Long," who were
   Ascetics, and of whom Theophilus was an Enemy; about Isidore and the
   Events which came about through these Four.

   The controversy would most likely have been terminated, had it not been
   renewed by Theophilus himself, from inimical feelings against Ammonius,
   Dioscorus, Eusebius, and Euthymius, who were called "the long." [1601]
   They were brothers; and, as we have before stated, became conspicuous
   among the philosophers at Scetis. They were at one period beloved by
   Theophilus above all the other monks of Egypt; he sought their society,
   and frequently dwelt with them. He even conferred on Dioscorus the
   bishopric of Hermopolis. He was confirmed in his hatred of them, on
   account of his enmity to Isidore, whom he had endeavored to ordain in
   Constantinople after Nectarius. Some say, that a woman, belonging to
   the Manichean heresy, had been converted to the faith of the Catholic
   Church; Theophilus rebuked the arch-presbyter (towards whom he had
   other reasons for entertaining resentful feeling), because he had
   admitted her to participate in the sacred mysteries before she had
   adjured her former heresy. Peter, for this was the name of the
   arch-presbyter, maintained that he had received the woman into
   communion according to the laws of the Church, and with the consent of
   Theophilus; and referred to Isidore, as a witness to the truth of what
   he had deposed. Isidore happened to be then at Rome on an embassy; but,
   on his return, he testified that the assertions of Peter were true.
   Theophilus resented this avowal as a calumny, and ejected both him and
   Peter from the Church. Such is the account given by some persons of the
   transaction. I have, however, heard it alleged, by a man of undoubted
   veracity, who was very intimate with the monks above mentioned, that
   the enmity of Theophilus towards Isidore originated from two causes.
   One of these causes was identical with that specified by Peter the
   presbyter, namely, that he had refused to attest the existence of a
   testament in which the inheritance was entailed on the sister of
   Theophilus; the other cause alleged by this individual was, that
   Isidore refused to give up certain moneys that had been confided to him
   for the relief of the poor, and which Theophilus wished to appropriate
   to the erection of churches; saying that it is better to restore the
   bodies of the suffering, which are more rightly to be considered the
   temples of God, and for which end the money had been furnished, than to
   build walls. But from whatever cause the enmity of Theophilus might
   have originated, Isidore, immediately after his excommunication, joined
   his former companions, the monks at Scetis. Ammonius, with a few
   others, then repaired to Theophilus, and entreated him to restore
   Isidore to communion. Theophilus readily promised to do as they
   requested; but as time passed away, and nothing more was effected for
   them, and it became evident that Theophilus was pretending, they again
   repaired to him, renewed their entreaties, and pressed him to be
   faithful to his engagement. Instead of complying, Theophilus thrust one
   of the monks into prison, for the purpose of intimidating the others.
   But he erred in this. Ammonius and all the monks with him then went to
   the prison, into which they were readily admitted by the jailer, who
   imagined that they had come to bring provisions to the prisoner; but
   having once obtained admission, they refused to leave the prison. When
   Theophilus heard of their voluntary confinement, he sent to desire them
   to come to him. They replied, that he ought first to take them out of
   prison himself, for it was not just, after having been subjected to
   public indignity, that they should be privately released from
   confinement. At length, however, they yielded and went to him.
   Theophilus apologized for what had occurred, and dismissed them as if
   he had no further intention of molesting them; but by himself, he
   champed and was vexed, and determined to do them ill. He was in doubt,
   however, as to how he could ill-treat them, as they had no possessions,
   and despised everything but philosophy, until it occurred to him, to
   disturb the peace of their retirement. From his former intercourse with
   them he had gathered that they blamed those who believe that God has a
   human form, and that they adhered to the opinions of Origen; he brought
   them into collision with the multitude of monks who maintained the
   other view. A terrible contention prevailed among the monks, for they
   did not think it worth while to persuade one another by flaming
   arguments for themselves in an orderly way, but settled down into
   insults. They gave the name of Origenists to those who maintained the
   incorporeality of the Deity, while those who held the opposite opinion
   were called Anthropomorphists.

   Chapter XIII.--These Four repair to John on account of his Interest;
   for this Reason, Theophilus was enraged, and prepares himself to fight
   against John.

   Dioscorus, Ammonius, and the other monks, having discovered the
   machinations of Theophilus, retired to Jerusalem, and thence proceeded
   to Scythopolis; for they thought that it would be an advantageous
   residence there for them on account of the many palms, whose leaves are
   used by the monks for their customary work. [1602] Dioscorus and
   Ammonius were accompanied hither by about eighty other monks. In the
   meantime, Theophilus sent messengers to Constantinople, to prefer
   complaints against them, and to oppose any petitions that they might
   lay before the emperor. On being informed of this fact, Ammonius and
   the monks embarked for Constantinople, and took Isidore with them; and
   they requested that their cause might be tried in the presence of the
   emperor and of the bishop; for they thought that, by reason of his
   boldness, John, who was careful to do right, would be able to help them
   in their rights. John, although he received them with kindness, and
   treated them with honor, and did not forbid them to pray in the church,
   refused to admit them to participation in the mysteries, for it was not
   lawful to do this before the investigation. He wrote to Theophilus,
   desiring him to receive them back into communion, as their sentiments
   concerning the Divine nature were orthodox; requesting him, if he
   regarded their orthodoxy as doubtful, to send some one to act as their
   accuser. Theophilus returned no reply to this epistle. Some time
   subsequently, Ammonius and his companions presented themselves before
   the wife of the emperor, as she was riding out, and complained of the
   machinations of Theophilus against them. She knew what had been plotted
   against them; and she stood up in honor of them; and, leaning forward
   from her royal chariot, she nodded, and said to them, "Pray for the
   emperor, for me, for our children, and for the empire. For my part, I
   shall shortly cause a council to be convened, to which Theophilus shall
   be summoned." A false report having prevailed in Alexandria, that John
   had received Dioscorus and his companions into communion, and had
   afforded them every aid and encouragement in his power, Theophilus
   began to reflect upon what measures it would be possible to adopt in
   order to eject John from his episcopate.

   Chapter XIV.--Perversity of Theophilus. St. Epiphanius: his Residence
   at Constantinople and Preparation to excite the People against John.

   Theophilus kept his designs against John as secret as possible; and
   wrote to the bishops of every city, condemning the books of Origen.
   [1603] It also occurred to him that it would be advantageous to enlist
   Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis, in Cyprus, on his side, a man who was
   revered for his life, and was the most distinguished of his
   contemporaries; and he therefore formed a friendship with him, although
   he had formerly blamed him for asserting that God possessed a human
   form. As if repentant of having ever entertained any other sentiment,
   Theophilus wrote to Epiphanius to acquaint him that he now held the
   same opinions as himself, and to move attacks against the books of
   Origen, as the source of such nefarious dogmas. Epiphanius had long
   regarded the writings of Origen with peculiar aversion, and was
   therefore easily led to attach credit to the epistle of Theophilus. He
   soon after assembled the bishops of Cyprus together, and prohibited the
   examination of the books of Origen. He also wrote to the other bishops,
   and, among others, to the bishop of Constantinople, exhorting them to
   convene synods, and to make the same decision. Theophilus, perceiving
   that there could be no danger in following the example of Epiphanius,
   who was the object of popular praise, and who was admired for the
   virtue of his life, whatever his opinion might be, passed a vote
   similar to that of Epiphanius, with the concurrence of the bishops
   under his jurisdiction. John, on the other hand, paid little attention
   to the letters of Epiphanius and Theophilus. Those among the powerful
   and the clergy, who were opposed to him, perceived that the designs of
   Theophilus tended to his ejection from the bishopric, and therefore
   endeavored to procure the convention of a council in Constantinople, in
   order to carry this measure into execution. Theophilus, knowing this,
   exerted himself to the utmost in convening this council. He commanded
   the bishops of Egypt to repair by sea to Constantinople; he wrote to
   request Epiphanius and the other Eastern bishops to proceed to that
   city with as little delay as possible, and he himself set off on the
   journey thither by land. Epiphanius was the first to sail from Cyprus;
   he landed at Hebdomos, a suburb of Constantinople; and after having
   prayed in the church erected at that place, he proceeded to enter the
   city. In order to do him honor, John went out with all his clergy to
   meet him. Epiphanius, however, evinced clearly by his conduct that he
   believed the accusations against John; for, although invited to reside
   in the ecclesiastical residences, he would not continue there, and
   refused to meet with John in them. He also privately assembled all the
   bishops who were residing in Constantinople, and showed them the
   decrees which he had issued against the discourses of Origen. He
   persuaded some of the bishops to approve of these decrees, while others
   objected to them. Theotimus, bishop of Scythia, strongly opposed the
   proceedings of Epiphanius, and told him that it was not right to cast
   insult on the memory of one who had long been numbered with the dead;
   nor was it without blasphemy to assail the conclusion to which the
   ancients had arrived on the subject, and to set aside their decisions.
   While discoursing in this strain, he drew forth a book of Origen's
   which he had brought with him; and, after reading aloud a passage
   conducive to the education of the Church, he remarked that those who
   condemned such sentiments acted absurdly, for they were in danger of
   insulting the subjects themselves about which these words treated. John
   still had respect for Epiphanius, and invited him to join in the
   meetings of his church, and to dwell with him. But Epiphanius declared
   that he would neither reside with John nor pray with him publicly,
   unless he would denounce the works of Origen and expel Dioscorus and
   his companions. Not considering it just to act in the manner proposed
   until judgment had been passed on the case, John tried to postpone
   matters. When the assembly was about to be held in the Church of the
   Apostles, those ill-disposed to John planned that Epiphanius should go
   beforehand and publicly decry the books of Origen to the people, and
   Dioscorus and his companions as the partisans of this writer; and also
   to attack the bishop of the city as the abetter of those heretics. And
   some concerned themselves in this; for by this means it was supposed
   that the affections of the people would be alienated from their bishop.
   The following day, when Epiphanius was about entering the church, in
   order to carry his design into execution, he was stopped by Serapion,
   at the command of John, who had received intimation of the plot.
   Serapion proved to Epiphanius that while the project he had devised was
   unjust in itself, it could be of no personal advantage to him; for that
   if it should excite a popular resurrection, he would be regarded as
   responsible for the outrages that might follow. By these arguments
   Epiphanius was induced to relinquish his attack.

   Chapter XV.--The Son of the Empress and St. Epiphanius. Conference
   between the "Long Brothers" and Epiphanius, and his Re-Embarkation for
   Cyprus. Epiphanius and John.

   About this time, the son of the empress was attacked by a dangerous
   illness, and the mother, apprehensive of consequences, sent to implore
   Epiphanius to pray for him. [1604] Epiphanius returned for answer, that
   the sick one would live, provided that she would avoid all intercourse
   with the heretic Dioscorus and his companions. To this message the
   empress replied as follows: "If it be the will of God to take my son,
   His will be done. The Lord who gave me my child, can take him back
   again. You have not power to raise the dead, otherwise your archdeacon
   would not have died." She alluded to Chrispion, the archdeacon, who had
   died a short time previously. He was brother to Fuscon and Salamanus,
   monks whom I had occasion to mention [1605] when detailing the history
   of events under the reign of Valens; he had been companion of
   Epiphanius, and had been appointed his archdeacon. Ammonius and his
   companions went to Epiphanius, at the permission of the empress.
   Epiphanius inquired who they were, and Ammonius replied, "We are, O
   father, the Long Brothers; we come respectfully to know whether you
   have read any of our works or those of our disciples?" On Epiphanius
   replying that he had not seen them, he continued, "How is it, then,
   that you consider us to be heretics, when you have no proof as to what
   sentiments we may hold?" Epiphanius said that he had formed his
   judgment by the reports he had heard on the subject; and Ammonius
   replied, "We have pursued a very different line of conduct from yours.
   We have conversed with your disciples, and read your works frequently,
   and among others, that entitled The Anchored.' When we have met with
   persons who have ridiculed your opinions, and asserted that your
   writings are replete with heresy, we have contended for you, and
   defended you as our father. Ought you then to condemn the absent upon
   mere report, and of whom you know nothing with assured certitude, or
   return such an exchange to those who have spoken well of you?"
   Epiphanius was measurably convinced, and dismissed them. Soon after he
   embarked for Cyprus, either because he recognized the futility of his
   journey to Constantinople, or because, as there is reason to believe,
   God had revealed to him his approaching death; for he died while on his
   voyage back to Cyprus. It is reported that he said to the bishops who
   had accompanied him to the place of embarkation, "I leave you the city,
   the palace, and the stage, for I shall shortly depart." I have been
   informed by several persons that John predicted that Epiphanius would
   die at sea, and that this latter predicted the deposition of John. For
   it appears that when the dispute between them was at its height,
   Epiphanius said to John, "I hope you will not die a bishop," and that
   John replied, "I hope you will never return to your bishopric."

   Chapter XVI.--The Dispute between the Empress and John. Arrival of
   Theophilus from Egypt. Cyrinus, Bishop of Chalcedon.

   After the departure of Epiphanius, John, when preaching in the church
   as usual, chanced to inveigh against the vices to which females are
   peculiarly prone. [1606] The people imagined that his strictures were
   enigmatically directed against the wife of the emperor. The enemies of
   the bishop did not fail to report his discourse in this sense to the
   empress; and she, conceiving herself to have been insulted, complained
   to the emperor, and urged the necessity for the speedy presence of
   Theophilus and the convocation of a council. Severian, bishop of
   Gabala, who had not yet changed his former resentment against John,
   cooperated in the promotion of these measures. I am not in possession
   of sufficient data to determine whether there was any truth in the
   current report that John delivered the discourse above mentioned with
   express allusion to the empress, because he suspected her of having
   excited Epiphanius against him. Theophilus arrived soon after at
   Chalcedon in Bithynia, and was followed thither by many bishops. Some
   of the bishops joined him in compliance with his own invitation, and
   others in obedience to the commands of the emperor. The bishops whom
   John had deposed in Asia repaired to Chalcedon with the utmost
   alacrity, as likewise all those who cherished any feeling of hostility
   against him. The ships which Theophilus expected from Egypt had already
   come to Chalcedon. When they had convened again in the same place, and
   when they had deliberated how the attempt against John might be
   judiciously forwarded by them, Cyrinus, leader of the church of
   Chalcedon, who was an Egyptian and a relative of Theophilus, and who
   had besides some other difficulties with John, spoke very abusively of
   him. Justice, however, seemed to follow him speedily; for Maruthas, a
   native of Mesopotamia, who had accompanied the bishops, happened to
   tread on his foot; and Cyrinus suffered so severely from this accident
   that he was unable to repair with the other bishops to Constantinople,
   although his aid was necessary to the execution of the designs that had
   been formed against John. The wound assumed so alarming an appearance,
   that the surgeons were obliged to perform several operations on the
   leg; and at length mortification took place, and spread over the whole
   body, and even extended to the other foot. He expired soon afterwards
   in great agony.

   Chapter XVII.--Council held by Theophilus and the Accusers of John in
   Rufinianæ. John is summoned to attend, and not being present, was
   deposed by Them.

   When Theophilus entered Constantinople, none of the clergy went out to
   meet him; for his enmity against the bishop had become publicly known.
   [1607] Some sailors from Alexandria, however, who chanced to be on the
   shore, both from the corn vessels as well as other ships, having
   collected together, received him with great acclamations of joy.
   Passing by the church, he proceeded directly to the palace, where a
   lodging had been prepared for his accommodation. He soon perceived that
   many people of the city were strongly prejudiced against John, and
   ready to bring accusations against him; and taking his measures
   accordingly, he repaired to a place called "The Oak," in the suburbs of
   Chalcedon. This place now bears the name of Rufinus; for he was a
   consul, and erected here a magnificent palace, and a great church in
   honor of the apostles, Peter and Paul, and therefore named it the
   Apostolium; and appointed a congregation of monks to perform the
   clerical duties in the church. When Theophilus and the other bishops
   met for deliberation in this place, he judged it expedient to make no
   further allusion to the works of Origen, and called the monks of Scetis
   to repentance, promising that there would be no recollection of wrongs
   nor infliction of evil. His partisans zealously seconded his efforts,
   and told them that they must ask Theophilus to pardon their conduct;
   and as all the members of the assembly concurred in this request, the
   monks were troubled, and believing that it was necessary to do what
   they were desired by so many bishops, they used the words which it was
   their custom to use even when injured, and said "spare us." Theophilus
   willingly received them into favor, and restored them to communion; and
   the question concerning the injuries done to the monks of Scetis was
   ended. I feel convinced that this matter would not have been so quickly
   settled, had Dioscorus and Ammonius been present with the other monks.
   But Dioscorus had died some time previously, and had been interred in
   the church dedicated to St. Mocius the martyr. Ammonius, also, had been
   taken ill at the very time that preparations were being made for the
   convocation of the council; and although he insisted upon repairing to
   "The Oak," yet his malady was thereby greatly increased: he died soon
   after his journey, and had a splendid entombment among the monks of
   that vicinity, and there he lies. Theophilus, it is said, shed tears on
   hearing of his death, and declared that although he had been the cause
   of much perplexity, there was not a monk to be found of more exalted
   character than Ammonius. It must, however, be admitted, that the death
   of this monk tended much to promote the success of the designs of
   Theophilus.

   The members of the council summoned all the clergy of Constantinople to
   appear before them, and threatened to depose those who did not obey the
   summons. They cited John to appear and answer; as likewise Serapion,
   Tigrius a presbyter, and Paul a reader. John acquainted them, through
   the medium of Demetrius, bishop of Pisinus, and of some of the other
   clergy, who were his friends, that he would not avoid investigation,
   but that he was ready, if the names of his accusers and the subject of
   his accusations were made known to him, to justify his proceedings
   before a larger council; for he did not choose to be considered insane,
   and to recognize his manifest enemies as judges. The bishops testified
   so much indignation at the non-compliance of John, that some of the
   clergy whom he had sent to the council were intimidated and did not
   return to him. Demetrius, and those who preferred his interests to all
   other considerations, quitted the council, and returned to him. The
   same day, a courier and a shorthand writer were dispatched from the
   palace to command John to repair to the bishops, and to urge the
   bishops to decide his cause without further delay. After John had been
   cited four times, and had appealed to a general council, no other
   accusation could be substantiated against him, except his refusal to
   obey the summons of the council; and upon this ground they deposed him.

   Chapter XVIII.--Sedition of the People against Theophilus; and they
   traduced their Rulers. John was recalled, and again came to the See.

   The people of Constantinople were made acquainted with the decree of
   the council towards the evening; and they immediately rose up in
   sedition. [1608] At the break of day they ran to the church, and
   shouted, among many other plans, that a larger council ought to be
   convened to take cognizance of the matter; and they prevented the
   officers, who had been sent by the emperor to convey John into
   banishment, from carrying the edict into execution. John, apprehensive
   lest another accusation should be preferred against him, under the
   pretext that he had disobeyed the mandate of the emperor, or excited an
   insurrection among the people, when the multitude was dispersed,
   secretly made his escape from the church at noon, three days after his
   deposition. When the people became aware that he had gone into exile,
   the sedition became serious, and many insulting speeches were uttered
   against the emperor and the council; and particularly against
   Theophilus and Severian, who were regarded as the originators of the
   plot. Severian happened to be teaching in the church at the very time
   that these occurrences were taking place; and he took occasion to
   commend the deposition of John, and stated that, even supposing him
   guiltless of other crimes, John deserved to be deposed on account of
   his pride; because, while God willingly forgives men all other sins, he
   resists the proud. At this discourse the people became restive under
   the wrong, and renewed their wrath, and fell into unrestrainable
   revolt. They ran to the churches, to the market-places, and even to the
   palace of the emperor, and with howls and groans demanded the recall of
   John. The empress was at length overcome by their importunity; and she
   persuaded her husband to yield to the wishes of the people. She quickly
   sent a eunuch, named Briso, in whom she placed confidence, to bring
   back John from Prenetus, a city of Bithynia; and protested that she had
   taken no part in the machinations that had been carried on against him,
   but had, on the contrary, always respected him as a priest and the
   initiator of her children.

   When John, on his journey homeward, reached the suburbs belonging to
   the empress, he stopped near Anaplus; and refused to re-enter the city
   until the injustice of his deposition had been recognized by a larger
   synod of bishops; but as this refusal tended to augment the popular
   excitement, and led to many public declamations against the emperor and
   the empress, he allowed himself to be persuaded to enter the city. The
   people went to meet him, singing psalms composed with reference to the
   circumstances; many carried light wax tapers. They conducted him to the
   church; and although he refused, and frequently affirmed that those who
   had condemned him ought first to reconsider their vote, yet they
   compelled him to take the episcopal throne, and to speak peace to the
   people according to the custom of the priests. He then delivered an
   extemporaneous discourse, in which, by a pleasing figure of speech, he
   declared that Theophilus had meditated an injury against his church,
   even as the king of Egypt had contemplated the violation of Sarah, the
   wife of the patriarch Abraham, which is recorded in the books of the
   Hebrews: he then proceeded to commend the zeal of the people, and to
   extol the emperor and the empress for their good will to him; he
   stirred the people to much applause and good acclaim for the emperor
   and his spouse, so that he had to leave his speech half ended.

   Chapter XIX.--Obstinancy of Theophilus. Enmity between the Egyptians
   and the Citizens of Constantinople. Flight of Theophilus. Nilammon the
   Ascetic. The Synod concerning John.

   Although Theophilus would fain have brought an accusation against John,
   [1609] under the plea that he had unlawfully reinstated himself in his
   bishopric, yet he was deterred from doing so by the fear of offending
   the emperor, who had been compelled to recall John, as the means of
   suppressing the popular insurrection. Theophilus, however, received an
   accusation against Heraclides during the absence of the accused, in the
   hope of thereby authorizing the sentence of condemnation which had been
   issued against John. But the friends of Heraclides interposed, and
   declared that it was unjust, and contrary to ecclesiastical law, to
   condemn one who was absent. Theophilus and his partisans maintained the
   opposite side of the question: the people of Alexandria and of Egypt
   sided with them, and were opposed by the citizens of Constantinople.
   The strife between the two parties became so vehement that bloodshed
   ensued; many were wounded, and others slain in the contest. Severian,
   and all the bishops at Constantinople who did not support the cause of
   John, became apprehensive for their personal safety, and quitted the
   city in haste. Theophilus, also, fled the city at the commencement of
   the winter; and, in company with Isaac the monk, sailed for Alexandria.
   A wind arose which drove the vessel to Gera, a small city about fifty
   stadia from Pelusium. The bishop of this city died, and the
   inhabitants, I have been informed, elected Nilammon to preside over
   their church; he was a good man, and had attained the summit of
   monastic philosophy. He dwelt without the city, in a cell of which the
   door was built up with stones. He refused to accept the dignity of the
   priesthood; and Theophilus, therefore, visited him in person, to exhort
   him to receive ordination at his hands. Nilammon repeatedly refused the
   honor; but, as Theophilus would take no refusal, he said to him,
   "To-morrow, my father, you shall act as you please; to-day it is
   requisite that I should arrange my affairs." Theophilus repaired, on
   the following day, to the cell of the monk, and commanded the door to
   be opened; but Nilammon exclaimed, "Let us first engage in prayer."
   Theophilus complied and began to pray. Nilammon likewise prayed within
   his cell, and in the act of prayer he expired. Theophilus, and those
   who were standing with him without the cell, knew nothing at the time
   of what had occurred; but, when the greater part of the day had passed
   away, and the name of Nilammon had been loudly reiterated without his
   returning any answer, the stones were removed from the door, and the
   monk was found dead. They honored him with a public burial after they
   had clothed him in the necessary vestments, and the inhabitants built a
   house of prayer about his tomb; and they celebrate the day of his
   death, in a very marked way, until this day. Thus died Nilammon, if it
   can be called death to quit this life for another,--rather than accept
   a bishopric of which, with extraordinary modesty, he considered himself
   unworthy.

   After his return to Constantinople, John appeared to be more than ever
   beloved by the people. Sixty bishops assembled together in that city,
   and annulled all the decrees of the council of "The Oak." They
   confirmed John in the possession of the bishopric, and enacted that he
   should officiate as a priest, confer ordination, and perform all the
   duties of the church usually devolving on the president. At this time
   Serapion was appointed bishop of Heraclea in Thrace.

   Chapter XX.--The Statue of the Empress; what happened there; the
   Teaching of John; Convocation of another Synod against John; his
   Deposition.

   Not long after these occurrences the silver statue of the empress,
   which is still to be seen to the south of the church opposite the grand
   council-chamber, was placed upon a column of porphyry on a high
   platform, [1610] and the event was celebrated there with applause and
   popular spectacles of dances and mimes, as was then customary on the
   erection of the statues of the emperors. In a public discourse to the
   people John charged that these proceedings reflected dishonor on the
   Church. This remark recalled former grievances to the recollection of
   the empress, and irritated her so exceedingly at the insult that she
   determined to convene another council. He did not yield, but added fuel
   to her indignation by still more openly declaiming against her in the
   church; and it was at this period that he pronounced the memorable
   discourse commencing with the words, "Herodias is again enraged; again
   she dances; again she seeks to have the head of John in a basin."

   Several bishops arrived soon after at Constantinople, and amongst them
   were Leontius, bishop of Ancyra, and Acacius, bishop of Berea. The
   festival of our Lord's Nativity was then at hand, and the emperor,
   instead of repairing to the church as usual, sent to acquaint John that
   he could not hold communion with him until he had cleared himself of
   the charges. John spiritedly replied that he was ready to prove his
   innocence; and this so intimidated his accusers that they did not dare
   to follow up the charges. The judges decided that, having been once
   deposed, he ought not to be admitted to a second trial. But they called
   on John to defend himself on this point only, that after he had been
   deposed, he had sat on the episcopal throne before a synod had
   reinstated him. In his defense he appealed to the decision of the
   bishops who had, subsequently to the council of "The Oak," held
   communion with him. The judges waived this argument, under the plea
   that those who had held communion with John were inferior in point of
   number to those who had deposed him, and that a canon was in force by
   which he stood condemned. Under this pretext they therefore deposed
   him, although the law in question had been enacted by heretics; for the
   Arians, after having taken advantage of various calumnies to expel
   Athanasius from the church of Alexandria, enacted this law from the
   apprehension of a change in public affairs, for they struggled to have
   the decisions against him remain uninvestigated.

   Chapter XXI.--Calamities suffered by the People after the Expulsion of
   John. The Plots against him of Assassination.

   After his deposition, John held no more assemblies in the church, but
   quietly remained in the episcopal dwelling-house. [1611] At the
   termination of the season of Quadragesima, on the same holy night in
   which the yearly festival in commemoration of the resurrection of
   Christ is celebrated, the followers of John were expelled from the
   church by the soldiers and his enemies, who attacked the people while
   still celebrating the mysteries. Since this occurrence was unforeseen,
   a great disturbance arose in the baptistery. The women wept and
   lamented, and the children screamed; the priests and the deacons were
   beaten, and were forcibly ejected from the church, in the priestly
   garments in which they had been officiating. They were charged with the
   commission of such disorderly acts as can be readily conceived by those
   who have been admitted to the mysteries, but which I consider it
   requisite to pass over in silence, lest my work should fall into the
   hands of the uninitiated.

   When the people perceived the plot, they did not use the church on the
   following day, but celebrated the Paschal feast in the very spacious
   public baths called after the Emperor Constantius. Bishops and
   presbyters, and the rest, whose right it is to administer church
   matters, officiated. Those who espoused the cause of John were present
   with the people. They were, however, driven hence, and then assembled
   on a spot without the walls of the city, which the Emperor Constantine,
   before the city had been built, had caused to be cleared and inclosed
   with palisades, for the purpose of celebrating there the games of the
   hippodrome. From that period, the people held separate assemblies,
   sometimes, whenever it was feasible, in that locality, and sometimes in
   another. They obtained the name of Johnites. About this time, a man who
   was either possessed of a devil, or who feigned to have one, was
   seized, having a poniard on his person, with the intention of
   assassinating John. He was apprehended by the people as one who had
   been hired for this plot, and led to the prefect; but John sent some
   bishops of his party to free him from custody before he had been
   questioned by torture. Some time afterwards, a slave of Elpidius the
   presbyter, who was an avowed enemy of the deacon, was seen running as
   swiftly as possible towards the episcopal residence. A passer-by
   endeavored to stop him, in order to ascertain the cause of so much
   haste; but instead of answering him, the slave plunged his poniard into
   him. Another person, who happened to be standing by, and who cried out
   at seeing the other wounded, was also wounded in a similar way by the
   slave; as was likewise a third bystander. All the people in the
   neighborhood, on seeing what had occurred, shouted that the slave ought
   to be arrested. He turned and fled. When those who were pursuing called
   out to those ahead to seize the fugitive, a man, who just then came out
   from the baths, strove to stop him, and was so grievously wounded that
   he fell down dead on the spot. At length, the people contrived to
   encircle the slave. They seized him, and conveyed him to the palace of
   the emperor, declaring that he had intended to have assassinated John,
   and that the crime ought to be visited with punishment. The prefect
   allayed the fury of the people by putting the delinquent into custody,
   and by assuring them that justice should have its course against him.

   Chapter XXII.--Unlawful Expulsion of John from his Bishopric. The
   Trouble which followed. Conflagration of the Church by Fire from
   Heaven. Exile of John to Cucusus.

   From this period the most zealous of the people guarded John
   alternately, stationing themselves about the episcopal residence by
   night and by day. [1612] The bishops who had condemned him complained
   of this conduct as a violation of the laws of the Church, declared that
   they could answer for the justice of the sentence that had been enacted
   against him, and asserted that tranquillity would never be restored
   among the people until he had been expelled from the city. A messenger
   having conveyed to him a mandate from the emperor enjoining his
   immediate departure, John obeyed, and escaped from the city, unnoticed
   by those who had been appointed to guard him. He made no other censure
   than that, in being sent into banishment without a legal trial or any
   of the forms of the law, he was treated more severely than murderers,
   sorcerers, and adulterers. He was conveyed in a little bark to
   Bithynia, and thence immediately continued his journey. Some of his
   enemies were apprehensive lest the people, on hearing of his departure,
   should pursue him, and bring him back by force, and therefore commanded
   the gates of the church to be closed. When the people who were in the
   public places of the city heard of what had occurred, great confusion
   ensued; for some ran to the seashore as if they would follow him, and
   others fled hither and thither, and were in great terror since the
   wrath of the emperor was expected to visit them for creating so much
   disturbance and tumult. Those who were within the church barred the
   exits still further by rushing together upon them, and by pressing upon
   one another. With difficulty they forced the doors open by the use of
   great violence; one party shattered them with stones, another was
   pulling them toward themselves, and was thus forcing the crowd backward
   into the building. Meanwhile the church was suddenly consumed on all
   sides with fire. The flames extended in all directions, and the grand
   house of the senatorial council, adjacent to the church on the south,
   was doomed. The two parties mutually accused each other of
   incendiarism. The enemies of John asserted that his partisans had been
   guilty of the deed from revenge, on account of the vote that had been
   passed against him by the council. These latter, on the other hand,
   maintained that they had been calumniated, and that the deed was
   perpetrated by their enemies, with the intention of burning them in the
   church. While the fire was spreading from late afternoon until the
   morning, and creeping forward to the material which was still standing,
   the officers who held John in custody conveyed him to Cucusus, a city
   of Armenia, which the emperor by letter had appointed as the place of
   residence for the condemned man. Other officers were commissioned to
   arrest all the bishops and clerics who had favored the cause of John,
   and to imprison them in Chalcedon. Those citizens who were suspected of
   attachment to John were sought out and cast into prison, and compelled
   to pronounce anathema against him.

   before John, was, not long afterwards, ordained as bishop of
   Constantinople. [1613] He was of a very mild disposition, and possessed
   of great piety; but the reputation he had acquired as a presbyter was
   diminished by the conduct of some of the clergy to whom he delegated
   his power, and who did what they pleased in his name; for their evil
   deeds were imputed to him. Nothing, however, operated so much to his
   disadvantage as the persecution that was carried on against the
   followers of John. They refused to hold communion, or even to join in
   prayer with him, because the enemies of John were associated with him;
   and as they persisted, as we have before stated, in holding a church in
   the further parts of the city, he complained to the emperor of their
   conduct. The tribune was commanded to attack them with a body of
   soldiers, and by means of clubs and stones he soon dispersed them. The
   most distinguished among them in point of rank, and those who were most
   zealous in their adherence to John, were cast into prison. The soldiers
   as is usual on such occasions, went beyond their orders, and forcibly
   stripped the women of their ornaments, and carried off as booty their
   chains, their golden girdles, necklaces, and their collars of rings;
   they pulled off the lobes of the ear with the earrings. Although the
   whole city was thus filled with trouble and lamentation, the affection
   of the people for John still remained the same, and they refrained from
   appearing in public. Many of them absented themselves from the
   market-place and public baths, while others, not considering themselves
   safe in their own houses, fled the city.

   Among the zealous men and excellent women who adopted this latter
   measure was Nicarete, a lady of Bithynia. She belonged to a noted
   family of the nobility, and was celebrated on account of her perpetual
   virginity and her virtuous life. She was the most modest of all the
   zealous women that we have ever known, and was well ordered in manner
   and speech and in behavior, and throughout her life she invariably
   preferred the service of God to all earthly considerations. She showed
   herself capable of enduring with courage and thought the sudden
   reversals of adverse affairs; she saw herself unjustly despoiled of the
   greater part of her ample patrimony without manifesting any
   indignation, and managed the little that remained to her with so much
   economy, that although she was advanced in age, she contrived to supply
   all the wants of her household, and to contribute largely to others.
   Since she loved a humane spirit, she also prepared a variety of
   remedies for the needs of the sick poor, and she frequently succeeded
   in curing patients who had derived no benefit from the skill of the
   customary physicians. With a devout strength which assisted her in
   reaching the best results, she closed her lips. To sum up all in a few
   words, we have never known a devoted woman endowed with such manners,
   gravity, and every other virtue. Although she was so extraordinary, she
   concealed the greater part of her nature and deeds; for by modesty of
   character and philosophy she was always studious of concealment. She
   would not accept of the office of deaconess, nor of instructress of the
   virgins consecrated to the service of the Church, because she accounted
   herself unworthy, although the honor was frequently pressed upon her by
   John.

   After the popular insurrection had been quelled, the prefect of the
   city appeared in public, as if to inquire into the cause of the
   conflagration, and the burning of the council-hall, and punished many
   severely; but being a pagan, he ridiculed the calamities of the Church,
   and delighted in its misfortunes.

   Chapter XXIV.--Eutropius the Reader, and the Blessed Olympian, and the
   Presbyter Tigrius, are persecuted on account of their Attachment to
   John. The Patriarchs.

   Eutropius, a reader, [1614] was required to name the persons who had
   set fire to the church; but although he was scourged severely, although
   his sides and cheeks were torn with iron nails, and although lighted
   torches were applied to the most sensitive parts of his body, no
   confession could be extorted from him, notwithstanding his youth and
   delicacy of constitution. After having been subjected to these
   tortures, he was cast into a dungeon, where he soon afterwards expired.

   A dream of Sisinius concerning Eutropius seems worthy of insertion in
   this history. Sisinius, the bishop of the Novatians, saw in his sleep a
   man, conspicuous for beauty and stature, standing near the altar of the
   church which the Novatians erected to the honor of Stephen, the
   proto-martyr; the man complained of the rarity of good men, and said
   that he had been searching throughout the entire city, and had found
   but one who was good, and that one was Eutropius. Astonished at what he
   had seen, Sisinius made known the dream to the most faithful of the
   presbyters of his church, and commanded him to seek Eutropius wherever
   he might be. The presbyter rightly conjectured that this Eutropius
   could be no other than he who had been so barbarously tortured by the
   prefect, and went from prison to prison in quest of him. At length he
   found him, and in conversation with him made known the dream of the
   bishop, and besought him with tears to pray for him. Such are the
   details we possess concerning Eutropius.

   Great fortitude was evinced in the midst of these calamities by
   Olympias, the deaconess. Being dragged for this reason before the
   tribunal, and interrogated by the prefect as to her motives in setting
   fire to the church, she replied, "My past life ought to avert all
   suspicion from me, for I have devoted my large property to the
   restoration of the temples of God." The prefect alleged that he was
   well acquainted with her past course of life. "Then," continued she,
   "you ought to appear in the place of the accuser and let another judge
   us." As the accusation against her was wholly unsubstantiated by
   proofs, and as the prefect found that he had no ground on which he
   could justly blame her, he changed to a milder charge as if desirous of
   advising her, finding fault with her and the other women, because they
   refused communion with his bishop, although it was possible for them to
   repent and to change their own circumstances. They all through fear
   deferred to the advice of the prefect, but Olympias said to him, "It is
   not just that, after having been publicly calumniated, without having
   had anything proved against me in the courts, I should be obliged to
   clear myself of charges totally unconnected with the accusation in
   question. Let me rather take counsel concerning the original accusation
   that has been preferred against me. For even if you resort to unlawful
   compulsion, I will not hold communion with those from whom I ought to
   secede, nor consent to anything that is not lawful to the pious." The
   prefect, finding that he could not prevail upon her to hold communion
   with Arsacius, dismissed her that she might consult the advocates. On
   another occasion, however, he again sent for her and condemned her to
   pay a heavy fine, for he imagined by this means she would be compelled
   to change her mind. But she totally disregarded the loss of her
   property, and quitted Constantinople for Cyzicus. Tigrius, a presbyter,
   was about the same period stripped of his clothes, scourged on the
   back, bound hand and foot, and stretched on the rack. He was a
   barbarian by race, and a eunuch, but not by birth. He was originally a
   slave in the house of a man in power, and on account of his faithful
   services had obtained his freedom. He was afterwards ordained as
   presbyter, and was distinguished by his moderation and meekness of
   disposition, and by his charity towards strangers and the poor. Such
   were the events which took place in Constantinople.

   Meanwhile Siricius had died, after having administered the bishopric of
   Rome fifteen years. Anastasius held the same bishopric three years, and
   then died, and was succeeded by Innocent. Flavian, who refused his
   consent to the deposition of John, was also dead; and Porphyry, being
   appointed to succeed him in the church of Antioch, where he agreed with
   those who had condemned John, many of those in Syria seceded from the
   church in Antioch, and because they made congregations among
   themselves, they were subjected to many cruelties. For the purpose of
   enforcing fellowship with Arsacius, and with this Porphyry and
   Theophilus, the bishop of Alexandria, a law was established, by the
   zeal of the powerful at court, that those who were orthodox should not
   assemble outside of the churches, and those who were not in communion
   with them should be expelled.

   Chapter XXV.--Since these Ills existed in the Church, Secular Affairs
   also fell into Disorder. The Affairs of Stilicho, the General of
   Honorius.

   About this period [1615] the dissensions by which the Church was
   agitated were followed, as is frequently the case, by disturbances and
   commotions in the state. The Huns crossed the Ister and devastated
   Thrace. The robbers in Isauria gathered in great numbers and ravaged
   cities and villages as far as Caria and Phoenicia. Stilicho, the
   general of Honorius, a man who had attained great power, if any one
   ever did, and had under his sway the flower of the Roman and of the
   barbarian soldiery, conceived feelings of enmity against the rulers who
   held office under Arcadius, and determined to set the two empires at
   enmity with each other. He caused Alaric, the leader of the Goths, to
   be appointed by Honorius to the office of general of the Roman troops,
   and sent him into Illyria; whither also he dispatched Jovius, the
   prætorian prefect, and promised to join them there with the Roman
   soldiers in order to add that province to the dominions of Honorius.
   Alaric marched at the head of his troops from the barbarous regions
   bordering on Dalmatia and Pannonia, and came to Epirus; and after
   waiting for some time there, he returned to Italy. Stilicho was
   prevented from fulfilling his agreement to join Alaric, by some letters
   which were transmitted to him from Honorius. These events happened in
   the manner narrated.

   Chapter XXVI.--Two Epistles from Innocent, the Pope of Rome, of which
   one was addressed to John Chrysostom, and the other to the Clergy of
   Constantinople concerning John.

   Innocent, [1616] bishop of Rome, [1617] was extremely indignant when
   apprised of the measures that had been adopted against John, and
   condemned the whole proceedings. He then turned his attention to the
   convocation of an oecumenical council, and wrote to John and to the
   clergy of Constantinople in part. Subjoined are the two letters,
   precisely as I found them, translated from the Latin into Greek.

   "Innocent, to the beloved brother John.

   "Although one conscious of his own innocence ought to expect every
   blessing and to ask for mercy from God, yet it seems well to us to send
   you a befitting letter by Cyriacus, the deacon, and to counsel you to
   long-suffering, lest the contumely cast upon you should have more power
   in subduing your courage than the testimony of a good conscience in
   encouraging you to hope. It is not requisite to teach you, who are the
   teacher and pastor of so great a people, that God always tries the best
   of men to see whether they will continue in the height of patience, and
   will not give way to any labor of suffering; and how true it is that
   the conscience is a firm thing against all that befalls us unjustly,
   and unless one be moved in these misfortunes by patience, he furnishes
   a ground for evil surmising. For he ought to endure everything, who
   first trusts in God, and then in his own conscience. Especially when an
   excellent and good man can exercise himself in endurance, he cannot be
   overcome; for the Holy Scriptures guard his thoughts, and the devout
   lections, which we expound to the people, abound in examples. These
   Scriptures assure us that almost all the saints are variously and
   continuously afflicted, and are tested by some investigation, and so
   have come to the crown of patience. Let thy conscience encourage thy
   love, O most honored brother; for that faculty amid tribulations
   possesses an encouragement for virtue. For since Christ, the Master, is
   observing, the purified conscience will station you in the haven of
   peace."

   "Innocent, the bishop, to the presbyters, deacons, and all the clergy,
   and to the people of the church of Constantinople under John, the
   bishop, greeting to you, beloved brethren.

   "From the letters of your love that you forwarded to me through
   Germanus, the presbyter, and Cassianus, the deacon, I have learned,
   with anxious solicitude, the scenes of evil which you have placed
   before our eyes. I have frequently seen during its repeated reading
   with what calamities and labors the faith is wearied. Only the
   consolation of patience heals such a state of affairs. Our God will
   shortly put an end to such tribulations, and they will eventually tend
   to your profit. But we recognized with approbation your proposition,
   placed at the beginning of the letter of your love; to wit, that this
   very consolation is necessary, and embraces many proofs of your
   patience; for our consolation, which we ought to have conveyed, you
   have anticipated in your epistle. Our Lord is wont to furnish this
   patience to the suffering, in order that when they fall into
   tribulations, the servants of Christ may encourage themselves; for they
   should reason within themselves that what they suffer has happened
   previously to the saints. And even we ourselves derive comfort from
   your letters, for we are not strangers to your sufferings; but we are
   disciplined in you. Who, indeed, can endure to witness the errors
   introduced by those who were bound especially to be enthusiasts for the
   quiet of peace and for its concord? But far from maintaining peace,
   they expel guiltless priests from the front seat of their own churches.
   John, our brother and fellow-minister and your bishop, has been the
   first to suffer this unjust treatment without being allowed a hearing.
   No accusation was brought, none was heard. What proposition was it that
   was nullified, so that no show of judgment might arise or be sought?
   Others were seated in the places of living priests, as though any who
   began from such discord would be able to possess anything or do
   anything rightly in any one's judgment. We have never known such
   audacities to have been done by our fathers. They rather prohibited
   such innovations by refusing to give power to any one to be ordained in
   another's place while the occupant was living, since he is unable to be
   a bishop who is unjustly substituted.

   "With respect to the observance of canons, we declare that those
   defined at Nicæa are alone [1618] entitled to the obedience and
   recognition of the Catholic Church. If any individuals should attempt
   to introduce other canons, at variance with those of Nicæa, and such as
   are a compilation by heretics, such canons ought to be rejected by the
   Catholic Church, for it is not lawful to add the inventions of heretics
   to the Catholic canons. For they always wish to belittle the decision
   of the Nicene fathers through opponents and lawless men. We say, then,
   that the canons we have censured are not only to be disregarded, but to
   be condemned with the dogmas of heretics and schismatics, even as they
   have been formerly condemned at the council of Sardica by the bishops
   who were our predecessors. For it would be better, O most honored
   brethren, that these transactions be condemned, than that any actions
   should be confirmed contrary to the canons.

   "What measures ought we to adopt now in the present circumstances
   against such deeds? It is necessary that there be a synodical
   investigation, and a synod we long ago said should be gathered. There
   are no other means of arresting the fury of the tempest. In order that
   we may attain this it will be profitable meanwhile for that healing to
   be exalted which comes by the will of the great God and of His Christ,
   our Lord. We shall thus behold the cessation of all the woes which have
   been excited by the envy of the devil, and which have served as trials
   for our faith. If we remain steadfast in the faith, there is nothing
   that we ought not to expect from the Lord. We are constantly watching
   for the opportunity of convening an oecumenical council, whereby, in
   accordance with the will of God, an end may be put to these harassing
   commotions. Let us, then, endure in the interval, and, fortified by the
   wall of patience, let us trust in the help of our God for the
   restoration of all things.

   "We had previously been made acquainted with all that you have related
   concerning your trials, by our fellow-bishops Demetrius, Cyriacus,
   Eulysius, and Palladius, who visited Rome at different periods and are
   now with us; from them we had learned all the details by a complete
   inquiry."

   Chapter XXVII.--The Terrible Events which resulted from the Treatment
   of John. Death of the Empress Eudoxia. Death of Arsacius. And further
   concerning Atticus, the Patriarch, his Birthplace, and Character.

   Such were the letters of Innocent from which the opinion which he
   entertained of John may readily be inferred. About the same period some
   hailstones of extraordinary magnitude fell at Constantinople and in the
   suburbs of the city. [1619] Four days afterwards, the wife of the
   emperor died. These occurrences were by many regarded as indications of
   Divine wrath on account of the persecution that had been carried on
   against John. For Cyrinus, bishop of Chalcedon, one of his principal
   calumniators, had long previously terminated his life in the midst of
   great bodily agony, arising from the accident that had occurred to his
   foot, and the consequent necessary amputation of the leg by the
   physicians. Arsacius, too, died after he had presided but a very short
   period over the church of Constantinople. Many candidates were proposed
   as his successor; and four months after his decease, Atticus, a
   presbyter, of the clergy of Constantinople, and one of the enemies of
   John, was ordained. He was a native of Sebaste in Armenia. He had been
   instructed from his youth in the principles of monastic philosophy by
   monks of the Macedonian heresy. These monks, who then enjoyed a very
   high reputation at Sebaste for philosophy, were of the discipline of
   Eustathius, to whom allusion has been already made as bishop there, and
   a leader of the best monks. When Atticus attained the age of manhood,
   he embraced the tenets of the Catholic Church. He possessed more by
   nature than by learning, and became a participant in affairs, and was
   as skillful in carrying on intrigues as in evading the machinations of
   others. He was of a very engaging disposition, and was beloved by many.
   The discourses which he delivered in the church did not rise above
   mediocrity; and although not totally devoid of erudition, they were not
   accounted by his auditors of sufficient value to be preserved in
   writing. Being intent, if an opportunity offered itself anywhere, he
   exercised himself in the most approved Greek authors; but lest, in
   conversation about these writers, he might appear unlettered, he
   frequently concealed what he did know. It is said that he manifested
   much zeal in behalf of those who entertained the same sentiments as
   himself, and that he rendered himself formidable to the heterodox. When
   he wished he could easily throw them into alarm; but he at once
   transformed himself and would appear meek. Such is the information
   which those who knew the man have furnished.

   John acquired great celebrity even in his exile. He possessed ample
   pecuniary resources, and being besides liberally supplied with money by
   Olympias, the deaconess, and others, he purchased the liberty of many
   captives from the Isaurian robbers, and restored them to their
   families. He also administered to the necessities of many who were in
   want; and by his kind words comforted those who did not stand in need
   of money. Hence he was exceedingly beloved not only in Armenia, where
   he dwelt, but by all the people of the neighboring countries, and the
   inhabitants of Antioch and of the other parts of Syria, and of Cilicia,
   who frequently sought his society.

   Chapter XXVIII.--Effort of Innocent, Bishop of Rome, to recall John
   through a Council. Concerning those who were sent by him to make Trial
   of the Matter. The Death of John Chrysostom.

   Innocent, bishop of Rome, was very anxious, as appears by his former
   letter, to procure the recall of John. [1620] [1621] He sent five
   bishops and two presbyters of the Roman church, with the bishops who
   had been delegated as ambassadors to him from the East, to the emperors
   Honorius and Arcadius, to request the convocation of a council, and
   solicit them to name time and place. The enemies of John at
   Constantinople framed a charge as though these things were done to
   insult the Eastern emperor, and caused the ambassadors to be
   ignominiously dismissed as if they had invaded a foreign government.
   John was at the same time condemned by an imperial edict to a remoter
   place of banishment, and soldiers were sent to conduct him to Pityus;
   the soldiers were soon on hand, and effected the removal. It is said
   that during this journey, Basiliscus, the martyr, appeared to him at
   Comani, in Armenia, and apprised him of the day of his death. Being
   attacked with pain in the head, and being unable to bear the heat of
   the sun, he could not prosecute his journey, but closed his life in
   that town.

   Book IX.

   Chapter I.--Death of Arcadius, and Government of Theodosius the
   Younger. His Sisters. Piety, Virtue, and Virginity, of the Princess
   Pulcheria; her Divinely Loved Works; she educated the Emperor
   Befittingly.

   Such are the details that have been transmitted concerning John. Not
   long after his death, and three years after the elevation of Atticus to
   the bishopric of Constantinople, and during the consulate of Bassus and
   Philip, Arcadius died. He left Theodosius, his son, [1622] who was just
   weaned, as his successor to the empire. He also left three daughters of
   tender age, named Pulcheria, Arcadia, and Marina.

   It appears to me that it was the design of God to show by the events of
   this period, that piety alone suffices for the salvation of princes;
   and that without piety, armies, a powerful empire, and every other
   resource, are of no avail. The Divine Power which is the guardian of
   the universe, foresaw that the emperor would be distinguished by his
   piety, and therefore determined that Pulcheria, his sister, should be
   the protector of him and of his government. This princess was not yet
   fifteen years of age, but had received a mind most wise and divine
   above her years. She first devoted her virginity to God, and instructed
   her sisters in the same course of life. To avoid all cause of jealousy
   and intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation
   of her resolution, she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of
   the Roman empire as witnesses to her self-dedication. In token of her
   virginity and the headship of her brother, she consecrated in the
   church of Constantinople, a holy table, a remarkable fabric and very
   beautiful to see; it was made of gold and precious stones; and she
   inscribed these things on the front of the table, so that it might be
   patent to all. After quietly resuming the care of the state, she
   governed the Roman empire excellently and with great orderliness; she
   concerted her measures so well that the affairs to be carried out were
   quickly decreed and completed. She was able to write and to converse
   with perfect accuracy in the Greek and Latin languages. She caused all
   affairs to be transacted in the name of her brother, and devoted great
   attention to bringing him up as a prince in the best possible way and
   with such information as was suitable to his years. She had him taught
   by the most skilled men, in horsemanship, and the practice of arms, and
   in letters. But he was systematically taught by his sister to be
   orderly and princely in his manners; she showed him how to gather up
   his robes, and how to take a seat, and how to walk; she trained him to
   restrain laughter, to assume a mild or a formidable aspect as the
   occasion might require, and to inquire with urbanity into the cases of
   those who came before him with petitions. But she strove chiefly, to
   lead him into piety, and to pray continuously; she taught him to
   frequent the church regularly, and to honor the houses of prayer with
   gifts and treasures; and she inspired him with reverence for priests
   and other good men, and for those who, in accordance with the law of
   Christianity, had devoted themselves to philosophy. She provided
   zealously and wisely that religion might not be endangered by the
   innovation of spurious dogmas. That new heresies have not prevailed in
   our times, we shall find to be due especially to her, as we shall
   subsequently see. With how much fear she worshiped God, it would take
   long for any one to say; and how many houses of prayer she built
   magnificently, and how many hostelries and monastic communities she
   established, the arrangement for the expenses for their perpetual
   support, and the provision for the inmates. If any one pleases to
   examine the truth from the business itself, and not to be convinced by
   my words, he will learn that they are not falsely described by me for
   my own favor, if he will investigate the testimonial documents written
   up by the stewards of her house, and if he will inquire from the true
   records whether the facts agree with my history. If these proofs alone
   do not satisfy him so as to make him believe, let God himself persuade
   him who had her in favor altogether and everywhere on account of her
   conduct, so that He heard her prayer readily, and frequently directed
   beforehand the things which ought to be done. Such indications of
   Divine love are not conferred upon men unless they have merited them by
   their works. But I willingly pass over for the present the many
   separate manifestations of Divine favor that were granted to the sister
   of the emperor as proofs that she was loved of God, lest anybody should
   blame me for having set out to do other things, and yet had turned to
   the use of encomiums. One incident relating to her seems, however, so
   fitting in itself and to my ecclesiastical history, and so evident a
   demonstration of her love for God, that I will relate it here, although
   it happened some time afterwards. It is as follows:--

   Chapter II.--Discovery of the Relics of Forty Holy Martyrs.

   A woman by name Eusebia, [1623] who was a deaconess of the Macedonian
   sect, had a house and garden without the walls of Constantinople, in
   which she kept the holy remains of forty soldiers, [1624] who had
   suffered martyrdom under Licinius at Sebaste in Armenia. When she felt
   death approaching, she bequeathed the aforesaid place to some orthodox
   monks, and bound them by oath to bury her there, and to hew out
   separately a place above her head at the top of her coffin, and to
   deposit the relics of the martyrs with her, and to inform no one. The
   monks did so; but in order to render due honor to the martyrs secretly,
   according to the agreement with Eusebia, they formed a subterranean
   house of prayer near her tomb. But open to view, an edifice was erected
   above the foundation, inclosed with baked bricks, and a secret descent
   from it to the martyrs. Soon after, Cæsar, a man among those in power,
   who had formerly been advanced to the dignity of consul and prefect,
   lost his wife, and caused her to be interred near the tomb of Eusebia;
   for the two ladies had been knit together by the most tender
   friendship, and had been of one mind on all doctrinal and religious
   subjects. Cæsar was hence induced to purchase this place so that he
   might be entombed near his wife. The aforesaid monks settled elsewhere,
   and without divulging anything about the martyrs. After this, when the
   building was demolished, and when the earth and refuse were scattered
   about, the whole place was smoothed off. For Cæsarius himself erected
   there a magnificent temple to God to the honor of Thyrsus, the martyr.
   It appears probable that God designedly willed the aforesaid place to
   disappear, and so long a time to elapse in order that the discovery of
   the martyrs might be regarded as more marvelous and a more conspicuous
   event, and as a proof of the Divine favor towards the discoverer. The
   discoverer was, in fact, no other than the Empress Pulcheria, the
   sister of the emperor. The admirable Thyrsus appeared to her three
   times, and revealed to her those concealed beneath the earth; and
   commanded that they should be deposited near his tomb, in order that
   they might share in the same position and honor. The forty martyrs
   themselves also appeared to her, arrayed in shining robes. But the
   occurrence seemed too marvelous to be credible, and altogether
   impossible; for the aged of clergy of that region, after having
   frequently prosecuted inquiries, had not been able to indicate the
   position of the martyrs, nor indeed had any one else. At length, when
   everything was hopeless, Polychronius, a certain presbyter, who had
   formerly been a servant in the household of Cæsar, was reminded by God
   that the locality in question had once been inhabited by monks. He
   therefore went to the clergy of the Macedonian sect to inquire
   concerning them. All the monks were dead, with the exception of one,
   who seemed to have been preserved in life for the express purpose of
   pointing out the spot where the relics of the holy martyrs were
   concealed. Polychronius questioned him closely on the subject, and
   finding that, on account of the agreement made with Eusebia, his
   answers were somewhat undecided, he made known to him the Divine
   revelation and the anxiety of the empress, as well as the failure of
   her recourses. The monk then confessed that God had declared the truth
   to the empress; for at the time when he was an overgrown boy, and was
   taught the monastic life by its aged leaders, he remembered exactly
   that the relics of the martyrs had been deposited near the tomb of
   Eusebia; but that the subsequent lapse of time, and the changes which
   had been carried on in that locality, deprived him of the power of
   recalling to his recollection whether the relics had been deposited
   beneath the church or in any other spot. And further said Polychronius,
   "I have not suffered a like lapse of memory, for I remember that I was
   present at the interment of the wife of Cæsar, and, as well as I can
   judge from the relative situation of the high road, I infer that she
   must have been buried beneath the ambo"; this is the platform for the
   readers. "Therefore," subjoined the monk, "it must be near the remains
   of Cæsar's wife that the tomb of Eusebia must be sought; for the two
   ladies lived on terms of the closest friendship and intimacy, and
   mutually agreed to be interred beside each other." When it was
   necessary to dig, according to the aforesaid intimations, and to track
   out the sacred relics, and the empress had learned the facts, she
   commanded them to begin the work. On digging up the earth by the ambo,
   the coffin of Cæsar's wife was discovered according to the conjecture
   of Polychronius. At a short distance on the side they found the
   pavement of baked bricks, and a marble tablet of equal dimensions, each
   the measure of the bricks, under which the coffin of Eusebia was
   disclosed; and close by was an oratory, elegantly inclosed with white
   and purple marble. The cover of the tomb was in the form of a holy
   table, and at the summit, where the relics were deposited, a small
   orifice was visible. A man attached to the palace, who happened to be
   standing by, thrust a cane which he held in his hand into the orifice;
   and on withdrawing the cane he held it to his nose, and inhaled a sweet
   odor of myrrh, which inspired the workmen and bystanders with fresh
   confidence. When they had eagerly opened the coffin, the remains of
   Eusebia were found, and near her head was the prominent part of the
   tomb fashioned exactly in the form of a chest, and was concealed within
   by its own cover; and the iron which inclosed it on each side at the
   edges was firmly held together by lead. In the middle, the same orifice
   again appeared, and still more clearly revealed the fact of the relics
   being concealed within. As soon as the discovery was announced, they
   ran to the church of the martyr, and sent for smiths to unfasten the
   iron bars, and easily drew off the lid. A great many perfumes were
   found thereunder, and among the perfumes two silver caskets were found
   in which lay the holy relics. Then the princess returned thanks to God
   for having accounted her worthy of so great a manifestation and for
   attaining the discovery of the holy relics. After this she honored the
   martyrs with the costliest casket; and on the conclusion of a public
   festival which was celebrated with befitting honor and with a
   procession to the accompaniment of psalms, and at which I was present,
   the relics were placed alongside of the godlike Thyrsus. And others who
   were present can also bear testimony that these things were done in the
   way described, for almost all of them still survive. And the event
   occurred much later, when Proclus governed the church of
   Constantinople.

   Chapter III.--The Virtues of Pulcheria; Her Sisters.

   It is said that God frequently in many other cases revealed to the
   princess what was about to happen, and that the most occurred to her
   and her sisters as witnesses of the Divine love. [1625] They all pursue
   the same mode of life; they are sedulous about the priests and the
   houses of prayer, and are munificent to needy strangers and the poor.
   These sisters generally take their meals and walks together, and pass
   their days and their nights in company, singing the praises of God. As
   is the custom with exemplary women, they employ themselves in weaving
   and in similar occupations. Although princesses, born and educated in
   palaces, they avoid levity and idleness, which they think unworthy of
   any who profess virginity, so they put such indolence far from their
   own life. For this reason the mercy of God is manifested and is
   conquering in behalf of their house; for He increases the emperor in
   years and government; every conspiracy and war concocted against him
   has been overthrown of itself.

   Chapter IV.--Truce with Persia. Honorius and Stilicho. Transactions in
   Rome and Dalmatia.

   Although the Persians had prepared to take up arms, they were induced
   to conclude a truce with the Romans for a hundred years. [1626]

   Stilicho, the general of the troops of Honorius, was suspected of
   having conspired to proclaim his son Eucherius emperor of the East, and
   was, in consequence, slain by the army at Ravenna. He had, at a former
   period, while Arcadius was still living, conceived bitter feelings of
   enmity against his officers, and was hence impelled to bring the two
   empires into collision. He caused Alaric, the leader of the Goths, to
   secure the office of general of the Romans, and advised him to seize
   Illyria; and, having sent forward Jovian, the appointed prefect, he
   agreed to join him shortly with Roman troops, and to reduce its
   subjects under the rule of Honorius. Alaric quitted the barbarous
   region bordering on Dalmatia and Pannonia, where he had been dwelling,
   and marched at the head of his soldiery to Epirus; after remaining for
   some time in that country, he retreated to Italy, without having
   accomplished anything. For he was about to migrate according to the
   agreement, but he was restrained by the letters of Honorius. After the
   death of Arcadius, Honorius projected a journey to Constantinople, in
   behalf of his nephew, to appoint officers faithful to his security and
   empire; for he held his nephew in the place of his son, and he was
   fearful lest the boy might suffer on account of his youth, since he
   would be exposed to plots; but when Honorius was on the very point of
   setting out on this journey, Stilicho dissuaded him from his design, by
   proving to him that his presence was requisite in Italy, to repress the
   schemes of Constantine, who sought to possess himself of the sovereign
   power at Arles. Stilicho then took that one of the sceptres which the
   Romans call Labarum, obtained some letters from the emperor, with which
   he set out, at the head of four legions, to carry on war in the East;
   but a report having been spread that he had conspired against the
   emperor, and had formed a scheme, in conjunction with those in power,
   to raise his son to the throne, the troops rose up in sedition, and
   slew the prætorian prefect [1627] of Italy and of Gaul, the military
   commanders, and the chief officers of the court. Stilicho himself was
   slain by the soldiers at Ravenna. He had attained almost absolute
   power; and all men, so to speak, whether Romans or barbarians, were
   under his control. Thus perished Stilicho, on a suspicion of having
   conspired against the emperors. Eucherius, his son, was also slain.

   Chapter V.--The Different Nations took up Arms against the Romans, of
   whom some were, through the Providence of God defeated, and others
   brought to Terms of Amity.

   It happened about the same time that the Huns, who were encamped in
   Thrace, retreated disgracefully and cast off many of their number
   although they had neither been attacked nor pursued. [1628] Uldis, the
   leader of the barbarous tribes who dwell near the Ister, crossed that
   river at the head of a large army, and encamped on the frontiers of
   Thrace. He took possession by treachery of a city of Moesia, called
   Castra Martis, and thence made incursions into the rest of Thrace, and
   insolently refused to enter into terms of alliance with the Romans. The
   prefect of the Thracian soldiers made propositions of peace to him, but
   he replied by pointing to the sun, and declaring that it would be easy
   to him, if he desired to do so, to subjugate every region of the earth
   that is enlightened by that luminary. But while Uldis was uttering
   menaces of this description, and was ordering as large a tribute as he
   pleased, and that on this condition peace could be established with the
   Romans or the war would continue,--when affairs were so helpless, God
   gave manifest proofs of special favor towards the present reign; for,
   shortly afterwards, the immediate attendants and the leaders of the
   tribes of Uldis were discussing the Roman form of government, the
   philanthropy of the emperor, and his promptitude and liberality in
   rewarding the best and good men. It was not without God that they
   turned to the love of the points so discussed and seceded to the
   Romans, to whose camp they joined themselves, together with the troops
   ranged under themselves. Finding himself thus abandoned, Uldis escaped
   with difficulty to the opposite bank of the river. Many of his troops
   were slain; and among others the whole of the barbarous tribe called
   the Sciri. This tribe had been very strong in point of numbers before
   falling into this misfortune. Some of them were killed; and others were
   taken prisoners, and conveyed in chains to Constantinople. The
   governors were of opinion that, if allowed to remain together, they
   would probably make a revolution. Some of them were, therefore, sold at
   a low price; while others were given away as slaves for presents, upon
   condition that they should never be permitted to return to
   Constantinople, or to Europe, but be separated by the sea from the
   places familiar to them. Of these, a number was left unsold; and they
   were ordered to settle in different places. I have seen many in
   Bithynia, near Mount Olympus, living apart from one another, and
   cultivating the hills and valleys of that region.

   Chapter VI.--Alaric the Goth. He assaulted Rome, and straitened it by
   War.

   Thus was the Eastern Empire preserved from the evils of war, [1629] and
   governed with high order, contrary to all expectations, for its ruler
   was still young. In the meantime, the Western Empire fell a prey to
   disorders, because many tyrants arose. After the death of Stilicho,
   Alaric, the leader of the Goths, sent an embassy to Honorius to treat
   of peace; but without avail. He advanced to Rome, and laid siege to it;
   and by posting a large army of barbarians on the banks of the Tiber, he
   effectually prevented the transmission of all provisions into the city
   from Portus. After the siege had lasted some time, and fearful ravages
   had been made in the city by famine and pestilence, many of the slaves,
   and most of the barbarians by race within the walls, deserted to
   Alaric. Those among the senators who still adhered to pagan
   superstition, proposed to offer sacrifices in the Capitol and the other
   temples; and certain Tuscans, who were summoned by the prefect of the
   city, promised to drive out the barbarians with thunder and lightning;
   they boasted of having performed a similar exploit at Larnia, a city of
   Tuscany, which Alaric had passed by for Rome, and had not taken. The
   event, however, proved that no advantage could be derived from these
   persons for the city. All persons of good sense were aware that the
   calamities which this siege entailed upon the Romans were indications
   of Divine wrath sent to chastise them for their luxury, their
   debauchery, and their manifold acts of injustice towards each other, as
   well as towards strangers. It is said that, when Alaric was marching
   against Rome, a good monk of Italy besought him to spare the city, and
   not to become the author of so many calamities. Alaric, in reply,
   assured him that he did not feel disposed to commence the siege, but
   that some resistless influence compelled and commanded him to go
   against Rome; and this he eventually did. While he was besieging the
   city, the inhabitants presented many gifts to him, and for some time he
   raised the siege, when the Romans agreed to persuade the emperor to
   enter into a treaty of peace with him.

   Chapter VII.--Innocent the Bishop of the Presbytery of Rome. He sent an
   Embassy to Alaric. Jovius, Prefect of Italy. Embassy dispatched to the
   Emperor. Events concerning Alaric.

   Although ambassadors were dispatched to treat of peace, [1630] the
   enemies of Alaric at the court of the emperor sedulously guarded
   against the conclusion of any treaty with him. But after this, when an
   embassy had been sent to him by Innocent, bishop of Rome, and Alaric
   was summoned by a letter of the emperor, he repaired to the city of
   Ariminum, which is two hundred and ten stadia distant from Ravenna.

   He encamped beyond the walls of the city; and Jovius, the prefect of
   Italy, held a conference with him and conveyed his demands to the
   emperor, one of which was, that he might be appointed by an edict to
   the generalship of the cavalry and infantry. The emperor gave full
   power to Jovius to grant Alaric as much money and provision as he might
   desire, but refused ever to confer this dignity upon him. Jovius
   unadvisedly awaited the messenger from the palace, in the camp of
   Alaric; and commanded the decision of the emperor to be read in the
   presence of all the barbarians. On finding that the dignity was denied
   him, Alaric was enraged at the result, ordered the trumpets to be
   sounded, and marched towards Rome. Jovius, apprehensive of being
   suspected by the emperor of siding with Alaric, committed a still
   greater act of imprudence by taking an oath on the safety of the
   emperor, and compelling the principal officers to swear that they would
   never consent to any terms of peace with Alaric. The barbarian chief,
   however, soon after changed his mind, and sent word he did not desire
   any post of dignity, but was willing to act as an ally of the Romans,
   provided that they would grant him a certain quantity of corn, and some
   territory of secondary importance to them, in which he might establish
   himself.

   Chapter VIII.--Rebellion of Attalus and his General Heraclean; and how
   he eventually craved Forgiveness at the Feet of Honorius.

   After having sent some bishops as ambassadors, on two different
   occasions, to treat on this subject, but without effect, Alaric
   returned to Rome, and besieged the city; he took possession of one part
   of Portus, and compelled the Romans to recognize Attalus, then prefect
   of the city, as their king. [1631] When the Romans had been nominated
   for the other offices, Alaric was appointed general of the cavalry and
   infantry, and Ataulphus, the brother of his wife, was raised to the
   command of the force called the domestic cavalry. Attalus assembled the
   senators, and addressed them in a long and very elaborate discourse, in
   which he promised to restore the ancient customs of the senate, and
   also to bring Egypt and the other Eastern provinces under the sway of
   Italy. Such was the boastfulness of a man, who was not destined to bear
   the name of sovereign during the space of a single year. He was
   deceived by the representations of some diviners, who assured him that
   he would be able to conquer Africa without a battle; he disobeyed
   Alaric, who urged him to send a moderate force to Carthage, to slay the
   officers of Honorius, in case of their attempting any resistance. He
   also refused to follow the counsels of John, to whom he had given the
   command of the royal cohorts about his own person, and who advised him
   to entrust Constans, on his proposed departure for Libya, with a
   document which they call edict, as though sent by Honorius, by which
   Heraclean might be dispossessed of office; he had been entrusted with
   the rule of the soldiers in Africa. Had this artifice been adopted, it
   would probably have proved successful, for the designs of Attalus were
   unknown in Libya. But as soon as Constans had set sail for Carthage,
   according to the advice of the diviners, Attalus was so weak in mind
   that he did not think it doubtful, but believed that the Africans would
   be his subjects, according to the prediction of the diviners, and
   marched at the head of his army towards Ravenna. When it was announced
   that Attalus had reached Ariminum, with an army composed partly of
   Roman and partly of barbarian troops, Honorius wrote to him to
   acknowledge him as emperor, and deputed the highest officers of his
   court to wait upon him, and offer him a share in the empire. Attalus,
   however, refused to share power with another, and sent word that
   Honorius might choose an island or any spot of ground that he pleased
   for his private residence, and that he would be allowed every imperial
   service. The affairs of Honorius were reduced to so critical a
   condition, that ships were kept in readiness to convey him, if it were
   necessary, to his nephew, when an army of four thousand men which had
   started from the west arrived unexpectedly during the night at Ravenna;
   Honorius caused the walls of the city to be guarded by this
   reinforcement, for he distrusted the native troops as inclined to
   treachery.

   In the meantime Heraclean had put Constans to death, and had ranged
   troops along the ports and coasts of Africa to hinder the merchant
   vessels from going to Rome. When, as a consequence, a famine seized the
   Romans, they sent a deputation to Attalus about it. Being at a loss
   what measures to adopt, he returned to Rome to consult the senate. The
   famine was so grievous that chestnuts were used by the people to supply
   the place of corn, and some persons were suspected of having partaken
   of human flesh. Alaric advised that five hundred barbarians should be
   sent into Africa against Heraclean, but the senators and Attalus
   objected that Africa ought not to be entrusted to barbarians. It then
   became evident to Alaric that God disapproved of the rule of Attalus;
   and finding that it would be futile to labor for a matter which was
   beyond his power, and after receiving certain pledges, he agreed with
   Honorius to deprive Attalus of his sovereignty. All the parties
   concerned assembled together without the walls of the city, and Attalus
   threw aside the symbols of imperial power. His officers also threw
   aside their girdles, and Honorius granted pardon to all for these
   occurrences, and each was to hold the honor and office which he had
   first had. Attalus retired with his son to Alaric, for he thought his
   life would not be in safety as yet, if he continued to dwell among the
   Romans.

   Chapter IX.--The Disturbance which the Greeks and Christians had about
   Attalus. The Courageous Saros; Alaric, by a Stratagem, obtains
   Possession of Rome, and protected the Sacred Asylum of the Apostle
   Peter.

   The failure which had attended the designs of Attalus was a source of
   deep displeasure the pagans and Christians of the Arian heresy. [1632]
   The pagans had inferred from the known predilections and early
   education of Attalus, that he would openly maintain their
   superstitions, and restore their ancient temples, their festivals, and
   their altars. The Arians imagined that, as soon as he found his reign
   firmly established, Attalus would reinstate them in the supremacy over
   the churches which they had enjoyed during the reigns of Constantius
   and of Valens; for he had been baptized by Sigesarius, [1633] bishop of
   the Goths, to the great satisfaction of Alaric and the Arian party.

   Soon after, Alaric stationed himself among the Alps, at a distance of
   about sixty stadia from Ravenna, and held a conference with the emperor
   concerning the conclusion of a peace. Saros, a barbarian by birth, and
   highly practiced in the art of war, had only about three hundred men
   with him, but all well disposed and most efficient. He was suspicious
   of Alaric on account of their former enmity, and reasoned that a treaty
   between the Romans and Goths would be of no advantage to him. Suddenly
   advancing with his own troops, he slew some of the barbarians. Impelled
   by rage and terror at this incident, Alaric retraced his steps, and
   returned to Rome, and took it by treachery. He permitted each of his
   followers to seize as much of the wealth of the Romans as he was able,
   and to plunder all the houses; but from respect towards the Apostle
   Peter, he commanded that the large and very spacious church erected
   around his tomb should be an asylum. This was the only cause which
   prevented the entire demolition of Rome; and those who were there
   saved, and they were many, rebuilt the city.

   Chapter X.--A Roman Lady who manifested a Deed of Modesty.

   It is obvious that the capture of so great a city as Rome must have
   been attended with many remarkable circumstances. I shall, therefore,
   now proceed to the narration of such events as seem worthy of a place
   in ecclesiastical history. [1634] I shall recount a pious action
   performed by a barbarian, and record the bravery of a Roman lady for
   the preservation of her chastity. The barbarian and the lady were both
   Christians, but not of the same heresy, the former being an Arian, and
   the latter a zealous follower of the Nicene doctrines. A young man of
   Alaric's soldiers saw this very beautiful woman, and was conquered by
   her loveliness, and tried to drag her into intercourse; but she drew
   back, and exerted herself that she might not suffer pollution. He drew
   his sword, and threatened to slay her; but he was restrained by the
   passion which he entertained toward her, and merely inflicted a slight
   wound on her neck. The blood flowed in abundance, and she offered her
   neck to the sword; for she preferred to die in her chastity than to
   survive, after having consorted lawfully with a husband, and then to be
   attempted by another man. When the barbarian repeated his purpose, and
   followed it with more fearful threats, he accomplished nothing further;
   struck with wonder at her chastity, he conducted her to the church of
   Peter the apostle, and gave six pieces of gold for her support to the
   officers who were guarding the church, and commanded them to keep her
   for her husband.

   Chapter XI.--The Tyrants who in the West at that Time rebelled against
   Honorius. They are wholly destroyed on account of the Emperor's Love of
   God.

   During this period many tyrants rebelled against Honorius in the
   Western government. Some fell upon one another, while others were
   apprehended in a marvelous way, and so evidenced that the Divine love
   toward Honorius was not common. The soldiers in Britain [1635] were the
   first to rise up in sedition, and they proclaimed Mark as tyrant.
   Afterwards, however, they slew Mark, and proclaimed Gratian. Within
   four months subsequently they killed Gratian, and elected Constantine
   in his place, imagining that, on account of his name, he would be able
   to reduce the empire firmly under his authority; and for no other
   reason than this, several other persons of the same name were elected
   to the tyranny. Constantine passed over from Britain to Bononia, a
   maritime city of Gaul; and after inducing all the troops in Gaul and
   Aquitania to espouse his cause, he reduced to obedience the inhabitants
   of the regions extending to the mountains which divide Italy from Gaul,
   and which the Romans have named the Cottian Alps. He then sent his
   oldest son, Constans, whom he had already nominated Cæsar, and whom he
   afterwards proclaimed emperor, into Spain. Constans, after making
   himself master of this province, and appointing his own governors over
   it, commanded that Didymus and Verinian, relatives of Honorius, should
   be loaded with chains, and brought before him. Didymus and Verinian had
   at first differed among themselves, but a reconciliation was effected
   between them, when they found themselves menaced by the same danger.
   They combined their forces, which consisted chiefly of armed peasants
   and slaves. They attacked Lusitania in common, and slew many of the
   soldiers sent by the tyrant for their capture.

   Chapter XII.--Theodosiolus and Lagodius. The Races of the Vandals and
   Suevi. Death of Alaric. Flight of the Tyrants Constantine and Constans.

   The troops of Constans were shortly afterwards strengthened by
   reinforcements, and Didymus and Verinian, with their wives, were taken
   prisoners, and were eventually put to death. [1636] Their brothers,
   Theodosiolus and Lagodius, who were living in other provinces, fled the
   country; the former escaped to Italy, to the Emperor Honorius; the
   latter fled to the East, to Theodosius. After these transactions,
   Constans returned to his father, after he had posted a guard of his own
   soldiers for the road to Spain; for he did not permit the Spaniards to
   act as guard, according to the ancient custom, a privilege for which
   they had petitioned. This precaution was probably afterwards the cause
   of the ruin of the country; for when Constantine was deprived of his
   power, the barbarous races of the Vandals, Suevi, and Alani took
   confidence and conquered the road, and took possession of many forts
   and cities in Spain and Gaul, and arrested the officers of the tyrant.

   In the meantime, Constantine, who still thought that matters would go
   according to his purpose, caused his son to be proclaimed emperor
   instead of Cæsar, and determined to possess himself of Italy. With this
   view, he crossed the Cottian Alps, and entered Liverona, a city of
   Liguria. He was on the point of crossing the Po, when he was compelled
   to retrace his steps, upon being informed of the death of Alavicus.
   This Alavicus was the commander of the troops of Honorius, and being
   suspected of conspiring to place the entire Western government under
   the domination of Constantine, he was slain when returning from a
   procession, in which, according to custom, it was his office to march
   in advance of the emperor. Immediately after this occurrence, the
   emperor descended from horseback, and publicly returned thanks to God
   for having delivered him from one who had openly conspired against him.
   Constantine fled and seized Arles, and Constans, his son, hastened from
   Spain, and sought refuge in the same city.

   On the decline of the power of Constantine, the Vandals, Suevi, and
   Alani eagerly took the Pyrenees when they heard that it was a
   prosperous and most abundant region. And since those who had been
   entrusted by Constans with the guard of the passage had neglected their
   duty, the invaders passed by into Spain.

   Chapter XIII.--Concerning Gerontius, Maximus, and the Troops of
   Honorius. Capture of Gerontius and his Wife; their Death.

   Meanwhile Gerontius, from being the most efficient of the generals of
   Constantine, became his enemy; [1637] and believing that Maximus, his
   intimate friend, was well qualified for the tyranny, he invested him
   with the imperial robe, and permitted him to reside in Tarracona.
   Gerontius then marched against Constantine, and took care to put
   Constans, the son of Constantine, to death at Vienna.

   As soon as Constantine heard of the usurpation of Maximus, he sent one
   of his generals, named Edovicus, beyond the Rhine, to levy an army of
   Franks and Alemanni; and he sent his son Constans to guard Vienna and
   the neighboring towns. Gerontius then advanced upon Arles and laid
   siege to it; but directly, when the army of Honorius had come to hand
   against the tyrant, under the command of Constantius, the father of
   that Valentinian who subsequently became emperor of Rome, Gerontius
   retreated precipitately with a few soldiers; for the greater number of
   his troops deserted to the army of Constantius. The Spanish soldiery
   conceived an utter contempt for Gerontius, on account of his retreat,
   and took counsel how to slay him. They gathered in close ranks and
   attacked his house at night; but he, with one Alanus, his friend, and a
   few servants, ascended to the top of the house, and did such execution
   with their arrows that no less than three hundred of the soldiers fell.
   When the stock of arrows was exhausted, the servants made their escape
   by letting themselves down secretly from the building; and Gerontius,
   although he might have been saved in a similar fashion, did not choose
   to do so, because he was restrained by his affection for Nonnichia, his
   wife. At daybreak of the next day, the soldiers cast fire into the
   house; when he saw that there was no hope of safety left, he cut off
   the head of his companion, Alanus, in compliance with his wish. After
   this, his own wife was lamenting, and with tears was pressing herself
   with the sword, pleading to die by the hand of her husband before she
   should be subjected to others, and was supplicating for this last gift
   from him. And this woman by her courage showed herself worthy of her
   religion, for she was a Christian, and she died thus mercifully; she
   handed down to time a record of herself, too strong for oblivion.
   Gerontius then struck himself thrice with his sword; but perceiving
   that he had not received a mortal wound, he drew forth his poniard,
   which he wore at his side, and plunged it into his heart.

   Chapter XIV.--Constantine. The Army of Honorius and Edovicus his
   General. Defeat of Edovicus by Ulphilas, the General of Constantine.
   Death of Edovicus.

   Although the city of Arles was closely besieged by the army of
   Honorius, Constantine still resisted the siege, because Edovicus was
   announced as at hand with many allies. [1638] This frightened the
   generals of Honorius beyond measure. Then they determined to return to
   Italy, and to carry on the war there. When they had united on this
   plan, Edovicus was announced as in the neighborhood, so they crossed
   the river Rhone. Constantius, who commanded the infantry, quietly
   awaited the approach of the enemy, while Ulphilas, the fellow-general
   of Constantius, remained not far off in ambush with his cavalry. The
   enemy passed by the army of Ulphilas, and were about to engage with the
   troops of Constantius, when a signal was given, and Ulphilas suddenly
   appeared and assaulted the enemy from the rear. Their flight was
   immediate. Some escaped, some were slain, while others threw down their
   arms and asked for pardon, and were spared. Edovicus mounted his horse
   and fled to the lands of one Ecdicius, a landed proprietor, to whom he
   had formerly rendered some important service, and whom he therefore
   imagined to be his friend. Ecdicius, however, struck off his head, and
   presented it to the generals of Honorius, in hope of receiving some
   great reward and honor. Constantius, on receiving the head, proclaimed
   that the public thanks were due to Ecdicius for the deed of Ulphilas;
   but when Ecdicius was eager to accompany him he commanded him to
   depart, for he did not consider the companionship of a malicious host
   to be good for himself or the army. And the man who had dared to commit
   the most unholy murder of a friend and a guest who was in an
   unfortunate situation,--this man went away, as the proverb says, gaping
   with emptiness.

   Chapter XV.--Constantine throws aside the Emblems of Imperial Power,
   and is ordained as Presbyter; his Subsequent Death. Death of the other
   Tyrants who had conspired against Honorius.

   After this victory the troops of Honorius again laid siege to the city.
   [1639] When Constantine heard of the death of Edovicus he cast aside
   his purple robe and imperial ornaments, and repaired to the church,
   where he caused himself to be ordained as presbyter. Those within the
   walls, having first received oaths, opened the gates, and their lives
   were spared. From that period the whole province returned to its
   allegiance to Honorius, and has since been obedient to the rulers of
   his appointment. Constantine, with his son Julian, was sent into Italy,
   but he was waylaid and killed. Not long afterwards Jovianus and
   Maximus, the tyrants above mentioned, Saros, and many others who had
   conspired against Honorius, were unexpectedly slain.

   Chapter XVI.--Honorius the Ruler, a Lover of God. Death of Honorius.
   His Successors, Valentinian, and Honoria his Daughter; the Peace which
   was then Worldwide.

   This is not the proper place to enter into the details concerning the
   deaths of the tyrants; [1640] but I considered it necessary to allude
   to the circumstance in order to show that to insure the stability of
   imperial power, it is sufficient for an emperor to serve God with
   reverence, which was the course pursued by Honorius. Galla Placidia,
   his sister, born of the same father as himself, dwelt with him, and
   likewise distinguished herself by real zeal in the maintenance of
   religion and of the churches. After Constantius, who was a brave and
   able general, had destroyed the tyrant Constantine, the emperor
   rewarded him by giving him his sister in marriage; he also bestowed
   upon him the ermine and purple, and admitted him to a share in the
   government. Constantius did not long survive the promotion; he died
   soon after, and left two children, Valentinian, who succeeded Honorius,
   and Honoria. Meanwhile the Eastern Empire was free from wars, and
   contrary to all opinion, its affairs were conducted with great order,
   for the ruler was still a youth. It seems as if God openly manifested
   His favor towards the present emperor, not only by disposing of warlike
   affairs in an unexpected way, but also by revealing the sacred bodies
   of many persons who were of old most distinguished for piety; among
   other relics, those of Zechariah, the very ancient prophet, and of
   Stephen, who was ordained deacon by the apostles, were discovered; and
   it seems incumbent upon me to describe the mode, since the discovery of
   each was marvelous and divine. [1641]

   [1641] He recounts the discovery of Zechariah only, while all the
   language here, and that of the beginning of the next chapter, indicates
   his intention to describe both. Could the work then have been
   concluded?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter XVII.--Discovery of the Relics of Zechariah the Prophet, and of
   Stephen the Proto-Martyr.

   I shall first speak of the relics of the prophet. [1642]
   Caphar-Zechariah is a village of the territory of Eleutheropolis, a
   city of Palestine. The land of this district was cultivated by
   Calemerus, a serf; he was well disposed to the owner, but hard,
   discontented, and unjust towards his neighboring peasants. Although he
   possessed these defects of character, the prophet stood by him in a
   dream, and manifested himself; pointing out a particular garden, he
   said to him, "Go, dig in that garden at the distance of two cubits from
   the hedge of the garden by the road leading to the city of Bitheribis.
   You will there find two coffins, the inner one of wood, the other of
   lead. Beside the coffins you will see a glass vessel full of water, and
   two serpents of moderate size, but tame, and perfectly innoxious, so
   that they seem to be used to being handled." Calemerus followed the
   directions of the prophet at the designated place and zealously applied
   himself to the task. When the sacred depository was disclosed by the
   afore-mentioned signs, the divine prophet appeared to him, clad in a
   white stole, which makes me think that he was a priest. At his feet
   outside of the coffin was lying a child which had been honored with a
   royal burial; for on its head was a golden crown, its feet were encased
   in golden sandals, and it was arrayed in a costly robe. The wise men
   and priests of the time were greatly perplexed about this child, who
   and whence he might be and for what reason he had been so clothed. It
   is said that Zechariah, the superior of a monastic community at Gerari,
   found an ancient document written in Hebrew, which had not been
   received among the canonical books. In this document it was stated that
   when Zechariah the prophet had been put to death by Joash, king of
   Judah, the family of the monarch was soon visited by a dire calamity;
   for on the seventh day after the death of the prophet, one of the sons
   of Joash, whom he tenderly loved, suddenly expired. Judging that this
   affliction was a special manifestation of Divine wrath, the king
   ordered his son to be interred at the feet of the prophet, as a kind of
   atonement for the crime against him. Such are the particulars which I
   have ascertained on the subject.

   Although the prophet had lain under the earth for so many generations,
   he appeared sound; his hair was closely shorn, his nose was straight;
   his beard moderately grown, his head quite short, his eyes rather
   sunken, and concealed by the eyebrows.
