SALVATION A DIFFICULT WORK.

   Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the

   105

SERMON IX.

THE DANGER OF MISTAKING KNOWLEDGE FOR OBEDIENCE.

   But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
   selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
   unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he beholdeth

THE REWARDS OF THE NEW CREATION.

   Then answered Peter and said unto Him, Behold, we have forsaken all,

   them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the
   regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory,
   ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
   Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
   sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my

GOD'S KINGDOM INVISIBLE.

   And when He was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God

   with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for,
   behold, the kingdom of God is within you.--St. Luke xvii. 20, 21.
   172

SERMON XIV.

THE DAILY SERVICE A LAW IN GOD'S KINGDOM.

   And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking
   bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and
   singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the
   people. And the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be
   saved.--Acts ii. 46, 47.
   186

THE HIDDEN LIFE.

   Your life is hid with Christ in God.--Colossians iii. 3.

   is willing, but the flesh is weak.--St. Matthew xxvi. 41.
   223

SERMON XVII.

SELF-OBLATION THE TRUE IDEA OF OBEDIENCE.

   For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
   sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how
   much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
   offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
   works to serve the living God?--Hebrews ix. 13, 14.
   242

SERMON XVIII.

THE SPIRITUAL CROSS.

   About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli,
   lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast Thou
   forsaken me?--St. Matthew xxvii. 46.
   258

   suffered.--Hebrews v. 8.
   287

SERMON XXI.

THE SLEEP OF THE FAITHFUL DEPARTED.

   I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which

THE WAITING OF THE INVISIBLE CHURCH.

   And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls
   of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony
   which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O
   Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them
   that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of
   them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little
   sea son, until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that
   should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.--Revelation vi. 9,
   10, 11.
   333

SERMON XXIV.

THE WAITING OF THE VISIBLE CHURCH.

   This I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they
   that have wives be as though they had none; and they that weep, as
   though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced
   not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use
   this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth
   away.--1 Corinthians vii. 29, 30, 31.
   349

SERMON XXV.

THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY.

SERMON I.

  THE MYSTERY OF SIN.

    ROMANS v. 12.

   "By one man sin entered into the world."

   PERHAPS there is no more awful thought than this: that sin is all
   around us and within us, and we know not what it is. We are beset by it
   on every side: it hangs upon us, hovers about us, casts itself across
   our path, hides itself where our next foot step is to fall, searches us
   through and through, listens at our heart, floats through all our
   thoughts, draws our will under its sway, and ourselves under its
   dominion; and we do not know what it is. It is a pestilence that
   walketh in darkness; nothing stays its advance; it passes through all
   barriers, pierces all strongholds; the very air seems to waft it into
   our dwellings. Now it is very awful to know this, and yet not to know
   what is this malign and deadly power. We read, that in the beginning
   sin was not in the world; that "by one man sin entered;" that here it
   has ever since abode; that it brought death with it; that "death passed
   upon all men, for that all have sinned."

   Thus much,, however, we do know, that it is a will opposed to the will
   of God. To make this more clear, let us consider, that whatsoever or
   whencesoever be the origin of sin, its home or dwelling is the moral
   nature of God's creatures. So far as we can understand, none but moral
   beings are capable of sin, because none but moral beings are
   responsible; that is, know good from evil, are on trial, are able to
   make choice, and are responsible for choosing. In this, we are only
   saying that the chief feature, or power, or endowment of a moral being,
   is a sense to discern, and a will to choose; and that, as to choose the
   good is holiness, so to choose the evil is sin. Consider next, that a
   will which chooses the evil is a will opposed to the will of God. Sin,
   therefore, is a quality, or inclination, or posture of the will of
   God's creatures, at variance with His own; or, to speak less exactly,
   but more simply, it is a will opposed to His.

   St. Paul says, "By one man"--that is, by the wilful act of one
   man--"sin entered into the world." And from this we may draw the
   following truths:--

   1 . First, that the entering in of sin proves the presence of an Evil
   Being. We talk of powers, and qualities, and principles, and
   oppositions, and the like; but we are only putting words for realities.
   They do not exist apart from beings create or uncreate; they are the
   attributes and energies of living spirits. Sin entered in through and
   by the Evil One; that is, the Devil. There is working in the world
   something which is not of God. All that He made was good; all was holy,
   and full of life, and immortal. The world was a manifestation of God,
   of His wisdom and His goodness; man was an image of His being and of
   His will. All was one; all moved in harmony, having one supreme and
   universal law. Things are now divided by a twofold movement, and are
   full of diversity and opposition, discord and warfare. An Evil One has
   entered, and spread his enmity throughout the world. For wise ends, God
   suffers this rebellion to smoulder in His kingdom. Though He might have
   girdled the world about with the precinct of His own holiness, so that
   sin should have never entered; though at a breath of His, even now, all
   should once more stretch out its hands without sin unto God; yet, for
   some unsearchable purposes of wisdom, He has, by the entering of the
   Evil One, permitted the unity of His works to be troubled, and the
   harmony of His creatures to be marred. It is most necessary for us ever
   to bear in mind the personality of Satan; for we are often wont to
   speak of sin, as we do of sicknesses or plagues, as if it were an
   impersonal thing; and we thereby lose all distinct perception of its
   power, deceitfulness, and malignity. Let us always remember that there
   is, in the world, as it were, a new law, opposed to the law of God; and
   administered by an Evil Being, who has entered and gained a hold in
   God's creation, and is therefore called "the prince of this world," [1]
   "the prince of the power of the air," "the spirit that worketh in the
   children of disobedience." [2]

   2. Another truth to be learned is, that, by the entering in of sin, a
   change passed upon the world itself. I am not now speaking of physical
   evil, such as dissolution and death, and the wasting away of God's
   works, and the like; but only of moral evil. A change passed upon the
   condition of man. His will revolted, and transferred its loyalty from
   God to the Evil One. By casting off his obedience to God, he lost his
   government over himself. So long as he was subject to the Divine will,
   he wielded an absolute power over his own nature. The passions and
   lusts of the flesh were then pure affections held in a bond of unity
   and subordination. When he rebelled against God, they rebelled against
   man; and the bond of their unity being broken, they warred against each
   other, and his will was dragged away into bondage by each in turn. And
   by this it came to pass that he lost his innocence; the presence of
   God, wherewith he was encompassed, departed from him, leaving him
   naked; fear cast out love; from thankful he became thankless; the lusts
   of the flesh soiled his spiritual being; his will caught the manifold
   taint of a world of evil; and through these dark avenues the wicked one
   gained a free entrance into his soul. He lay open to incursion on all
   sides. There were as many breaches as there were impure affections. And
   thus man's will became one with the will of the Evil One; and was so
   drawn to it as to move with it; and became a part of the evil which
   entered into the world. Thenceforward man was the representative of the
   alien and antagonist power which had broken the unity of God's kingdom;
   and his will was bent in a direct opposition to the will of God. Such,
   then, as I said before, is sin.

   There are one or two further remarks to be made on this subject.

   And first, that this awful principle of sin has been ever multiplying
   itself from the beginning of the world. It so clave to the life of man,
   that as living souls were multiplied, sin in them was multiplied also.
   Adam "begat a son in his own likeness." And every several will born
   into this world, is born at variance with God. "That which is born of
   the flesh is flesh." [3] "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it
   is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." [4] Every
   several man contains in him the whole mystery of the fall, the whole
   principle of evil. It may be said, that at the birth of every man sin
   enters into the world. All along the line of these six thou sand years,
   every one of the countless generations of mankind bears the full
   dilated image of the first fallen man. So was the earth peopled, from
   the first-born of Adam to the great family of all nations and languages
   and people and tongues, ever multiplying, ever replenishing itself. As
   sin, through the power of death, withers off generation after
   generation, so does it by its fearful hold in the being of man,
   perpetually reproduce itself. And here it still abides in God's world,
   carrying on unceasing, universal warfare against Heaven. In the
   beginning there was one man at variance with his Maker. Now there is an
   untold array of disobedient wills. Even the blessing of fruitfulness,
   which God breathed upon the earth, has become the channel through which
   the mystery of evil perpetuates, distributes, and multiplies itself.
   Such is the fall of the world, and such by nature are we ourselves.
   Well may we stand in awe of our mysterious being, and pray to be
   delivered "from the body of this death."

   Another remark is this, that as sin has multi plied in its extent, so
   it would seem also to have become more intense in its character. It is
   plain, that in every man born into this world there is the whole of
   Adam's fallen nature. The fault and corruption is in us; so that we are
   every one "very far gone from original righteousness/ and are of our
   own nature inclined to evil. We are born out casts from God's presence,
   sullied, alienated, and opposed. Such we are, I say, by nature: but we
   become (except through God's grace we repent) far worse in act. When
   the living powers which are in us become unfolded into energy, the evil
   that cleaves to them unfolds with them. What we were before only in
   bias or inclination, we afterwards become in consciousness and will;
   what we were only in a leaning, we become after wards in a habit; and a
   habit of sin is original sin full grown, and multiplied both in the
   manifold kind and energy of evil. It is plain to all, that (except, as
   I said, in penitents) the whole life of a man from birth to death is a
   deterioration. He is ever becoming worse. Time, opportunity,
   temptation, are necessary to quicken and unfold all that lies wrapped
   up in his birth-sin; and all these are ministered to him day by day.
   The faults of childhood grow into the sins of boyhood, and these grow
   vivid and intense, and burst out into the manifold guilt of after-life;
   and as the heart throws up new lusts continually, so does the perverted
   reason complicate itself into crookedness and cunning. Who does not see
   that, except a man day by day grows better, he must needs grow worse?
   Even they whose sins do not grow more open and profligate, are
   nevertheless deteriorating. They grow impure in thought and will, if
   not in act; or hard, worldly, selfish, and unthankful; or irreverent
   and consciously alienated from God; or they live on in the world
   without love to God, and every year chills and deadens them more and
   more. Now what is all this but original sin multiplying in kind and
   energy, and ever growing more exceeding sinful? Better were it for us
   that we had never been born; or, if born, that we had passed with no
   more than the taint of our birth-sin to the tribunal of Christ, than
   that we should live on only to become two fold more the children of
   hell than before.

   And if this be true of individual men, must it not also be true of all
   mankind? Must not the world, in its long life of six thousand years,
   have grown worse than it was in the beginning? Has not the birth-sin of
   the world, so to speak, unfolded itself into the variety and energy of
   a fuller and maturer wickedness? I think it is plain, from reason and
   from holy Scripture, that such a process of deterioration has been
   going on: that the mystery of evil, no less than the mystery of
   godliness, has been strengthening and unfolding itself. Now we must not
   be led astray by illustrations. The life of the world is not like, but
   analogous to, the life of an individual man. Three generations of men
   are not like the yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow of a single being. We
   carry on with us from day to day the whole moral context of the day
   gone by. We are to-day all we were yesterday, and something more. We
   have no breaks in our personal identity--no new beginnings of our moral
   life. We do not revert continually to our first original. But all this
   is true of the world, and of mankind as a living race. The mystery of
   original sin is begun over and over again with each successive
   generation. Men grow up to a certain height of the moral stature, and
   are cut down and laid in the earth: their children rise up more or less
   to the same standard, within certain limits which are the conditions of
   our being and of our probation. The days of our age are threescore
   years and ten; though some men be so strong that they come to fourscore
   years. And in this short race every man has his own beginning and
   ending of moral life.

   All this indeed is very true; but it is no less certain, that there is
   a growth and accumulation of evil which in the life of the world is
   analogous to the deterioration of character in an individual man. What
   we read in the book of Genesis is proof enough. We no sooner read that
   "men began to multiply upon the face of the earth/ than we also read,
   "and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
   that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually; and it repented the Lord that He had made man on the
   earth, and it grieved Him at His heart." [5] Now the whole history of
   the Bible shews us a continual unfolding of the sin of man. To the
   first act of a disobedient will, were added the shedding of a brother's
   blood, the great and unexplained fall of "the sons of God," and the
   sins which called down a decree rescinding the law of creation, and
   brought the flood upon the earth. Then through Ham, who was as the
   original sin of the new world, came again transgression; and Noah
   sinned, and idolatry filled the earth, and God gave men up to a
   reprobate mind. Then again in Abraham began a new age; and once more
   the line of sin reappeared through Abraham, Jacob, Aaron, Moses, David,
   even the chief of God's saints; after a while the people fell into
   idolatry, and then into unbelief, and crucified the Lord of Glory. And
   then, again, began the new creation; and among the Apostles there was
   Judas, the fore runner of sin in the world of the regenerate. And it
   was expressly foretold by the Spirit, that in the latter days there
   should be perilous times, and a falling away from God. And what holy
   Scripture thus declares to us, we see actually fulfilled. The history
   of the Catholic Church shews that there has been a deterioration
   analogous to the earlier declensions of mankind. I am not now speaking
   of the work of regeneration, which also has been going on in the midst
   of this unfolding of evil. The saints have been each one growing
   holier; and the Church has been edified continually, and is rising
   towards its perfection. I am speaking not of the Church, but of the
   world, and only notice it lest it should seem to be an objection which
   has been overlooked. From all this it is plain that there have been
   four great ages of the world; that is, from Adam to Noah, from Noah to
   Abraham, from Abraham to the coming of our Lord, and from the coming of
   our Lord to this day. Scripture tells us that in the first three there
   was a declension from God. It foretells it of the fourth, in which we
   live; and the history of Christendom already shews the partial
   fulfilment of the prophecy. From these great facts, let us look to the
   laws on which they rest. These broad declensions of mankind are the
   direct and necessary consequence of the progressive deterioration of
   the individual character; the manifold inventiveness of sin; the
   universal contagion of moral evil; the infinite multiplication and
   refinement in the forms of disobedience, arising from the interchange
   of personal or national corruptions; the accumulating power of
   tradition, which gathers up and embodies the characteristic sins of
   every successive generation, and creates a new moral world--a world of
   wrong and darkness and deceit--into which the next generation enters at
   its birth. Sin is born in us; and we are born into a world of its own
   creating. There is hanging between the soul of man and the realities of
   God, a veil wrought up of lying visions: upon it are traced the
   dazzling forms which allure the sin that is in him to put itself forth
   in wilful acts of evil. Who can doubt that they who were born in the
   later times of a declining age,--as, for in stance, a generation before
   the flood,--were born into a darker, more inveterate, and therefore a
   more wicked world, than they who followed soon after the first sin of
   man? St. Paul, in the first chapter of his epistle to the Romans,
   teaches us how the sins of the heathen world little by little reached
   their height; how they began in a shrinking of the heart from God, and
   then through pride men fell into ignorance, and through ignorance into
   the most horrible rebellions against the laws of nature--of laws, that
   is, which are written even in the passive and lower nature of
   man--instincts obeyed by the beasts that perish. Idolatry, again, was a
   sin of slow and subtle growth. A long course of sin was needed, so to
   deaden and blind the heart of man as to make idolatry possible. Age
   after age gave in its contribution: there was a sort of tide, an unseen
   cur rent, swelled by many feeding streams, which bore along every
   generation, as one followed another, in the same line; so that, besides
   the original sin of each man, there was a sinful tradition of man kind,
   which excited, and unfolded, and ripened, and carried it to a maturity
   and strength which it would not otherwise attain; and every generation
   contributed somewhat to this onward tide, and bequeathed to the next a
   further measure of declension from God.

   It may be objected, that, nevertheless, there has been an advance both
   in the moral and intellectual state of mankind, and that this view,
   therefore, cannot be true. To which it may be said, first, that such an
   advance would not prove, that the tendency of sin is not to multiply
   itself and to grow more intensely sinful; but that God, in His mercy,
   is working even more mightily, counteracting all, both the original and
   accumulated powers of evil. And that is most certainly true. "Where sin
   abounded, there did grace much more abound." But this is not our
   subject: we are speaking of the unfolding of the power of sin in the
   world, which is no less certain than the gracious unfolding of the
   mystery of godliness, which shall overcome and cast it out at the last.
   And so, again, it must be said of the alleged advance of the moral and
   intellectual state of man. It is certain that in Christendom there is
   neither the blind idolatry nor the gross corruptions of the heathen. Be
   it so; but there are sins both of the flesh and spirit such as the
   heathen never knew. The form may be changed; the outward grossness may
   be purged off. There may be sins having less that is akin to the
   unreasonable creatures of God, but a nearer fellowship with Satan. The
   personal guilt may be no less; the opposition of the will to the will
   of God may be greater. And this is the true life and malignity of sin.
   Adam's sin had in it little of grossness, but it was intensely
   guilty--the more so because he was fresh from the hand of his Maker: he
   was nigh to God, and God held converse with him. Even so it is with
   Christendom: the sins of Christians, though they are refined and
   reduced to never so small a measure, are greater and guiltier far than
   the sins of Tyre and Sidon. It is Capernaum that shall be thrust down
   to hell. Christendom, as Adam was, is new from the hand of God. He is
   in the midst of it; He has filled it with the light of His presence;
   His mercy, His truth, His Spirit, are revealed in it. We are near God,
   and He has brought us to an awful fellowship with Himself. As the
   mystery of godliness has unfolded in the midst of us, and the light of
   it has been forced into the conscience of Christendom, so do even the
   lesser sins of men become far guiltier. They are committed against more
   light, more grace, greater mercies, louder warnings--in despite of the
   inward pleadings and drawings of the Spirit of life. It may be, that in
   Christians a common lie is guiltier than the sin of Achan, and the
   visions of the imagination than the sin of David; and if so, then it
   may be a more conscious, naked, wilful act of disobedience in
   Christians to oppose the law of God in the least, than in the blind
   unconverted heathen to transgress it in the greatest. And therefore it
   may be that a multitude of sins, in deed and in thought, which are
   deemed to be consistent with the context of a refined life, are far
   more intense provocations of the Divine Majesty, and express a far more
   resolute opposition to the Divine will, than the impure idolatries of
   the Gentiles, or even the backslidings of the Jews. And, once more,
   what shall we say of heresy; that is, obstinate resistance to the light
   of truth? And, above all, of infidelity? What must be the intensity of
   spiritual evil in such a sin! How pure from all grossness; how keen and
   disembodied, so to speak, and yet how nearly akin to Satan! And these
   are sins, I may say, peculiar to Christendom--characteristic, above
   all, of what is called an enlightened or intellectual age. What were
   the heresies of the Docetae, or the Cerinthians, or the Montanists,
   compared with the scoffing, ribald infidelity which reared itself up in
   the bosom of the Church a hundred and fifty years ago? Even where
   infidelity did not issue (which was seldom enough) in the lowest
   sensuality, yet what a temper of cold, proud resistance--what an
   energetic variance of will to the mind of God was there in the heart of
   an infidel! What a prodigy in God's world is a professing atheist!
   These are fruits not of the green tree, but of the dry. They were not
   put forth in the beginning of the new creation; but in the latter days,
   when, according to prophecy, there have come "scoffers walking after
   their own lusts:" when we see on every side the words of St. Paul
   coming to pass: "This know also that in the last days perilous times
   shall come; for men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
   boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
   unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,
   incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady,
   high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God." [6] One more
   fact will be enough. If any man would see the multiplying power and
   intensity of spiritual evil, let him compare the unity of the Church in
   the beginning with the schisms of Christendom now. "The same sin which
   entered and destroyed the unity of the whole creation, has reentered
   and broken up again the restored unity of the new. But, to leave both
   the past and the present, let us remember that the time is not yet
   come. The full unfolding of sin has ever been at the close of the
   dispensations of God; it has been at its worst when He was nearest. So,
   we are taught, it shall be again. All God's Word foretells it; all the
   face of the world bespeaks the working out of the prophecy. The day of
   Christ shall not come, until there "come a falling away first, and that
   wicked be revealed." The mystery of evil, which by one man entered into
   the world, is now teeming with its mightiest birth. Men have sinned
   long and sinned greatly against Heaven; but there is a warfare coming,
   a strife of man's will against the will of God, in the surpassing
   tumult of which shall all former disobedience be forgotten. The Evil
   One shall be loosed upon the earth, having great wrath, "because he
   knoweth he hath but a short time." And all things are making ready for
   him: the powers of spiritual wickedness marshalling themselves in
   secret, unfolding their legions, and unrolling their banners around the
   camp of the saints. Hell is moving itself to meet his coming. And then
   shall the sin which by one man entered into the creation of God be at
   its full, and the world-long growth and gathering of this awful mystery
   be accomplished. It shall at last stand forth in the earth, at the full
   stature of its hate and daring against heaven; and by the coming of the
   Son of Man in glory shall be cast out for ever.

SERMON II.

  CHRISTIANS NEW CREATURES.

    2 COR. v. 17.

   "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed
   away; behold, all things are become new."

   SUCH is the change which passes upon Christians through the power of
   Christ their Lord: they are made new creatures. And this deep mystery
   of our own renewed being flows out of the mystery of Christ's
   incarnation. He took our manhood and made it new in Himself, that we
   might be made new in Him. He hallowed our manhood, and carried it up
   into the presence of His Father as the first sheaf of the coming
   harvest, and the first-fruits of a new creation. And we shall be made
   new creatures through the same power by which He was made man--by the
   overshadowing of the Holy Ghost. He was born in the flesh, we in the
   Spirit: His birth is the symbol of our regeneration, and we shall
   therefore be conformed to His likeness. "Now are we the sons of God,
   and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that when He
   shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is." [7]
   In the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of
   His kingdom, that is, at the resurrection of the dead and the
   restitution of all things, we shall be born again of the earth, as Adam
   in the beginning. In the day-spring of the resurrection the dew of our
   birth shall be of the womb of the morning.

   So much we know generally, and of the future. But St. Paul says, "If
   any man be in Christ he is a new creature." There is, therefore, a
   particular and a present sense in which this is true; and this it
   concerns us most of all to know. We will see, then, how it is that we
   may be said to be new creatures now; and afterwards we may learn some
   useful lessons from it.

   1. And, first, we are made new creatures by a present change working in
   our moral nature; that is to say, through our regeneration in holy
   baptism. By the love of God electing us to a new birth of the Spirit,
   and by the Holy Ghost working through that visible sacrament, we are
   translated from wrath to grace, from the power of darkness to the
   kingdom of His dear Son. Old things pass away, and all things become
   new around the regenerate man. We look upward to a new heaven; we stand
   upon a new earth: both are reconciled; heaven, through the
   blood-shedding of Christ, is opened to all believers; and earth, healed
   of the original curse, is pledged to restore its dead. We are brought
   under the shadow of the Cross, within whose do minion the powers of sin
   are bound. We receive that thing which by nature we cannot have--a
   baptism not of water only, but of the Holy Ghost. It does not more
   become us to search into God's secret manner of working in holy
   baptism, than in the holy eucharist; both are sacraments, both
   mysteries, both symbols of the eye, both gifts of grace to the soul of
   man. In baptism we are made new creatures, so that we may grow daily to
   the sanctity of angels, or so that we may fall, and hold our
   regeneration in unrighteousness,--as angels that kept not their first
   estate hold their angelic nature still in anguish and in warfare
   against God.

   2. But further; Christians are new creatures by present, ever-growing
   holiness of life--by the renewing of their very inmost soul. They are
   absolutely new creatures--new in the truth of moral reality: new
   altogether, but still the same. I will pass by the grosser kinds of
   sin, for instance, profligacy of life, mockery of religion, or
   unbelief, and take for example two men of opposite characters; a pure
   man, whose heart and imagination is hallowed by the Spirit of Christ;
   and an impure man, whose thoughts and associations are sullied and
   defiled. Or take a watchful, self-denying man, who brings under his
   body, and keeps it in subjection, so as to be ever vigilant, instant in
   prayer, thoughtful, fond of solitude and of lonely converse with God in
   secret; and compare him with the heavy, surfeited man--not the gross
   winebibber or glutton alone, but the man that gives himself a full
   range and measure in all things lawful, and of common life, so as to
   over-burden his soul with the cloying of the sated body, and deaden the
   keen tact of conscience, and smother the struggling pulses of his
   spiritual being. This is a very common character among people that are
   not religious. What can be more contrary, more altogether several and
   distinct, than two such men? Or, to take another instance. We see some
   men large-hearted and generous, denying themselves, almost above
   measure, that they may give to the poor and to the work of Christ. They
   kindle with every man's joy, rejoice in his good, make festival with
   him for the abounding of his happiness; they have tears for the broken
   in heart, and seem to pass into the place of departed friends as if
   they were the same loved spirit in another guise--they live, as we say,
   in other men. And let us compare with such the man who is greedy of
   gain; who has an evil eye when his neighbour prospers, is busy and
   blithe when another is stripped and smitten. Such men are often seen.
   They are men shrewd in the world's cunning; men of skill in doubling
   all the changes of life, and in meeting its emergencies. They have a
   sail for every wind; they are far-sighted and practical; careful of
   money, but not hard; not absolutely refusing to give, but giving
   scantily, as buying themselves off cheaply, yet always strictly within
   the constituted laws of right and honour. Or, to take a last and
   all-comprehending contrast,--look at the penitent sinner, calm and
   self-collected, of a gentle bearing and a gentler spirit; shrinking
   from the approaches of sin by an unerring and almost unconscious
   instinct; weeping for the sins of other men; mourning in spirit at the
   recollection of past falls; hating the passing thoughts of evil which
   overcloud his soul; not only confessing before His Father in secret the
   sins of every day, but condemning himself as guilty for the very
   susceptibility of temptation. And then look at a man of no great
   grossness of life--a sinner of the common sort--hardy, self-trusting,
   venturous in the midst of evil, unconscious of its dominion. Evil words
   and thoughts do not grieve him; he regards them as unrealities. After
   he has sinned greatly, perhaps he is a little grieved; for a passing
   moment he is angry and irritable: but he shrinks the more from
   God--turns to business--tries to fill his thoughts and wait for
   to-morrow, remembering how often a little time has deadened his first
   remorse, and put back his old heart into him again. Now, in all these
   contrasted characters there is one common basis; there is one common
   nature--moral and responsible,--a heart, a conscience, a will. They are
   individuals of the same race and family, so alike in kind as to be one;
   but so different in character, so diametrically opposed by the
   antagonist forces of moral energy, that no two other things can be more
   two than they are. They have no fellowship, no common language. They
   are each to the other unintelligible riddles.

   And now let us take not two men of two characters, but the same man at
   two stages of his moral life.

   If we could compare what the lurking power of our birth-sin would have
   made a man, who from holy baptism has been shielded and sanctified,
   with the actual energetic holiness to which the grace of God has
   wrought his inmost being, we should understand the deep mystery lying
   in the words, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." But as
   we can measure powers only in their effects, we must take the common
   case of a man in whom an after-repentance and change of heart abolishes
   his former self. Compare together the earlier and the latter state of
   the man who was once impure, and is now chaste; who was luxurious, and
   is now mortified in the flesh; who was grasping and worldly, and now
   vests the right and disposal of all he has in Christ his Lord; who was
   once dead and impenitent, and is now broken in heart; though, by the
   line of identity which runs deeply through all his life, in boyhood,
   youth, and man hood, binding all his years, with all their burden of
   good and ill, in one single consciousness; and by the stern rule of
   moral responsibility, which rivets with an iron bond his former self
   about him to the last,--though by these laws of our being he is one and
   the same man still, yet in all other things he is so two as light and
   darkness cannot be more distinct.

   And that because two wills bent contrary ways are, in moral truth, not
   more two than one which has had two contrary determinations. It is not
   in the multitude of wills that men are so truly several and divided as
   in their contrary and conflicting bias. All the lights of heaven, and
   all the water-springs of the earth, all the angels of God, all spirits
   and souls of the righteous, are but one in the sameness of their common
   nature. They are all a perfect unity. It is moral contradiction--moral
   conflict--the clash of moral antagonists, that makes God and man to be
   two, and the race of man as divided as it is numerous; and so is it in
   every living soul changed by the grace of God. He was an evil being, he
   is a holy one; that is, he was an old, he is a new creature. Such were
   Manasseh and Magdalene; such the apostle Paul; such was even St. John,
   once ambitious and fiery, but afterwards meek and patient, taking the
   scourge with joy for his Master's sake. For he, too, had grown into a
   new creature. He had learned things unutterable, lying on his Master's
   bosom; he had there looked with stedfast gaze into the clear depths of
   the Redeemer's love, and by gazing he had grown into the likeness of
   his Lord. Such is the law of our regeneration; and so must we be ever
   changing from old to new. It is a change as searching and as absolute
   as can be in the limits of the same being. When the flesh is subdued to
   the spirit, and Satan bruised under our feet, this old world passes
   away as a shadow, and the new stands out as the visible reality from
   which the shadow fell: and the whole man grows into a saint. The low
   liest and most unlettered man, to whom written books are mysteries--the
   tiller of the ground--the toiling craftsman--the weary trader--the poor
   mother fostering her children for God--the little ones whose angels do
   always behold the face of their Father in heaven,--all these, by the
   Spirit of Christ working in them, are changed into a saintly newness,
   and serve with angels, and look into the mystery of God with cherubim,
   and adore with the seraphim of glory.

   Now, if this is to be a new creature, we may well stand in awe of our
   great and holy calling to be members of Christ. What an awful change
   has passed upon each one of us when we knew it not! How fearful is the
   relation into which we have been brought to the spiritual world! how
   nigh to the unseen presence of the Word made flesh, and to the person
   of the Holy Ghost! How appalling, then, is this view of our state as
   Christians! We are wont to look without reflection on the lives of men
   baptised like ourselves, and to think that such high mysteries cannot
   be literally understood; that they must needs be lowered by
   explanations, so as to accord with the mingled state of the visible
   Church; because we plainly see that the state of baptised men is, for
   the most part, very far from the spiritual condition expressed in these
   mysterious words.

   For instance, what are we to say of sinful Christians? how are they new
   creatures? how are they in Christ? and if not in Christ, what is their
   state? and what must be their end? Surely, a man may say, they cannot
   be new creatures. In them old things are not passed away; their old
   sins are loved as much as ever, their old lusts as much pampered, their
   old habits as much indulged. All their old ways are still about
   them,--neglect of prayer and of the holy Communion, quick tempers,
   biting words, evil thoughts, trifling with sin, impenitent
   recollections of past wickedness--all these hang about them, and they
   are unchanged; and yet, for all that, they are in Christ: well were it
   if they were not so--this, indeed, is their condemnation. They are
   members of His body; they have received that thing which by nature they
   could not have; they have resisted God and held His grace in
   unrighteousness. Simon Magus was not sanctified, but he was baptised,
   and his baptism was his condemnation. The profaners of the holy
   Sacrament of the Lord's body and blood at Corinth ate and drank their
   own condemnation; holy things turned in their hands to poison. Well
   were it had it been common water, bread, and wine,--but they were
   consecrated. We know not what sinning in holy things may do; nor what
   tampering with evil may challenge at God's hand. Saul sought to witch
   craft, and the Lord raised up Samuel to foretell his death. Balaam
   tempted the Lord, and an angel withstood him in the way, and would have
   slain him while he knew it not. The sins of men baptised into Christ
   are worse than the sins of heathen. The handling of holy things without
   holiness is an awful mystery of condemnation. Yet all such men are
   branches in the vine, though dying or dead--twice dead, waiting for the
   sharp sickle and the burning--yet branches still; and in hell, it may
   be, the water of baptism shall scorch more fiercely than the fire that
   is not quenched, and the Cross which was drawn upon their foreheads eat
   into the soul as if it were graven with a finger of flame.

   Again; we may ask the same question, not about greater sinners only,
   but about all Christians. There is no man that liveth and sinneth not;
   and how shall it be said of any living soul beset by sin, that he is a
   new creature? Where is the man that does not feel a conscious oneness
   with his former guilty self? Who does not feel within the smiting of
   conscience, the vivid recollection of past sins, with all their colour
   and aggravation; how he tempted the temptation, how he courted the sin,
   how forgot his resolutions; or how he remembered his prayers, but
   sinned against them; how he knew his own peril, but betrayed himself?
   Who does not feel himself at times haunted by the self of other days,
   which seems to rise up as a spirit of darkness, and cast a spell upon
   him, and fix him with its eye? It fascinates him, so as well nigh to
   draw his gaze from Christ. In such a time it is hard for a man to
   believe that he is indeed a new creature. And still the more when the
   power of old habits, and the strength of old temptations, seem for a
   time to prevail: when, even in the holiest seasons--in prayer and in
   the holy Eucharist--thoughts once pampered and familiar thrust
   themselves unbidden now into the abode where they were wont to be
   welcomed before. Some times we are all but driven to believe; Surely I
   am unchanged; old things lie heavily upon me, and crush the very life
   of my soul. "Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"

   Let us therefore learn some lessons of encouragement. Unlikely as it
   may seem, our most confident and cheering hopes will be found to arise
   out of the awful reality of our regeneration. It is be cause we have
   been born again, that we have reason to be of good courage. You have
   the tokens of this change, faint though they be, upon you now. It is
   true of you, that in pledge and power old things are passed away. It is
   a new thing to hate what you once loved, to weep over what you once
   rejoiced in, to feel what was once unheeded. What is this but the
   yearning of the new creature to burst the bondage of corruption? In
   you, then, old things are passed, as the night is passed when the
   darkness is driven before the coming day; and new things are come, as
   the day is come when the white morning steals up the sky. There may be
   thronging clouds and weeping showers before mid-day, but to every
   penitent man the noon shall come at last. The gift of a new birth is in
   you; the earnest is given; and in every one that endureth, He that hath
   begun the good work will perfect it until the day of Christ. By one
   baptism for the remission of sins your transgressions are blotted out.
   They have passed from the book of God; and all of the former self that
   cleaves and clings about you, God shall disentangle and destroy. The
   past self of a penitent man is, after a wonderful manner, purged, and
   his losses, in some part at least, restored. "I will restore to you the
   years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar,
   and the palmer-worm." [8] Though, doubtless, not without some tokens of
   an inscrutable forfeiture still abiding, they that truly repent and
   return to the grace of their regeneration are made to partake once more
   of the freshness and fragrancy of heart which is the inheritance of the
   sons of God. Be of good cheer, then; the trials and the buffetings of
   evil are no more than the churlish days and raving storms which come
   between the seed-time and the harvest. The clinging taint of sins gone
   by shall ere long be cleansed; only make sure of your repentance before
   God, a repentance that shrinks from a thought of evil as from the
   second death; and He will finish His own work.

   And, lastly; live above this world, as partakers of the new creation.
   He that is "the beginning of the creation of God" is knitting together
   in one His mystical body, making up the number of His elect; and to
   this end is He working in each one of us, cleansing and renewing us
   after His own image. All things about us teem with a new perfection.
   For a while it must needs be that our eyes are holden: were they but
   opened, we should understand that even now are we in the heavenly city.
   Its walls stand round about us; and they that were seen in Dothan walk
   in its streets of gold. We know not how nigh are the great realities of
   the world unseen; how truly they are here, though we see them not; how
   closely and awfully we are related to them by our regeneration.
   Therefore be it our care to live under an habitual consciousness that
   we are new creatures, striving day by day to disentangle ourselves from
   the clinging toils by which this old and fallen world draws us to
   itself, and having our "life hid with Christ in God." And, as a way to
   this severer life of faith, live according to the rule of His Church on
   earth. She bids you to confession, and prayer, and praise, to
   thanksgiving, and homage. She bids you to fasts and festivals, to
   sorrow and rejoicing. What are all her chants, and oblations, and
   solemn assemblies, but the voices, and songs, and gatherings, and
   marriage-feastings of the new creation? They are earthly shadows of an
   heavenly gladness. Brethren, look through them; and, as through a veil
   and a parable, you shall see Christ your Lord, changing old things into
   new. They do but slightly veil His unseen presence from the eye of
   flesh. To the eye of faith they are as trans parent as the light of
   noon. The whole Church is a sacrament of His presence; and in all parts
   of it, the man that seeks Him in purity of heart shall see Him with
   open face.

SERMON III.

  ON FALLING FROM THE GRACE OF BAPTISM,

    ST. LUKE xvii. 32.

   "Remember Lot's wife."

   THIS warning, taken from the familiar history of the Jews, is a part of
   our Lord's answer to those that asked when the kingdom of God should
   come. He warned them that it should come with no out ward and visible
   tokens--with few forerunning signs; and even those such as the faithful
   alone should read. "As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also
   in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married
   wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into
   the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. Likewise, also, as
   it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they
   sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of
   Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them
   all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
   In that day, he which shall be upon the house-top, and his stuff in the
   house, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the
   field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot's wife." [9] Now,
   in thus calling up to their recollection the judgments of God in old
   time, our Lord teaches us to recognise the mysterious movements of His
   providential order, and to learn the broad analogies by which they are
   controlled. The flood of waters, and the over throw of Sodom, were
   forerunning types of judgments yet to come. In the spirit of prophetic
   warning He thus foreshewed the overthrow of Jerusalem, and the
   hair-breadth escape which was then awaiting them. But all these,
   including this also, were no more than types foreshortened, as it were,
   one behind the other, of His last coming at the end of the world. As
   they were in suddenness and severity, so, beyond all, shall the last
   coming be. As the escape of Lot, and of the remnant who were faithful
   in Jerusalem, even so also shall be the saving of the righteous; for
   the righteous shall "scarcely be saved." As the judgment on Lot's wife,
   so likewise shall be the doom of apostate Christians.

   And this is the only point we will now dwell upon. We have in this a
   warning of a peculiar character; we see in it an example of the just
   wrath of God against those who, having been once mercifully delivered,
   shall afterwards fall back. She was, by a distinguishing election of
   God, and by the hands of angels, saved from the overthrow of the
   wicked. We, by the same deep counsel of God, have been translated from
   death to life. She perished in the very way of safety. Let him that
   thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. Lot's wife is an example
   of those who fall from baptismal grace.

   As, for instance, of those who, having been made partakers of salvation
   by baptism into the Church of Christ, fall away from it through the
   overmastering power of sin. That a man may fall finally, and without
   hope, from grace given, is broadly written in holy Scripture. Men would
   fain have it otherwise; and some beguile themselves by the dream, that
   they magnify the mercies of God in contending that the gifts of grace
   are indefectible. Let them beware how they offer strange fire upon
   God's altar. God will be served only of that which His Spirit hath
   consecrated to Himself. "When the righteous turneth away from his
   righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the
   abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his
   righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass
   that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them
   shall he die." [10] Again: "If we sin wilfully after we have received
   the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins;
   but a certain fearful looking for of fiery indignation, which shall
   devour the adversaries. He that despised Moses' law died without mercy
   under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,
   shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God,
   and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
   sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of
   grace?" [11] And once more: "It is impossible for those who were once
   enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made
   partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and
   the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to renew them
   again unto repentance; seeing they crucify unto themselves the Son of
   God afresh, and put Him to an open shame. For the earth which drinketh
   in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for
   them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God; but that which
   beareth thorns and briars is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose
   end is to be burned." [12] Such is the gift of a new birth, held in
   unrighteousness; and such the end to which every baptised man, who
   lives in wilful and conscious sin, is perpetually tending. The sins of
   the flesh and of the spirit wound his inmost soul with a keen and
   poisoned edge; and the wounds rankle inwardly where no eye but God's
   can reach. There are very many who in the visible relations of life are
   without reproach, and yet carry within a heart-sin, indulged in secret,
   which eats into their whole spiritual life with a most deadly
   corruption. They have been redeemed from death, and predestined to
   immortality, though they are dying in the very path to life. Such are
   the sensual, the unchaste, the intemperate, the proud, the revengeful,
   and the like.

   But we must not narrow this warning to the grosser kinds of sin. The
   disobedience of Lot's wife was not that she went back to Sodom, but
   that she looked back. Doubtless she verily thought that she was
   pressing on to safety; but her heart was not right in her. She was
   disobedient in will, and in the hankerings and longings of the mind.
   The unchanged bent of the heart found expression in a slight but
   significant act. She looked back: and that forbidden gaze betrayed a
   multitude of unchastened thoughts, and a world of disobedience.

   We must, therefore, apply this same warning not only to those who,
   through the power of indulged sin, fall grossly from baptismal grace,
   but also to all who, in any way, and for any hindering cause, fall back
   from the holiness of life, of which baptism is both the source and
   standard. By your baptism you are pledged to a life of sanctity. The
   life of Christ is your example. Your calling is, to be ever growing in
   likeness to the Son of God. Who, then, is there that needs not to
   remember Lot's wife? Who of us is so inflexibly bent to wards God, as
   not to be often wavering? whose face so stedfastly set to Zoar, as
   never to look aside--as never to look back? Where is the man who has so
   repented of past evil, that he does not sometimes cast back, in unwary
   thoughts, a hankering look behind? Who has so gained the mastery of
   himself, as not to be again overmastered? Who has so renounced the
   world, as not to wax weak at its allurements? Who has so braced himself
   to the secret discipline of a self-denying life, as not at times to
   shrink from the hardness he has chosen for his portion? Well is it, and
   better than we dare hope, if there be none here among us, who, after
   renouncing a vain, trifling, self-pleasing life, have again yielded
   themselves, little by little, to be led by the gaudy follies of the
   world; none whom the opposition of men with out God, or the jeering
   banter of supercilious minds, or the imposing comments of
   self-important people, have not slackened, if not checked, in their
   flight from eternal death. Too surely there are such among us. The
   world has a clinging hold; and gain, and ease, and levity, and the
   pomps of life, are cunning baits; and gibes, and laughter, and the
   grave mockery of familiar friends, are keen weapons of offence; and it
   is no easy task to bear up against the stream which is ever setting
   away from God, and to keep the eye of the soul ever waking, and to live
   in conscious fellowship with the world unseen. It is our natural bias
   to decline from God. There is somewhat within us which is ever
   slackening its intention, ever rekindling its old imaginations, ever
   feeling around for its old sup ports, ever looking back on its former
   self. What we once were cleaves so closely to us, that we shall never
   be wholly free till the morning of the resurrection. The holiness to
   which our baptism has pledged us is so pure and high, that we faint at
   the greatness of our way. Of the whole body of baptised men on earth,
   none are perfect--few are near perfection--many, it must be feared, are
   energetically evil. And between these two extremes is every measure of
   approach or departure from God; and on this twofold movement men are
   perpetually passing and repassing, in the manifold changes of their
   moral state, and in the partial relapses and recoveries of their
   spiritual life.

   Now, from all this we must learn, first, that any measure of declension
   from our baptismal grace is a measure of that same decline of which the
   end is, a hopeless fall from God. I say, it is a measure of the same
   movement; as a day is a measure of a thousand years. It is a state and
   inclination of heart which differs from absolute apostacy not in kind,
   but only in degree. Surely, the first symptoms, all slight though they
   be, of a pestilence, which is beyond the skill of healing, must needs
   be greatly feared. Such are small sins, slight tamperings with the edge
   of conscience, half-unwilling returns to forsaken evil, passive
   re-admission of once-banished faults; all these are the first
   beginnings of an impulse and a direction which leads to a settled
   determination of the heart from God. Every day the deposed powers of
   evil steal back, and re-assert their dominion: first, a failing, then
   faults, then a sin, then a mingled throng of lesser acts of
   disobedience--willed, not done, be cause, though longed for, not as yet
   ventured on; and so the whole character recoils in all its parts from
   God. How often do we see such examples in those who have been brought
   to better thoughts by a sharp and threatening sickness, or by a heart
   breaking cross m life, or by the edge of a cutting sorrow; and yet
   afterwards, in the restored buoyancy of health or heart, have inwardly
   declined from the warmth and sincerity of their better resolutions! It
   may be they were earnest for a long season, and moved on a higher
   level, had loftier aspirations, purer joys, and keener sympathies. But,
   after all, by slight relapses, they sunk back, and grew commonplace,
   and ended in a low, dull, dubious life, upon the very boundaries of
   wilful disobedience.

   We must also learn from this example, that all such fallings back from
   our baptismal grace are great provocations of God's most righteous
   severity. The sin of Lot's wife was not only disobedience, but
   ingratitude. While Lot lingered, she was saved by the hand of angels;
   "the Lord being merciful unto them."

   And we, brethren, who have been taken out of a dead world to be grafted
   into the Church of the living God, how shall not we be held in the bond
   of a twofold guilt? Even after many and great commendations for faith,
   and patience, and zeal for His name, He that walketh in the midst of
   the golden candlesticks, warned the Church in Ephesus: "Nevertheless I
   have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
   Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do
   the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and remove thy
   candle stick out of his place, except thou repent." [13] These are
   awful words. There are two things which God hates--backsliding and
   lukewarmness; and there are two which He will avenge--an alienated
   heart, and a will at war with His. Who can foretell what forfeiture of
   blessings, what withdrawal of grace, what clouding of the conscience,
   what hiding of God's countenance, what weakness, what confusion of
   soul, may be the righteous chastisement of a secret falling away of the
   heart from God? Thus even in this life God looks out upon those that
   reject Him, and troubles them: and who knows whereunto these things may
   grow? "Remember Lot's wife:" and who hath said, "If any man draw back,
   my soul shall have no pleasure in him."

   If these things be so, how shall we hold fast our stedfastness? There
   is no other sure way but only this,--ever to press on to a life of
   deeper devotion--to a lowlier repentance, and more earnest prayers--to
   a more sustained consciousness of God's continual presence--and to a
   keener watchfulness against the first approaches of temptation. But all
   that can now be offered in particular is one or two plain rules by way
   of caution.

   1. First of all, then, beware of remembering past faults without
   repentance. The recollection of our sins is safe only when it is a part
   of our self-chastisement. To look back upon them without shame and
   sorrow, is to offend again. God alone can simply behold evil without
   contamination; for memory, like a gnawing stream, gathers its tinge
   from the soil through which it winds its sullen way. So is it, above
   all, with impenitent recollection of sins once indulged. Our present
   character imbibes again the quality of past evil. We soon cease to fear
   what we can endure to think upon; and we soon grow again to behold the
   lust we once have served with the same eyes of favour and desire as
   when we were its slaves. There arises an interior assent to sins which
   we dare not outwardly commit. Past sin becomes present by a renewed
   adhesion of the heart; and even though we never offend again in the
   same outward form as before, some new and subtler evil is thrown out
   from the stock of our original disobedience.

   2. Another thing to beware of is, making excuses for our present faults
   without trying to correct them. Nothing so wears down the sharpness of
   conscience, and dulls its perception of our actual state, as
   self-excusing. It is the most certain way to forfeit all true knowledge
   of ourselves; it directly fosters and strengthens the faults we are
   attempting to excuse; it weakens the corrective powers of religion, the
   first and chief of which is a sincere confession of every swerving of
   the will from God. From this there can nothing come but a declining of
   heart, and an estrangement of the sore and irritable mind. And these
   things draw a darkness over the conscience, which hides the face of
   God. A little while ago, and such men were warm and forward in
   religion, now they feel chilled and backward; for the justified fault
   is a harboured canker, and the repulsion of an alienated will thrusts
   them away from God.

   3. And lastly, beware of those particular forms of temptation which
   have already once held you in their power, or sapped your better
   resolutions. Every man has his own particular character, and every
   character its own particular cast. We have our characteristic faults
   and our characteristic weakness. Sometimes the same sins prevail again
   over the same man; sometimes an opposite sin; sometimes lesser faults,
   but in a greater multitude; sometimes fewer, but in a greater
   intensity. There can be no general precepts in this matter, any more
   than in the healing of the body. Beware of evils which have once
   prevailed against you, as knowing their malignity; beware of those
   which have never as yet had dominion, as not knowing what may be their
   fearful strength. Beware of a retroverted heart, and of the glancing
   aside of the imagination, and of the slack obedience of the will.
   Angels hands have been about you from the waters of holy baptism. Their
   guidance, unseen, unfelt, has drawn you again and again from ills which
   your hearts had chosen. In seasons of weakness they have stayed you up;
   in the hour of wavering they have kept you from falling. Before is the
   city of refuge--the world that lieth in wickedness is behind. "Escape
   for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain:
   escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed." [14] "Remember Lot's
   wife."

SERMON IV.

  THE MYSTERY OF MAN'S BEING.

    PSALM cxxxix. 14.

   " I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are Thy works; and
   that my soul knoweth right well."

   IN the beginning of this Psalm king David gives utterance to his wonder
   and awe at the mystery of God's invisible, universal presence. And from
   this he turns upon the mystery of his own individual nature. It is with
   hardly less of awe and wonder that he muses upon himself. He feels a
   consciousness that his own very being is an ineffable work of God--his
   own body of dust, wrought after some high type of wisdom and
   perfection--knit together in a wonderful order--quickened by an
   ineffable breath of God--filled with the powers of life, with the light
   of reason, and the rule of conscience--able, by memory and by
   foresight, to make present both things past and things to come to look
   through visible things, and make unseen things visible; and that all
   this should be himself--that all should be so blended into one, as to
   revolve about his own will, and to be instinct with his own individual
   consciousness,--this it was that made him say, "I am fearfully and
   wonderfully made; and that my soul knoweth right well."

   It was from musing after this sort upon God, that he turned to muse
   upon himself. It was, indeed, by pondering upon the mystery of God's
   nature, that he learned to stand in awe of the mysteriousness of his
   own; by dwelling on the awful thought of the unseen Being who fills all
   things, and quickens all things, he came to understand that he too was
   a being of a high descent, a mystery of God's almighty power, and that
   in the wonderful frame of his own bodily form there dwelt a conscious
   soul, whose eye was turned inwardly to gaze upon itself. Now, as this
   consciousness of what we are follows in a most certain order upon a
   true knowledge, so far as man can have it, of what God is, so it is
   also a condition absolutely necessary to all true religion. There can
   be no real fear, or reverence, or seriousness of heart, until a man has
   come to understand, at least in some measure, what he is--to realise
   his own awful structure and destiny.

   We will consider, then, some of the thoughts which press upon a mind
   conscious of its own wonderful nature. It perceives in part an evident
   likeness, and in part an equally marked unlikeness, to its Maker.

   And, first; we know, by instinct and by revelation, that God has made
   us in part like to Himself, that is, immortal. This bodily frame we
   look upon, although it is a part of ourselves, is but the least part;
   although it is a partaker of Christ's redemption, it is but the shrine
   of the redeemed spirit: we feel that a man's self is his living
   soul--the invisible, impalpable spirit, which comprehends all his being
   with an universal consciousness, and is itself comprehended only of
   God. The body is its subject, its organ, its instrument, its
   manifestation, its symbol; it is not itself. All things that affect the
   body are external to it, separate from it. The very life of the body is
   but a lower energy of the true life of man, and is also separable and
   distinct. It may be quenched, and yet the soul shall live, and wield
   higher powers and intenser energies, as unclogged and disenthralled
   from the burden and the bondage of its lower life. It has a life in
   itself, which, embodied or disembodied, shall live on--outliving not
   the body alone, but the very world itself. All things visible shall
   decay; the heaven shall pass away like a scroll, the earth shall melt
   away under our feet; even now all things are hurrying past us, are
   dropping piecemeal, are dying daily: but we shall live for ever. We
   shall rise on the heaving wreck of material things. All men, both good
   and evil, shall live on; all that ever have lived, live still; all that
   ever died since Adam,--Abel the righteous, and Enoch that walked with
   God, and John that lay on his Master's bosom, Balaam that tempted the
   Lord, Judas that sold his Redeemer, Herod that mocked the Lord of
   glory, the very men that nailed Him to the cross,--all are living in
   some unseen abode. In this life they were a mystery of mortality and
   immortality knit in one. They were in their season of trial; and their
   day ran out, and their award was fixed, and the mortal fell off like a
   loosened shroud, and the immortal spirit passed onward into the world
   unseen.

   And, in the next place, we learn that our nature stands in a marked
   contrast to the divine; that the immortal nature which is within us is
   of a mutable kind, susceptible of the most searching changes. God, who
   is immortal, is also changeless. He is "I am that I am," "the same
   yesterday, to-day, and for ever." In Him "is no variableness, neither
   shadow of turning." But we, who, by His almighty power, are made
   immortal like Himself, unlike Him, are daily changing. We are
   susceptible of forms and characters stamped upon us from without; of
   habits and tempers of soul fixed by energies within. We grow, we decay,
   we fluctuate, we become what we were not, what we were we lose again;
   and yet we must be immortal. The most fearful and wonderful of
   mysteries is man. To be mortal and to be mutable, to be under the power
   of change and death, would seem, like the meeting of kindred
   imperfections, to be consistent; that we, who change daily, should
   change at last, once for all, from life to death, from being to
   annihilation, would seem like the carrying out of a natural law; and
   the last change to be like all other changes, save only in that it is
   the greatest and the last. But to be ever changing, and yet to be
   immortal; that after this changeful life ended, there should be life
   everlasting, or the worm that dieth not,--bespeaks some deep counsel of
   God, some high destiny of man; something that is ever fulfilling, ever
   working out in us, whether we will or no.

   And so, indeed, it is. We are here, upon our trial, for this end. We
   are sent into the world, that, by our own will and choice, we should
   determine our eternal portion. This is the moral design and purpose of
   Him that made us; and therefore He made us as we are--mutable, that we
   may take our mould and character; and immortal, that we may retain it
   for ever.

   1. Let us consider, then, first, that our immortal being is always
   changing for good or evil, always becoming better or worse. We came
   into this world with a bias of evil on our nature; but in holy baptism
   we received a gift which redressed the balance, and made us free to
   choose. From that day we have stood between two contending powers. On
   the one side, the world, the flesh, and the devil; on the other side,
   the Spirit, the water, and the blood; the powers of darkness and of
   light, of death and of life; the kingdom of Satan and the Church of
   Christ; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of
   life,--the gospel of salvation, and the holy Sacraments; all these, as
   antagonist legions, have contended for us, and cast in turn their power
   and their hold upon us, and we have hung in the poise and vibrated to
   and fro, wavering in weakness and wilfulness, a spectacle to men and
   angels, till, for good or ill, choice or time has determined the
   suspense. And this is the key to all the moral phenomena we see around
   us. The ten thousand various and conflicting characters of men are,
   each several one, nothing more than the shape and attitude in which
   they finally issue from this moral conflict. All men are good or evil,
   just as they incline determinately to this or that side of this moral
   balance; and their determined inclination is their character. All our
   life long, and in every stage of it, this process, which we vaguely
   call the formation of character, is going on. Our immortal nature is
   taking its stamp and colour; we are receiving and imprinting
   ineffaceable lines and features. As the will chooses, so the man is.
   Our will is ourself; and as it takes up into itself, and, as it were,
   incorporates with itself, the powers and the bias of good or ill--such
   we become.

   2. In the next place, consider that this continual change is also a
   continual approach to, or departure from God. We are always tending to
   God or from God; and this must be by the force of moral necessity. We
   are always growing more or less like Him, and therefore nearer or
   further from Him. On these two lines all moral beings are for ever
   moving. The holy, the pure-hearted, and the penitent, have fellowship
   with angels, and walk with God, and God dwells in them with a growing
   nearness day by day; they are ever more and more one with Him, and
   partake more fully of the Divine nature, and are filled with the will
   of God: they abide in God, and God in them; they are one with Christ,
   and Christ with them: they are taken up as it were into the company of
   heaven, and, by the ascent of their moral being, climb upwards to the
   throne of God. But the sinful, the impure, and the impenitent, have
   their fellowship with fallen angels, and their moral being is in
   warfare against God, their will struggling and clashing against His
   will; they are beset round about, but they are not dwelt in by His holy
   presence; the gulf between them and heaven is ever widening day by day:
   they are ever departing from God, and ever sinking downward to the
   abyss; and the shadow of the outer darkness al ready gathers upon their
   inmost soul. Now this is the work which rests not, day or night, in the
   moral being of mankind. Heaven and hell are but the ultimate points of
   these diverging lines on which all are ever moving. The steady and
   changeless rise and fall of the everlasting lights is not more
   unerring. It is a moral movement, measured upon the boundaries of life
   and death; a change of nature, which, in the moral world, is a change
   of position and of standing before God,--it brings us nearer or casts
   us farther from Him.

   3. And this leads us to one more thought: I mean, that such as we
   become in this life by the moral change wrought in our immortal nature,
   such we shall be for ever. Our eternal state will be no more than the
   carrying out of what we are now. After this life is over, there will be
   no new change--no new beginning--no passing the eternal gulf between
   good and evil. He that is unjust shall be unjust still; he that is
   filthy shall be filthy still; he that is righteous shall be righteous
   still; and he that is holy shall be holy still. The two diverging lines
   shall then be at an impassable distance, and they that move upon them,
   it may be, shall move onward still, into a brighter glory, or a darker
   gloom--to a closer ministry, or a further banishment from God. For, in
   very truth, heaven and hell are not more abodes than characters. Abodes
   they are, where shall be gathered all men and angels, according as the
   award shall be; but that which makes the bliss or misery of each is not
   less the habit which has here been wrought into the moral being, and
   there is made absolute for good or evil. In this life the holiest will
   and the most saintly spirit is clogged and checked by the swerving and
   burden of the flesh. All men fall short of their high purposes; the
   best of men bear but little fruit; it ripens slowly and uncertainly,
   and often soon decays: but the will which has here struggled to perfect
   itself after the example of our Redeemer, shall there be perfected by
   His mighty working. He shall fulfil the work. They that have yearned to
   be holy shall be holy with out blemish; they that have wept for their
   feeble services shall there excel in strength--what they would fain
   have been, they shall be. Their determination of will, and deliberate
   choice, and faithful toiling, shall fix the character of their eternal
   lot. What through their weakness they could not here attain, He, of His
   gracious power, shall make them to be for ever.

   And so, likewise, of evil men. The warning, and striving, and
   restraining of the Holy Ghost shall then be over; and all that in this
   life kept back the full outbreak of a sinful will shall be taken off.
   The whole power of evil, which lurks pent up in the hearts of the
   wicked, shall burst forth into a flame. The very air they breathe must
   kindle it. It may be they shall wonder at themselves, at the mystery of
   iniquity which has lain harboured in them. Their conditions in life so
   far repressed and masked them from themselves, that they did not fully
   know what they truly were: just as we often see men, by some outward
   change, put forth new and incredible powers of evil, which, before they
   were tried, no man could believe them to possess; and as we all know
   how the example of others,--their influence, their presence, the glance
   of their eye, and a thousand other outward checks,--will sustain in us
   a better habit, which, when they are removed, is altogether lost, and
   our true self rises to the surface, and overspreads the whole
   character, and puts out its full ungovernable strength. Such, beyond
   doubt, shall be the state of those whose will has here conflicted with
   the will of God. There all check, all mitigation, all repression, shall
   be gone; and such as they would be now, if they dared, they shall be
   then for ever.

   And if these things be so, with how much awe and fear have we need to
   deal with ourselves!

   First of all, we. must needs learn to keep a continual watch over our
   hearts. Every change that passes upon us has an eternal consequence;
   there is something ever flowing from it into eternity. We are never at
   rest: our moral life is like a running stream; its very condition is
   change. And these changes creep on us by such an insensible approach,
   that we hardly perceive them till they have established themselves.
   They are like the growth of our stature, or the alteration of our
   features,--most perceptible in the whole after-effect, but beyond the
   subtlest observation to detect in the manner and the moment of their
   changes. So, too, our moral dispositions grow upon us. We know them by
   retrospect. They took their first spring from some unperceived or
   forgotten incident, they penetrated into our inmost being, and drew it
   to their own shape. To pass by the grosser forms of sin, I would take,
   for example, a secret dislike of religion, which often comes from a
   soft, self-pleasing temper; or pride, springing from the accidents of
   life; or supercilious contempt of the Church's warnings, arising from a
   confidence in our own judgment and opinion. These, being free from all
   grossness, and therefore compatible with all that the world exacts of a
   man, wind themselves imperceptibly around many who are otherwise
   blameless and upright. But, though free from all grossness, they are
   faults capable of great intensity. They stifle the very life of faith,
   wear out all reverence, excite a most restless and obstinate dislike of
   holiness, and turn the whole man aside from God with a perfect
   estrangement of heart. They are sins more deadly for the very reason
   that they are spiritual. They dwell in that depth of our being which is
   most akin to the immortality of fallen angels.

   Watch, then, over the changes and inclinations of your will; for every
   one bears upon eternity. Every energy lays in another touch upon your
   deepening character; every moment fixes its colours with a greater
   stedfastness. Remember that you are immortal; realise your own
   immortality. Remember it all day long, in all places: live as men whose
   every act is ineffaceably recorded, whose every change may be retained
   for ever.

   And, again; we have need not only to watch, but to keep up a strong
   habit of self-control. How it is that every act we do leaves upon us
   its impression, we know not; but the scars and the seams of our bodily
   frame may warn us of the havoc sin makes in our unseen nature. The cur
   rent of our thoughts, the wanderings of our imagination, the tumult of
   our passions, the flashes of our temper, all the movements and energies
   of our moral being, leave some mark, wither some springing grace,
   strengthen some struggling fault, decide some doubtful bias, aggravate
   some growing proneness, and always leave us other, and worse, than we
   were before. This is ever going on. By its own continual acting, our
   fearful and wonderful inward nature is perpetually fixing its own
   character. It has a power of self-determination, which, to those who
   give over watching and self-control, becomes soon unconscious, and at
   last involuntary. How carelessly men treat themselves! They live as if
   they had no souls. In their traffic of this life, they scheme as if
   they were to live for ever. In their preparation for death, they trifle
   as if there were no life beyond the grave. How easy is all self-control
   at the first! if neglected, how all but impossible at last! To most
   men, it must have somewhat of sharpness. To the unchastened it is
   galling and irksome; but what is this to the remorseful looking back
   and the fearful looking on ward of the guilty spirit waiting for the
   day of doom!

   Watch, therefore, and win the mastery over yourselves. Live so as you
   would desire to live for ever. Speak and act as if you were now fixing
   your eternal state. Be such, that, if your moral being were now to be
   precipitated and made eternal, your portion should be. in the kingdom
   of God. And commit yourselves to the great movement of His mysterious
   providence, by which He is working out the change and transfiguration
   of His saints. The vision which the prophet saw by the river Chebar
   [15] --a vision of many wheels and wondrous creatures of God, of a
   whirlwind, and a light infolding itself, full of movements seemingly
   opposed, but absolute in harmony--full of powers angelic and
   ministering--full of meaning and of mystery; all this is a parable of
   the Divine presence working through the complex unity of His Church. On
   His Church, as upon the potter's wheel, He hath laid our immortal
   being; and as it revolves, He shapes us with the unerring pressure of
   His hand, and the vessel of wrath rises into a vessel of glory. It is
   by His holy word and sacraments, by acts of homage and adoration, by a
   life of obedience, and by a wisely tempered discipline of chastisement
   and peace, that He wins and conforms us to Himself. He is working upon
   you. That in you which shall never die is changing daily, is being
   moulded or marred, according as you yield to or resist the working of
   His word and Spirit--is taking the eternal stamp of good or ill. To our
   eyes it is the Church, to our faith it is God Himself, that is changing
   us into the likeness of His Son.

SERMON V.

  WORLDLY AFFECTIONS DESTRUCTIVE OF LOVE TO GOD.

    1 ST. JOHN ii. 15.

   "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
   man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him."

   ST. JOHN here tells us that the love of the world thrusts the love of
   God out of our hearts. Now, this love of the world means a love either
   of things which are actually sinful, or of things not sinful in
   themselves, but hurtful and a hinderance to the love of God. The first
   is too plain to need a word. A love of sin must set a man at war with
   God: his whole inner being ranges itself in array against the Spirit of
   holiness. The second form of this truth is somewhat less clear, and far
   less thought of; and we will therefore consider it.

   There are things, then, in the world, which, although not actually
   sinful in themselves, do nevertheless so check the love of God in us as
   to stifle and destroy it. For instance, it is lawful for us to possess
   wealth and worldly substance; we may serve God with it, and consecrate
   it at His altar; but we cannot love wealth without growing
   ostentatious, or soft, or careful, or narrow-hearted; "for the love of
   money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they
   have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many
   sorrows." [16] So, again, with friends and what is called society. It
   is lawful for us both to have and to love friends, both to enter into
   and to enjoy the pure happiness of living among them; but when we begin
   to find loneliness irksome, when we grow fond of being much in society,
   we are really trying to forget ourselves, and to get rid of sadder and
   better thoughts. The habit of mind which is formed in us by society is
   so unlike that in which we speak with God in solitude, that it seems to
   wear out of us the susceptibility of deeper and higher energies. Much
   more true is this when to the love of society is added a fondness for
   light pleasures, or a love of power, or a craving after rank and
   dignities. And so, once more, lawful as it is to be thoughtful and
   circumspect in the ordering of our life, arid in thankfully enjoying
   the ease and happiness which God gives us, we cannot long have our
   thoughts on these things without becoming biassed with a sort of
   proneness to spare and to indulge ourselves.

   Now, it is against such dangers as these that St. John warns us. They
   will, by a most subtle but inevitable effect, stifle the pure and
   single love of our hearts towards God; and that in many ways. For, in
   the first place, they actually turn away the affections of the heart
   from God. He so made our nature for Himself, that He alone is the
   lawful and true object of our supreme and governing love. Other lawful
   affections are not contrariant to this, but contained in it. The love
   to God presides over them all; orders, and harmonises, and preserves
   them in purity and health. But when they are loved immoderately, or
   chiefly, or before God, He is defrauded of so much of His own
   inalienable homage. They become to us as other gods, each one diverting
   our hearts from its straight and single direction towards Him alone. It
   is of our affection that He speaks when He calls Himself "a jealous
   God." Love of worldly things, then, plainly defrauds Him of our
   loyalty, and checks, if it does not absolutely thrust our love to Him
   altogether out of our hearts.

   And, in the next place, it impoverishes, so to speak, the whole
   character of the mind. Even the religious affections which remain
   undiverted are weakened and lowered in their quality. They are like the
   thin fruits of an exhausted soil. The virtue and the fatness of the
   land have been drawn off and distributed into so many channels, that
   what remains is cold and poor. It is wonderful how characters of great
   original earnestness lose their intensity by entanglement in the lower
   affections of the world. They spend their energy on objects both so
   many in number, and so beneath the care of a regenerate spirit, that
   they lose all unity of heart and intention. They are even conscious to
   themselves that this is going on, sapping the foundations of their
   moral strength. Surely it is a sign of a poor mind to be greatly moved
   by little things; to have much fondness for the most harmless of this
   world's littlenesses; to love them and God, as it were, in one
   affection. There is an evident shallowness about such minds, a want of
   power to perceive the measures, and relations, and magnitude of things.
   Even their highest energies are slack and feeble.

   Thus much, then, may be said generally. We will now consider somewhat
   more closely the particular consequences of this love of the world.

   1. It brings a dulness over the whole of a man's soul. To stand apart
   from the throng of earthly things, and to let them hurry by as they
   will and whither they will, is the only sure way to calmness and
   clearness in the spiritual life. It is by living much alone with God,
   by casting off the burden of things not needful to the inner life, by
   narrowing our toils and our wishes to the necessities of our actual
   lot, that we become familiar with the world unseen. Fasting, and
   prayer, and a spare life, and plainness, and freedom from the cumbering
   offices and possessions of the world, give to the inner eye and ear a
   keen and piercing sense. And what is this but to say that, by such a
   discipline the powers of our regenerate life are unfolded and enlarged?
   But such a life is almost impossible to the man that moves with the
   stream of the world: it carries him away against his will. The
   oppressive nearness of the things which throng upon him from without
   defrauds him of solitude with God. They come and thrust themselves
   between his soul and the realities unseen; they drop like a veil over
   the faint outlines of the invisible world, and hide it from his eyes.
   They ring too loudly in his ear, and throw too strong an attraction
   over his heart, to suffer him to hear and understand. And the spiritual
   powers that are in him grow inert and lose their virtue by the dulness
   of inaction. This is most clearly perceptible, not only in persons of a
   predominately worldly tone of mind, but in those who have been, and
   still are in some measure, religious; and none know it better than
   they. Perhaps the only feeling which long retains its keenness after
   the religious affections are deadened, is the fearful consciousness
   that they can no longer love God as they loved Him once. They are
   painfully alive to a sense of the eager and importunate sympathy, the
   warm and clinging fondness which they still have for the goings on of
   their worldly life, and the stunned and senseless heart with which they
   turn to the thought of God. When they are on their knees before Him,
   even at the foot of the altar, and in the very act of prayer, they feel
   in a strange unnatural posture; and are half in doubt whether it were
   not better to make no approach to Him at all, than to draw near with a
   heart so deaf and dull. Now to this, and, alas, often far beyond this,
   are many blameless and good-hearted people brought at last. Much
   trading, or much toiling for advancement, or much popularity, or much
   intercourse in the usages and engagements of society, or the giving up
   of much time to the refinements of a soft life,--these, and many like
   snares, steal away the quick powers of the heart, and leave us
   estranged from God. And this is the secret of the oppressive weariness
   which people who live in the world feel in all holy duties. The acts of
   religion, such as reading, thought, contemplation of the unseen,
   prayer, self-examination, the fasts and feasts, and offices of the
   Church, first seem to lose their savour, and are less delighted in:
   then they grow irksome, and are consciously avoided. So it must be.
   When religion ceases to be a delight, it becomes a yoke. Serve God we
   must, either in freedom or in bond age; if not for love, then for fear.
   If we love the world, we shall only fear God. We shall turn to our
   profession or our calling, or to society, or to our pleasures in life,
   with speed and gladness, but to God with constrained prayers and
   reluctant confessions. We shall go to them with distant and
   equivocating hearts, and turn from them with a secret readiness which
   makes us tremble. How awfully do people deceive themselves in this mat
   ter! We hear them saying, "It does me no harm to go into the world: I
   come away, and can go into my room and pray as usual." O, surest sign
   of a heart half laid asleep! You are not aware of the change, because
   it has passed upon you. Once, in days of livelier faith, you would have
   wept over the indevoutness of your present prayers, and joined them to
   the confession of your other backslidings; but now your heart is not
   more earnest than your prayers, and there is no index to mark the
   decline. Even they that lament the loss of their former earnestness do
   not half know the real measure of their loss. The growth of a duller
   feeling has the power of masking itself. Little by little it creeps on,
   marked by no great changes, much as the dimness of the natural sight,
   which must reach to an advanced point before it is detected to be more
   than a passing film. And so the inward affections lose all their
   freshness, and the pure light of the heart is overcast, and its love
   towards God grows cold. The mind is excited, and its feelings and
   powers drawn into life and play on every other side; but in the region
   which lies towards God it is bleak and lonely; and the faint gleams of
   heavenly love, which must be fed by insights of the world unseen,
   flicker and decay in the unwholesome neighbourhood of worldly
   affections.

   2. I will notice one more consequence. As we grow to be attached to the
   things that are in the world, there comes over us what I may call a
   vulnerableness of mind. We lay ourselves open on just so many sides as
   we have objects of desire. We give hostages to this changeful world,
   and we are ever either losing them, or trembling lest they should be
   wrested from us. What a life of disappointment, and bitterness, and
   aching fear, and restless uncertainty, is the life of the ambitious,
   and covetous, and self-indulgent! merchants, trading at a thousand
   hazards; statesmen, climbing up to slippery places; men of letters,
   catching at every breath of fame; men of the world, toiling to sustain
   a great appearance,--how anxious, and craving, and sensitive, and
   impatient of an equal do they become! How saddened, how ill at ease,
   how preyed upon by the fretting of unrest; and therefore how far from
   the calm inward shining of the love of God! Where this is, there is
   contentment, and a submissive will, and a glad consent in our present
   lot, and a simplicity which shields itself from the throng of manifold
   perturbations. But all these hallowed and happy tempers are frighted
   away by the writhing and the moaning of a worldly spirit, chafing
   against the visitations which invade or sever its earthly attachments.
   But it is not only in this form that the mind is made vulnerable by a
   love of the world. It lays itself open not more to chastisements than
   to temptations; it gives so many inlets to the suggestions of evil.
   Every earthly fondness is an ambush for a thousand solicitations of the
   wicked one. Through these he fills men with pride, vanity,
   vain-glory,--with ambition and jealous rivalry, with a greedy mind,
   with murmuring and discontent, with unthankfulness and mistrust of God.
   Any affection, either ill-directed or inordinate, passes into a
   temptation. It is a lure to the tempter, and a signal which betrays our
   weaker side; and as the subtle infection of evil tempers winds itself
   into the mind, the Spirit of the Dove is grieved by an irritable and
   unloving spirit. The very affections of the heart recoil sullenly into
   themselves, and sometimes even turn against the objects of their
   immoderate fondness. In this way the love of the world becomes a cause
   of very serious deterioration of character. It soon stifles the love of
   God; and when that is gone, and the character has lost its unity,
   particular features unfold themselves into a fearful prominence. The
   chief among its earthly affections becomes thenceforth its ruling
   passion; and so predominates over all the rest, and draws the whole
   mind to itself, as to stamp the man with the character of a besetting
   sin. And this is what we mean, when we call one man purse-proud, and
   another ostentatious, or worldly-minded, or selfish, and the like. The
   world has eaten its way into his soul, and "the love of the Father is
   not in him."

   Now, if this is so, what shall we do? If it were possible for us to
   begin life over again, and to lay it out upon some definite and
   carefully adjusted plan, we might avoid the entanglements of the world.
   But almost every one of us already finds himself fully implicated in
   the embarrassments of life, and involved in a multitude of inferior
   attachments, before he is well aware. What, then, is to be done? We
   cannot withdraw ourselves. One has wealth, another a family, a third
   rank and influence, another a large business; and all these bring with
   them an endless variety of duties and offices, and usages of custom and
   courtesy. If a man is to break through all these, he must needs go out
   of this world. All this is very true; but, at the same time, it is
   certain that every one of us might reduce his life to a greater
   simplicity. In every position in life there is a great multitude of
   unnecessary things which we may readily abandon: if we were to examine
   carefully the objects on which we bestow time and money and thought and
   earnestness, we should find many that are purely artificial. Many
   things we do only because others have done them before us; many by mere
   passive imitation. We are all over-ready to combine many characters, or
   pursuits, or offices together; to make heavier our own burdens; we
   learn to form exaggerated judgments of the worth and importance of
   things from other men; and all this gathers into a worldliness of
   character, and over spreads our mind, fearfully oppressing the
   religious life within us. Now they are happiest who arc most discharged
   from contact with the world; who can sit, like Mary, at the Lord's feet
   without distraction. Most peaceful life, to have nothing to do with the
   conflicts, or changes, or possessions of this world: to have enough,
   and somewhat for them that lack; and friends, so as not to be desolate,
   and yet without carefulness! What is there for them to do, but to wait
   on God, and to look out for the resurrection? But they are very few to
   whom this scarce and solitary lot is given. The great multitude of men
   are so interwoven in the tangled maze of relations and duties, that
   they must take the burden with the blessing; and yet even they would
   find that they are suffering their heart to be diverted and
   impoverished, and their affections to be dulled and deteriorated, by
   entanglement with many things from which a little boldness and decision
   would set them free. All that is not necessary may be cast off. Our
   unwariness, or our own free choice, has encumbered us with it; and it
   is in our own hands to undo it again.

   And as for all the necessary cares of life, they need involve us in no
   dangers. In them, if we be true-hearted, we are safe. The inevitable
   relations of our earthly lot are the appointments and declaration of
   God's will to us. It is He that has sur rounded us with them, and there
   is no danger in His dispensations. "God cannot be tempted with evil,
   neither tempteth He any man." Besides, even though a man were never so
   deeply implicated with the relations of life, there is no need that he
   should suffer them to usurp upon him. He may live in the midst of them
   with an unsubdued and single heart; he may meet them cheerfully, fulfil
   what they exact of him, but do them no homage; yield to them no mastery
   over his inward purpose. He submits to them as to a rule of God's
   ordaining; accomplishing day by day his toil, or study, or professional
   offices; mixing, too, in life, taking pleasure in its pure happiness
   and fond affections, without fear or doubting, knowing that he is where
   God has willed his probation. But the deep movements of his heart are
   reserved for God. All other emotions are partial, affecting only a
   portion of his spiritual life; but this extends over all, and
   concentrates all upon itself. It is only towards God that he turns with
   a perfect unity of will. And, besides that the necessary entanglements
   of our lot are thus in themselves safe and lawful, God in His mercy
   shields the obedient mind from the deteriorating effect of inevitable
   contact with the world. When He leads men into positions of great
   trial, whether by wealth, or rank, or business, He compensates by
   larger gifts of grace. The spiritual life is perpetually replenished by
   the "powers of the world to come; "and we find men who are the most
   burdened, and even overborne, by the thronging toils of daily life, or
   lured and solicited by the splendours of the world, not only holding
   out against the secularising action of worldly things, but even
   confirmed and elevated to a higher pitch of devotion. The world not
   only has no power to conform them to itself, but it becomes a sort of
   counter-pressure, which forces them to take shelter in a secret life of
   self-renouncement. It keeps them ever on the watch, by a consciousness
   that to relax is to be in peril; and therefore it often hap pens that
   none are more dead to the world than they that have it around them in
   the largest mea sure. They have learned its emptiness and its
   bitterness, and recoil into themselves, as into a silence where the
   presence of God is heard. They have had many struggles with it, and
   gained many masteries, and suffered many wounds, and they have become
   estranged from it, and suspicious of all its advances and allurements;
   and have learned that, whensoever they have leaned upon it, an edge has
   pierced them, and that there is no safety but in God.

   From all this, then, it is plain that we can never charge the
   worldliness of our hearts upon our lot in life; for our hinderances are
   either made by entanglement in things which are unnecessary, or, if in
   necessary things, are made through some inward fault of our own. Let us
   therefore no more pretend to excuse the withholding of our hearts from
   God, or the poverty and dulness of our affections, on the plea that the
   cares and duties of the world keep us back from a devoted life. Still
   less let us persuade ourselves, that the temptations to which we
   needlessly expose ourselves are inevitable and appointed of God, or
   that we can resist their action. They have already overcome us, as soon
   as we suffer them to pass within the precinct of our daily life. We can
   still, however, with great ease, in due season, disentangle ourselves
   from all needless hinderances. The rest will be no let to the love of
   God. All pure loves may dwell under its shadow. Only we must not suffer
   them to shoot above, and to overcast it; for the love of God will not
   grow in the shade of any worldly affection. Above all, let us pray of
   Him to shed abroad in our hearts more and more of His love; that is, a
   fuller and deeper sense of His exceeding love towards us. It is thus He
   draws our love upward to Himself. "We love Him because He first loved
   us." The consciousness of this divine love comes down like a flood of
   light upon our darkened hearts, transfiguring all pure love of God's
   creatures with exceeding brightness, making all the affections of our
   spiritual life harmonious and eternal.

SERMON VI.

  SALVATION A DIFFICULT WORK.

    ST. MATTHEW vii. 13, 14.

   "Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the
   way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in
   thereat: because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
   leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it."

   IN these words our Lord uttered a startling and awful truth. He
   declared, that they who make forfeit of eternal life are many, and they
   who gain it few. And the reason He affirmed to be this: that the way of
   destruction is broad, and the way of life narrow. By these words, He
   designed to express some great difficulty which lies in the way of
   salvation, some barrier which few surmount.

   Now one thing is most certain; I mean, that this difficulty is not of
   God's making. He "would have all men to be saved, and to come to the
   knowledge of the truth." [17] "I have no pleasure in the death of the
   wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live." [18] "God so
   loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoso ever
   believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." [19] It
   is not, then, any difficulty ordained of God; and therefore it is plain
   that it must be on man's part; that it is something in our own nature,
   I mean a moral difficulty. And what this is we will go on to examine.

   And, first, strange as it may seem, the difficulty will be found in the
   unwillingness of men to be saved. In holy Scripture this is broadly
   charged upon mankind. God asks, as pleading with His people, "Why will
   ye die?" And our Lord, weeping over Jerusalem, "How often would I have
   gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens
   under her wings, and ye would not!" [20] And again, "Ye will not come
   unto me, that ye may have life." [21] And in the parable of the
   marriage-feast, a type of eternal life, "They all with one consent
   began to make excuse." It is manifest that there is in man's nature a
   deep and settled unwillingness, which is the first and great est
   barrier to his salvation; an unwillingness not simply to be saved, that
   is, to be made everlastingly blessed this, as a mere end of their
   desires, all men long after--but an unwillingness to be saved in the
   way of salvation which God has ordained. They would fain enter into the
   strait gate, if they could do it without repenting, or denying self, or
   crossing their own will, or changing their way of life. If they
   might-live on to the very threshold of His kingdom with an unchastened
   heart, and then, without struggle, shed off the unmortified body of sin
   and death, and enter new-born into His joy; if, after a life of
   self-indulgence, they could inherit eternal bliss, and so draw out the
   indolent, self-pleasing luxury of earth into the perfect blessedness of
   heaven, then, indeed, there would be no unwillingness; then the way of
   life should be broad enough, and many should go in thereat; and the way
   of destruction narrow, and there should be few that find it. But it is
   the severe holiness of salvation from which they shrink, because the
   carnal mind is enmity against God. They know that salvation is, the
   being saved from sin, from its guilt and from its soil, from the power
   with which it rules over us, from the love with which we cling to
   it;--in a word, it is the healing of the soul; the cleansing of its
   deadly sickness; the making of the sinful creature a holy being. From
   this men shrink by the recoil of their natural will. They too clearly
   see that it is from themselves that they must be saved; from what they
   love and pamper with perpetual license; that they must renounce what
   they are, and become what they are not; that they must absolutely
   submit their will to be changed and subdued to His will;--and they are
   not prepared to put so great a yoke upon themselves. And, besides this,
   the thought of God's awful and searching presence, all pure, all holy,
   is insufferable. They feel the awful contrast of their own sullied
   spirits with His spotless sanctity; and they can neither endure to
   forsake the sins they doat on, nor dare to draw nigh Him without
   repentance. And this unwillingness which all men have by nature is
   greatly aggravated by the habit of their lives. Every act of sin
   excites it. Sinful acts, as they multiply into habits, and combine into
   a settled character, turn a man's heart aside from God with a most
   stedfast alienation. The power of evil, and the hold of the world, grow
   stronger upon such a man. He has more to break through, more to
   forsake, more to mortify; and the effort becomes daily harder and less
   hopeful. It is not only sins of the grosser sort, and habitual
   familiarity with evil, that determine the will of man against God. An
   angry or a sullen temper, jealousy, fondness for trifles and worldly
   vanity, levity, ambition, and the hardness of heart which is seldom far
   from a soft, self-pleasing mind,--all these things foster a secret
   dislike of the severities of personal religion, and make a man
   unwilling to enter in at the strait gate. Nay, even the pure-minded
   have need to watch; for the world is ever shedding a silent influence
   upon us; it deadens the keen tact of conscience, and entangles us in
   unseen toils, and draws the will secretly from God. Many who are pure
   from grosser evil may forfeit eternal life through a slothful
   indisposition to strive against their conscious faults. This, then, is
   one form of the great moral difficulty which must be overcome by all
   who would enter into life.

   2. There is yet another, not wholly unlike in kind, but more subtle,
   and therefore not less dangerous. Let us suppose a man to have made the
   first bold and successful struggle, to have burst through the bonds and
   trammels of an evil or a worldly life, and to have submitted himself to
   the merciful severity of God: thenceforward his life is a perpetual
   warfare; as before against God, so now against himself; and that
   because the reluctance of his natural will is not absolutely changed,
   but only held in check. He is willing in the main to submit to
   repentance and self-denial, and to the crossing of his daily choice;
   or, in a word, to yield himself up to be saved in the awful way of
   God's appointment. But though willing in the main purpose of his mind,
   and in the general resolution of his heart, he is found unwilling in
   the particular instances which make up his actual salvation. He is
   willing to be delivered from all sins, until he is tempted. Each
   particular temptation has its lure and its spell to draw him to a new
   consent. His old disease returns upon him in detail. There is an
   uncertainty, a weakness, and a wavering about such men,--a readiness to
   pass impostures upon their own conscience: and all these make it hard
   for them to win eternal life.

   The reasons of this are many. The power of his old habits is upon him
   still; and, as the original fault of man's nature inclines him to evil
   gene rally, so they give a man a leaning and proneness to particular
   sins. His will is weaker on that side where it has been wont to yield;
   he is more vulnerable, more liable to be tempted,--as a constitutional
   liability to any sickness makes a man more readily take infection; for
   his former habits have laid up a provision for future falls. They leave
   in him something upon which temptation may kindle; in the words of a
   wise spiritual guide and bishop of the Church, they are like a taper
   newly quenched, which starts again into a flame at the first approaches
   of a light. Most unlike to Him in whom the prince of this world, when
   he came, had nothing on which to fasten. On Him temptations fell
   harmless, as sparks are quenched upon the surface of a pure fountain.

   Once more; in such a man as we speak of, the new strength of better
   habits is not as yet confirmed. And here again the power of past evil
   reappears. It not only claims a dominion of its own, but it mars the
   beginnings of a holier character. It perpetually breaks up the first
   foundations, unsettling them as soon as they are laid, baffling our
   toil, and mocking us by continual defeats. No man knoweth, but God
   only, what is the hurt inflicted upon man's spiritual nature by
   familiar consent to evil; what is the deterioration of the moral being
   in the scale of His redeemed creatures. It scathes and deadens the
   spiritual sense, and leaves fearful scars and seams on our inmost soul.
   It seems to make us less susceptible of holiness: for by a course of
   disobedience not only is the antagonist resistance of the mind
   increased, but even its passive powers are diminished. As, for
   instance, what is it that hinders the deeper sorrow of repentance, but
   a former habit of treating sin with levity? What makes devotion well
   nigh impossible, but a past habit of living with out prayer? What makes
   it so hard to sustain a habitual consciousness of God's presence, but
   an early habit of living without that consciousness? There has come
   over the spiritual nature an inaptness, and often an antipathy. As in
   some men the keenness of the eye and ear is blunted, and the very first
   laws of harmony and beauty be come unintelligible, and even irksome; so
   is it with holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. We
   squander and abuse the mysterious powers of our spiritual being, and
   daily create around us new obstructions in the way of our salvation,
   narrowing the path and straitening the gate by which alone we can enter
   into life.

   But hitherto I have seemed to speak only of those who, after an evil or
   worldly life, turn to repentance. And yet this warning is for all. It
   was spoken absolutely. To all mankind, as fallen men, the way of life
   is not more blessed than it is arduous. And that for this reason,
   because "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither
   doth corruption inherit incorruption." [22] There must pass on each a
   deep and searching change. And this change, though it be wrought in us
   of God, is wrought through our striving. It is no easy task to gird up
   the energies of our moral nature to a perpetual struggle. The most
   watchful feels as one that strives against the half-conscious
   drowsiness of an oppressive poison; the purest, as he that leaves upon
   driven snow a dark and sullying touch; the most aspiring, as a man that
   aims his shafts from a strained and slackened bow; the most hopeful of
   eternal life, as one that toils for a far shore in a rolling and stormy
   sea. It is a hard thing to be a Christian. It is a hard thing to keep
   ourselves unspotted from the world. It is a hard thing to force our
   way, making an armed retreat into a position of safety; for sin, that
   great and manifold mystery of ill, whose root no man hath ever found,
   whose goings forth were before the world was made, and whose legions
   are unseen, hovers around with a terrible strength, and still more
   terrible craft. It ever hangs upon our skirts, and harasses our way to
   life; it waits through every day, and watches in every hour; it besets
   all our paths, and lurks beside all our duties; it mingles in our
   toils, and hides in our secret chamber, and masks itself under our
   religion, and follows us to the altar of God. Through all this we have
   to win our way to life. "We wrestle not with flesh and blood"--for then
   we might endure it, beholding our enemy and grappling with him face to
   face,--"but we wrestle against principalities, against powers, against
   the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
   in high places." [23] These throng the way to life, and cast down the
   unwary, and overbear the wavering soul, and mar the beginnings of
   repentance: therefore are they who find eternal life but few.

   Such, then, is the warning of our Lord. And these are some of the many
   difficulties which beset our way to heaven. We are bid to strive.
   Salvation is not the by-play of our idle hours, when the mind is
   wearied with overtoiling for this life, or cloyed with the oppressive
   customs of the world. It demands a manly and a resolute heart, or that
   still strength which faith gives to the most feminine and gentle
   spirit.

   Beware, then, of an easy, acquiescing temper, which lulls you to be
   secure. What is meant by "wide is the gate and broad is the way that
   leadeth to destruction," but that a man needs only to follow his own
   will; only to let his thoughts, and words, and lusts wander and run on
   unchecked, and he is in as fair a way to perish, as a ship without a
   helm, where there is but one haven and a thousand shoals? By a natural
   law man leans towards destruction. It may be called the gravitation of
   a fallen being; and let a man only be at ease in himself, and satisfied
   with what he is, and consent to the usurping customs of the world,
   drawing in the unwholesome breath of refined evil, and letting his
   moral inclination run its natural course, without check or stay, and he
   will most surely tide onward, with an easy and gentle motion, down the
   broad current of eternal death. Such a man is seldom strongly tempted.
   The less marked solicitations of the tempter are enough. The suggestion
   of a great sin might rouse his conscience, and scare him from the
   toils. We may take this, then, as a most safe rule, that a feeling of
   security is a warning to be suspicious, and that our safety is to feel
   the stretch and the energy of a continual strife.

   But there is also another thing to remember. Our blessed Lord did not
   give this warning to discourage, but to rouse us. He well knew that men
   always despise things easy to be done; that they think what may be done
   easily may be done at any time; and that what may be done by a little
   effort is often never done at all. And men are ever ready to believe
   that it is no hard task to enter into life; and this, as knowing
   neither the holiness of God's kingdom, nor the sin that is in
   themselves. He therefore told them the naked truth, startling, awful,
   and unpalatable as it must ever be; and by this He tried the reality
   and strength of their intentions. Let no man, therefore, go away cast
   down. A consciousness of difficulty is to the true of heart a spur to
   efforts, and therefore a pledge of success at last. Only resolve to win
   eternal life, and He will accept your resolution as a pure offering.
   Measure your daily life upon your resolve; shun all things that can
   betray your stedfastness; cleave to all that may strengthen or confirm
   your vow. Only be true to yourselves; and all help and all succour
   shall be given you. Twelve legions of angels shall wrestle for you,
   rather than that one faithful spirit perish from the way of life. To
   this end you were born, and for this cause came you into the world,
   that you should inherit the kingdom of God. Lose this, and all is lost.
   "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and
   lose his own soul; or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"

SERMON VII.

  A SEVERE LIFE NECESSARY FOR CHRIST'S FOLLOWERS.

    ST. LUKE ix. 23.

   "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his
   cross daily, arid follow me."

   WE read in the Gospels both of St. Matthew and of St. Mark, that this
   startling precept was given at the time when Peter had been sternly
   rebuked for his misguided affection for his Lord. It was at the same
   time, when in the foresight of His coming agony, the Lord Jesus began
   to teach them what things the Son of man should suffer; and Peter, in
   the forwardness and blindness of his heart, "took Him, and began to
   rebuke Him, saying, Be it far from Thee, Lord: this shall not be unto
   Thee. But He turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
   thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be
   of God, but those that be of men." And then, to shew the breadth of
   this great law of suffering, and how that the law which reached even
   unto Him bound also every living soul that followed Him, He said unto
   them all, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and
   take up his cross daily, and follow me." And thus, by words between a
   proverb and a prophecy, He foreshewed them both His own lot and theirs:
   He taught them the mysterious order of His unseen kingdom; how that He
   and His must all alike suffer, all deny self, all bear the cross. Again
   and again, through His whole ministry, He threw out this strange lure
   to win them more closely to Himself. It was so He strengthened His
   followers against the rending asunder of households and of kindred: it
   was so He tempered the over-ready eagerness of some that would follow
   Him before they had reckoned up the cost; it was so He sought to bind
   the rich young man for ever to His service, by one more, and that the
   last and strongest link. And the same deep truth we trace throughout
   the whole texture of His words and deeds: His own visible self-denial,
   and the cross which He daily bore, alike bespoke the lot of all that
   would be His. And what His life ever testified, He here expressly
   declared. And His words are both a bidding and a warning: they bid us
   that we come after Him; they warn us that we must deny ourselves; and
   they teach us that self-denial is the absolute condition of His
   service: or, in other words, that without self-denial no man can be a
   faithful Christian.

   And how universally this great condition has been fulfilled in all His
   true servants, is shewn by the whole history of the Church. The
   apostles, martyrs, confessors, bear witness with one voice to the same
   mystery of suffering. They testify that the badges of Christ's people
   are sufferings for Christ's sake; and even they to whom it was given to
   believe in Christ, but not to suffer for Him, the fellowship of all
   saints, conspire in the same awful testimony. They have each one borne
   the cross--each in his own unnoticed way; even though the nighest to
   them, it may be, knew it not: in some hidden grief, in some despised
   affliction, in some thing they burned to utter, but never dared to
   speak. Though the form of their affliction was invisible, yet they
   visibly bore the cross; and in bearing it, they shewed whose steps they
   followed. The character which was upon them was a legible countersign
   of their claim to be His servants. They had about them an integrity and
   completeness of the moral life, a fulness and distinctness of
   character; standing out from the world around, and yet dwelling in it;
   separate, and yet mingled in it; in contact with it, but unsullied by
   its touch; external to it, but guiding and checking its course; moving
   it, but not borne along with it; though in most things like other men,
   and to most eyes undistinguishable among the throng which gathers in
   kings palaces, or learned schools, or busy marts, yet to eyes whose
   sight is purged bearing most visible tokens of their Master's calling.
   We see in them the mind of Christ; the high dignity of an austere
   calmness; a greatness of soul which the world's busy fretfulness could
   seldom ruffle; a voluntary disentanglement from all the world counts
   dearest; a habitual self-mastery in foregoing honours, gains, and
   happiness, in choosing hardness, contempt, and isolation. By these the
   saints of all ages bear their witness to this great law of Christ's
   regenerate kingdom, that without self-denial no man can serve Him.

   But we must go further. Our Lord does not only tell us that this shall
   be so, but that it must be so. "Whosoever doth not bear his cross and
   come after me, cannot be my disciple." It is not so much a general fact
   in the history of Christendom, as an universal law working out its own
   fulfilment. It is no accidental dispensation or arbitrary condition
   imposed upon the Church by the will of Him we serve, but the inevitable
   law of a deep moral necessity; for it is not more certain that without
   holiness no man can serve Him, than that without self-denial no man can
   be holy. And so it must be from the nature of mankind, and the nature
   of Christ's service. For what is man's nature but sinful flesh? and
   what His service but a sharp corrective? What is man's sin but the
   domination of self-will? and what is the corrective but its abasement
   and abolition? What is each several characteristic form of sin, but
   self-will lusting on every side, and predominantly in some one
   direction? and what is our enfranchisement from sin, but the quelling
   of sinful lusts by Christ's Spirit working in us through self-denial?
   No two powers can be more antagonist than man's nature and Christ's
   service; and the struggle issues, as either power prevails, in apostacy
   or in self-denial.

   We will take one or two particular proofs of this moral necessity.

   1. In the first place: without crossing and denying ourselves, there
   can be no purifying of the moral habits. Without a true compunction and
   a tender conscience, purity of heart, and the energy of a devout mind
   set free from the thraldom of evil, no man can have fellowship with
   Christ; and no man can have these without self-denial. There hangs
   between Him and the soul which is sullied by permitted lusts, a dark
   and impenetrable veil. No holy lights stream through upon it; no
   softening influence pierces the inner gloom; no invitations from above
   draw up the sullen mind towards heaven; no yearnings of heart stretch
   forth their hands unto God; the whole inmost soul is bent into a
   challenging array, or chilled by cold estrangement from God's holy
   presence. And so it must be in every man while his moral habits are not
   purified; and, though there may be many shades, some of a more and some
   a less pronounced and settled character, yet there are, after all, only
   two main classes. A man must either deny or indulge himself. There is
   no middle or indifferent state--for the not denying is indulgence; it
   is throwing the reins on the neck of his lusts, though he may lack
   boldness to set the spur; it is rather the want of self-denial, than
   any conscious and deliberate purpose of sinning, that solves the case
   of most habitual sinners. Positive sins gather and fester in the
   untended moral habit before men are aware that they have so much as
   gained an entrance. It may be, they never sought the sin; they were not
   forward in the temptation; they did not invite it; they were minded not
   to indulge it; it may be, they were somewhat troubled at it--only they
   did not deny it; and so the plague fastened upon them. Out of these
   beginnings issue oftentimes the most settled and deliberate forms of
   vice, which either so blind men's hearts that they cannot trace
   Christ's footsteps, or utterly turn them back from following
   Him--sometimes for ever.

   2. And so, again, even with those who have for a while followed His
   call, how often do we see the fairest promise of a high and elevated
   life marred for want of constancy! They had no endurance, because they
   had no self-denial. What is more common than to see men whose earlier
   years have been shielded from the grosser contact of evil, or whose
   manhood has been, for a season, overcast by some heavy chastening--such
   men outwardly consistent, it may be, for years, and yet at last
   shrinking from hardness, and weary of His correction. They endure for a
   while; but in time of temptation, by change of lot, or by some new
   condition of life, such as wealth or elevation, or by some sifting
   trial, fall away. And what is it but the lack of self-denial which
   brings out such moral anomalies as we daily see? As, for instance, men
   of excited sensibility, with hearts impenetrably hard; or with
   benevolent impulses, but merciless through self-indulgence; or with
   devout minds, but soft, and without fibre enough to wrestle for the
   truth; or full of good intentions, but so flexible as to accomplish
   nothing, so languid as to hold fast by nothing. A self-sparing temper
   will make a man not only an utter contradiction to his Lord, but even
   to himself. Only let difficulties gather and hedge him in, and, though
   honest in the feeble longings of his heart, he will compromise himself
   with petty equivocations, or crooked dealing, just within the verge of
   self-evident duplicity; or he will explain away his meaning, and wear
   down the severe truth of his principles, and come out of the trial no
   better than a worse man would issue from a like temptation.

   3. And still further; without self-denial there can be no real cleaving
   of the moral nature to the will of God. I say real, to distinguish
   between the passive and seeming attachment of most baptised men, and
   the conscious, energetic grasp of will by which Christ's true disciples
   cleave to their Master's service. The faith of many is no more than a
   torpid, immature assent to things they cannot deny. There is no act of
   the will in it. They pay a cheap tribute in the understanding, to buy
   off the obedience of their hearts. They know the Gospel to be logically
   true; but their moral nature has at the most a dull, flitting sympathy
   with the world unseen. They rather gaze after Christ than follow Him.
   And so they linger on through life, dreaming of self-denial: and are
   all the harder to be roused, because they are so invincibly persuaded
   that their dream is a reality. And yet, after all, they have never once
   stirred themselves to so great an effort as to make a choice between
   Christ's service with its cross, and a smooth easy path with no crown
   in heaven. They have but listened without gainsaying; or lived without
   great swervings from the first principles of right. It may be, they
   have looked on while the Church celebrates her mysteries: they have
   been assessors at her worship, and spectators at her fasts and
   festivals: at the most, they have gazed upon the visible form of her
   rites and sacraments. But all this is external to the will. They have
   chosen nothing, and grasped nothing. They have been encompassed by a
   system, but not incorporated with it.

   For these, and for many more like reasons, it is plain that, if any man
   will be a true follower of his Lord, and live after the Exemplar to
   which in his regeneration he was pledged, he must needs put this yoke
   upon himself. "The disciple is not above his Master." The whole earthly
   life of Him we follow; the whole history of His Church, thick set with
   the shining lights of His true servants; the holiness of our calling;
   and the sin that dwells within us,--all alike declare that we must make
   choice between self-indulgence and His service. It is self-evident, and
   inevitable; and by this law our probation is brought to a simple but a
   fearful issue. Either we are now, at this time, denying ourselves, or
   we are not Christ's disciples in that deep inward sense which all but
   shuts out the many who by baptism are made His. And that we may as
   certain whether it be so with us, we have need to ask:

   First, in what do we deny ourselves? It would be very hard for most men
   to find out what one thing, in all the manifold actings of their daily
   life, they either do or leave undone simply for Christ's sake. The
   greater number of men live lives of mere self-pleasing. They take the
   full range of all things not absolutely forbidden. They live ever on
   the very verge of license, and within a hair's-breadth of excess. Such,
   for instance, as live at ease with large revenues, and a full fare, and
   costly furniture, and a retinue of friends--filling a large field in
   the world's eye. To such men the burden and the sharpness of the cross
   are strange, uneasy thoughts. They feel the antipathy of their whole
   inner being to the severe happiness of a Christian life. They would
   fain break through the heavy bonds which weigh upon the sated soul; but
   the weariness of the work, and the perpetual recurrence of the toil, is
   too much for them; and they sink back with the sluggard's portion of
   baffled wishes and a declining hope.

   Again; there are many who fare more hardly--who have fewer offers of
   this world's favour, and accept them sparingly; and they would seem to
   be of a self-denying cast: but after all, it is no more than the
   self-imposed bondage of an earthly soul, wearying itself for some mere
   earthly purpose. Carefulness about money, love of praise, rivalry,
   ambition, a reckless and turbulent spirit, a desire to be thought
   self-denying and severely religious, will often throw out a character
   which may be mistaken for self-denial: and self-denial in one sense it
   is. Such men pursue their deliberate aim with a concentration of
   powers, and a putting forth of energies, which might win for them a
   high place in God's kingdom. They will renounce every thing which can
   relax the intension of the mind; they lay out time, toil, substance;
   they forego ease, pleasure, the gifts of life and home, to reach some
   aim on which the gaze of their heart is fastened. And yet, after all,
   it may be no more than a miserly greediness to amass a fortune, or the
   lust of power, or an earthly vanity to make a family, or the love of
   some poor proximate end, which shall perish on this side of the
   resurrection. And so, perhaps, with each one of us, it would be hard,
   after separating off all things which a craving for men's favourable
   judgment, respect for our own interest, the promptings of a more
   refined regard for self, produces, to trace out any one thing which we
   do or forego simply and altogether for the sake of Christ. This is all
   the harder to discern in lives that are disciplined by the happy order
   of a system such as ours. We live in an age which does homage to
   propriety of conduct. All things around check and restrain us; all the
   lesser moralities of life chasten and throw us in upon ourselves, and
   bring us so near to the likeness of self-denial, that we may well seem,
   even to our own eyes, to be self-denying. And yet, after all, if we can
   find nothing less ambiguous by which to verify our claim to be Christ's
   true followers, no seal, or countersign, of that service which has left
   its visible impression on all the fellowship of saints--ours must be a
   fearful self-deceiving. Surely, if we have no mark upon us which He
   will own, when "the sign of the Son of Man" shall be revealed--no
   imprinted tokens of His sharp crown, or of His sharper cross--how then
   shall they know us for His, who shall be sent to gather His elect from
   the four winds of heaven?

   2. And if we cannot find any thing in which we deny ourselves already,
   we must needs resolve on something in which we may deny ourselves hence
   forward. And in resolving, we should remember that it is a poor
   self-denial which foregoes only in expedient or unnecessary things.
   These are not the subject-matter of self-denial. It is in things lawful
   and innocent, and, it may be, gainful and honourable, and in keeping
   with our lot in life, and such things as the world, by its own measure,
   esteems to be necessary things, that we may really try ourselves: as,
   for instance, in living more simply than our station in life may
   prescribe, or our fortune require; in withdrawing from contests of
   precedence; in contenting ourselves with a lower place, and a less
   portion, than is our acknowledged due; in living toilsome lives of
   well-doing, when we might do well and yet live without toiling;--in
   these, or in points of the like kind, we may find matter for
   self-denial, and that in many ways. A man may either deny himself
   greatly, and once, so that his whole after-life shall bear the marks of
   it,--as in giving up some high and luring offer, and choosing a lowlier
   and a simpler one; in foregoing some dearly cherished purpose, that he
   may be more absolutely His; in crossing some deep yearning of the
   heart, that he may have more to lay out in His service: or he may so
   order his self-denial as to make it a daily and continual sacrifice; he
   may so mete out his acts as to spread them over a wider surface, and
   along a more protracted time; which is, indeed, like retaining what we
   have, and administering it by a continual stewardship, compared with
   the selling at one cast all that we possess.

   And we must remember that, besides these universal obligations, which
   bind Christians in all ages of the Church, there are also particular
   and special reasons binding us more strongly now. We have need to lay
   some such yoke upon ourselves, because we have to pass through no
   persecution for our Lord. We have no rending choice to make, no
   forfeiture of all things to endure. We should suffer rather, were we to
   forsake His service. All the prescriptions of nearly two thou sand
   years, and all the unwritten customs of life, constrain us to follow
   Him. We were made His servants by no will of our own: we may seem to
   abide with Him, and yet have no clinging of our moral nature to His
   holy fellowship. Our Christianity is indistinguishably blended with the
   unconscious habits of our passive life. We have never been tested,
   never in peril for our hope's sake, never forced to choose between
   suffering and apostacy. And therefore, under the fairest seeming, there
   may lurk a fearful, variable temper, which, in the day of trial, would
   betray the Lord, and forfeit the crown of life. We have little
   opportunity of knowing whether we could endure hardness, save by
   putting ourselves upon some trying rule. Perhaps many live and die
   unknown to themselves, fully persuaded that they are what indeed they
   are not: many think themselves to be His, who will not be found among
   "Christ's at His coming." And there is still a further reason, and that
   is, because the Church imposes on her members no private and particular
   discipline. Their self-denial, therefore, is the individual act of
   each. The framing of our own private order of religion is, for the most
   part, left to the individual conscience. And for minds of a devoted
   cast, it may be, this is well. It may elicit higher forms of a more
   conscious self-oblation. But we have need to look to it, that what the
   Church does not peremptorily require, we do not forget to practise. For
   the health of the moral character, it is absolutely necessary that we
   have some definite rule; and we have no need to strain after great
   occasions--for our every-day life abounds in manifold opportunities of
   self-discipline: we shall find them in the hours of prayer, in the
   practice of charity, in alms-deeds, in fasting, in abstinence, in
   straitening our ease, in abstaining from lawful, and to ourselves
   expedient, things for others sakes, in curbing our pleasures, in
   bearing slander, in forgiving injuries, in obeying our superiors, in
   yielding to our equals, in giving up our liberty for the good of
   others, in crossing the daily intentions of our will. In these inward
   and hidden motions of the mind we may keep clear both from excitement
   and from eccentricity, and yet live a life mortified and separate from
   the world we see, and in sympathy with the world unseen. And the man
   thus purged of self is drawn ever more and more within the veil; the
   realities of faith stand out ever more and more before his eyes in
   awful majesty; and he lives no more unto himself, but unto Christ his
   Lord. He is ever drawing nearer to His throne; and his shall be a calm
   lot on earth, and a high destiny in heaven, even as his that said,
   "Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear in my body the marks of
   the Lord Jesus;" [24] and, in the clear foresight of his departure,
   when the toil and the cross were almost ended, "Hence forth there is
   laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous
   Judge shall give me at that day." [25]

SERMON VIII.

  CHRIST OUR ONLY REST.

    ST. MATTHEW xi. 28-30.

   "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
   lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is
   easy, and my burden is light."

   WITH these gracious promises our blessed Lord drew to Him the people
   who were toiling and struggling with the burdens of this saddened and
   sinful world. He saw not only sinners, but many a good man wearying
   himself in vain.

   Among those to whom He spoke, He saw besides those that were heavy
   laden with their own sins, many who were burdened with evil traditions
   and unmeaning customs; who were fainting under the yoke which had been
   laid upon them as a school master to bring them unto Christ. He
   promised them rest, if they would come, and learn, and take on them His
   yoke, i.e. if they would obey and follow Him, if they would believe and
   be like Him. Many there were, as Andrew and Levi, who gave up their
   former ways., and all that they had, and made the trial, and found the
   promise true. They found rest in forgiveness and a quiet mind, in a
   heart chastened into a holy calm, and in the hope of their Master's
   kingdom. Now what He promised them when He was seen of men on earth, He
   has both promised and fulfilled ever since from heaven. He has ever
   been in the world by His unseen Spirit--pleading, drawing, persuading
   men to take His easy yoke. This He has done by His Church in the world.
   Among all nations He has gone, offering rest to every weary soul. Who
   can tell what has ever been the ineffable yearning of the heathen
   world; what tumultuous cries of spiritual sorrow have been heard in the
   ears of God? There has ever been the voice of conscience, and the sting
   of guilt, and the fears of defenceless purity, and the remorse of
   conscious sin. Without a doubt, among the myriads of eternal beings who
   thronged the face of the earth at Christ's coming, there were tens of
   thousands who felt higher and purer aspirations, who sighed and strove
   for light and truth in the dark and stifling bondage of heathenism. And
   to these, in due season, Christ in His Church went preaching, as "to
   spirits in prison," bringing the balm of meekness, and the peace of a
   lowly heart. When they heard Him, they were drawn to Him by an
   irresistible persuasion. They had found what they darkly longed
   for--and all the wants and miseries of their being clung to His healing
   touch. They were "refreshed with the multitude of peace."

   And not only so, but within the Church itself, and to this day, Christ
   ever calls, in these soft, persuasive words, "Come unto me, all ye that
   are weary and heavy laden." It is not only among the unregenerate
   spirits of men, but among those also who have been born again by His
   gracious working, that He finds toiling and burdened hearts. As He
   stands in the midst of His Church, and be holds our daily life, and all
   the hurrying to and fro of weary and restless spirits, He sees and
   pities our blind infirmities: for many are His by baptism, who have
   never learnt of Him; many know Him in word, who have never borne His
   yoke; many have seemed to draw nigh, who have found no rest unto their
   souls.

   For instance, He sees among us the very same kinds of men as among the
   Jews--sinners "laden with sins"--men conscious of guilt, hating the sin
   for its after-agonies, but yielding to its momentary bait. The throes
   and torments of Christian men are worse even than the terrors of the
   heathen or the Jew. For Christians know of life and immortality: to
   them Tophet and Gehenna are no parables, but well-known and horrible
   realities. No tongue of man can tell the scourge, and fear, and
   suffocating burden of guilt seen in the light of an illuminated
   conscience. And this is all around us, among baptised men. It is the
   cause of their stubbornness in sin, because it is the root of their
   despair.

   But, besides these, there are men of a worldly heart, who weary
   themselves day and night in the round of gain or selfishness, "lading
   themselves with thick clay;" early and late full of care--with furrowed
   brows and withered hearts; wearing a false cheerfulness, being sick in
   their inmost soul. This world fairly frets such a man's heart through
   and through; to him the world is overgrown, and all its cares are
   swollen to an unnatural greatness. He has no sight of the world unseen,
   to check and balance the visible world; and therefore this world is all
   things to him. Hence come foolish choices, and inordinate cravings, and
   bitter disappointments. I am not speaking of men who are so greedy of
   gold as to pass into a proverb; but of a common sample of men, whose
   aim in life is to gain no more than an ordinary measure of wealth, or
   to rise, as they say, to becoming places of dignity and power. If you
   could read the inner life of such men, you would find their minds wound
   up to an incessant and unrelieved stretch, which is ever at the highest
   pitch. At last it makes them weary of themselves, and they break down
   in bitterness or imbecility. There is also all the aching of
   disappointment, and the irritation of rivalry, and the fear of
   miscarriage, and the foresight of unpitied falls; and well is it if
   there be not also the hidden smouldering of an angry jealousy, and the
   wincing soreness, which ambitious and envious minds feel at the very
   name of a successful neighbour. What burden heavier than this dead
   world bound about the heart of man? what yoke more galling than a
   restless, craving spirit?

   And, once more; there are others who are not less truly labouring in
   vain, though they know it not: I mean, those that are making happiness
   their aim in life. There are many who ply this unprofitable,
   disappointing trade. I am not speaking of sensualists, or empty-hearted
   followers of this vain glorious world; but of grave and thoughtful
   people, whose theory of life is the pursuit of individual happiness.
   They look forward, as a matter of course, to certain great acts and
   stages of life, as to things predetermined by a customary law.
   Oftentimes, indeed, their aims and desires are very reasonable;
   sometimes sadly commonplace. They choose out, for instance, some of
   life's purer fountains, running through a broken cistern, at which to
   slake their thirst to be happy. There is some thing lacking--something
   without which their being is not full. They take, it may be, many ways
   of meeting this craving of their hearts; but diverse as are their
   schemes, their aim is all one--they have a predominant desire to be
   happy, and to choose their own happiness; and therefore they are full
   of disappointments, perpetually wounded on some side, which they have
   laid bare to the arrows of life. The treacherous reed is ever running
   up into the hand that leans on it. They are ever giving hostages, as it
   were, to this changeful world, and ever losing their dearest pledges;
   and so they toil on, trying to rear up a happiness around them, which
   is ever dropping piecemeal, and, at last, is swept away by some
   chastening stroke; and then, no wiser than before, they set themselves,
   with a bruised and chafing heart, to weave the same entanglements
   again.

   From what has been said, it follows plainly:

   First, that all our unrest and weariness is in and of ourselves. It is
   either the slavery of some tyrannous sin, or the scourge of an
   impenitent memory, or the indulgence of some fretful, implacable
   temper, or some self-flattering and sensitive vanity, some repining
   discontent at what we are, or some impotent straining after what God
   has not willed us to be, or some hungering for an earthly happiness,
   with all the chill and faintness of heart which arises from the
   ever-present consciousness that what we crave for, even though we had
   it, would fail to satisfy; besides all these, the weary recurrence of
   night and day, laboriously spent in toiling on towards an end they
   never reach,--these, I say, and only these, or such-like, make men
   weary and desolate. If they would only burst through this thraldom of
   indulged faults, or break the spell of this cheating, benumbing world,
   they should soon find rest to their souls. But so long as they run on
   in the ring of evil or vain desires, God will not give them rest; nay,
   should He give it, they would soon barter it away for some exciting
   pleasure.

   Once more; we may learn that it is only in Him that we can find rest;
   that is, it is only by learning of Him, yielding ourselves up to Him,
   and living for Him, that we can find release from the causes of our
   disquiet, or rest for the deep cravings of an immortal being.

   The main and original fault in all our toiling after rest is this: we
   forget that peace with God, and the purification of our own nature, is
   the absolute condition to our ever reaching it. Here men stumble on the
   very threshold; and here it is that Christ will have us make the first
   step. "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
   in heart." The first step to rest is, to have forgiveness in the
   blood-shedding of Christ, and to have His mind renewed in us. It is
   thus hat we are delivered from ourselves. Even though men should gain
   all they labour after, yet, with out this, happiness would be as far
   off as ever; it would fly before them as the horizon, which they are
   ever following after, but never reach. In the very midst of success,
   the bitterness of the fallen nature would rise to the surface, and
   taint all the joy. How uneasily does a cheerful look sit upon the face
   of the happiest worldly man! how soon it fades, and the settled aspect
   of uncertainty return and over cast his brow! There is a worm that
   dieth not at the root of all--a "sorrow of the world," which "worketh
   death." It is only the virtue that goes out from Christ that can
   disinfect us of our natural sadness. Nothing but a devout life of
   repentance and self-discipline at the foot of His cross can avail to
   free us from ourselves. Seek, then, forgiveness, and the gift of a
   broken heart. Ask of Him the words of peace--"Thy sins be forgiven
   thee;" and the words of purity--"I will; be thou clean." He will lay on
   you that sweet yoke, of which He spake in the mountain of beatitudes:
   Blessed are the poor in spirit, the mourners, the meek, the hungry and
   thirsty for righteousness, the merciful, the poor, the peacemakers, the
   persecuted. He will change your inward soul by His purifying breath. As
   you fall down before Him, He will lift upon you the light of His
   countenance, which transfigures all on whom it falls into the likeness
   of Himself. Be sure that in Him only can the deep cravings of our
   immortal being find enough. He has so made man's heart for Himself,
   that it is restless ever until it finds rest in Him. [26]

   This is the master-key to all earthly disappointments. Men choose a
   false, cheating happiness, in the stead of a true. They choose things
   which have nothing akin to their immortal nature. All earthly things
   are too lifeless and dull for the tact of spiritual beings. Something
   higher and purer, more intimate and searching, is needed for a
   regenerate man: or only a part, and that the lower, of his reasonable
   being is affected by the fullest earthly happiness; and when men have
   chosen even the best of earthly things, the purest and highest,--such
   as intellectual employments, or domestic happiness,--they find it
   variable and fleeting. It wears dull, or soon changes to a cloyed
   satiety. There is an ever-springing care, and a thrilling anxiety,
   which pierces through all such happiness at its best. Even when God is
   not forgotten, it is not enough; and without Him it is all an exciting
   and empty dream. O that men would learn of the Psalmist! "Delight
   thyself in the Lord; and He shall give thee the desires of thine
   heart." [27] It is not for man to choose happiness as the end of
   life--but God: to delight in God, and then none of his desires shall
   fail. As they are all laid up in God, so he has them all fulfilled. If
   it be good for him to be happy, he shall have happiness; if not, it is
   happiness to him to lack what God in love withholds.

   But God would have all men happy. As He has no pleasure in the death of
   a sinner, so has He none in his sadness. He would have you to be happy,
   but not in your way. The time and the manner He reserves in His own
   power. Happiness is not a thing inherited by the rich alone--the
   poorest may better have it; nor is it only for them that have many and
   dear friends about them--the loneliest may have it in a deeper though a
   severer measure; for happiness is an inward boon; it is shed abroad
   secretly in the heart by the love of Christ. They that have chosen Him
   above all others have chosen well. He is enough, though they hardly
   feel it; though their affections crave about, like a flickering flame,
   for nearer and palpable things. Therefore let us choose boldly. Some
   choice you must have. Even the most wavering have a preference, which
   to them is equal to a choice. A thousand other forms beckon to us with
   promises of rest; but only He can give it. Choose rather to sit at His
   feet than to be at ease, or rich, or high, or prosperous, or full of
   bright earthly hopes. Yea, choose rather to sit in loneliness before
   Him, than to dwell in the happiest throng, where He holds the second
   place. Life is very short; and the world to come already dawns upon us.
   Brethren, choose boldly a life devoted to Christ. Be His above all; be
   His only. Hear the Church saying, "My beloved is mine, and I am His."
   The world holds you but by a thread; you may snap it in twain, and in
   the settled though hidden purpose of your soul take on you His yoke for
   ever.

   And having chosen boldly, make good your choice with perseverance. Many
   a time your heart will hanker for what it once promised itself to
   possess. Many a time you will almost fear to walk alone in the way
   "which is desert." It will seem strange, singular, and solitary. It may
   be, you will have seasons of a faint will--at times all but consent to
   revoke your choice, and unbind your resolution. But this is not your
   trial only. It is common to all who devote themselves greatly. Only be
   stedfast, and you shall breathe more freely, and poise yourselves more
   steadily on the heaving flood of this unstable world. The more devoted
   you are to Him, the more absolutely free shall you be from all
   perturbations--the safer, the stronger, the happier. True, a devoted
   life is a severe one. But there is a severity in the perfection of
   bliss. It is severe because perfect, as God is awful in His perfection.
   Fear not to give up what the world counts dearest, that you may wear
   His yoke in secret. Live in lowly well-doing; in works of alms and
   prayer, of charity and spiritual mercy. Better to be so under a vow to
   Him, than to be free to choose this world's alluring hopes. Brethren,
   are you happy now? If not, why not? Why, but because you are hankering
   after something on a lower level of devotion. Something below Christ is
   your aim in life. You are restless because you have not reached it; or
   now that you have it in your hands, you find it cannot satisfy your
   heart.

   "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and cumbered about many things. But
   one thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall
   not be taken away from her." [28]

SERMON IX.

  THE DANGER OF MISTAKING KNOWLEDGE FOR OBEDIENCE.

    ST. JAMES i. 22, 23, 24.

   "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
   selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
   unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: for he beholdeth
   himself and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of
   man he was."

   ST. JAMES is here warning the great body of the Church against a very
   common and subtle temptation; that is, the substituting of Christian
   knowledge for Christian obedience.

   The Gospel had in it such an overwhelming power of speculative and
   moral truth as to subdue a mixed multitude of men to a sort of
   professed allegiance to the mysteries of God. It came into the world as
   a veiled light of transcendent brightness, revealing the mystery of the
   Godhead, and the condition of mankind; resolving the doubts of the
   wise, and unravelling the perplexities of the unlearned; it laid open
   the secrets of the unseen world, and put a continuous meaning into the
   great movements of the world we see; it made man to know and to feel
   that he is a fallen and sinful being, and that God, of His great love,
   has pledged to him the forgiveness of his sins. And thus, as it
   declared the character of God, and the standing of man before Him, and
   the mysteries of life and death, and hell and heaven, it silenced the
   disputations of contending schools, and won men to itself by the
   yearnings of their hearts, and the convictions of their understanding,
   and the judgments of conscience, and a miraculous consent of will; it
   held up each man to himself, as in a mirror of supernatural truth,
   revealing depths of evil which men knew not before; and thus there was
   gathered round the Gospel a mixed and numberless multitude of all kinds
   and character of life; from the holiest to the least purified, from the
   man who is sanctified beyond the measure of his knowledge, to the man
   whose knowledge was as full as his life was unholy.

   Now this is the sin and the danger against which St. James warns them;
   against the sin, that is, of having knowledge without obedience, and
   the danger of hearing without doing the word of God. He tells them that
   all such knowledge is in vain, nay worse than in vain. And this is what
   we will more fully consider.

   1. In the first place, we must remember that this knowledge without
   obedience ends in nothing. It is, as St. James says, like a man who
   looks at his own face in a glass. For the time he has the clearest
   perception of his own countenance; every line and feature; even the
   lightest expression, is visible, and, by the mysteriously retentive
   power of the mind, he holds it for a while in what we call the mind's
   eye: but when he has gone his way, the whole image fades, and the
   vividness of other objects overpowers it, so that he becomes habitually
   more familiar with the aspect of all other things than with his own
   natural face. Nothing can better express the shallowness and
   fleetingness of knowledge without obedience. For the time it is vivid
   and exact, but it passes off in nothing--no resolution recorded in the
   conscience, or, if recorded, none maintained; no change of life, no
   thing done, or left undone, for the sake of the truth which is shadowed
   upon the understanding. And this is the folly which our Lord rebukes in
   the parable of the man that built his house upon the sand. He was not
   comparing the solidity of doctrinal foundations; but exhibiting the
   folly and disappointment of knowledge without obedience. "Every one
   that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be
   likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: and
   the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat
   upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it." [29]

   2. But it must also be considered that knowing without obeying is worse
   than in vain. It inflicts a deep and lasting injury upon the powers of
   our spiritual nature. Even in the hardest of men, a knowledge of
   Christianity produces an effect upon the conscience and the heart. It
   excites in a man certain convictions and emotions, and these are
   mysterious gifts of God; they are the first movements of the moral
   powers that are within us, the first impulses to set us in motion
   towards God. It is by these inward strivings that knowledge brings a
   man to repentance and to eternal life. But they are only movements and
   impulses--means to a further end, and good in so far as they attain
   that end. In their own nature they are most transitory: they can be
   prolonged only by issuing in obedience, and thereby settling into
   principle; or, if they issue in nothing, by keeping up a perpetual
   succession of the same excitements. Now here is the peril of habitually
   listening to truths which we habitually disobey. Every time we hear
   them, they goad the conscience, and stir the heart; but every time with
   a lessened force, and, as it were, with a blunter edge;--not, indeed,
   that they can lose aught of their own power and keenness, but because
   the often-excited mind grows languid and dull; its senses, often acted
   on, are deadened; the passive powers of the mind wear out, as the ear
   seems to lose all hearing of familiar sounds, or as a pampered palate
   is vitiated and its functions destroyed. So is it with men who from
   their baptism have been familiar with the mysteries of Christ. In
   childhood, boyhood, manhood, the same sounds of warning, and promise,
   and persuasion, the same hopes and fears, have fallen on a heedless
   ear, and a still more heedless heart: they have lost their power over
   the man; he has acquired a settled habit of hearing without doing. The
   whole force of habit--that strange mockery of nature--has reinforced
   his original reluctance to obey; and long familiarity with truth makes
   it all the harder to recognise,--as the faces of those we most
   intimately know are often less distinct in our memory than those we
   have seen but seldom, and therefore noted all the more exactly.

   3. But there is a yet further danger still; for knowledge without
   obedience is an arch-deceiver of mankind. "Be ye doers of the word, and
   not hearers only, deceiving your own selves"--deceiving, i.e. as if you
   were any the nearer heaven for a cold, barren consciousness that the
   Gospel is the word of God, or a clear intellectual perception of its
   several doctrines. Nay, it deceives a man into the belief that he
   really is what he so clearly knows he ought to be; that he is really
   moving onward in the path which he so clearly knows he must walk in, if
   he would inherit the kingdom of God. It is a wonderful imposture men
   pass upon themselves. One would think, the clearer a man's knowledge of
   what he ought to do and be, the clearer would be his perception of the
   vast moral distance between that high standard and his actual state.
   But, no. The heart is a busy mocker of the conscience: it borrows of
   the understanding and of the imagination visions and shadows of eternal
   truth, and it flatters the conscience into a pleasant belief that such
   are its own spontaneous dictates and intentions; it cheats it into
   appropriating, as its own moral character, the mere shadows which lie
   on the surface of the intellect. And from this comes the ready and
   exact profession of religion which is often found in the mouth even of
   irreligious men: they know so well what a holy character ought to be,
   that they are able exactly to describe it. They can sketch out all its
   outline, and fill in its detail, and colour it, by what we should call
   the merely imaginative or graphic powers of the mind. And as the most
   undisguised fictions often move our lower feelings as deeply as truth
   itself, emotions come in to help the cheat, and a man really kindles at
   his own vivid descriptions; but he deceives others less than he
   deceives himself. When he speaks of the love of God, or the passion of
   Christ, or the heavenly Jerusalem, or the crowns of martyrs, and the
   holiness of saints, and the happiness of a Christian life, the topics
   grow upon him, and he moves himself, much as he might by some pathetic
   tale, and his emotions flatter him into the belief that he is a man of
   religious feelings; and then how can he doubt that his heart is
   religious too? So we mock ourselves, and Satan ensnares us. We draw a
   haze, as it were, over the clear eye of the conscience, by the warmth
   of kindled emotions; and the outlines of our slighted knowledge are
   verily taken for the realities of a holy life. This will be found to be
   the true key of many characters. We see men who know every thing a
   Christian has need to know to his soul's health, and yet are as little
   like Christians in their daily habit of life, as if they had never
   reached beyond the moral philosophy of heathen schools. But nothing
   would make them believe it;--they have deceived their own selves.
   Again; there are men who can never speak of religious truth without
   emotion, and sometimes not without tears; and yet, though their
   knowledge has so much of fervour as to make them weep, it has not power
   enough to make them deny a lust. Ay, brethren, it will be found with
   most of us, that we verily believe ourselves to be better than we are.
   It is a pleasant flattery, and a quiet self-indulgence, which winds
   itself through our minds, and soothes them when we are ill at ease. We
   overrate what we do well; we wink at what we do amiss. We comfort
   ourselves that we know better, and shall therefore do better another
   time. We fall back on our better knowledge, as a makeweight against our
   worse practice, and as a pledge of future improvement, forgetting that
   it aggravates our present faults.

   4. And this brings us to another thought: this knowing and disobeying
   it is that makes so heavy and awful the responsibilities of Christians.
   The servant that knew his Lord's will, and did it not, shall be beaten
   with many stripes; but the servant who knew not his Lord's will, and
   did not make ready, shall be beaten with few stripes. It is a good plea
   and a prevailing, to say, "Lord, I knew not that it was Thy will." Even
   Saul was for given, albeit he persecuted the Church of God. "I obtained
   mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief." But knowledge is a
   great and awful gift: it makes a man partaker of the mind of God; it
   communes with him of the eternal will, and reveals to him the royal law
   of God's kingdom. A man cannot know and slight these things without
   grievous and fearful sin. "It is better not to have known the way of
   righteousness, than after they have known it to turn from the holy
   commandment delivered unto them." To hold this knowledge in
   unrighteousness, to imprison it in the stifling hold of an impure, a
   proud, or a rebellious heart, is a most appalling insult against the
   majesty of the God of truth.

   For whom were the heaviest words of doom reserved by our most patient
   and gentle Lord, but for those that had known Him, but not obeyed? "Woe
   unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works
   had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you, they had a
   great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes: but it shall
   be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. And
   thou, Capernaum, who art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to
   hell." [30]

   What was this but the recoil of truth upon the soul that had slighted
   its warning voice? "Whosoever shall fall upon this stone shall be
   broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
   [31]

   These, then, are some of the many reasons why we have need to watch
   against this subtle temptation. It is a vain and hurtful thing, full of
   deceit and danger, to hear and not to do, to know and not to obey, the
   Gospel; and it is a temptation to which the Church, though exposed at
   all times, is most especially liable when the means of knowledge are
   greatly multiplied, and the bonds of discipline are greatly
   relaxed;--and such a state of the Church is ours now, at this day. From
   baptism to the end of life, you have God's holy word, and the holy
   sacraments, the fasts and festivals, and all the sacred admonitions of
   things old and new, to force a knowledge of religion even upon the
   unwilling mind. It is as the light of heaven, which we cannot choose
   but see, though we may wilfully shut our eyes. In such a state, the
   danger of living far behind the light we have is in finitely great;
   especially as our rule of self-discipline is chiefly made by each man
   for himself; and the custom of the world, which is unchangeably at
   variance with the mind and Church of God, bears heavily upon us. We
   have to breast it and to stem it, and are perpetually carried by it
   away from our resolutions. But these are perilous declensions, making
   great havoc in the inward character of the mind.

   Steadily resolve, therefore, to live up to the light you possess. There
   is an unity, a sameness, and a strength about a consistent character.
   The light you already have is great, and great therefore must be your
   obedience; and remember that to linger behind, or to follow afar off,
   is as if you should suffer your guide to outstrip you in the
   night-season. You hold your present knowledge on the tenure of
   obedience: to disobey it, is to dim its brightness, and yet to deepen
   your responsibility; for we shall answer even less heavily for what we
   still have than for what we have lost. These are fearful words: "They
   received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for
   this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
   believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the
   truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." [32]

   But though for the most part your knowledge is great, there are some
   who feel or believe their own light to be small. It is not in the
   greatness of the light, but in the closeness with which we follow it,
   that we shall find safety. "Thy word is a light unto my feet, and a
   lantern to my path." It is the clear dictate of conscience, enlightened
   by even a single ray of truth, guiding the details of a Christian's
   daily life, that will bring him to heaven. Therefore, once more, let us
   learn not to delay to follow with readiness the guidance of right
   knowledge. If it do but beckon or point you in the way of obedience,
   follow without lingering. The first penetrating conviction, and the
   kindled emotion, and the momentary willingness which raises the eyes of
   obedient hearts to higher and holier paths, and dislodges even a
   stubborn mind from its most settled purpose, these are sent as the
   first impulses to launch you in an heavenward course. Do not slight
   them: beware how you stifle them. They are as fleeting as the memory of
   a reflected image. It may be you have them now: if lost, it may be you
   shall have them never again.

SERMON X.

  OBEDIENCE THE ONLY REALITY.

    1 ST. JOHN ii. 17.

   "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the
   will of God abideth for ever."

   IT may seem perhaps a hard saying, that in this majestic and dazzling
   world there is only one imperishable reality, and that, a thing most
   hidden and despised--I mean, a will obedient to the will of God. Yet
   nothing is more certain. It is plain that nothing is truly real which
   is not eternal. In a certain sense, all things, the most shadowy and
   fleeting,--the frosts, and dews, and mists of heaven,--are real; every
   light which falls from the upper air, every reflection of its
   brightness towards heaven again, is a reality. It is a creature of God;
   and is here in His world, fulfilling His will. But these things we are
   wont to take as symbols and parables of unreality, and that because
   they are changeful and transitory. It is clear, then, that when we
   speak of realities, we mean things that have in them the germ of an
   abiding life. Things which pass away at last, how long soever they may
   seem to tarry with us, we call forms and appearances. They have no
   intrinsic being; for a time they are, and then they are not. Their very
   being was an accident; they were shadows of a reality, cast for a time
   into the world, and then withdrawn. In strictness of speech, we can
   call nothing real which is not eternal. Now it is in this sense that I
   have said, the only reality in the world is a will obedient to the will
   of God: and this we will consider more at large.

   1. First of all, it is plain that the only reality in this visible
   world is man. "The earth, and all the works that are therein, shall be
   burned up." [33] Whatsoever may lie hid in these awful words, it is
   clear that they declare this world to be transitory, and its end
   determined. Of all things that have life without a reasonable soul, we
   know no more than that they perish. All visible things are ever
   changing; material forms passing into new combinations, shifting their
   sameness with their shapes: all things around us, and above us, and
   beneath, are full of change; they heave, and mingle, and resolve, and
   pass off by some mysterious law of intercommunication, and by that law
   declare that they are not eternal. In like manner, all the works of
   men, all the arts of life, are no more than the impressions and
   characters left by the spirit of man, while subject to the conditions
   of an earthly state. Kingdoms, and polities, and laws, and armies, and
   mechanical powers, and the achievements of wisdom, and wit, and might,
   and the infinite maze of human action, from the beginning to the ending
   of the world's history,--what are they all, under the providence of
   God, but so many fleeting and broken shadows, cast from the
   ever-varying postures of man's restless spirit? They are all in time
   and of time, and with time shall pass away, save only their accumulated
   results, of which we shall have to speak hereafter. Such, for instance,
   were the empires of Nimrod and Nebuchadnezzar, of Persia and Greece; or
   let us take, as an example, the great empire of Rome. For well nigh two
   thousand years what a sleepless movement of human life swarmed round
   that wonderful centre of the world! how it expanded itself from a point
   to be the girdle of the whole earth! how that same teeming power of
   thought and action wrought itself inwardly into a wondrous polity of
   ordered and civilised life, and outwardly, through fleets and legions,
   into an irresistible force, breaking in pieces, and fusing, and
   recasting the world into its own mould! And so it wrought on from
   century to century, as if it would never wax old; and men, from this,
   were beguiled to call it the Eternal City. And it bid fair to be coeval
   with the world. And yet of all that majestic phenomenon, what shall
   remain, when the fashion of this world hath passed away, but the
   isolated individual souls which in this world were lost in its mighty
   life? The whole is gone by, like a stately and stupendous pageant, and
   its mighty frame resolved again into its original dust. No thing
   survives but the mass of human life; and that not blended as before,
   but each one as several and apart as if none lived before God but he
   only. And so of all the course and history of the world; all is either
   past or passing away; nothing remains but the record of human life in
   the book of the Eternal, and the stream of undying spirits which is
   ever issuing from among us into the world unseen. And thus it is that
   all that is real in the world is ever passing out of it; tarrying for a
   while in the midst of shadows and reflections, and then, as it were,
   melting out of sight.

   2. Again; as the only reality in the world is man, so the only reality
   in man is his spiritual life. By this I do not exclude his animal
   being, but expressly include it, as the less is included in the
   greater. In like manner as, when we speak of a spiritual body, we mean
   not a spirit only, but a body under the conditions of the spirit; so by
   the spiritual life is meant the living man made new by the power of the
   Holy Ghost. Before his regeneration through the Spirit, he was dead in
   the flesh; he was a part of this dying world, which is ever passing
   away; unknown changes awaited him; and after the last visible change,
   there was no destiny revealed. We know not all that the doom, "Thou
   shalt surely die," may mean in the state of the dead. But the
   regenerate man is translated from death to life; he is made partaker of
   immortality, and is again eternal. I am speaking, then, of that
   spiritual life which is in all that are born again; and I say that this
   alone is intrinsically eternal, forasmuch as it is an awful gift of the
   Divine Presence, and is the one only, and true, and abiding reality.

   Now the truth of this will be made to appear, if we consider the
   following points. First, that of what is called the life of man--that
   is, of his living acts and energies--the greatest part is altogether
   separable from his spiritual life, and is therefore altogether
   transient and perishing: such, for instance, as all his endless,
   ever-returning toil for the sustentation of this bodily life; all the
   homage which we are compelled to pay to the conditions of our earthly
   state, and the wants of our fallen manhood. It matters not what is the
   particular form of all this toiling: whether a man be a tiller of the
   earth, or a keeper of flocks, or a merchant, or a pleader, or an
   orator, or a maker of laws, he is laboriously serving the necessities
   of our earthly condition; and though a faithful man may turn any or all
   of these callings into a service of spiritual obedience, yet they may
   be, each one, and are, for the most part, all of them, fulfilled
   without a thought of the inner life, by the almost mechanical powers of
   the reason and the will. Now all this, which makes up the greatest part
   of the life of most men, is little better than mere contact with this
   perishing world. Except when incorporated with the spiritual life, it
   has no admixture of permanence, and, in the sense we have defined, of
   reality. It is a mere shadow, transient and fleeting. All the sweat of
   the brow, all the bold enterprises, all the skilful address, all the
   kindling oratory, all the science of government, and all the toil by
   which these were earned, and all the wealth or greatness by which they
   are waited on,--where are they all when a man comes to die, or when he
   must fall down before God to confess a sin? They are as utterly
   abolished as if they were all acted in a masque, or done in a former
   life. How strangely, how awfully external and unreal do all these
   things appear, when we are on our knees beneath the Eternal Eye!

   And so, again, to take another instance: even that which seems above
   all to enter into the very deep of our spiritual life,--I mean the
   cultivation of mind, refinement, the excitement of intellectual powers,
   the acquirement of learning and science, which things seem to us to
   give the distinguishing mould and cast to the characters of men,--how
   altogether separable are these things also from the spiritual being!
   They are often found in men of the unholiest passions. The railing
   scoffer, the most impure sensualist, the man in whom the spiritual life
   seems absolutely quenched, oftentimes far more largely possesses these
   manifold gifts of our intellectual nature than the most devoted of
   God's servants. They are but partial developments of his reasonable
   life; altogether unsanctified; in no way related to the spiritual
   being; earthly, and therefore but shadows of the eternal gifts of the
   hallowed and illuminated reason. Now most men of learning and
   self-cultivation, if they would but look closely and truly into
   themselves, would be awe-struck to see how little unity there is
   between their intellectual and their spiritual powers; how unreal is
   all they are living in, and, unless taken up into the spiritual life,
   and thereby consecrated, how hollow and perishable is all the toil and
   fret of their daily labour. If any proof of this were wanting, we need
   only see such men in times of sorrow, or fear, or anxiety, or
   pain--above all, in a season of death. It seems, then, as if all but a
   tithe of their whole being were suddenly abolished: all their powers,
   and energies, and acquirements, are as remote and alien from their
   present needs, as so many broad acres, or stately houses, or costly
   retinues. They all alike seem splendid unrealities, which have done
   little more than dazzle and draw off the eyes of the inner spirit from
   that which alone is eternal.

   And, besides this, remember that nothing of all we have and are in this
   world, save only our spiritual life, and that which is impressed upon
   it and blended with it, shall we carry into the world unseen. Even as
   we said of this world's entangled history, so is it of the life of each
   several man. Though all things shall be remembered in the judgment, and
   though all that he has ever done or spoken shall have left some stamp
   for good or ill upon his immortal spirit, yet what a putting-off of
   this lower life shall there be at that day! "Every man's work shall be
   made manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be
   revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort
   it is. If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall
   receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer
   loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire." [34] Of all
   the unnumbered goings on of this busy life, of all its deeds, and
   achievements, and possessions, how small a remainder shall be found
   after that fiery trial has done its work! how shall the "wood, hay, and
   stubble," and all the unrealities of act, and word, and thought, and
   self-persuasion, and empty imagination, and conventional formalities,
   and personal observances, be burned up; and no thing abide that
   searching test but the powers of our spiritual life! And of all the
   regenerate to whom that high gift was given, none shall pass through
   that piercing trial into God's kingdom but only they in whom there
   shall be found a will obedient to the will of God. They that have held
   a regenerate nature in disobedience are condemned already with the
   world, and must perish with the world--"for the world passeth away, and
   the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."

   From what has been said, let this one broad inference suffice, that the
   aim of our life ought to be to partake of this eternal obedience.
   Nothing else is worth our living for. We have been each one of us born
   again. Obedient or disobedient we must be, real or unreal, imperishable
   or perishing.

   And therefore our first care must needs be, to watch against whatsoever
   may turn the obedience of our will away from God. Of the commission of
   actual sin I need say nothing; I am speaking only of those in whom the
   regenerate will so far prevails as to make them, in the main, obey the
   will of God. The temptations which keep alive the disobedience of the
   will are such as these; strong desires after any aim in life, worldly
   foresight, long-drawn schemes of action, over-carefulness in the work
   of our calling, the indulgence of choosing and wishing for the future,
   a soft life, love of ease, and the like: now all these strengthen the
   action of our own will, and make us impatient of a cross. If events
   fall out otherwise than we desire, we grow rest less and repining; or
   if we do not carry ourselves in open variance to the will of God, we
   submit with sullenness and a chafing heart. All this is because we have
   willed things in some other way; we have been forecasting, and taking
   counsel of our own wishes, and measuring things by their supposed
   bearing upon ourselves; and our will has become so imperious in its
   choice, that we forget the sovereignty of God in His own world. Now, we
   are all tempted to this fault by nature; and even after we have so far
   yielded ourselves as to obey His laws in the main tenour of our life,
   there lingers behind a strong root of spiritual disobedience in the
   heart; and we are ever exciting and stimulating it in secret. Our
   calling in life presents a thousand subtle provocations to awaken and
   sustain the independent life of our will. And this explains our bitter
   disappointments, immoderate griefs, irritable tempers, jealous
   feelings. We have been imposing laws on the course of our destinies,
   taking the rule of God's kingdom out of His hands, and surrounding
   ourselves with an unreal world of hopes, and fears, and choices, and
   yearnings of our own; and God has touched it with His hand, and it has
   started asunder and crumbled away. These states of our interior life
   are very insidious. There is perhaps hardly any man who is so wholly
   free from them, as to be altogether real and simple. For the most part,
   men choose, in thought, what they like best, and then will that it
   should come to pass, and then persuade themselves that it is to be so,
   and live in the persuasion, and "walk in a vain shadow, and disquiet
   themselves in vain." They are out of harmony with the movement of the
   Divine will, and become hollow and visionary. And that, too, in the
   most commonplace manner of life. The most unimaginative, unpoetical,
   matter-of-fact men are often just as unreal as the most heated and
   romantic--only in another way; as, for instance, they wear out a whole
   life with a concentration of every thought which is awful and
   saddening, in straining after some object--such as high place, or great
   wealth, or hereditary name, which for them is as remote and unreal as
   the philosopher's stone, or the elixir of life. In truth, whatsoever
   lies on either side of the lines, or beyond the limits, which the will
   of God has drawn about our lot in this world, is for us as if it did
   not exist; and all our thoughts, aims, hankerings, and toil after it,
   are mere unrealities, and must come to nothing. Most certain it is,
   that in every man there will be found a large admixture of this labour
   in vain; and perhaps the largest measure of our earnestness, and
   energy, and of the powers of life, are simply thrown away. Now, the
   first check upon this is, to understand what God wills us to be; and
   then to abandon every thing else, as if it did not so much as exist in
   the world. What we are, is a revelation of His will towards us. Our lot
   is a reality; the works of our calling, so long as they are done as a
   service of obedience, are real. Within these bounds there is nothing
   which does not bear upon eternity.

   And this teaches us that we must do more than only watch against the
   allurements of our own will. Obedience to the will of God is a work of
   direct and simple consciousness. It is to be wrought in us by its own
   self-confirming power. It is by doing the will of God; by recognising
   it in all the changes of life; by reading in the course of this
   troubled world the expression of the Divine mind; by bowing ourselves
   down before it, under whatsoever guise it may reveal itself; by
   yielding ourselves in gladness of mind both to do and suffer it,
   counting it a holy discipline, and a loving correction of our own
   wilfulness, and by praying Him never to stay His hand till the mind of
   self be abolished from our regenerate being;--by these means it is that
   we are changed from the shadows of a fleeting life to the abiding
   realities of the eternal world, being made partakers of the will of
   God.

   But to such a life of submission much self-discipline is needed. We
   cannot pass to it at once, but approach it only by the laws of a
   slow-advancing growth. These are days very adverse to the subjugation
   of the individual will. They are too external and stimulating. Even our
   religious life is drawn into the whirl and fever of an endless
   activity. But, in the service of God, there must be something behind a
   life of action; there must be the stationary energies of a devout
   spirit. Our life is too continually outward, and visible, and pent up
   in the throng of men. We are not enough at large and alone with God.
   And hence it strangely comes to pass, that we deem visible things to be
   real, and invisible things to be imaginary; we look upon the kingdoms
   of the earth, and worldly powers, and the acts of law and legislation,
   and the business of traders and merchants, as realities; but the Church
   and the priesthood, and offices of worship, and daily homage, and
   chants, and the offering of eucharists, and a life of contemplation, as
   economies and shadows. But these alone are the shrine of an abiding
   life. This pompous, wise, stately world must have its day, and then be
   dissolved, "as a dream when one awaketh." We live in the midst of it,
   till it bewilders and stuns us, and we do it homage; and when we turn
   from it to unseen things, they are too subtle and too pure for our
   deadened sense. There is no cure for this, but to be more alone with
   God. Solitude and silence are full of reality. We must draw more into
   our own hearts, and converse more with Him. Never do we so put off the
   paint and masquerade of life, as when we are alone under the Eye which
   seeth in secret. A man must be either very bold, or very blind, that
   will still keep up the play and artifice of his common bearing. I do
   not speak of hypocrites. There is no man that is not in some measure
   twofold; and that simply because there is no man who is willing to be
   known by his fellow-men as he knows himself, and as none knows him
   beside, but God only. We see only a part of each other, but God sees
   all. Our partial view is, if not mingled with untruth, yet misleading,
   because imperfect; we know only half the riddle, and we are led astray
   in guessing at the rest. But "all things are naked and opened unto the
   eyes of Him with whom we have to do." Our very helplessness makes us
   real. His eye holds in check the duplicities of our being; and by the
   habitual restraints of solitude with God they are weakened and
   overcome. In the world, all day long, there is an influence playing
   upon us, which draws our characters to the surface, and there fixes
   them, leaving our hearts hollow and inactive. The works of our calling,
   even the most sacred offices, have a tendency to become an unconscious
   facility, and to sever themselves from the powers of the will. The next
   move is, to withdraw themselves from the region of the conscience. Now,
   nothing but self-discipline in secret can keep up the integrity of our
   whole nature. And the more difficult this is, by reason of a man's
   overburdened life of daily business, the more absolutely needful is it
   for his safety. Fearful thought! we were born alone, and alone we must
   die; and yet through all our life, we, as it were, flee from
   loneliness, which is alike the beginning and the ending of our earthly
   transit! Does not this seem to say, that we are never at ease but when
   we can lose the consciousness of what we are, in the noise and show of
   the world? All that we can do, when we find ourselves grown artificial
   and excited, is to go apart, where none but God sees us, and fall down
   as dust and nothingness before Him, and plead with Him against
   ourselves, and pray Him to abolish in us all that is not real and
   eternal.

   We have the more need of this sacred discipline of self, because we
   have few aids and helps of a secondary sort. They are not many who have
   the blessing of being subject to any proximate superior; to any rule
   out of themselves, by which the detail of their life is ordered. More
   is there by thrown upon the energy of the individual will. The need of
   some imposed discipline, which shall bear upon the actings of our inner
   nature, is wonderfully attested by the yearnings of thoughtful men at
   this time: on every side we hear them painfully striving to free
   themselves from the bondage of unmeaning and artificial habits, and to
   find some basis on which they may rest the full weight of their living
   powers. This has grown upon them, more and more, ever since the current
   of the world turned aside from the path of the Catholic Church. The
   more energetic, dominant, and mighty, the more learned, toilsome, and
   self-trusting it has become, the more hollow is it and untrue. "The
   world passeth away, and the lust thereof." It is confounded at its own
   perpetual changes: it sees that none of its schemes abide; that it
   daily grows more weary of tolling, and more transient in its toils. And
   why, but because it has divorced itself from the Church of the living
   God, and is resolving again into the incoherencies of its fallen state?
   All men are conscious of this: even they that cannot explain the cause.
   They feel, when they are busied in the world, that there is something
   empty, something which mocks and wearies them: they feel that the
   leaning of their worldly toil is away from God; that they are moving in
   another direction; that their returns to Him are by a sensible effort,
   and, as it were, against a stream. They feel, too, that their daily
   life is a hinderance to a life of devotion. It is distracting and
   importunate; it exacts too much ser vice, and repays with a perpetual
   weariness. All the day long they are conscious that they have fallen
   under the dominion of a power which is not at one with God. They crave
   after something through which they may submit themselves to the
   realities of the eternal world. And for this end was the visible Church
   ordained. To meet the yearnings of our baffled hearts, it stands in the
   earth as a symbol of the Everlasting; under the veil of its material
   sacraments are the powers of an endless life; its unity and its order
   are the expressions of heavenly things; its worship, of an eternal
   homage. Blessed are they that dwell within its hallowed precinct,
   shielded from the lures and spells of the world, living in plainness,
   even in poverty; hid from the gaze of men, in solitude and silence
   walking with God.

SERMON XI.

  THE LIFE OF CHRIST THE ONLY TRUE IDEA OF SELF-DEVOTION.

    PHILIPPIANS ii. 21.

   "All seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's."

   THERE is something peculiarly touching in the saddened tone of these
   few words, in which St. Paul glances at the slackness of his
   fellow-labourers. It must have been a cross almost too heavy to bear
   without complaining, when from his prison-house at Rome he saw his
   brethren in Christ drawing off, one by one, from the hardness of their
   Master's service. It must have been a provocation almost beyond
   endurance to see, day by day, tokens of a faint heart and a selfish
   purpose coming out in the words and acts of those on whom he most
   depended. It added to his bondage the worst form of desolation--the
   loneliness of a high, unbroken spirit in the throng of shrinking and
   inconstant men. He had before now seen, in faithless and fearful
   Christians, open apostacy and undisguised abandonment of Christ and His
   Gospel. But keenly as that must have entered into his soul, he had in
   this to endure a still sharper trial. It was this that pierced him to
   the quick: for they of whom he here writes were not open apostates.
   They were not men who fell from the body of the Church, and were
   severed wholly from his fellowship; but men openly professing faith in
   Christ, keeping up with him the same outward relation as partakers in
   the same labour of love, and yet failing him in the moment of danger,
   in the very pinch of severe trial. Such, for instance, was Demas; who
   is often, but by mistake, supposed to have been an apostate from the
   faith: he did not renounce his Christianity, but fell back from the
   hardships of an apostle's life. "Demas hath forsaken"--not Christ nor
   the Gospel--but "me, having loved this present world." [35] He had no
   like zeal or self-devotion with St. Paul: they were unequally yoked
   together. Demas was hurried, beyond his own choice, into dangers and
   toils; he found St. Paul a perilous companion; he loved the Gospel, but
   not less he loved his own life and ease; and he fell back, from an
   apostle's standing, to be an ordinary Christian.

   This is probably a fair example of what St. Paul intended, when he told
   the Philippians, that he must needs detach Timothy, and send him unto
   them; for "I have no man like-minded, who will naturally care for your
   state: for all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
   Christ's." We see, then, what he would express. It was the state of men
   in whom the first fervours of conversion had subsided. In an hour of
   ready zeal, they had forsaken all, and undertaken an apostle's work. It
   may be they were, for a long season, forward and stedfast, foregoing
   much, and enduring more; but at the last they grew weary of the
   monotonous hardship of preaching and suffering. And first, it may be,
   they began to spare themselves, and to use trifling evasions, or to
   keep unseasonable silence, and secretly to long for their discharge
   from a service now grown irksome. And this hidden disloyalty of the
   heart shewed itself in low views of what was possible in Christ's
   service, and in overrating difficulties, in discouraging views, in
   untimely objections, and in expostulations at the very moment of
   action. In some of these ways they betrayed the disappointing truth,
   that self-regard had mastered them, and that love of self out weighed
   their love of Christ. There was a counterattraction overcoming the
   constraining love of their Lord. This, then, is the heart-sin of which
   St. Paul writes: it is a refined selfishness, so plausibly defended, so
   strongly entrenched in reasonable pleadings, as to leave him no more to
   do than to expostulate and to be silent; to give them a fair opening to
   do high service for their Master; and then to pass them by, and choose
   some worthier and bolder men.

   And here we see one of the worst antagonists of the Church of
   Christ,--a fair profession of Christianity with a predominant regard of
   self. The deepest wounds have been given, not so much by the sword of
   persecution, or by the grosser forms of sin, as by the overmastering
   powers of self-regard. Every body will admit that this is true, at the
   first hearing; but few really know the subtle insinuations and the full
   extent of this spiritual disease.

   The peculiar danger of this fault may be seen by the following
   remarks:--

   1. It may consist with all that the Church requires of her people as a
   condition to communion in her fullest privileges. A man may be under
   the dominion of this paralysing fault, and yet really live in many ways
   a Christian life. A man may live a pure life, and blameless; he may be
   benevolent, and do many works of charity; he may be very systematic in
   his religious duties; and have no little zeal in works of a directly
   religious character; and yet, after all, it shall be not more true of
   Demas than of such a man, that he loves this present world, that he
   habitually and deliberately seeks his "own, and not the things that are
   Jesus Christ's." For all the tokens of Christian life that I have
   spoken of, fall within the limit at which a man's self-regard is put on
   trial. There is a large field of commonplace Christian duty, in which a
   man may toil without so much as ever once be coming aware that there is
   an irreconcilable variance between a governing regard to his own
   interests, and a faithful discharge of Christ's service; that there is
   a clashing point, where one or other must give way. A very large part
   of Christianity is directly favourable to a man's worldly
   interests:--all that goes to the establishing of a fair reputation, and
   to the conciliation of good will, is full of solid advantage;
   self-regard and self-respect urgently prescribe to a man such a habit
   of life as shall be in accordance with the outward example of Christ's
   true servants.

   Nay, even more, a man's own happiness is advanced by a Christian temper
   of mind; and thus far the service of Christ is oftentimes one of the
   chiefest and most refined means of cherishing himself.

   Habits of devotional thought, and the hopes of an inheritance in light,
   kindle and sustain his interior life and peace; and in this way he
   makes the service of Christ minister directly to the self-regard which
   governs all his actions. Like education, or intellectual excitement,
   and other refined energies of the reason and moral habit, it becomes
   distinctly subservient to his predominant aim.

   2. But, on the other hand, this habit of mind, while it satisfies the
   external demands of the Church, and ministers to the inward happiness
   of the mind, absolutely extinguishes all that ever produced any great
   work in Christ's service. It stunts the whole spirit at the standard of
   self; and makes all a man's thoughts and powers minister and submit
   themselves to his own aim and purpose. It makes a man live in himself
   and for himself, and bound himself about by his own horizon. He will be
   devoted and earnest just so far as he may with out trenching upon the
   comfort of his own life. He will pray, and fast, and give alms, and
   witness for the truth, just so far, and just so long, as shall involve
   him in no austerity, or weariness, or self-denial, or loss of
   popularity. All that goes beyond this measure will be to him excessive,
   unnecessary, gratuitous; the boundaries of his own practice are fixed,
   he believes, at the ultimate point, and so become absolute; the aims
   which rise above or lie beyond his practice are visionary and
   impossible. Most desirable, he will admit--and would to God we lived in
   days when they could be accomplished--but he deliberately thinks that
   times are changed; and what our fathers might reasonably do, we may as
   reasonably forbear. They did great works, bore great self-denials, made
   great sacrifices; but then it was the custom of their day--society did
   not require of them many things which it exacts of us. And who would
   set himself against society? Who would affect strangeness and
   singularity? Who would live below his means in life, or not keep pace
   with others of his own rank and standing?--No, brethren, not to
   evangelize mankind, would such a man offend the fastidious feelings of
   society, or break the self-constituted proprieties of a perishing
   world; no, not for an Apostle's crown, nor for the love of Christ his
   Lord, would such a man say to himself, No change of times, customs, or
   conventional rule, can absolve me from the unchangeable law of
   self-devotion. No such man would say this, and act upon it. He stands
   well with the world; he is not censured by the Church;--what more is
   necessary? Surely for him it must be gratuitous and ostentatious to
   take a rule and standard of his own above other men. Besides, it would
   offend them; it would be a rebuke to them; it would alienate them from
   him, and neutralise his influence for good: a man forfeits the effect
   of good example by going too far.--So men tamper with the edge of
   conscience, and turn its keenness. Even they that have higher
   yearnings, and pulses that beat for nobler deeds, sink back
   acquiescingly under the burdensome traditions of our easy life. Little
   by little their sympathies with high aspiring minds are blunted; every
   thing that goes beyond their own habit is over-much; every thing that
   would by consequence break in upon some part of their blameless easy
   course is impossible. Oh, none are so hard to rouse to great works of
   faith as they. If we should plead with a Magdalene out of whom have
   been cast seven devils, or a Peter that hath thrice denied his Lord, or
   a Paul who hath made havoc of the Church,--there is material for a
   substantive and vivid character, there is energy for a life above the
   world. Conformed to the likeness of their Lord, the examples of all
   living men are no more to them than the gaudy shifting clouds of an
   evening sky; moving along the path of the cross, all the soft and
   silken customs of life are as threads of idle gossamer. There is about
   them a moral weight, and an onward force, and a clear definite outline
   of character, before which every thing gives way. They hurry all before
   them, as by the spell of absolute dominion. They have about them a
   dignity borrowed from the grandeur of the end for which they live.
   Poverty and plainness, solitude and a self-denying life, in them no man
   dares despise; nay, all men feel that these harder features are more in
   keeping with the loftiness of their moral choice, than the nice
   proprieties or the effeminate exactness of the world.

   And yet, is it not most true that such characters as these we deem
   rather to be gazed after than followed; as objects rather to admire
   than to imitate? Do we not deal with each other, ay, and with our own
   consciences, as if the devotion of the Apostles were as miraculous as
   the casting out of devils? Do we not look along the lines of holy men,
   who, through the darkest ages of the Church, shine with unearthly
   splendour, and speak of them as we do of strange fires which move on no
   discoverable laws; wild and eccentric lights, of most commanding
   grandeur, but perilous to follow? And what do we thereby confess, but
   that the Divine laws, which ordered that spiritual world, are but
   feebly felt and faintly understood by us; that the powers of some lower
   system have absorbed us in their circuits; and that we are hurried
   along by some inferior forces, which bear us visibly away from their
   luminous paths and destinies, we know not whither, nor why?

   And yet the reason is not mysterious. We need call up no seer to
   unravel the secret. It is simply this, "all seek their own, and not the
   things that are Jesus Christ's."

   1. First of all; few of us have any clear view of Christ's service
   projected before our minds, to which all our living powers are bent.
   There is a want of external reality in all our views of religion. They
   are self-contemplative and limited. We do not look out of ourselves to
   Him. The secret of that stupendous self-devotion which the saints of
   Christ in all ages have manifested in the world is simply this: they
   set up the life of Christ their Lord before them. They believed it to
   be the only spiritual reality the world ever saw, and that all other
   patterns of life were cheats and shadows; from it they drew all maxims
   and rules of living; by it they tried all customs of mankind; what
   combined with it, they held fast; what clashed with it, they trampled
   under foot; they gazed upon it, and grew towards it; they fell down
   before it, and worshipped it; and when they arose, and turned from it
   upon the world, they knew not that they reflected its borrowed glory.
   They knew not why men followed them, and yet shrunk from them; why they
   resisted them, and yet gave way before them; and they were troubled,
   and went and hid themselves, and did their works in secret, and bade no
   man speak of them; and yet their words and deeds came abroad, and
   kindled others to a like devotion.

   This, then, is the main reason why in these days we see so few great
   examples of bold and masculine devotion. Men have lost sight of the
   living type of self-sacrifice, and with that type they have lost their
   energy of will. Lower views insure lesser powers.

   2. And the natural consequence of this must be, that all the customs of
   life, the habits of the world, the particular traditions of family and
   individual character, and all the current maxims and unwritten laws of
   society, maintain so tyrannous a hold even over good minds (for of such
   only, not of the coarsely selfish, or the grossly self-indulgent, am I
   speaking), that high and generous tempers are chilled into inaction,
   and so miserably depressed, as to move along the dreary level of an
   over-circumspect and self-regarding life. They are predestined by the
   usurping fatality of the world to grow rich, or to make a family, or to
   perpetuate a fortune, or to spend an income ostentatiously, or to
   maintain the laborious courtesies of life; they are in a bond age from
   which there is no escape. Oh, what high spirits are dwarfed, what
   heavenly aspirations beaten back to earth, what deep yearnings of love
   are crushed and stifled, for want of the free air of heaven, and the
   bold action of a devoted life! They are forced to seek their own, until
   a refined selfishness returns upon their regenerate nature with all the
   tainting, stupifying power of its original sin. And they grow
   over-prudent and wary, shrinking within the narrowest lines, always on
   the safer side, hazarding nothing, measuring by the scale of their own
   feebleness what is possible to be done for Christ in His own kingdom.
   And thus the glow of early religion is chilled down into the torpor of
   after-life: and hence come isolating forms of opinion and practice,
   "even in religion; and over-development of peculiarities in the
   individual character, and the obscuration of that common type of
   Christian life which knits men insensibly in one. Hence, too, arise
   schisms of sympathy within the Church; and disappointing slackness,
   even in good men; jealousy of private rights in things most sacred; the
   reappearance of unequal ranks, in the very sanctuary of God; irregular
   and conflicting schemes of well-doing, even when we do our best;
   decline of missionary zeal, of eucharistical charity; and, as a
   consequence of all this, the contraction and palsy of the Church
   itself. Oh, that we did but know the freedom and the happiness of a
   life above the world! They whose names are splendid with the most
   hallowed light have in their day moved along all paths of life. Among
   the saints of Christendom are men of toil and trade, the craftsman, and
   the merchant, the pleader, the man of letters, orators, lawgivers,
   warriors and leaders of mighty hosts, princes, and queens, and
   emperors. In all ranks, and all orbits of the civil state, men
   mortified in soul, as the holy Paul, have lived unto Christ their Lord.
   None so fulfilled the offices and tasks of life as they--because they
   were above them all. They descended to them, and discharged them with
   an ease and grace which nothing but an absolute extinction of self can
   give. None so wise, so courteous, so beloved as they; none richer nor
   more prosperous; none more faithful in their stewardship of this
   world's wealth; none bequeathed costlier heir-looms to their children's
   children: and that because they sought not their own, but the things
   that were Jesus Christ's. Brethren, here is the key of this great
   spiritual parable: ask of God the mind of Jesus Christ; for "He pleased
   not Himself." Learn to do, to give up, to give away, as He did. Live as
   men whose "life is hid with Christ in God." "Let your conversation be
   in heaven." Try every thing, measure every thing, check every thing, by
   the governing law of Christ's example. Seek first what is His; and He
   will take care for what is your own.

SERMON XII.

  THE REWARDS OF THE NEW CREATION.

    ST. MATTHEW xix. 27, 28, 29.

   "Then answered Peter and said unto Him, Behold, we have forsaken all,
   and followed Thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus said unto
   them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the
   regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory,
   ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
   Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
   sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my
   name's sake, shall receive an hundred-fold, and shall inherit
   everlasting life."

   IN these words we have a most gracious promise of the full and sure
   reward with which our Lord Jesus Christ will overpay all His true
   servants in the kingdom of the resurrection. They were drawn from Him
   by the shrinking back of the rich young man who had sought to enter
   into the kingdom of God. He had so lived from his youth up as to be not
   far from it; but in the last deciding trial he was found wanting. One
   thing he lacked, and that one thing was in what we should call his
   characteristic failing: he was rich, and he could not forsake all for
   Christ. He wanted nerve and faith enough to strike through the last
   bond which bound down his soul to earth; and this one thing wanting
   lost him all things. St. Peter then, who was standing by, and had heard
   and seen what had passed, took occasion to say, "Lo, we have left all
   and followed Thee; what shall we have therefore?" And our Lord promised
   a repayment, an over payment, an hundred-fold; and, as we read in St.
   Mark, He said, "now in this time;" [36] and in St. Luke, "in this
   present time, and in the world to come everlasting life." [37]

   First, then, our Lord meant that He would repay them for all things
   they gave up for His sake, in this world, after His resurrection. They
   who followed Him had been gathered out from Galilee and Judea, from
   Bethsaida and Jerusalem, one by one; and each several one had to make
   the same deliberate act of self-renunciation. They had to forsake all
   that earth holds dearest; not traffic, and gain, and ease alone, but
   the love of friends, and all that we gather together in our thoughts of
   home. All that was once fullest of life became to them as dead; all in
   the life of which they were wont to live was thenceforth as if it had
   never been: their choice of Christ for their Lord, and His kingdom for
   their portion, was a sharp and severing vow, which left them solitary
   in the throng of men who were friends before.

   Such they made themselves for His sake before He suffered, and
   therefore He pledged His truth to them, that they should find again
   what they had lost for His service, after He was risen from the dead.
   And He made them the patriarchs of the "Israel of God;" they were made
   pastors and princes, fathers and bishops, ruling, from their apostolic
   thrones, the twelve mystical tribes of God's elect. The whole Church
   was their ghostly family: they had sons, and brethren, and sisters, in
   all lands. All the whole earth was their home. All things were theirs,
   for "they had all things common." So was His word fulfilled in the
   communion of saints. Even in this present time it was fulfilled, albeit
   with persecution: even when the powers of hell hung heaviest upon them,
   and shut them in on every side, what man can tell the hidden joy, the
   unutterable gladness, of His holy Church? When most likened in
   suffering to the passion of their Lord, there was, ever deep and full,
   a river of holy calm, making glad the city of God. And so unto this
   day, His most sure promise has had a like fulfilment. Never any man
   forsook any thing for his Master's sake, but even in this life he hath
   found it in some unlooked-for compensation; not, it may be, alike in
   kind, but full of as deep a joy. The manifold wisdom of His eternal
   love attempers to His servants all their earthly being. Though their
   lot be most various, and most adverse to their self-choosing hopes,
   though it be ever changing, yet in every change it brings out some
   unknown and larger outline of ever-new reward for all they have
   forsaken in His service.

   But there is yet a further and deeper fulfilment of this promise still
   to come.

   Our Lord intended also, that He would reward them in His kingdom, after
   their own resurrection; that is, when the number of the regenerate is
   accomplished, and the end is come, and the new heaven and new earth are
   revealed. "In the regeneration" or restitution of all things, when He
   "shall sit on the throne of His glory," then shall their reward be
   likewise made perfect. At that day, when the heavenly Jerusalem shall
   appear, and the fellowship of saints be gathered from the four winds of
   heaven, in that unnumbered company shall all the bonds and affections
   of all holy spirits be made eternal, and they shall receive an
   hundred-fold; brethren and sisters, and father and mother, and wife and
   children. What is here given in part, shall be there given in its
   fulness; and then shall be perfected the sympathy of all members of
   Christ's body mystical, perpetuating all that earth has known of
   purity, and transfiguring all that is eternal with surpassing glory.

   We see, then, in this promise, these great laws of Christ's kingdom.
   First, that there shall be a manifold reward for those who shall in any
   way forego any thing for Christ's sake, for all they do or suffer for
   His name--a reward, observe, not earned, but given; not wages, but a
   free gift. Once for all, let this be said: there is no connexion of
   idea between our meriting and His rewarding. The one is as much denied
   as the other is promised in holy Scripture. And, secondly, that there
   shall be a larger and distinguishing reward for those that have
   forsaken most for His service. There is promised in holy Writ, "the
   brightness of the firmament," and the shining "as the stars for ever
   and ever;" there is "the righteous man's reward," and "the prophet's
   reward;" there is a "right hand" and a "left hand" in His kingdom.
   Again: as are the orders of unseen spirits, so are the orders of
   saints. All are not angels, nor archangels, nor spirits of knowledge,
   nor spirits of love; nor have all the same degree, nor the same
   heavenly ministry, nor the same near approach to the Eternal throne;
   and so, doubtless, in the company of saints: as on earth, so in heaven
   there shall be patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, saints of all
   measures of glory, though all shall be absolutely blessed, and the
   principle of order shall be doubtless this: As it is the strength and
   energy of love to Christ that makes one man to differ from another here
   in this life, so without doubt the same shall there fix the rule and
   order of His kingdom. As some men are now holier, so shall some be then
   more glorious; as some are now more like their Lord, so shall some be
   then nearer to Him: all shall walk in white, but some shall be of a
   more dazzling splendour; all shall be crowned with gold, but some shall
   cast brighter rays.

   Such is the meaning of this promise. See, then, brethren, whether you
   have a share in it. What shall they have who forego nothing, or but
   little for His sake? Must we then, in any sense, measure our share by
   our self-denials? This would be a fearful issue to which to bring our
   confident hopes. And yet most true it is, for He Himself has spoken it:
   "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife,
   and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he
   cannot be my disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come
   after me, cannot be my disciple." [38]

   Let us see, then:

   1. First, what we are now giving up for His sake; what we are laying up
   in the kingdom of the resurrection. Where does your daily life exhibit
   any token of His cross? How should we be different, if He had never
   risen from the dead? Take away all that is exacted of us by fear of
   reproof, or interest, or love of reputation, or self-respect, or the
   customs of life, and the established order of our home, and the rules
   and maxims by which society is refined; and then what one thing would
   be found remaining? How different is the self-same act in two different
   men, when one man acts for some of these lower motives, and the other
   for the hope of the resurrection! Be not content, therefore, until you
   have searched out and found that the aim of your heart is single: this
   is what we have to ascertain. What are we casting on the water, that we
   may find it on the river of life? What power or effect has the kingdom
   of the resurrection on the works of every day; on that thronging
   multitude of thoughts and feelings and moral acts, which shape
   themselves, as the will inclines, into toil, and business, and study,
   and pleasure, and ease, and prayer? How are these affected by the
   promise of our Master? What token do they bear which bespeaks a
   yearning hope of His exceeding great reward? Do not our hearts witness
   against themselves, that all these daily actings of life are chiefly
   done for our own gain or pleasure? It is very hard to unravel
   motives--to separate the interweaving of higher and lower purposes, and
   to ascertain in what mea sure they each severally determine our will
   and practice. It is an ominous thing when a man's interest is found
   always to fall in with his religion; when the bias of his common life
   is exactly coincident with his better aims; when the many things he
   seems to do, or to leave undone, for Christ's sake, would be done or
   left undone also for other reasons; when the doing them or leaving them
   undone always turns to his advantage. I do not say, that he must
   therefore be necessarily acting on the inferior motive; far from it.
   Such is the manifold perfection of Christ's service, that it will be
   found to take up into itself all good reasons of moral action, and
   often to be, even in a worldly sense, the best, safest, and most
   expedient way of life. But we have need to examine ourselves, and see
   whether the lower aims of our mind be not the more fixed and stedier,
   and therefore the real and dominant, though secret, reason of our
   habitual line of acting.

   And next, consider in what you may forsake something for His service. I
   do not speak of sins which if a man do not forsake, he shall surely
   perish; for if he break them off, they are not for gone for his Lord's
   sake, but for his own. An horrible dread of eternal death, and the
   gnawing of a selfish fear, make men first break off their sins. But
   that is not self-denial; nor are sins the matter in which to shew the
   entireness of our devotion.

   Nor, again, is it in foregoing the needless superfluities of a
   luxurious life. They that give up only what they care not to retain,
   make but poor oblations. Rich and easy people seldom reach the point of
   real self-denial. It is in things lawful, and, as the world deems,
   necessary, but, in the severe judgment of a devoted mind, tending to
   relax the tone of our obedience, that we may prove the singleness of
   our purpose. For instance, in things harmless in themselves, but
   inexpedient for our own sake or for others; in narrowing the freedom we
   might ourselves enjoy, lest any other for whom Christ died should be
   misled by our example; in leaving unsaid and undone many things which
   may tend to irritation or questioning in uninstructed or prejudiced
   minds. Moreover, it is not only for the safety of others, but of
   ourselves, that we must needs limit our use even of lawful things. He
   is in great peril of judgment who never foregoes any thing that he
   might lawfully enjoy. He that lives on a dubious boundary-line,
   trusting his own stedfastness, is ever ready to slip over into a
   transgression. More men perish by exceeding in the measure of lawful
   things than in deliberate commission of things forbidden. It is a
   perilous footing on the giddy edge of a precipice. Again; a man may
   deny himself in things held by the world to be eligible and good, such
   as by custom are almost forced upon us, and in themselves are full of
   promise, and, it may be, of enjoyment, and yet are cumbrous, and hinder
   the devoting of ourselves to Christ. There was nothing of evil in
   Martha's life; but Mary's was the higher and more hallowed. Martha was
   careful about many things, yet all these things were innocent; Mary
   about only one, and that alone was needful. There is nothing evil in
   the possession of lands and riches, yet they bring much toil of heart,
   and over-burdening of care. They defraud a man of much of himself, and
   make him pay tribute of more than half of all his hopes, and fears, and
   thoughts, and hours of day and night--half, that is, of his whole
   earthly being; and, it may be, poverty in the world to come, as the
   cost or tax at which he buys the trouble of being rich. The very
   thought of being contented at any point short of the utmost gain, is
   lost from among men. They have no horizon to their aims for this world;
   and therefore "they have their reward." It is a poor, palpable,
   proximate reward here on earth. The aim of most men falls short and
   terminates in something on this side of the resurrection; some phantasy
   of earthly happiness. It may be, then, that each one of us may find
   something which he may forego for the sake of the world to come; some
   possession, or purpose of life, or wish of heart; some of the permitted
   self-indulgences common to his rank and fortune: and this foregone.,
   for the sake of living a life of larger charity, or of more abstracted
   devotion, that is, for the sake of making charity or devotion the great
   and governing aim of the whole life, and all other things as means and
   opportunities to it, shall not be forgotten where all self-denials are
   remembered: and so shall you have your lot with him who said, "Behold,
   we have left all things; what shall we have therefore?"

   Remember, then, brethren, that in all these acts of self-restriction
   there must be the sincere in tent to do it for Christ's sake; otherwise
   our acts are like inarticulate sounds, without emphasis or meaning.
   Many men seem to live a mortified life, and, as far as mere
   self-restraint, really do so, and yet not for Christ's sake, but for
   some earthly end. Doubtless the rich young man denied himself for his
   great, possessions. None forsake and forfeit more than "they that will
   be rich." But we know that the severest life without a conscious
   choice, is less than the least acts of self-impoverishment with a clear
   and single aim of foregoing something, that we may find it in His
   kingdom. Peter's worldly all was a boat and a net; and the alabaster
   box of ointment had a great testimony of acceptance, be cause she had
   "done what she could." They are oftentimes the little ministries of
   love that shew most devotion, and most intimate resolution of heart.
   And remember also, that, having chosen deliberately, a man must act
   boldly, not looking back. Half our difficulty in doing any thing worthy
   of our high calling, is the shrinking anticipation of its possible
   after-consequences. But if Peter had tarried, and cast up all that was
   to come, the poverty, and wandering, and solitude, and lonely old age,
   the outcast life, and chance of a fearful death, it may be he would
   have been neither an Apostle nor a Christian.

   And, once more; whereinsoever you resolve to forsake any thing for
   Christ's service, bear the trial patiently, and wait for the end. There
   must be some irksomeness, nay, some galling edge, some burden in our
   yoke, or we have need to look well lest we be carrying a mere mocking
   shadow of His cross. Be not afraid though your life be deemed singular
   and solitary; His was so; and theirs who at any time have followed Him,
   each in his way and kind, has been so likewise. When He promises you an
   hundred-fold, be not content with thirty-fold, nor with sixty-fold. You
   would be happy to have any reward in His blissful kingdom; but be not
   therefore slack in striving for it. True, He does not offer you the
   crowns of apostles; but He offers you more than you can ask or think,
   more than we are ever reaching after. Every day we might attain we know
   not what; every day, it may- be, loses or wins something of the
   brightness of the resurrection. All we do or leave undone has its
   counterpart in the unseen world. And what then is life, and what is the
   world, to that day, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His
   glory?

   Forsake all, rather than forfeit your reward, rather than be set far
   off from Him when He cometh in to order the guests that are bidden to
   the marriage-supper of the Lamb.

SERMON XIII

  GOD'S KINGDOM INVISIBLE.

    ST. LUKE xvii. 20, 21.

   "And when He was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God
   should come, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not
   with observation: neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for,
   behold, the kingdom of God is within you."

   THE state of the Jews at that time affords to the Church of Christ an
   awful example of inward blindness in the full light of God's
   revelation. They were looking out for the coming of Christ's kingdom;
   but they knew not for what they were watching. God had told them that
   Messiah should come; but they had formed for themselves a low and
   earthly idea of His character and His kingdom. They verily thought that
   He would make His entry among them with the sound of the trumpet and
   the banners of the tribe of Judah; with the pomp of kingly splendour,
   and a royal train of chariots and horses, as their kings of old came
   "riding through the gates of Jerusalem." Doubtless they thought that
   all men would know by the tokens and the heralds, and by the very
   majesty of its coming, when the kingdom of God should appear. So they
   dreamed and wandered in the blindness of their hearts. An obstinate
   prepossession had filled them with the thoughts and images of earth,
   and all the prophets of God could not purge this film from their inward
   sight. They looked out every way for the signs of His coming; but the
   signs they looked for came not; or came and spake other things, and
   mocked their expectation, and darkened their foolish hearts the more,
   and lulled them into security, at the time when of a truth the kingdom
   of God was come upon them. Before so much as a stray thought of
   foreboding arose in their hearts, whilst their eyes were all turned
   another way, it came upon them like a thief; suddenly and in silence it
   came, no man seeing it; without visible token; without the warning of a
   prophet; without the sound of a footfall: it was among them, and they
   knew it not; it was within them, and they knew not that it was of God.
   The kingdom came in the coming of the King Himself, as the day comes in
   the sun's rising. While men slept, Christ was born: a poor child and
   unheeded of men, none knew of His coming but His lowly mother and
   Joseph, and a few shepherds: to the rest He was as any other child; as
   one of the many who are born in sorrow, and die in silence. The ten
   thousands of Israel, the scribes and the Pharisees, the elders and the
   chief priests, even the very courses that ministered day and night in
   God's temple, were taken in the snare. God's kingdom was above, and
   around, and within them; it embraced, and pervaded, and searched them
   through and through; and they knew it not.

   And as was its coming, so was its course. He grew up at Nazareth, a
   child among children, obedient to His parents: though His mother
   pondered many things of Him in her heart, other men saw in Him no more
   than the aspect and the actings of a child. Many an eye beheld Him then
   which shall behold Him no more. Many gazed on Him, as we gaze on a
   thoughtful child, and saw no gleaming rays of the mystery which lay hid
   within. So, too, He began His Father's work, going about on foot,
   unknown and outcast, with a few who followed Him. He wrought miracles;
   but the prophets had wrought them too, and yet the kingdom of God came
   not with them. So He died; not as a king, but as a malefactor, and as a
   common malefactor--one of the many who, from time to time, were seen
   hanging on the cross. So He rose again at daybreak, when few were by.
   By their own falsehood they broke, so far as they were concerned, the
   force of this mighty sign, saying, "His disciples came by night, and
   stole Him away while we slept." He passed, for forty days, to and fro
   in Jerusalem and in Galilee, on the mountain and by the sea; seen of
   His own, but not of all the people. And at the last, when He had led
   them out unto Bethany, away from the haunts of men, "He was taken up
   from them into heaven, and a cloud received Him out of their sight."
   Such was the coming of that kingdom, for which not Israel alone was
   waiting, but the whole creation travailed together with tumultuous
   groaning; and by this manner of its coming God put them on their trial,
   whether they had eyes to see the shadow of His hand, and ears to hear
   His voice.

   So, in like manner, the kingdom of God came upon the world at large.
   While all mankind was full of its own gross imaginations, bowing down
   to the power of evil, and shaping from the creatures of God's hand
   blind mockeries of Himself; while men sealed their own moral
   debasement, by making the natures they adored a transcript of their
   own; there was a preparation going on, there was that unheeded
   fellowship, in an upper chamber, brooding over great and unimaginable
   things. They were men of whom the world knew nothing, but they had seen
   mysteries; they were not read in learned schools, but they had mused on
   the sea of Galilee; they had seen the feet of God upon its heaving
   flood, and heard His word rebuke the rudeness of the storm. To them the
   unseen world stood out in visible reality; heaven had revealed its
   wisdom; hell had given up its secret; death had betrayed his own
   overthrow; and the grave spread open as a homeward path, kindling in
   the light of life. All this they knew; for they had seen God, and He
   had shewed them these things. He had filled them with the might of
   heaven, against which no power of earth could strive. They had in them
   the omnipotence of truth--of God made flesh, crucified for the life of
   the world.

   And thus they went forth, twelve unnoticeable men; but they had in them
   a secret which was mighty to move the world. They went, scattered
   abroad into all lands, two by two, speaking grave words, of things past
   and things to come, pouring a little water on willing listeners, and
   giving to them bread and wine, with prayer and benediction. Such was
   God's kingdom. Wheresoever they went, it went likewise--strange and
   silent. Every where they had the mastery; and yet there was no "cry, as
   of them that strive." Every where they were more than conquerors; yet
   the kings and kingdoms of the earth did not fall before them. All these
   stood visibly as before, but the unclean spirit was cast out of them.
   They were clothed with a mightier dignity, quickened with new life from
   an unseen spring, and governed by an energy which is of God. While
   kings warred, and sophists wrangled, and the goings-on of life tided
   onward as before, the kingdom of God came and stood in the midst, even
   as He came that night, when the doors were shut, silent and sudden,
   breathing peace. Its coming was not noised in the market-place; it was
   not announced in the palace of the Caesars. As at the first, so always,
   it came without observation; a kingdom invisible, internal, dwelling in
   men's hearts, knitting them in holy brotherhood, blending them in one
   with the power and stillness of light. Even so hath been, and still is,
   the kingdom of God among us--from that day, and in all the world--in
   this land, and at this hour. There are about us the visible structures
   which enshrine its presence, the outward tokens of God's service, and
   the loud schemings of men who, under the name of the Church, would
   serve themselves of the Church as a contrivance for civilising mankind;
   but they are not God's kingdom. There is, under the badge of religion,
   a strife and struggle for mastery among men that bear the sacred name
   which the saints first bore at Antioch; but God's kingdom is not in
   their heady tumult: there are the visible hurryings to and fro of a
   worldly Jehu-like zeal for the Lord; and there are the plottings of
   earthly Christians--for men may plot for Christ's Church, as well as
   against it. The same earthly and faithless temper of mind which
   sometimes resists God's will may also insinuate itself into His
   service. Men may think, and do think, to spread His kingdom by the stir
   and noise of popular excitement; but God's kingdom, like God Himself,
   when He communed with His prophet on the mountain-height, is not in the
   boisterous and fleeting forms of earthly power. As its coming and its
   course, so is its character. It is not in any of these: but verily it
   is in the midst of us; in the still small voice of the holy Catholic
   faith; in the voiceless teaching of Christ's holy sacraments, through
   which mysteries of the world unseen look in upon us; in the faithful
   witness of the Apostles of Christ, who, through their ghostly lineage,
   live among us still. The same men, who from the upper-chamber went
   forth to win the world, are here: their gaze is upon us, and their
   voices speak to us. Prophets, Apostles, martyrs, and the King of
   martyrs, are with us to this day. Since the veil of the temple was rent
   in twain, heaven and earth are laid in one: all that heaven holds in
   glory is with us; all that earth ever held of God is on our side; all
   saints perfected, all holy teachers, all servants of our God; all the
   spirit and the sympathy of the whole mystical body of our Lord; all the
   Church invisible, the unseen presence of the Word made flesh, the
   fellowship of the Holy Ghost, the power of the ever-blessed
   Trinity,--all are in the midst of us, and about us, and all these are
   God's kingdom, of which we are heirs and servants.

   Such is its true character, ghostly and inward. It has its seat in the
   hearts of men, in their moral habits, in their thoughts, actings, and
   affections, in the form and the bias of their moral being; the visible
   forms we see are but the shadow of the reality; God's kingdom is the
   obedience of the unseen spirit of man to the unseen Lord of all. We
   see, then, what it is, and we see how we may fall into a fault like
   that of the Jews, by transmuting the true idea of its spiritual
   character into the base alloy of earthly notions.

   If, therefore, we look for Christ's kingdom among the popular theories
   of political and religious speculators, we shall look for the living
   among the dead. We have great need to guard against this danger; for
   the popular opinion of this day, whether in politics or religion, leads
   to an earthly conception of the Church, as of a thing subject to the
   senses and understanding of man. There is a sort of under-current
   perpetually drawing men away towards these errors. They either think
   that God's kingdom is, if not in itself secular, yet to be promoted
   chiefly by secular measures. This is a common form of religious
   Erastianism, of which we see many examples. Even good people have it:
   and worse people use it as a bait to draw better men into ensnaring
   toils, promising political advantage, increased efficiency, immediate
   results, apparent popularity, general co-operation--silver sounds, the
   bartering price, to bribe them from their stedfast hold of the broad
   rule of God's mysterious kingdom.

   A second danger to which men are now tending is, to think that God's
   kingdom is to be spread by visible excitement of people's minds. The
   whole scheme of modern religion is visible motion; all its machinery is
   on the surface, all its momentum is from without. The springs of all
   power, if secret, are mistrusted; they must be laid bare for the
   childish curiosity of minds that cannot believe any thing to be going
   on unless they see its working, and understand how its results are
   brought about. This runs through almost all the movements by which men
   fancy the Gospel is to be propagated at home or abroad, and through all
   the means taken to impress it on individual minds. We are fallen upon a
   mechanical age, and men are blindly putting mechanical and material
   inventions in the place of moral power. This runs through both our
   popular religion and our popular education; e.g. the attempt to do by
   stimulating books what can only be done by the moral action of the
   Church of Christ, and the endeavour to effect upon masses of moral
   beings by outward systems the work which can alone be done by the
   inward power of regeneration and the presence of the Holy Ghost. Much
   that is called efficient management of schools, and the like, may be
   little better than this. There has been, from the beginning of the
   Gospel, an inwardness, and an invisibleness, about all great movements
   of Christ's Church, which ought to abash the hasty, talkative zeal of
   men into a reverent silence.

   Knowing, then, the character of God's kingdom, we shall know both how
   to keep ourselves from these delusive schemes, and how to spread it on
   the earth.

   We shall know, first, that the way to spread it is, to have it ruling
   in ourselves, to have our own spirits brought into harmony with its
   secret workings. It is by the still strength of a holy character that
   we must leave the stamp of God upon the world. As they in the beginning
   went out from Judea into all the earth, trusting in God, counting
   themselves nothing, and their mission every thing; measuring
   themselves, and all the actions and energies of body and mind, by the
   faith which Christ had charged them to deliver, and counting only those
   labours to be God's service which fell within the limits of the truth,
   and all toil but unprofitable waste of life--nay, even as a very
   scattering of the Lord's harvest--which swerved from this rule of His
   ordaining; so we, believing and living in the faith of our baptism, and
   bending all our thoughts to be what He would have us, shall best spread
   His kingdom in an evil and revolting world, when we carry most of its
   heavenly character impressed upon ourselves.

   And by knowing the character of His kingdom, we shall know, too, how to
   make that character our own; that is, chiefly, by a life of inward
   holiness. We know that it is an unseen kingdom; that, although Christ's
   Church is visible, as God was visible in Christ, yet it is also an
   unseen, because an inward, power, even as life is unseen which is in
   man. The visible Church is the symbol of Christ's presence, as the
   water of baptism is the symbol of a new birth, and the holy bread and
   wine the symbol of Christ's body and blood. We partake of baptism, that
   we may partake of the Church; our new birth is an engrafting into
   salvation, through the blood-shedding of Christ. As we may partake of
   the water of baptism, or the bread and wine of the holy eucharist, and
   yet have no part in the saving grace they bear to man, so may we
   partake of the holy Catholic Church, which to the eyes of faith is
   visible in all lands under heaven, and yet have no fellowship with the
   saints of Christ, seen or unseen--with that mystical body of Christ,
   which is the company of all faithful people-with the Church of the
   first-born, whose names are written in heaven. We must seek to have the
   inward life of the Church in ourselves: it is not by loud profession of
   the faith, nor by headlong zeal for truth, nor by eager controversies
   against error, nor by excited devotions; but by a silent and even life
   of faith and purity, by a patient following of Christ's holy footsteps,
   by a mastery of temper, by mortifying self, by a steady gaze on His
   mysterious passion, by being, and praying Him to make us, like Himself,
   that we shall bear within us the kingdom and the presence of God.

   And to sustain this character within us at all times, we must remember
   that God's kingdom is at all times present with us.

   It is upon us, and we cannot flee from it: whether we will or no, it
   encompasses us about; whether we remember it or no, it is ever proving
   us. We may be forgetful of its nearness, but it will not depart from
   us. We may fall into a like fault with the Jews of old, and look out
   for Christ's coming when He is already with us;--even as some look
   about for their regeneration, being regenerate already, because they
   have not faith enough to believe the mystery of holy baptism. So,
   again, men are ever beguiling themselves with the dream that they shall
   one day be what they are not now: they balance their present
   consciousness of a low worldly life, and of a mind heavy and dull to
   spiritual things, with the lazy thought that some day God will bring
   home to them in power the realities of faith in Christ. So men dream
   away their lives in pleasures, sloth, trade, or study. Who is there
   that has not at some time secretly indulged this soothing flattery,
   that the staid gravity of age, when youth is quelled, or the leisure of
   retirement, when the fret of busy life is over, or, it may be, the in
   evitable pains and griefs which are man's inheritance, shall one day
   break up in his heart the now-sealed fountains of repentance, and make,
   at last, his religion a reality? Who has not allayed the uneasy
   consciousness of a meagre religion with the hope of a future change?
   Who has not thus been mocked by the enemy of man? Who has not listened,
   all too readily, to him who would cheat us of the hour that is, and of
   all the spiritual earnings which faith makes day by day in God's
   service, stealing from us the present hour, and leaving us a lie in
   exchange? And yet, this present hour is all we have. To-morrow must be
   to-day before we can use it: and day after day we squander in the hope
   of a to-morrow; but to-morrow shall be stolen away too, as to-day and
   yesterday. It is now we must be penitent, now we must be holy; this
   hour has its duty, which cannot be done the next. There is no new
   coming of God with observation, to make the Gospel mightier over our
   stubborn hearts, or to bid His sacraments renew the unwilling and
   indolent soul. The grace of the holy eucharist that was given this
   morning, if lost, is lost for ever. To-morrow may bring its own
   opportunities, but will not restore to-day's. The convictions of this
   hour, if unheeded, will never come back. God may send others, but these
   will be gone for ever. Even now, while I am speaking, the kingdom of
   God is within your inmost being: it is in every righteous man that
   serves God in purity of heart; in every penitent man who sorrows for
   the wreck to which by sin he has brought himself; in every repenting
   man who, though still wavering in the poise, yet inclines towards God;
   in every worldly man who feels within the visitings and promptings of a
   will and a power above his daily life; in every man who still trembles
   in himself at the thought of God: so nigh. God's kingdom was very nigh
   to him who trembled at the judgment to come. Felix trembled once; we
   nowhere read that he trembled again. "Behold, I stand at the door, and
   knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to
   him, and sup with him, and he with me."

SERMON XIV.

  THE DAILY SERVICE A LAW IN GOD'S KINGDOM.

    ACTS ii. 46, 47.

   "And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking
   bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and
   singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the
   people. And the Lord added to the Church daily such as should be saved/

   WE here read the very remarkable fact, that the Apostles and the whole
   Church of Christ still continued,, after the day of Pentecost, to
   attend the daily service of the temple. It must be remembered, that at
   this time not only was the whole mystery of our Lord's passion already
   completed and revealed; not only had He risen and given authority to
   His Apostles to gather out His Church by the sacrament of baptism; but
   He had also shed abroad on them the fulness of the Holy Ghost, and they
   had actually begun to gather together the members of His mystical body.
   In the words which go before those I have read to you, we are told that
   three thousand souls had been baptised into the Church; that this body
   of the faithful "continued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine and
   fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers;" that they "had
   all things common:" and yet of this definite, organised, isolated body,
   a Church fully formed, and conscious of its own personality, we read
   that "they continued daily in the temple." Surely nothing can more
   strikingly shew that the Apostles and first Christians knew themselves
   to be still bound by the primary laws of faith to worship God in public
   every day. The truth is this: God had commanded daily worship to His
   elder Church: morning and evening the sacrifice was offered to Him in
   the temple. So long as His elder Church was still on trial, and, though
   guilty of Christ's blood, not yet cast off, the daily service was still
   accepted in its ancient line. The Apostles, with the full light of the
   Gospel, continued to partake of it. There was nothing contrariant
   between God's elder and later dispensation. They both worshipped Him in
   His temple, and offered the eucharistical sacrifice in their upper
   chambers. The time was not yet come when the daily sacrifice should be
   taken from the elder, and given to the Catholic Church. Until this time
   came, the Church of Christ daily served God in the courts of the
   sanctuary on Mount Zion. When the time came that Jerusalem should be
   overthrown, and the Divine Presence forsake His temple, the daily
   service passed to the altars of the Catholic Church. The daily worship
   of the Apostolic Church was the daily service of the Jewish, taken up,
   continued, illuminated, and transfigured with the glory of the Gospel.
   It was the same daily service which Aaron offered fifteen hundred years
   before, filled with spirit and truth. And so we find from the earliest
   dawn of the Church of Christ, that the daily service was an universal
   law, lying at the very root of its spiritual life. We find even the
   very same hours of nine and three o'clock, the times of the morning and
   evening sacrifice, continued. The Church knew that the daily service
   was an heritage for ever; that the Jews had made forfeit of this
   blessed heir-loom, and that they in their stead had received it. Now,
   from what I have said, it is plain that the daily public worship of God
   is an absolute law, binding the Church of God at all times; that we are
   bound to observe and hand it on as much as were Moses and Aaron, or
   Eli, or Josedeck the high-priest; that the Apostles daily worshipped
   God in the temple, and all Christians received it as a primary,
   self-evident, or, as we are wont to say, axiomatic law of the Church,
   that public worship should be daily paid to the Most High.

   It would be very easy to go on, and to give a multitude of other
   proofs, both in the words of holy writ, and from the facts and usages
   of the universal Church; but I have said enough--first, because it is a
   fact not denied, that the Catholic Church always from the beginning has
   daily worshipped God in public; and next, because the duty of excusing
   or justifying their neglect lies upon those who have departed from the
   unbroken, universal law of the Church for more than three thou sand
   years. I shall not therefore offer any more affirmative proofs; nor
   shall I add any arguments of a controversial sort to refute commonplace
   objectors. I am speaking not to gainsayers, but to men of good will. My
   aim now is to say what may assist those who are willing to be
   persuaded; but feel themselves beset by plausible objections. As for
   mere gainsayers, they must be dealt with apart. Charity forbids my
   classing with them the earnest but perplexed minds of whom I speak. I
   will therefore take and consider a few of the most specious objections
   which weigh with serious people.

   1. As, for instance, it is often said that the daily service is
   unnecessary now, because of the prevalence of family prayer. There are
   many strange mistakes in this. First, it assumes that the fathers and
   masters of families in times past did not worship God in their
   households, as much as people do now; which is a mere assumption,
   having no grounds but the fancy of the speaker, and is, more over,
   contrary to the recorded facts of history. It is perfectly plain that
   family religion was a prominent feature of the Jewish dispensation, in
   which the daily service of God was made so absolute and binding.
   Indeed, this was grafted on the house hold worship of the patriarchs.
   Also the paschal supper was a household service; all the daily life of
   the Jews, in every family relation, was full of worship; all through
   the Old Testament history we have ever emerging tokens of family
   religion. We find Joshua saying, "as for me and my house, we will serve
   the Lord;" and such was the rule of every faithful Israelite. The
   hundred and first Psalm is the very mind of a faithful head of a
   consecrated household. The same we find running into the New Testament;
   even among proselytes. Of Cornelius, we are told that he was "a devout
   man, and one who feared God with all his house;" special mention is
   made of his communicating the vision of the angel to "two of his
   household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him
   continually:" [39] and so, throughout the apostolic writings, household
   religion is broadly recorded. Very little can they know of the history
   of the faithful, who in all ages of the Church have most stedfastly
   waited on God in His daily worship, if they imagine that their
   households were without God in the world. The private lives of all
   great saints shew that none so consecrated their homes as they did. In
   the great examples of the English Church in modern days, we have direct
   evidence of this. [40] Everybody knows that in the last century, when
   Christianity in this land seems to have grown both cold and dark almost
   to extinction, family prayer, no less than the daily service, had well
   nigh perished. By God's mercy we have been brought back again to a
   consciousness of our decline; but it is only the vain self-flattery of
   the day to talk as if we had less need now of the daily service,
   because, forsooth, people have begun to hallow again their desecrated
   homes. The objection is false in its facts. They of old who worshipped
   God daily in His Church, worshipped Him, far more than we, day by day,
   in their own house holds. And we painfully overstate the extent to
   which family worship has been restored. At the most, it is to be found
   in the houses of the educated, and of some others among the less
   instructed but more devout of our people. But in the homes of the
   millions of our population, family worship is still unknown. There is
   something almost hard hearted in the narrow-minded, short-sighted way
   in which people use this objection, as if the few thousand households
   of the richer, or more leisurely, or more educated, or more religious,
   were all the Church had to care, and to provide, and to think, and to
   act for. People get into a way of thinking of themselves, and of the
   little horizon of their own consciousness, as if it were the whole
   Church of God. They are truly charitable towards all who come in
   contact with them; but of the wide rough world which howls round their
   little precinct they are unconscious altogether. But not for them only,
   her more favoured children, must the Church provide, but for the
   hundreds of thousands of house holds in which, through the sin of
   master or mistress, or father or mother, the voice of worship is never
   heard; that is, for the great bulk of the Church. The Church must open
   a shelter for the desolate, and dress an altar for those whose lot is
   cast in households where God is unknown. Therefore, even in this view,
   the objection rests on false assumptions. Nay, it turns against itself;
   for if family prayer were never so full an equivalent, as indeed it is
   not in any way, for the daily service of the Church, how few households
   possess that equivalent! The very objection would shew the necessity of
   a daily service for all the rest; that is, for the great bulk of the
   Church. But, in truth, we are reasoning on a false basis. Family
   worship is in no sense a substitute for public; and the objector, to be
   consistent, must extend the argument even to the Sunday, and abolish
   public worship altogether. Does not this shew that the whole is a
   confusion of things broadly distinct? Public worship is the perfection
   of all worship. Personal worship was in the world before the worship of
   a family, and the united worship of families is the worship of the
   Church. The private prayers of each member in the house does not
   discharge him from the duty of joining in the worship of the family;
   neither does the worship of the family discharge the household from the
   duty of joining in the daily worship of the Church. The daily ser vice
   of the Jews was grafted on the household worship of the patriarchs, or,
   rather, it was developed out of it; in the public worship of the tribes
   of Israel the household worship of Abraham rose to its perfection: and
   the same is the daily service of the parish church to the family
   prayers of every household; these unite men, the other unites families;
   and such, too, is the daily worship of the universal Church as
   conceived apart from its several altars, to the worship of all its
   spiritual families, each under its spiritual head. In a word, there is
   a personality in the individual man, in the family, and in the Church;
   and each of these personalities is so related to God as to demand a
   daily acknowledgment. It is by this means that the visible and
   conscious unity of the Church is maintained. And it is a remarkable and
   instructive fact, that, while the Catholic Churches in the East and in
   the West, from the beginning to this hour, have retained their daily
   service, they have--in the midst of whatsoever corruption in doctrine
   and practice may be other wise alleged against them--nevertheless
   retained also a visible and conscious unity: while certain portions of
   the Western Church, which in the last three centuries have abandoned
   the daily service, have lost their visible and conscious unity. They
   broke the bond, and trod under foot the symbol of unity, which is
   perpetual visible worship. And the end of this we see. Unity departed
   first, and truth followed speedily. The daily sacrifice was taken away,
   and they were broken up; and Churches fell into fragments--into
   congregations, ever changing, ever resolving themselves into new forms,
   ever wasting away, gathering round new centres, multiplying, and yet
   diminishing; they had let the embers on the altar die out untended, and
   then they sought to rekindle a sacred fire on their own hearth-stone;
   but the unity, and with the unity the energy, of spiritual life was
   gone, or it lingered first in families, and then in members of a
   family, and the chill of the neglected sanctuary spread through the
   family into the secret chamber; and men's prayers in their own closets
   waxed faint and cold. Now this has been our state; and from this we are
   slowly recovering, anxiously chafing our numbed limbs to life. God be
   thanked that prayer has grown stronger in secret; that it is passing
   out of the closet into the family; but God forbid it should ever stay
   until it has passed out of the family into the sanctuary again. This is
   the end to which God's mercy is leading us once more, as He led His
   servants of old. Ours is a sadder case. Theirs was the steady growth of
   the first design of God to its full perfection; ours a slow recovery
   from a perilous decline. Let us beware how we linger by the way, and
   think the reconsecrating of our homes is all. We have yet to regain the
   visibleness and consciousness of unity; yet to learn that, though
   private worship is meetest for our unuttered complainings, and family
   worship for our earthlier brotherhood, public worship is the bond of
   our spiritual fellowship, the most perfect work of redeemed man, the
   highest energy of the new-born soul, and nearest to the bliss of
   heaven.

   2. Another common objection is, that the daily service of the Church is
   unprofitable, because so few are able to attend it. Of the ability I
   will speak hereafter; at present we will take for granted that only few
   can attend. Certainly too many there cannot be. The more, the more
   blessed. But why should any be defrauded of a blessing because others
   deprive themselves of it? Daily service is either a blessing, or it is
   not. If any man will undertake to shew that it is no blessing, in God's
   name let him speak out, or else for ever hereafter hold his peace. We
   have yet to see the man who will undertake this task. But if it be a
   blessing, why should any be defrauded of it; and they, too, for the
   most part, such as stand in most need of it? Why should Simeon and Anna
   be thrust back from the gate that is "called beautiful," because others
   see "no comeliness "in it "that they should desire "it? What is it that
   men, and sometimes good men, would say, when they talk of the
   profitableness or unprofitableness of this or that in religion? In what
   company of the merchants of Midian were they so nurtured as to be
   unconscious of the bartering, selfish, unhallowed temper which breathes
   through such a word? Is it not fearfully like to his words who asked,
   "Doth Job serve God for naught?" Alas! we are cast upon an age of
   merchandise. All our life savours of it. Our theology draws its
   parallels from it. Our sanctuaries are built by its schemes. Our very
   hearts buy and sell in the temple; whereby we may know that He is not
   far off who, with a scourge of cords, once cleansed His Father's house:
   and "who may abide the day of His coming, or who shall stand when He
   appeareth?" God forbid we should come to this place only because it is
   profitable to us! We worship God because it is an homage due to Him.
   What is right is always profitable; but woe to the man that does right
   only that he may be profited! Honesty is the best policy; but he is no
   honest man who pays his just debts only that he may be a gainer. He is
   no better than a sordid, unprincipled man, who would just as lief
   defraud his creditors as pay them, if only the balance of profit lay on
   that side. Even the heathen of old were wiser than our philosophers
   now-a-days. We are gravely told that the expedient will always be found
   to be the right. Most true; but conscience is man's guide in moral
   actions; and it is not conscience, but calculation, which judges of the
   expedient. Let a man do right, and he will infallibly do what is
   expedient. God has given him a moral sight to discern the right as the
   test and as the including form of true expediency: to invert the order
   of our moral and reasonable constitution, is like pretending to judge
   of tastes by the smell or the hearing. For once that we may be right,
   we shall mistake a thousand times. And so in the holiest things; we
   have no test of what is profitable but what is right. We have no
   warrant to use the word, except in speaking of what it is our duty to
   do. St. Paul says, "I profited in the Jews religion above many my
   equals," [41] and that was in the way I speak of, i.e. exact conformity
   to the rule of duty. There is no form of evil, heresy and schism
   included, into which a man who, instead of what is ordered, makes what
   is profitable his test in religion, is not likely to fall. And now to
   take up once more our subject:

   The daily worship of God in public is a visible act of homage due to
   Him as the Creator and Preserver of the world, and as the Redeemer and
   Sanctifier of the Church. It is a solemn approach and address to the
   Majesty unseen. The seraphim veil their faces before Him on high; the
   cherubim adore in the glory of His presence; arch angels and angels cry
   aloud; the heavens, and all the powers therein, night and day worship
   the Lord of Hosts; the holy Church throughout all the world evermore in
   matins and evensong doth acknowledge and confess the living and true
   God: it is a visible creed, uttered in symbol, set forth in oblations,
   chants, and bended knees; it is the new born life, reaching out its
   hands unto the Great Father, deep calling unto deep; the one baptism,
   calling upon the regeneration of all things; the new creation of God,
   manifesting itself to the eye of flesh in the midst of this wrongful
   and turbulent world. This is the meaning which angels read in the daily
   worship of the Church on earth. Let us read no less. Even though
   nothing else could be said for the daily public service of God in His
   Church, let this suffice. Whether it be profitable or no to pay God His
   due homage, if any doubt now, he shall know in the morning of the
   resurrection. It is plain, then, that though there be never so few in
   His house, this homage is both due and acceptable in His sight. He has
   been before hand with our objections, and has said, "Where two or three
   are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them;" to
   every, the smallest, gathering of His one Church He has pledged His
   presence. And their homage is no less acceptable than the worship of
   the heavenly companies whom no man can number, whose songs are as the
   voice of many waters. To object on the score of the smallness of the
   congregation, is a direct slight of our Lord's promise, and an
   unintended confession that men have forgotten the whole theory of
   worship, which is homage paid to the unseen presence of God.

   And, besides this, it is manifest that the duty of worshipping God day
   by day rests upon the same ground as the obedience of faith. How
   incongruous is it for those who so jealously contend that the works of
   faith are a free service, to talk of profitableness, as if that were
   the test of public worship! The whole life of faith is a free
   service--as it were, a perpetual eucharist: "Christ our Passover is
   sacrificed for us, therefore let us keep the feast." And how intimately
   does this harmonise with all that has been said of the daily homage due
   to God! From the rising to the going down of the sun, the Church
   redeemed from the gates of hell offers her daily eucharist; not asking,
   How shall this profit me? but ever saying, "It is very meet, right, and
   our bounden duty, that we should at all times and in all places give
   thanks unto Thee, O Lord, Holy Father, Almighty, Everlasting God." By
   this, again, that is by the whole idea and spirit of a life of faith,
   the low calculations of profit are excluded from the subject of the
   daily service.

   But that it may not seem as if the objection had the lightest weight, I
   will say that the highest and most real profit of the Christian is,
   after all, to be found in the daily worship of Almighty God. I might
   content myself with saying, it must be so, because it is a homage and
   an eucharistical offering due to God our Redeemer. But I will explain
   what I mean more fully. In the daily service of the Church, we are
   brought more sensibly under the shadow of the unseen world than at any
   other time. Though we may have livelier feelings at other times of
   prayer, certainly never have we so great a sense of awe and reverence
   as in the house of God. It thereby sustains, by a perpetual help, the
   ever-fainting faith of our hearts: it keeps a daily check upon this
   visible world, which is always growing up about us and closing us in on
   every side. First, then, it is a witness for the unseen world. Next, it
   strengthens the habits of devotion. Let any one who has kept a watch
   upon himself say, whether it is not most certain that at no time is his
   mind more fenced from distraction, and more drawn towards the object of
   worship, by the out ward admonitions of the eye and ear, than in the
   church. And this passes into all the acts of divine service,--into the
   confessions, prayers, praises, thanksgivings. Again; there is a direct
   incitement to devotion in the consciousness of united worship. So it
   was ordained by the constitution of man's heart; and this natural
   feeling is the bond of the communion of saints. Man was as little made
   to worship alone, as to live alone: united homage is the destined bliss
   of man. And, once more; there are special promises made to united
   prayer: Christ has promised to be in the midst of us, and to grant what
   we ask with one accord. We cannot limit this blessing: no man can say
   how great it may be. And shall any man say that this is not profitable?
   or that all this is not necessary for every redeemed soul of man? or
   that daily worship is a duty less binding, and a blessing less to be
   longed for, in a parish where there are only two or three who come to
   share it, than in a parish where there are two or three thousand?
   Duties and blessings are no more to be determined by numbers than are
   the gifts of the Holy Ghost to be purchased with money. Wheresoever
   there is a church, an altar, and a priest, there God looks for His
   daily homage, and there He will hallow, by large gifts of daily
   benediction, the souls of the two or three who wait upon Him. "They
   that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength." All the services
   and sacraments of Christ are as necessary for the sanctification of one
   soul as of the whole Church on earth.

   3. Again; it is sometimes said, that the pastors of the Church have no
   time for daily service; that if they were every day in the church, they
   would have less time to give to visiting their people, managing their
   schools, and the like. It is considerate in people to allege these
   reasons for them, though assuredly they would not allege them for
   themselves. And that because they know that the Church strictly
   commands "all priests and deacons" to "say daily the morning and
   evening prayer, either privately or openly, not being let by sickness
   or some other urgent cause;" and also, that "the curate that
   ministereth in every parish church or chapel, being at home, and not
   being otherwise reasonably hindered, shall say the same in the parish
   church or chapel where he ministereth, and shall cause a bell to be
   tolled thereunto, a convenient time before he begin, that the people
   may come to hear God's word, and to pray with him;" [42] and also that
   the Church, in the Ordination Service, places the ministering in the
   church foremost among the offices of the priest hood. So far from
   diverting their time, it would give it a fixedness and regularity which
   would wonderfully extend their pastoral usefulness. Every day, at a
   certain hour, their people would know where to find them, for counsel,
   or consolation, or help of any kind. Nothing would more assist them in
   their office, than a habit formed in their people, of coming to seek
   them in the place where the parish priest is daily known to stand
   ministering in the order of his office. They are now too often
   compelled to act in an obstructed and unheeded way, as a mere visitor
   or reader in the cottages of their people; and they that have most
   tried it will best know how hard it is to win their thoughts from the
   crowd of household-work which lies around them. What we want is, to
   stir our people to some more direct, personal, energetic acts of
   religion, than the passive listening to a sermon, either in church or
   out of it. The act of coming to the house of God, and praying, is such
   an act; but of this part of the subject we are not speaking now. The
   clergy of the Church would be greatly furthered in their pastoral work,
   by a disposition in their people to join them in daily worship. It
   would restore, also, to their office its true but most forgotten
   character, and bring down unknown blessings upon their ministry.

   4. I will notice only one more objection. It is said, that the habits
   of life are so changed as to make daily service impossible. And
   certainly, when we see that from sunrise to sunset the working-man is
   at his labour; the mechanic or manufacturer twelve or sixteen hours a
   day at his furnace or his loom; the man of business, the lawyer, the
   trader, from nine or ten in the morning to five or six in the evening,
   ever toiling; the man of the world, even still more laboriously, and
   without relaxation, bound down to the round of courtesies, and
   engagements, and usages of life,--we may well confess that the habits
   of life are changed--but for the worse. Once the world waited upon the
   Church, and took its hours and seasons from the hours and seasons of
   God's worship; His service went first in the cycle of all the goings-on
   of life: but now all is reversed. The Church must wait upon the world.
   Worship is thrust aside; is pent up in one day of the seven; is
   narrowed to one service in that one day. The poor working-man wrings a
   scant livelihood out of an over-laboured week. Six whole days are his
   earthly master's share: one is all he has for God and his own soul. Far
   worse is it with the poor sicklied workman in the manufactory; and
   hence comes a sour and restless discontent. Life is an uncheered,
   grating toil, which jars and galls the whole man in soul and body. Life
   has for them few gleams, little or nothing of gladness or of freedom:
   even wife and children, which make the natural heart to spring, give to
   a wearied and saddened people but little happiness. In them they see
   their own toil-worn life, as if it would never end, beginning over
   again. So, too, with the learned professions, and with rich traders,
   and men of commerce; they are ever complaining of an unrelieved
   pressure of daily toil. Many men fairly break down in body or mind,
   under the stress of life. Of those who cannot wait on God daily,
   because they are so over-laboured in doing the nothingnesses of
   society, I need hardly speak; and yet these are the habits of life
   which are pleaded in bar of the daily worship of God. Times and habits
   are changed; indeed, and miserably for the worse: changed so that all
   men are crying out for rest, and for release from an oppressive burden;
   so that the great adversary of God's Church has prevailed, through
   these changes, to turn God's house to a desolation, and to make fast
   its porches against our endeavours to return. Well were it if this
   merely external hinderance were all he had raised between us and the
   daily homage of the Church. Perhaps at no time was the moral
   disposition of man so alienated from daily public prayer. We have not
   only lost this great axiom of the Church, but the very intuition to
   perceive it. It has become a matter of inquiry, and doubt, and
   argument. It is faintly affirmed, and vehemently gainsayed. Be it then
   ever remembered, that the daily service of the Apostolic Church was
   grafted on the daily service of the Jewish. The whole body of the first
   Christians assumed it as a law in God's Church for ever. Men have now
   abandoned it as a body; and its hold, even over individual minds, is
   comparatively faint. The best are unconscious how awful a silence there
   is between God and a Church which does Him homage only one day in
   seven: and in this silence must grow up a still more awful strangeness;
   and the Church have fewer tokens of the Divine presence, and fainter
   reflections of His imparted sanctity.

   Now it is most certain, that the habits of life are not so absolute,
   but that a little firmness would soon throw them again into a better
   order. Let us only resolve to "seek first the kingdom of God;" to take
   the cycle and the seasons of the Church as our governing rule, and to
   make our lives bend to its appointments. When once the Church has
   restored the solemn days of fast and festival, and the stated hours of
   daily prayer, there will be an order marked out for all men of good
   will to follow. And, at the last, we shall once more see this fretful,
   busy world checked, and for a while cast out, by the presence of the
   world unseen. Its bur den will be sensibly lessened; and the hearts of
   men will have some shelter, and rest to turn to, in the dry and glaring
   turmoil of life.

   Then among us, as of old, men may go up in secret to the house of
   prayer, to make their sin-offerings, and their peace-offerings, and
   their offerings of thanks. No sun should then go down on sins
   unconfessed, or blessings unacknowledged; and if any be truly hindered,
   still in their own home, or by the way-side, or in crowded marts, or in
   busy cities, or in the fields,--when the bell is heard afar off, or the
   known hour of prayer is come, they may say with us the confession and
   the Lord's prayer; and though far from us on earth may meet us in the
   court of heaven.

SERMON XV.

  THE HIDDEN LIFE.

    COLOSSIANS iii. 3.

   "Your life is hid with Christ in God."

   BY the sacrament of holy baptism we were both buried and raised with
   Christ; both in symbol and in power we were made partakers "of a death
   unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness." Our present life,
   therefore, is as the life of our Lord after His resurrection, spiritual
   and immortal. We have no more to do with the world than if we were
   dead. We are even, as it were, ascended with Him. St. Paul tells the
   Ephesians that God hath "raised us up together" with Him, "and made us
   sit in heavenly places;" and the Philippians, that "our conversation is
   in heaven;" and here he says, "seek those things which are above, where
   Christ sitteth at the right hand of God;" for, as to all this world,
   and the works that are therein, "ye are dead, and your life is hid with
   Christ in God." Now consider what it is St. Paul says: he tells us that
   our life is hid; that there is a depth and a mystery about our life.
   Now this signifies;--

   First, That the origin or source of our spiritual life is hidden. We
   derive it from Christ, and He is hid in the unseen world, in the glory
   of God; and yet our life is hardly so much any thing received from
   Christ, as a oneness with Christ. He is our life. We are so made
   partakers of Him, that He said, "Because I live, ye shall live also."
   As St. Paul says, "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet
   not I, but Christ liveth in me." This is no mere parable or figure. By
   our birth into this world the first Adam lived in us. We have his
   nature, and the stamp of his disobedience. His fallen manhood was in
   us. By our second birth in holy baptism we are made partakers of the
   second Adam, and of His raised and glorified manhood; all His mystical
   body is united to Him, so as with their Head to make but one person.
   All members of His body are so one with Him that they live in Him, and
   He in them. There is one life, filling and quickening all; and that one
   life has its origin and source in the unseen world from Christ, who is
   "hid in God."

   In the next place, St. Paul's words mean that the habitual course and
   tenour of our spiritual life is hidden and secret from the world. This
   may seem, at first sight, contrary to our Lord's command, "Let your
   light so shine before men that they may see your good works;" and to
   all the multitude of precepts respecting the power of a holy example.
   But it is not so. The holiness of the saints cannot fail to be seen. It
   breaks out by its own strength, and shines around them. If they would,
   they could not hide it. Even their shrinking from the gaze of the world
   turns into a bright grace of lowliness, and betrays itself by the act
   of concealment. But St. Paul is not speaking of this outward
   manifestation of the spiritual life; but of its powers, and energies,
   and habitual inward actings. There is a world of life between a
   Christian and Christ his unseen Lord, which the eye of man never
   beholds. The whole life of interior repentance, the lonely and
   ever-repeated confessions of his sins, the indignant scrutiny of his
   own hidden thoughts, the tears which are laid up in the vial of God,
   and the sighs which are noted in His book; all the energies of faith,
   and the breathings of prayer, and the groanings which cannot be
   uttered, and the awful converse of the heart with God, and the
   struggles of the will, and the kindlings of hope and love, and all the
   host of living thoughts which pass to and fro between the spirit of a
   redeemed man and the Lord of his redemption;--all these, I say, make up
   a hidden life which the world can neither see nor scan. And this has
   been ever going on, more or less, in each one of us, from our baptism.
   And how wonderfully is all this, from time to time, excited and
   complicated by the changes and chances of life--by seasons of joy and
   sorrow! They who best know each other's hearts, how little do they
   truly understand what a vast realm of spiritual life lies hid in each
   one of us! how it reaches upward to heaven in height, and downward to
   the deep beneath; how it touches the eternal bounds of good and ill!
   And all this is in each one with whom we daily speak, whom we love, and
   well-nigh live for. We see them smile, or look cast down, or hang in
   doubt, or fix their resolution, and speak promptly, and then muse on
   what they have done: and we kneel by them, and worship God, and feed on
   the same eucharist, and have the same hopes, and fears, and prayers:
   and yet how little do we truly know them! what a fine illuminated edge,
   as it were, of their spirits it is that we have beheld, and our love
   has fastened on! The full breadth of it shines inwardly, and is turned
   on the unseen world alone. How all the history of mankind shews this
   strange truth! Take Enoch for an example, He lived in the midst of men,
   and saw all their doings, and they looked upon his daily life; and he
   was the father of Methuselah, and of sons and daughters. He was not
   unlike any other man that feared the Lord. But what a secret lay hid in
   him! "Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him." [43]
   And so, at all times, between God and His true servants there has been
   a hidden and most intimate fellowship. The saints of Christendom are as
   a line of unintelligible characters. The world sees them, knows that
   they do not belong to it, that they are above it, that they have a
   strange intercourse with things unseen; it chafes at them, mocks them,
   hates them, but fears them. It may slay, but it cannot scorn them.
   There is something too real, majestic, and awful for the world to dare
   any thing but their death. So it was with St. Paul, and with all
   prophets and martyrs, and with all the great names in the story of the
   Church. They have, as it were, a twofold being, or two sides to their
   life: the one written by the world, all confusion and perplexity; the
   other recorded by the Church, full of unity and light. And yet neither
   the world nor the Church can give the full outline, for their "life was
   hid with Christ in God." We must wait until they "shine forth as the
   sun in the kingdom of their Father."

   Let us now follow out some of the consequences of this truth. It is
   evident that there are great diversities of character among Christians;
   diversities of a remarkable sort--some only in degree, some almost in
   kind. Between those who live purely, and in the fear of God, there is
   often great and visible difference, and yet, at the same time, a
   predominant likeness and a true fellowship. But between those who live
   in habitual devotion, and those who live a blameless life (for 1 am not
   speaking of sinners), without the living marks of faith, there is a
   difference so sensible and deep, as to make them almost
   incomprehensible to each other. Now the true key of this difficulty is
   to be found in these words of St. Paul. All alike have been made
   partakers of the one hidden source of life, by baptism into Christ,
   which, like the breath of our nostrils, is a gift of God, passively
   received into their being: but in the energy and habit of their living
   powers, as distinguished from the gift of spiritual life, they differ
   so greatly, that some so live in the world which is here visible, as
   hardly to live at all in the world unseen; some so habitually dwell in
   the hidden world, as to have but little part in this; and all the rest
   vary in their character, in the measure in which things seen or unseen
   govern and control their life. For instance, Christians whom we call
   worldly are of the first sort. The field of their whole life lies on
   this side of the veil which hides from us the unseen. There is no
   indulged evil about them; their morals are pure; they are kind; they
   seldom speak harshly of any one; they are careful and exact in their
   calling; prudent, foreseeing; discreet advisers on a large range of
   subjects in morals and politics; they seem to have scanned thoroughly
   this world which has importuned their attention; and they will go with
   you round the whole horizon of this visible common-place life; but when
   you come to the point where things seen blend with the unseen, they, as
   it were, vanish at once. They are gone; and you feel as if you were
   alone, by yourself, speaking aloud. It is not at all that they reject
   or make light of the objects of faith; but they do not see them: the
   faculty of perception lies in them undeveloped, as the sense of harmony
   in an untutored ear. It is simply a state of privation of senses: the
   hidden powers of hearing and sight are in them, but have never been
   roused into consciousness. We see this much more painfully in people
   that love the pleasures of life. The easy, acquiescent habit which
   grows over such minds, seems to make them incapable of steady and
   serious thought. Self -pleasing, even in its purest and most refined
   forms, is highly deadening to the keenness of the inward life; and it
   is remarkable that such persons are often full of religious emotions
   and religious conversation. Sensibility, or a quickness of superficial
   feeling, is the exact part of their mind that is most unfolded and
   excited by their common life; and a desire to maintain a good tone and
   standard in judging of passing events, compels them to form a habit of
   talking religiously. But both the feelings and the words pass off into
   mere unrealities; they come from no depth of the spiritual life; they
   are uttered by no conscious energy of the will; they are out of
   proportion with the character, being high and deep enough for the
   utterance of saints. In them it is simply artificial; mere pictures of
   the fancy, and simulation of the active intellect. Now such people
   follow the order of the Church, much as they yield to the order of the
   world. Acquiescence is their habit: they at tend fast and festival;
   they gaze on ceremonies and sacraments--but they see only the outside.
   They cannot penetrate within; their inward sight is blindfold. And so
   they live on, year by year, the exterior habits of the mind knitting
   more closely, and indurating more and more the susceptibility of their
   interior life. The gift of regeneration lies in them, living indeed,
   but without a pulse of life. Theirs is a visible, external life, acted
   on from without--not thrown out from within. They are a part of this
   material world, and move along with it, and are conformed to it.
   Doubtless, even in such persons there are many thoughts and movements
   of the soul towards what is to come here after; but these are instincts
   of the heart and conscience, almost involuntary and irresponsible. The
   greater part of all their conscious, voluntary, responsible life is
   turned to this visible world; their hidden life is so deaf, and blind,
   and lifeless, that they may be truly said to have little more than the
   gift which they passively received in holy baptism.

   In direct contrast to these people that I have spoken of, are they who
   so live in the world unseen as to have but little part in this life:
   such, for instance, as those whose characters have been moulded, by the
   virtues of truth and grace, upon the laws and worship of the Church;
   whose spiritual nature has been unfolded either by a steady growth from
   the waters of baptism, or by the after-work of a thorough and searching
   change. We find in them a purity and dignity of mind, a refinement and
   elevation, a free play in all the powers of their spiritual being, and
   a quickness to penetrate into the mind of symbols and mysteries, which
   is altogether wonderful. Every one is conscious of it but themselves.
   To them it is as unperceived, by any reflection, as health or sight.
   They go on unknown to themselves, living a life above the world, which
   makes us wonder at them. They are ever putting forth more and more of
   power, and unfolding faculties so altogether new, so manifold, and so
   adequate to every season of great trial, whether in action or
   endurance, that we seem never to have known them before. They hardly
   look to us like the same men; and the more energy of will and reason,
   the more of sanctity and wisdom, they unfold to us, the more we feel
   persuaded that there is an inexhaustible depth behind, a source
   somewhere out of sight, from which they are perpetually drawing in new
   powers of life. In all their judgments of moral character, their
   counsels of action, their foresight, schemes, and cautions, there is a
   piercing strength, and a clear wisdom, so unperceived before they
   uttered it, but so self-evident when spoken, that we are fain to hear
   in silence. About all their actions in life there is a plainness and a
   power, a calmness, a grace, and a greatness, which makes us feel that
   they move on some higher path than we, and are numbered in a higher
   fellowship. And so in truth it is. Their "life is hid with Christ in
   God;" their "fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus
   Christ." Their visible exterior life in this world is but the lesser
   and lower portion of their being. They come down, as it were, from the
   source and sanctuary of their hidden life, to mix in the goings-on of
   this world. The wonderful light and irradiation which breaks out on all
   sides of their character is no less than this, the mind of Christ
   shining out through their renewed man hood. They are channels by which
   it streams forth into this fallen world. Year by year they have less of
   this visible life about them; they seem to put off its mortality before
   the time. They are more and more drawn within the veil. They come out
   seldomer into this turbulent state; their dwelling is, in prayer and
   silence, "with Christ in God."

   These, then, are the two extremes on either side; and the number of
   each is few. The greater part of men are to be found between these two
   decided characters; under the absolute predominance of neither the
   visible nor the invisible world; but wavering between both, balancing
   in an ever-varying poise, inclining now to the one, now to the other
   side. And this is the key to all the vacillation and inconsistency of
   men otherwise good. They are better in aim than in act; in conviction
   than in resolution; and their will is dragged to and fro. Hence we find
   people apparently of a worldly mind doing acts of decided faith; and
   people of a religious character commit ting acts of mere secularity.
   This is according as either bias of the will prevails in turn; they
   have a sympathy with both worlds, and both still keep a hold upon them.
   Again; we see people more decided than the last, who have ventured, as
   it were, a little way into the world unseen; and then have grown
   afraid: they feel lonely and disquieted; they see others hang back and
   leave them to go alone; and they fear to go on. Such persons have a
   deep conviction of the reality of the life of faith, and a high
   perception of the blessedness of living under the shadow of God's
   throne; they have at times felt His unseen hand drawing them within the
   folds of His presence, and have been conscious that awful lights have
   fallen upon their hearts. And yet it seems to them, that if they would
   follow His leading, they must "needs go out of the world;" that they
   must make great sacrifices; give up many pleasant dreams for the
   future; forego much they have been toiling after. Such is the state of
   most men--neither one thing nor the other; lacking boldness to go
   onward or backward; lacking devotion to be wholly devout, and yet
   having so much that they could never be happy again with out it. They
   have a great measure of real seriousness, and of clear insight into the
   hidden meaning of the Church and its mysteries. And yet this is not the
   predominant feature of their character. Their visible calling imposes
   its laws on their whole life: they are first traders, or students, or
   statesmen, or husbands, or fathers, and then subordinately they are
   Christians. Their faith is kept in check by the prescriptive rights, as
   it were, of their worldly calling, which stamps a governing character
   on their life, limiting the play of faith in the unseen within certain
   arbitrary bounds of prudence, or moderation, or established usage, arid
   the like. Now between such men and the invisible world there is,
   indeed, a certain kind and mea sure of intercourse; but it is sadly
   darkened and thwarted. They are forced to pay homage first to this
   world; and their allegiance to the other is but secondary and
   conditional.

   There are two further remarks I would make on what has been said: and,
   first, that there is no lot, nor calling in life (if only it be a
   lawful one) in which a man may not so live as that his life shall be
   "hid with Christ in God." It is not only prophets and apostles, or
   monastic orders, or priests waiting at the altar, who may so stand
   aloof from this world: it is within the power of all men, be their
   station never so public, be their calling in life never so full of
   toil. We need not withdraw from the eyes of men to pass into the world
   unseen. We are not any the more within the veil because we are hid from
   the sight of men. We may be in a wilderness, and yet shut out from the
   invisible world; we may be in kings courts and crowded cities, and yet
   be "hid with Christ in God." The avenues stand open every where alike;
   but it is the heart that must enter in. If we have a strong,
   self-collected faith, it matters not where we are;--all visible things
   grow transparent, and unseen things shine through upon us. We walk as
   in an illuminated cloud, which softens, but cannot hide what is before
   our eyes. And that, too, not in acts of devotion and in hallowed
   shrines alone, but every where. In our chamber, in our household, by
   the way-side, in the scene of our public duties, at all seasons, all
   day long, the whole vision of the hidden world hangs before the eye of
   the wakeful spirit. Therefore let no man plead, in behalf of his
   sightless, inactive faith, that he is baffled by his lot in life, his
   duties, his round of labour, the distractions of society, and the like.
   If in any thing he is consenting to the neighbourhood and contact of
   evil, then his plea is true; but if his lot in life is that which God
   has chosen for him, it is nothing less than charging his hinderances on
   God. From every lawful state in life there is a direct and open way
   into the world unseen.

   The last remark I will make is, that we must be ever moving one way or
   the other, either to or from the source of our hidden life. To hold an
   equipoise between the seen and the unseen is impossible. Our inward
   being is ever changeful and fluctuating; and as it gains or loses its
   sympathy with the realities of faith, so it will either rise or fall in
   the scale of spiritual life. We are always tending to one of the two
   extremes: the inward must subdue the outward to itself, or the outward
   will stifle the inward life. Let us, therefore, make our choice, and
   let us choose wisely. Most pure is the happiness which may be ours, if
   only we will; a bliss without a shade of sorrow. There are no thorns
   now in the hidden life of Christ; no chill, no blemish in its gladness.
   All things, even the best, below God, have a canker somewhere, and the
   taint of a fallen world is on them. Not so the life which is with
   Christ in God. It is as peaceful as it is pure; high above the reach of
   all perturbations. They that live in Him have their dwelling in God;
   they look out of Him as out of an everlasting shelter; and look down on
   the wide weltering sea of this world's troubled life. Let us pray of
   Him to draw us within the veil; to make us forgotten among men; to
   gather up all our life into Himself: that "when Christ, who is our
   life, shall appear," we may "appear with Him in glory."

SERMON XVI.

  SINS OF INFIRMITY.

    ST. MATTHEW xxvi. 41.

   "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed
   is willing, but the flesh is weak."

   THESE words of our Lord in the garden, when He came from His agony and
   found the apostles asleep, are very sorrowful and touching. They shew
   an ineffable depth of tenderness and compassion. He uttered neither
   reproach nor complaint at their unseasonable slumber; but only, "What,
   could ye not watch with me one hour?" and He turned away all thought
   from Himself to them; and, for their own sakes, bade them "watch and
   pray," for that their trial was at hand. Now in this we have a
   wonderful example of the love of Christ. How far otherwise we should
   act in such a case, we all well know. When any seem to us to be less
   keenly awake to the trial we may happen to be undergoing, we are above
   measure excited, as if some great wrong were done to us. There is
   nothing we resent so much as the collected manner of those who are
   about us in our afflictions. If they still seem the same when we are so
   changed--even if they can still be natural, feel common interests, and
   take their wonted rest, we feel exceedingly aggrieved, and almost
   forget our other trial, in the kindling of a sort of resentment. We
   have here, then, a wonderful pattern of gentleness and forgetfulness of
   self; for if ever there was a season of sorrow to any born of woman, it
   was the hour of agony in the garden. It seems strange to us how His
   disciples could have slept at such a time. They had but then left the
   upper chamber, where they had seen and heard all the sad words and acts
   of that last passover; they had heard Him saying, "With desire I have
   desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer;" and little as
   they understood the full meaning of that mystery of sorrow, yet from
   His way of speaking they must have felt overcast by the belief that
   some trial, greater than any before, was near at hand. Moreover, they
   had seen Him "troubled in spirit," and heard Him say, "one of you shall
   betray me." [44] And, besides this, His parting words to them when He
   went away from them a stone's cast in the garden, were enough, we
   should have thought, to keep us waking: "Then saith He unto them, My
   soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch
   with me." [45] And with all these things full upon them, it would have
   seemed that they, least of all, could have fallen asleep--they, the
   favoured three--Peter who loved his Master with so earnest and warm a
   love, and James who was counted worthy to be the companion of Peter,
   and the disciple who an hour before had lain on His breast at sup per.
   In St. Luke's Gospel we read that they were "sleeping for sorrow." [46]
   And this secret cause of their heaviness, it may be, the evangelist
   learned of some one who well knew what passed on that awful night. Who
   can doubt but that they sadly told all their infirmities? St. Matthew
   (and St. Mark also) say that "their eyes were heavy." [47] And they
   that have entered into the depths of sorrow know well how nearly akin
   to slumber is the languor and amazement of unutterable grief; how the
   "sight faileth for looking upward," and the eyes, which gaze fixedly
   and see nothing, close for very emptiness. But none knew this better
   than He, the Man of Sorrows, when He spoke these few words of mild
   upbraiding. It was at that hour they had most need to watch, as being
   by sorrow least able to stand against temptation. Theirs, then, is an
   example of an almost blameless infirmity; and yet, though hardly to be
   blamed, it was not the less beset with danger. And here we have a great
   warning, and a no less consolation: a great warning, indeed; for if
   they slumbered at such an hour, how may we not fear that our
   temptations will often fall upon us unawares? And yet, for our
   consolation, we see how gently He bare with them; and He will surely be
   no more severe with us. In truth, He made their defence for them; His
   very warning taught them how to plead with Him; and by teaching it, He
   acknowledged the truth of the plea: "the spirit indeed is willing, but
   the flesh is weak." Let us consider these words.

   And, first, we must observe, that by "the spirit" is to be understood
   what we call the heart or will, illuminated by the grace of God; as
   where St. Paul says, "the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the
   spirit against the flesh;" [48] and where he prays for the
   Thessalonians, that their "whole spirit and soul and body be preserved
   blameless;" [49] and again, "the Spirit itself beareth witness with our
   spirit, that we are the children of God." [50] And next, by "the flesh"
   is to be understood our fallen manhood, with its affections and lusts,
   so far as they still remain even in the regenerate. Now before our
   regeneration we are under the power of the flesh; then there is no
   willingness to serve God aright: after our regeneration, the flesh is
   put under the dominion of the Spirit. St. Paul speaks not as an Apostle
   endowed above other men, but as one born again of the Spirit, when he
   says, "I can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth me."
   [51] Such, I say, is the state of the regenerate. They "can do all
   things;" but, alas, they do not. The flesh has no more dominion, except
   we willingly re-invest it with its sovereignty. We may still betray
   ourselves to it again, and become twofold more enslaved to it than
   before; and short of this, even though we no more yield to it a
   dominion over us, yet it is to us "a sore let and hinderance in running
   the race that is set before us." When it cannot overcome, yet it still
   can sap and weaken; or, in other words, it is a weakness in itself;
   for, under the governing power of the Spirit, our regenerate manhood be
   comes a servant of God; it is once more consecrated to God's service;
   but having been stripped and wounded by the powers of sin, and left as
   it were dead, even after its rising again through holy baptism, it is
   weak and failing: and therefore we find such paradoxes in the lives of
   true Christians. They are ever willing, and purposing, and desiring,
   and yearning, and beginning well; and even more than this, we see them
   growing in grace and spiritual strength; and yet we find them also
   failing and falling short, ever trying to reach some far mark, but not
   attaining it--purposing great things, and hardly accomplishing little
   things. Such, in deed, for at least a large part of their earthly life,
   is the state of most baptised people: and that not because they are
   under any subduing dominion of indwelling sin, as some would have us
   believe, who expound St. Paul's description of his state before his
   regeneration as if he were speaking of himself after he had been born
   again through the grace of Christ; but because "the flesh is
   weak,"--that is, their whole nature, though made new of the Spirit, is
   still feeble, and soon exhausted, and ready to slumber, and easily cast
   down. And this is what St. Paul means when he says, "the flesh lusteth
   against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are
   contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye
   would." [52] He is speaking, not of two natures, but of one--of one
   fallen but regenerate manhood, in which linger still the
   susceptibilities of evil, besetting and weakening the renewed heart and
   will by many sore and stubborn hinderances. Such, then, is the state of
   good men, of whom it may be truly said, that the "spirit is willing,
   but the flesh is weak." Now we may take one or two particular examples
   of this truth.

   1. For instance, we may trace the weakness of our nature in the great
   fluctuations of our inner state. I do not mean in such as end in a
   falling away from baptismal grace, or under the mastery of any grievous
   sin. These are examples rather of the strength of the flesh in its own
   hereditary rebellion against God, than of the weakness of our
   regenerate nature. I am speaking now of such variations as fall within
   the limits of a life in the main obedient to the faith. No one can have
   care fully watched over himself, without perceiving how different he is
   at different times. Let him compare the trembling exactness of his
   obedience, his prolonged and earnest prayers, his subdued and yielding
   temper, in a time of sorrow or great fear; or, again, the depth of his
   self-accusation and repentance, and the watchful abhorrence with which
   he repelled the approaches of evil thoughts in a time of severe
   sickness, or in a season of great spiritual blessings; let him compare
   such state with his condition, it may be, some few years after, when
   change of position in life, or mere toil, or elevation, or accession of
   wealth, has come upon him. Though he is still in the fear of God, he is
   a changed man. It is difficult, perhaps, to see exactly what is the
   change. It may be, though he feels it himself, he could not tell what
   it is; only that he is more self-possessed, less vivid in faith, less
   susceptible of impressions--that he retains them less steadily, and has
   lost, as it were, the quickness and flexibility of his mind. Now there
   can be no doubt that all the while he has been sincere in his desires
   to serve God; but, either by the withdrawal of the out ward discipline
   under which he was once brought nearer to the unseen world, or by
   weariness in well-doing, and the fretting of little daily
   counteractions, he has given way, and declined from his former and more
   devoted state. Of course such persons are in great danger of being
   overthrown by the direct assault of sins coming upon them suddenly, as
   St. Peter was, a few hours after our Lord warned him in the garden. It
   is more likely than not that such falls do mingle in from time to time;
   and though really sorrowed over, yet leave behind a deadening effect,
   which is not enough noted at the time, and shews itself afterwards only
   indistinctly in effects, or as one among many causes of declension.

   2. We may take as another example of this weakness, the speedy fading
   away of good impressions even in those that live lives of real
   devotion. In the first place, it seems true that the mind can not
   without a strain be ever at one pitch. Like the power of sight, it must
   have its intervals of intension and remission. It seems by some law of
   its inscrutable nature, to need to be unbent; and therefore, after
   fixed contemplation of the unseen world, or prayer of greater length,
   or after a day of fasting, it may be that the conditions of our nature
   require that it should be relaxed. And this may be called, in one
   sense, the weakness of the flesh. For of the ministering angels who
   excel in strength, and of the spirits of the just made perfect, we are
   told, that they rest not day or night from their heavenly adoration. In
   them there is nothing of earth, and therefore nothing of infirmity.
   They mount up as eagles, with ever-renewing strength. In one sense,
   then, it may be said that, owing to the weakness of the flesh, our
   adoration is but a faint and broken reflection of theirs. But this is
   not the sense with which we have now to do. This is the inevitable,
   blameless infirmity of fallen man. We are speaking of something
   further; something which, if we will, is within the limits of our
   strength; and therefore, if we will not, is worthy of blame. For
   instance, it is a sad thought when we reflect for how short a time we
   retain the posture of mind which was wrought in us by our last day of
   fasting, or our last act of self-examination. For a time, we were bowed
   under the Eternal Will, and awed by a sense of God's nearness, and a
   sight of our own sullied hearts: for a time, all the faults of our
   inferior nature were so held in check, that we seemed to be set free
   from their oppression; our better self rose to the surface, and
   maintained its ascendency; we were drawn into harmony with the secret
   order of His spiritual kingdom; all things, even the most adverse and
   chastening, seemed to us to be good; we were willing to be disposed of
   by Him, though it should cost us all we had been longing for in life.
   Again, in times of great affliction, when by acts of self-humiliation,
   and pondering over the tokens of His purpose, we have brought ourselves
   to a calm submissive state, so as to feel, as well as know, that if we
   had chosen for ourselves, we should have chosen amiss, and that our
   piercing sorrows are the last hope of breaking us into obedience, the
   necessary means of winning for us a crown in heaven;--it is sad to see
   how quickly these pure and blessed thoughts, with their fresh and vivid
   feelings, are blown away like the morning dew. So great is the change,
   that we seem to be other men. Our lighter thoughts fritter away our
   humiliation; lofty and self-trusting impulses belie our acts of
   lowliness, and seem to turn our very prayers into an unreal and
   intrusive profession; we grow restless, self-guiding, wilful; we take
   up again a self-confident tone, and lose our seat among those that are
   poor in spirit; or we grow fretful, and retract our acquiescence in
   God's chastisement, and in anguish of heart forfeit the blessing which
   should have abased and sanctified us. In like manner, when, by a great
   struggle against ourselves, we have overcome any evil temper of the
   mind, by which, for a season, we have been mysteriously buffeted,
   though for a time it seem to lie dead within us, it comes back upon us
   unawares, and takes possession of the whole mind before it betrays its
   return. All at once we find ourselves within its grasp; and all the
   strife is to be fought over again. And we feel wearied out, and to have
   no more spirit in us; as if, in St. Paul's words, "sin revived, and" we
   "died."

   They that have watched themselves narrowly, know by what subtle and
   imperceptible movements of the mind we thus sink away from our better
   dispositions; and how all the while that we are desiring to hold our
   state unchanged, our highly wrought impressions are passing off. Not
   only do things without slacken and draw us down,--such as superficial
   talking, many companions, differences of opinion, eager discussion,
   unconsidered assertions, words not weighed, and the like,--but it seems
   as if the mind were ever shedding its own better energies by a sort of
   radiation; as if they were ever escaping, and leaving us chilled and
   downcast. We find ourselves indevout, unhumbled, unhappy. Here, then,
   is another example of a willing spirit burdened by the weakness of our
   fallen nature. We have hardly come out of our keenest vigil before we
   are overcome with slumber.

   3. I will take only one more example, and then bring this subject to an
   end with one or two remarks. This same weakness which besets our
   imperfect nature, is the reason why we fall so far short, in effect, of
   our aims and resolutions, and, in a word, of the whole law and measure
   of obedience. By the gift of regeneration, and by the powers of the
   sanctified and illuminated reason, we are able to perceive in some sort
   the idea of holiness as it exists in the Eternal Mind. In will and
   desire we choose it for our law of life. But the powers and energies of
   our fallen nature, even though regenerate, are too small for our
   aspirations. In desire we can reach to a sinless perfection of being,
   but in deed our purest and most elevated obedience is mingled and
   imperfect. This at the best; for the most part there is a sad
   intermingling of a baser alloy. How much of self, and sloth, and of our
   characteristic faults, and of secondary aims lying just below the
   horizon of our visible acts, is there to be found in our works of
   charity, our alms-deeds, our fasts, our prayers, our confessions, even
   at the steps of the altar! We are always resolving on more than we
   keep, purposing more than we do, feeling less than we say; projecting
   before our eyes a more perfect pattern than we ever attain; and that
   not only when we propose to ourselves the example of our Lord, whom
   none can follow in this world "whither soever He goeth," but even of
   men beset like ourselves, as His saints asleep, or His servants yet
   living on earth. After all, ours is a poor, flagging, swerving, laggard
   obedience at the best. Yet we are not only willing, but earnestly
   desiring, striving, and praying Him to raise us to a higher measure of
   obedience; and, nevertheless, ever finding our will baffled, and our
   acts most imperfect. I will give one instance, and then pass on. Let us
   take the whole branch of our personal religion which is expressed in
   the words "discipline" and "devotion." With our whole soul we purpose
   to fast, pray, watch, meditate, deny ourselves; and yet, when we look
   back on our habits hitherto, we shall find that we have been
   consciously failing, leaving things undone, coming short of our rules,
   changing them, seemingly for fair excuses, but really to relieve the
   weakness of our imperfect nature. Com pare the end of Lent with its
   beginning, or the evening of a fast-day with the morning; set side by
   side your resolutions and your fulfilments, your rules and your acts;
   and who shall go uncondemned?

   In all this, then, we see the tokens of the fall, which are still upon
   the regenerate. Only One was ever "tempted like as we are, yet without
   sin." Though He bore our manhood with its sin less infirmities, yet He
   hallowed and endowed it with transcendent strength. We by our
   regeneration are made partakers of that same hallowed nature, not in
   perfection, but in imperfection; not in its fulness, but in a measure.
   It is in us, but made subject to the laws which control our humanity
   and our probation. Such is the King of saints in the midst of His
   brethren: He shining with full orb through heaven and earth; they in
   partial reflections, sometimes obscured, sometimes breaking forth,
   waxing and waning, yet, on the whole, ever shining "more and more unto
   the perfect day." We have received this great gift of God, that our
   "spirit is willing." There is no surer sign that we are members of His
   mystical body, through which the Will that moves heaven and earth, and
   gives laws to angels, and leads the morning stars, and out of darkness
   brings light, out of discord harmony, pours itself abroad, fills all
   the regenerate, and unites them to Himself.

   In the first place, therefore, do not be out of heart at the
   ever-present consciousness of the weakness of your mortal nature. It is
   well known, and better understood, and more closely scanned by Him to
   whose perfection you are mystically united. If we were not fallen men,
   what need were there that the Word should be made flesh, and God become
   man, taking up the weakness of our manhood into the power of His
   Godhead? It is the very condition of the regenerate, and the law which
   governs the knitting together of His mystical body, and the educing of
   a new creation out of the old, that it should be gradual; imperfection
   passing into perfection; death being slowly swallowed up of life, sin
   through long striving cast forth by holiness. Moreover, we know not
   what mysterious purpose in the spiritual world may be fulfilled even in
   our weakness; nor how the glory of the Son of God, and the abasement of
   sin, may be perfected in our infirmity. It was not all fulfilled when
   in His sinless and perfect manhood He bruised Satan under His feet: He
   will do more, and bruise him day by day under the feet of our weak and
   imperfect nature. What St. Paul said of the apostolic grace is true
   also of our regeneration: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels,
   that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us." [53]
   And the abasement of the powers of evil is the more absolute in this,
   that the weakest in God's kingdom is stronger than they. This, it may
   be, besides his own humiliation, was the hid den meaning of St. Paul's
   long buffeting with the messenger of Satan: "For this thing I besought
   the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And He said unto me, My
   grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in
   weakness." [54]

   And, once more; as there seems to be some great purpose in the
   permission of our weakness, so does there also appear to be as deep a
   design in permitting the infirmities of the saints to cleave so long
   and closely about them. They are ever crying to be delivered "from the
   body of this death," to be set free from the harassing of indwelling
   evils, and to be healed of the very susceptibility of temptation. The
   prayer of the saints has ever been, to be "endued with much strength,"
   to be made like to the One who was without sin. They have been going
   about seeking rest, crying, "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be
   clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.' Cast out of me the
   unclean spirit, for I am grievously vexed with the tyranny of this
   self, which of a child hath tormented me. Lord, how long wilt Thou not
   speak the word, and heal me?"

   At first sight we might be tempted to think that, as "the will of God"
   is "our sanctification," we could not be too speedily delivered from
   the infirmities of the flesh. But in this we should overlook one great
   reality in our present state. We must be made partakers of the
   humiliation of Christ; and therefore we are left girded about with the
   burden of our fallen nature. It is by learning the depth of our fall,
   and of the evil that dwells in us, that we are to be fully abased. We
   must "drink of the brook in the way" or ever He will "lift up" our
   "head." Therefore God suffers weaknesses and infirmities to cling about
   His holiest servants, even as He suffers them to bear a dissolving body
   to the last. Great is the mystery of our humiliation; even sin, for
   which we are abased, is over ruled to perfect our abasement; and,
   besides this, our faults and weaknesses are left about us for our
   purification. The cleansing of spiritual evil is a deep and searching
   work. It is not as the bleaching of a soiled garment, which is dead and
   passive in the fuller's hand. It is wrought by the energy and repulsion
   of a holy will, conscious and invincible in its warfare against itself.
   The pains of in dwelling evil are, it may be, an absolute condition to
   the perfection of holiness in a fallen being. Of those blessed and holy
   spirits, which have ever kept their first estate, and are the nearest
   types of the unchangeable and Holy One, we know no thing. But for the
   restoration of us, fallen, and alienated, and redeemed, and born again,
   not a re-moulding as of dead and passive matter, but the living and
   intense action of a moral nature, seems ordained by the eternal laws of
   will and being. Our weakness and faults, therefore, are left to abide
   in us, that we may learn the perfection of hating what God abhors. They
   are as a purifying fire, which eats through us with a sleep less pain
   and an anguish which cleanses the soul. When God shews to us the inner
   depths of our spiritual being, leading us, as He led His prophet of
   old, through chambers hallowed to Himself, but defiled by secret
   abominations, He reveals to us a mystery of fear and sorrow which has
   nothing like it on this side of the grave. Nevertheless, let us pray of
   Him to shew us all. If we would be safe, we must know the worst. And
   this will teach us to lay our hand upon our mouth, when we are tempted
   to cry, "How long, O Lord?" and turn us from the rising wish "to be
   unclothed," and to be delivered from ourselves; because it may be that
   we blindly desire the shortening of our purification, with we know not
   what loss of glory in His kingdom. Better is it to bear about the cross
   of our own fallen hearts until it has wrought in us His cleansing work.
   Shrink from no sorrow, so it be purifying. Our soils and our sins lie
   so deep, they must needs be long in the refiner's fire. Pray rather
   that, if need be, you may be tried seven times, so that all may be
   clean purged out.

SERMON XVII.

  SELF-OBLATION THE TRUE IDEA OF OBEDIENCE.

    HEBREWS ix. 13, 14.

   For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
   sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how
   much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
   offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
   works to serve the living God?"

   THROUGHOUT the New Testament we are taught that bur sins are forgiven
   through the blood-shed ding of Christ; and in this epistle St. Paul
   shews to the Hebrew Christians how this great truth was shadowed forth
   in the symbolical sacrifices of the law; and how, in the self-oblation
   of Jesus Christ, the one true and only atoning sacrifice was offered up
   to God. The offerings of the law purified the flesh: the typical
   oblations put away ceremonial uncleanness. They could not cleanse the
   guilt of the conscience; they could not put away sin. For this there
   was needed some great spiritual reality--something having relation to
   the secret laws of God's eternal kingdom, to the nature of holiness and
   of sin, and to the inscrutable mystery of the will, and of our
   reasonable being. And this was offered up by Jesus Christ, "who through
   the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God."

   Now we will inquire somewhat more closely into this truth; not, indeed,
   that we are required to know how this mysterious sacrifice avails for
   our atonement. They that were healed by His word, or by touching the
   hem of His garment, or by the clay, were healed by a simple belief that
   there was virtue in Him to make them whole: what it was, and how it
   wrought, they knew not. So with the great oblation whereby our sins are
   expiated. The multitude of unlearned Christians, in all ages of the
   Church, have lived and died by faith in the blood-shedding of the Son
   of God, knowing nothing save that "the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth
   us from all sin." And the most illuminated of the saints have known
   little more of that transcendent mystery. Blessed be God, it is but a
   little learning we need have to enter into His kingdom; and that
   knowledge is rather in the will than in the understanding, and is
   rather gained by a quiet shining of the mind of Christ in a clear
   conscience than by the skill and keenness of intellectual powers. Still
   there are depths into which we may see far enough to learn great
   truths; and those not as images of the mind only, but as great laws of
   life and action. We will therefore consider further, what we are taught
   in holy writ respecting the nature of the one great sacrifice.

   St. Paul here tells us that Christ "offered up Himself." From which we
   may learn--First, that the act of offering was His own act; and next,
   that the oblation was Himself. He was both priest and sacrifice; or, in
   a word, the atoning oblation was His perfect obedience, both in life
   and in death, to the will of His Father. And this St. Paul tells us in
   the next chapter: "Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not, but a body
   hast Thou prepared me: in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin Thou
   hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the
   book it is written of me) to do Thy will, O God!" [55] From which we
   learn that the mystery of atonement began from the first act of
   humiliation, when He laid aside His glory, and was made in the likeness
   of men. It contains, therefore, His incarnation, His life of earthly
   obedience, His spiritual and bodily sufferings, His death and
   resurrection from the dead. Through out the whole of this lengthened
   course, He was ever fulfilling His own prophecy--"Lo, I come to do Thy
   will, O God!" In childhood, youth and manhood; in the acts and
   sufferings of His humanity; in all that He did for sinners, and all
   that He endured at their hands; in His baptism, fasting, and
   temptation; in His whole obedience unto death, as well as in His death
   itself,--the great mastery over sin was ever accomplishing. All these
   were so many manifestations of the perfect obedience of the will of
   Jesus Christ, and therefore so many masteries over the sin which has
   troubled the creation of God. And this is St. Paul's meaning when he
   says, "As by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to
   condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came
   upon all men unto justification of life: for as by one man's
   disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
   many be made righteous." [56]

   Now it is important to look at this mystery in its fullest breadth, to
   correct the partial, and, in so far as they are partial, the imperfect,
   views which are often taken of it. There is contained in the dominion
   of sin a fearful power of death, which could no way be overcome but by
   the dying of the Son of God; as St. Paul says--"By death He destroyed
   him that had the power of death, that is, the devil:" our redemption is
   "by means of death;" our reconciliation "in the body of His flesh
   through death:" "Christ died for the ungodly:" He "died for our sins
   according to the Scriptures." [57] What death is, by what link it is
   indissolubly bound to sin, how the death of Jesus Christ broke that
   link, we know not. We know that it did so: but we know that He
   destroyed not death only, but sin also; and the victory over sin was
   wrought through a whole life, of which His death was the consummation.
   He overcame sin by His holiness, by perfect and perpetual obedience, by
   a spotless life, by His mastery in the wilderness, by His agony in the
   garden. There was a mysterious warfare ever going on, of which the
   cross was the last act, forasmuch as He "resisted unto blood, striving
   against sin." [58] His whole life was a part of the one sacrifice
   which, through the eternal Spirit, He offered to His Father; namely,
   the reasonable and spiritual sacrifice of a crucified will. It is
   import ant to keep this in mind, lest we fail to perceive the real
   nature of sin, and its true seat and energy, and thereby lose the
   insights which are given to us into the mystery of our justification,
   and the law of our justified state.

   Let us, then, consider one or two truths which follow from what has
   been said.

   And, first; we may learn into what relation towards God the Church has
   been brought by the atonement of Christ. The whole mystical body is
   offered up to the Father, as "a kind of first-fruits of His creatures."
   [59] Whatsoever was fulfilled by the Head is partaken of by the body.
   He was an oblation, and- the Church is offered up in Him. He "loved the
   Church, and gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it
   with the washing of water by the word; that He might present it to
   Himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such
   thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish." [60] "And you,
   that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works,
   yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to
   present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in His sight." [61]
   The Church is gathered out of the world, and offered up to God: it is
   made partaker of the atonement of Christ, of the self-oblation of the
   Word made flesh. By union with Christ, the Church is so one with Him as
   to be one mystical person in body, soul, and spirit. It is in Him that
   we are beheld by the Father; being "accepted in the Beloved." Even now
   the Church is crucified, buried, raised and exalted to sit with Christ
   in heavenly places. In the same act of self-oblation He comprehended
   us, and offered us in Himself. And in this is our justification;
   namely, in our relation, as "a living sacrifice/ to God through Christ,
   for whose sake we, all fallen though we be, are accounted righteous in
   the court of heaven.

   The next truth we may learn is, the nature of the holy sacraments.
   Under one aspect they are gifts of spiritual grace from God to us;
   under an other they are acts of self-oblation on our part to God. He of
   His sovereign will bestows on us gifts which we, trusting in His
   promises, offer ourselves passively to receive. As, for instance, in
   the baptism of adults, the candidate came, and after renouncing Satan
   and his kingdom, made oblation of himself, by profession of the creed,
   to the holy Trinity. In like manner, and even more expressively, are
   children dedicated to God by the office and ministry of the Church:
   they that bear them in their arms, and lend them speech and
   understanding, express a twofold act of oblation, both on the part of
   the parents, who thereby consecrate their offspring to God, and on the
   part of the child, who, through the compassion of God, is accepted as
   if he consciously offered up himself. And so likewise, in a more
   express and visible manner, in the sacrament of the blessed eucharist;
   with the "creatures of bread and wine" we offer up "ourselves, our
   souls and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto"
   God. The whole order of the sacraments is expressive of self-oblation,
   by which we offer ourselves to God, through the atoning sacrifice of
   our unseen Head. They are the emphatic expressions and the efficient
   means of realising the great mystery of atonement in us. How
   important., is this view of the holy sacraments, every one will at once
   understand, who remembers the low and shallow views which are unhappily
   too widely spread abroad in these latter days of the Church. It is
   denied that under the Gospel there are any sacrifices. They are looked
   upon as carnal, legal, unevangelical rites, which were abrogated at the
   coming of Christ. It is said, "the Church of Christ has neither
   sacrifices nor priesthood; the Jewish sacrifices and priest hood were
   types of Christ and His oblation of Himself; He being come, and His
   oblation perfected, these types are gone, and the antitype is in
   heaven." Now here, as usual, there is a great truth only half uttered.
   The Jewish temple, priesthood, altar, and sacrifice, were shadows of
   Christ. Be it so. But St. Peter tells us that we are "a spiritual
   house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices." [62]
   "Yes," it is answered; "but that is to be understood spiritually." To
   which I reply, that spiritual things are not figures, but realities;
   that the Jewish temple, and priesthood, and altar, and sacrifices, were
   types and shadows, and unrealities, because they were not spiritual;
   and that the Church, and priesthood, and altar, and sacrifices of
   Christians, are not only types, as indeed they are, of heavenly things,
   but antitypes; not shadows, but substances; not figures, but
   realities,--for this very cause, because they are spiritual; that is,
   ordinances and acts ordained and wrought in us by the eternal Spirit,
   through whom Jesus Christ "offered Himself without spot unto God." What
   a strange inversion of God's economies,--what a going back into the
   bondage of legality and Judaism, it is, to look upon the blood of bulls
   and of goats as real sacrifices, and on the self-oblation of the Church
   in the holy eucharist, through the atonement of Christ, as no sacrifice
   at all! As if sacrifices must of necessity be not only in part, but
   altogether, material; as if theirs were any thing more than sacrifices
   in a shadow, while ours are "in spirit and in truth." Is it not very
   likely that this shallow doctrine arises, as I have suggested, from the
   partial and imperfect view commonly taken of the one great oblation?
   They that dwell chiefly on the last act of suffering in the flesh, seem
   naturally to fall into a lifeless and material conception of all
   sacrifices, whatsoever they be. They dwell on the external and material
   part only; forgetting that this is, so to speak, the out ward and
   visible sign of the oblation; a part in deed, but the body or vehicle
   of the sacrifice, which has an inward reality in the spiritual act, and
   may be called the soul of oblation. Such, for instance, is the
   sacrifice of the eucharist; for sacrifices are akin to sacraments, and
   are of a twofold nature; are partly material and partly spiritual,
   partly seen and partly unseen. And therefore the faithful in early
   times, in the very act of offering up the living sacrifice of
   themselves, saw in the bread and wine of the holy eucharist an
   expressive symbol of self-oblation, and a fulfilment of the prophet's
   words: "From the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
   same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place
   incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering." [63]

   I will now draw one or two inferences of a practical kind from what has
   been said, and then conclude.

   1. We may learn from this view of the great act of atonement, what is
   the nature of the faith by which we become partakers of it, or, in
   other words, by which we are justified. Plainly it is not a faith which
   indolently terminates in a belief that Christ died for us; or which
   intrusively assumes to itself the office of applying to its own needs
   the justifying grace of the atonement. "It is God that justifieth."
   [64] All that faith does at the outset, in man's justification, is to
   receive God's sovereign gift. By our baptism we were grafted into the
   mystical body of Christ, which is justified through His oblation of
   Himself; that is, we were accounted righteous in Him--we were
   justified. By faith we hold fast the gift which we have received; and
   justifying faith conforms us to the self-sacrifice of Christ. Therefore
   St. Paul says, "I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
   present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
   which is your reasonable service." [65] And this is the meaning of his
   words, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
   Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live
   by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me:"
   [66] and also of other like passages, where he speaks of our being made
   partakers of the cross of Christ. Justifying faith, then, is the trust
   of a willing heart, offered up in obedience to God: it is His will
   working in us, knitting us to Himself. Perhaps in no way is the danger
   of a merely speculative or passive faith more exhibited than in this
   view; and nothing is more certain than that many, who are far removed
   from antinomianism in doctrine, and even hold it in abhorrence, are in
   danger of acquiescing in a merely passive faith: such persons, I mean,
   as those whose lives are pure, but without self-denial; who are of a
   religious mind, but at peace with the world; who hold correct doctrine,
   but live lives out of all analogy with the realities of the cross. The
   faith of such persons may be called merely passive; because, while it
   fails to constrain them to acts of self-oblation, after the example of
   Christ's living sacrifice, it rests itself upon a knowledge that His
   dying on the cross was an offering in their behalf. And hence it is we
   find oftentimes the most strongly expressed reliance on the death of
   Christ in persons of a very unmortified habit of life. Men of a
   self-indulging character, who live in ease and softness, taking their
   fill of the world's good things--of its wealth, popularity, and
   honours--who love high places, and delicate society, and refined
   pleasures, are often heard to speak with a confidence and a
   self-possession of the justifying power of a faith which would seem to
   be in no way distinguishable from a knowledge that Christ died for us,
   and a self-persuasion that, by an act of their own minds, they apply
   His death to their own justification. Again; it is a dubious and
   untrusty faith, (howsoever clear be the knowledge that Christ's death
   is our atonement), which is reconcileable with an ambitious life, or
   with a joy at succeeding or being elevated in the world, or with a
   watchfulness for opportunities and occasions of advancement. It is hard
   to believe that such men are free from strong choices, and purposes
   framed according to the bias of their own will, or that they are dead
   to the world, and par takers of the self-denial of Christ. We have need
   of much misgiving, when we can bear to be followed, caressed, and
   listened to by the world from which we are redeemed. Our faith, if we
   would endure unto the end, must be stern, unyielding, and severe. It
   must bear the impress of His passion, and make us seek the signs of our
   justification in the sharper tokens of His cross.

   2. The next inference I will draw is this; we may thus learn what is
   the true point of sight from which to look at all the trials of life.
   We hear people perpetually lamenting, uttering passionate expressions
   of grief at visitations which, they say, have come on them unlocked
   for, and stunned them by their suddenness: one has lost his
   possessions, another his health, another his powers of sight or
   hearing, another "the desire of his eyes," parents, children, husbands,
   wives, friends; each sorrowing for their own, and all alike viewing
   their affliction from the narrow point of their own isolated being:
   they seem to be hostile invasions of their peace; mutilations of the
   integrity of their lot; untimely disruptions of their fondest ties, and
   the like. Much as we speak of violent deviations of nature from her
   laws, and of the mysterious agencies of devastating powers; so we talk
   of the destruction of a -fortune, the breaking up of our happiness, the
   wreck of our hopes. Now all this loose and faithless language arises
   from our not recognising the great law to which all these are to be
   referred. It is no more than this: that God is disposing of what has
   been offered up to Him in sacrifice: as, for instance, when a father or
   mother bewails the taking away of a child, have they not forgotten that
   he was not their own? Did they not offer him at the font? Did not God
   promise to receive their oblation? What has He done more than take them
   at their word? They prayed that He would make their child to be His
   "own child by adoption:" and He has not only heard, but fulfilled their
   prayer. Have they not perpetually, since that day, asked for him the
   kingdom of heaven, even as the mother of Zebedee's children came and
   besought that her two sons might sit, the one on His right hand, and
   the other on His left, in His kingdom? And, like them, they knew not
   what they asked: they were desiring a high blessing, awful in its
   height; for which, if granted, they may have to go sorrowing because
   God. has heard their prayer, and a sword has pierced through their own
   soul also. In an especial manner this seems true of the death of
   infants. They were offered up to Him, and He took them to Himself. So
   that they be His, who dare lament that He has chosen the place where
   they shall stand and minister before Him? Little, it may be, the glad
   mother thought, as she stood beside the font, what she was then doing;
   little did she fore cast what was to come, or read the meaning of her
   own acts and prayers. And so, likewise, when any true servants of
   Christ are taken away, what is it but a token of His favourable
   acceptance of their self-oblation? They have been His from baptism, and
   He has granted them a long season of tarrying in this outer court of
   His temple. But now, at length, the time is come; and when we see them
   "bow the head, and give up the ghost," is it not our slowness of heart
   that makes even our eyes also to be holden, so as not to see who is
   standing nigh, conforming them to His own great sacrifice? While they
   were with us, they were not ours, but His: they were permitted to abide
   with us, and to gladden our hearts awhile; but they were living
   sacrifices, and ever at the point of being caught up to heaven.

   And so, lastly, in all that befalls ourselves, we too are not our own,
   but His; all that we call ours is His; and when He takes it from
   us--first one loved treasure, then another, till He makes us poor, and
   naked, and solitary let us not sorrow that we are stripped of all we
   love, but rather rejoice for that God accepts us: let us not think that
   we are left here, as it were, unseasonably alone, but remember that, by
   our bereavements, we are in part translated to the world unseen. He is
   calling us away, and sending on our treasures. The great law of
   sacrifice is embracing us, and must have its perfect work. Like Him, we
   must be made "perfect through suffering." Let us pray Him, therefore,
   to shed abroad in us the mind that was in Christ; that, our will being
   crucified, we may offer up ourselves to be disposed of as He sees best,
   whether for joy or sorrow, blessing or chastisement; to be high, or
   low; to be slighted, or esteemed; to be full, or to suffer need; to
   have many friends, or to dwell in a lonely home; to be passed by, or
   called to serve Him and His kingdom in our own land, or among people of
   a strange tongue; to be, to go, to do, to suffer, even as He wills,
   even as He ordains, even as Christ endured, "who, through the Eternal
   Spirit, offered Himself without spot to God." Amen.

SERMON XVIII.

  THE SPIRITUAL CROSS.

    ST. MATTHEW xxvii. 46.

   "About the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying-, Eli,
   Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast Thou
   forsaken me?"

   I HAVE chosen these awful words, spoken in our Lord's last agony, that
   we may have, by the help of the Eternal Spirit through whom He offered
   Himself to God, a fuller and truer understanding of the depth of His
   bitter passion. The feelings of our lower nature so strongly draw us to
   dwell on the crucifixion which He suffered in the flesh, that we think
   too little of the mystery of His spiritual agony. And yet the pains He
   suffered in the body are but faint tokens of the agony He suffered in
   the soul. The torment of the fleshly crucifixion, unutterably great as
   it was, lasted for a few hours only, and for once; but His spiritual
   agony was at all times throughout His ministry on earth. He suffered
   day by day. His last sufferings in the flesh were not endured alone:
   they were shared by two men like ourselves, and their fleshly pangs
   outlasted His. But He was suffering a twofold crucifixion. His cross
   was, as it were, a sacrament of sorrows, having an outward and an
   inward anguish. Our eyes fasten on the material cross, the outward and
   earthlier, the more human portion of His sufferings: but His intenser
   agonies were all within; his keenest anguish was the spiritual cross:
   and this is what we will now for a while consider.

   In these words of the twenty-second Psalm, it is plain that He spoke of
   more than His agonising death. They were no doubt in part wrung from
   Him by the torment of His wounded body; but they have a deeper meaning.
   This forsaking was manifestly one of a more awful and oppressive kind.
   Of such a holy mystery it is hard to speak without seeming to be guilty
   of an over-boldness, which makes our thoughts sound like irreverence:
   it is a depth rather to be mused over than to be spoken of: so that
   when we hear our own thoughts aloud, they seem almost more than we
   designed to venture on.

   Let us, then, consider the nature of His spiritual cross. It was the
   being brought under all the conditions of a sinner, though Himself
   without sin. Sin tried upon Him all its powers; first to lure,
   afterwards to destroy. As, for instance:

   1. He was tempted by direct suggestions of evil. We read that He "was
   led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil."
   It was a foremost part of His warfare with the powers of spiritual
   wickedness. All before Him had sinned. Satan had won his masteries over
   all. The first man Adam, the patriarchs, prophets, and saints, all
   God's earthly servants in their day had sinned. Hitherto the prince of
   this world had triumphed, carrying all before him. But now was
   manifested one more servant of God, with whom the whole contest lay. He
   was brought into the world as the leader and prince of saints; and all
   powers of evil thronged about Him. How far the true mystery of His
   person was known, is not revealed to us: but we find the tempter
   saying, "If thou be the Son of God," plainly shewing that he knew at
   least the name of Jesus. Be this as it may, all powers of evil gathered
   upon Him, and strove with Him. He was assailed with a temptation to
   mistrust His heavenly Father, to be vainly confident of God's
   protection, to forego His own allegiance and homage for a mighty bribe.
   All these suggestions of evil were made to pass vividly before His
   spiritual consciousness; and who shall conceive the pangs of such a
   trial? The lures of sin are hateful just in the measure of the holiness
   of him that is tempted. A sinner has no distress in the worst
   solicitations of evil; even though resisted, it is not the
   solicitation, but the self-denial that grieves and galls him. A holy
   man has bitterness in his very soul at the consciousness of being
   tempted, and, in resisting, is refreshed by a sense of mastery; but the
   conception of evil in his heart is full of shame and sorrow. And so to
   the end of life; as men grow in holiness, they grow in a keen
   sensitiveness of soul which makes temptation all but intolerable. But
   with the Holy One, who can express the affliction of being the direct
   subject of temptation? To hate evil as God hates it, and to be tempted
   as man is tempted, is a humiliation and a sorrow, as of iron entering
   into the soul. Surely all the after-assaults of spiritual wickedness to
   destroy His life were as nothing, compared to the awful mystery of
   being addressed by the allurements of sin. These approaches of the
   wicked one were made to the will of the Son of God, with the design of
   withdrawing the consent of His pure soul from His heavenly Father. They
   were a thousand-fold more hateful and harrowing than the falsehood of
   His suborned accusers, or the scourging of His sinless flesh.

   2. Again; He suffered a perpetual unmingled sorrow for the sins of men.
   All the day long He was the mark of their gainsaying and contradiction.
   Every form of falsehood, unfair dealing, misinterpretation, insidious
   address, malignant slander, were heaped upon Him. All around Him He be
   held a conscious resistance of the light of truth. Very keen is the
   suffering of false construction from deaf and prejudiced hearts. We
   know little of it; but that little is enough. There is an
   unreasonableness about minds heated into opposition which nothing can
   allay; and minds otherwise not corrupt pass on into obstinate and
   sinful perversity. All this He suffered so as never man endured before.
   The lawyers stood up and questioned, tempting Him; the Pharisees and
   Herodians sought to entangle Him in his talk: others watched His words,
   that they might find wherein to accuse Him. They gave to His words such
   refined perversions of meaning, as are manifold more cutting than the
   blackest falsehood. Slander is characteristically devilish. They
   reviled Him for the works which they could not deny. "He casteth out
   devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils." "Say we not well, that
   thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?" We can conceive very little of
   this bitter sorrow; for in Him it was dashed with a far bitterer taste,
   of which we can know still less. The sorest and most hateful part of
   this contradiction was the ingratitude of man. With the full foresight
   of all He should suffer for their sakes, and the consciousness that all
   He then suffered was for their salvation, He bore at their hands all
   manner of wrong and subtilty. And to this sense of their ingratitude
   was joined a knowledge of their self-destruction. Sad and woful sight
   in the eyes of Him by whom all things were made, to see mankind, God's
   chiefest creature in this visible world, marred from its original
   holiness, "earthly, sensual, devilish." To Him the depths of this
   alienation were ever open; He saw the world of enmity against God which
   had entered the soul of man. And doubtless as He read the whole out
   line of the fall, in each sinner that reviled, or lay in wait to
   ensnare Him, so did He look on to the working out of the mystery of
   iniquity in the new creation of God. "Have I not chosen you twelve? and
   one of you is a devil." Surely the sin of Judas sat upon His heart
   before that last hour, when He said, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful,
   even unto death." He carried about with Him the daily bur den of the
   foreseen sins of His enemies and of His friends. All the awful guilt of
   His last passion, the betrayal, the false judgment, the impious
   mockery, the scourge, the cross, the self-accursing cry of God's
   apostate people, were all foretasted; and surely the forsaking of His
   Apostles, and the denial of Peter, were not veiled from His sight. And
   He that afterwards, in the isle of Patmos, unfolded before the eyes of
   St. John the stream of the world's history, and the fortunes of His
   Church in the world, daily foresaw all things that should come
   hereafter. The sin of the world, and, worse than all, the sin of His
   Church, lay heavily upon Him day by day. Shall we not believe that the
   schisms, and strife, and mutual conflict of Churches, the dying out of
   light, the darkening of truth, the growth of false traditions, the
   falling away of the latter times, and all the chequered train of these
   eighteen hundred years, were all before His sight in whom dwelt "all
   the fulness of the Godhead bodily?" Sin in all its mysteries of origin,
   and depth, and breadth, and all its masteries, even to the end of the
   world, were spread before Him who was, by peculiar title, "the Man of
   Sorrows," "the Lamb that taketh away the sin of the world." And as He
   said to the women that bewailed Him, when He was led away to Calvary,
   "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me; but weep for yourselves and
   for your children. For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they
   shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and
   the paps which never gave suck. Then shall they begin to say to the
   mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do these
   things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" [67] --so
   doubtless the destinies of His Church on earth stood like a lowering
   horizon behind the mount of crucifixion. The rents and wounds of His
   mystical body already pierced His spirit; and the false kiss which the
   world should give, to the betrayal of His Church; and the afflictions
   of His saints, and the tyranny of the strong, and the pampered
   self-pleasing of soft spirits, and the plagues of worldliness, and the
   foreseen apostacy of the latter days,--all these dwelt heavily on Him
   to whom all things to come are as things that are.

   3. And, once more; He suffered, throughout we know not how large a
   portion of His whole life, the natural fear of death and of His coming
   agony. It is strange that, while we dwell chiefly on the thought of His
   fleshly crucifixion, we so hastily pass by these natural affections of
   our manhood wherewith He was encompassed. In His lifetime we forget His
   fleshly nature in His spiritual; at His death we forget His spiritual
   in His fleshly. Now it is plain that his whole life, so far as revealed
   to us in the Gospel, was full of a sad and afflicting foresight of the
   cup which His Father should give Him: therefore He was wont to say,
   "Mine hour is not yet come;" and therefore He spoke of "the sign of the
   prophet Jonas;" and of His lifting up. The fear of death is one of the
   sinless infirmities of our manhood; and this He bare no less than
   thirst or hunger. We know with what a piercing strength the first
   glimpses of a coming sorrow shoot in upon us: how they chequer our
   whole life, and overshadow all things; how sad thoughts glance off from
   all we do, or say, or listen to; how the mind converts every thing into
   its own feeling and master-thought. Even the smallest things in life
   have great capacities of sorrow, and hold great measures of sadness. It
   is not only on the greater and more set occasions that our afflictions
   overwhelm us. Perhaps our keenest sufferings are in sudden
   recollections, remote associations, indirect hints, words, tones,
   little acts of unconscious friends. And even so it was with Him. It was
   not only when Moses and Elias, in the mount of the transfiguration,
   alloyed the brightness of His glory by speaking of "the decease which
   He should accomplish at Jerusalem," but in all the lesser events of
   life His coming agony rose up before Him. When a lowly woman anointed
   Him with ointment, He saw in it the preparations of the grave: "She
   hath anointed my body to the burying." The very spikenard had in it the
   savour of death. "Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink
   of, and to be baptised with the baptism that I am baptised with?" "I
   have a baptism to be baptised withal, and how am I straitened till it
   be accomplished!" And, as the time drew nigh, this sinless shrinking of
   our manhood from the agonies of His passion was more clearly
   manifested. He grew, if I may so speak, fuller of the thought, and
   began to teach His disciples how many things He must suffer; [68]
   foretelling every step of His last afflictions, from His betrayal to
   His cross: and when the hour was come, He was straitened with a sinless
   impatience for its accomplishment; and He bade the traitor to do his
   work with a friendly speed: "What thou doest do quickly:" and after
   wards in the garden, when He had said, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful,
   even unto death," [69] who shall venture to imagine what were His
   hidden agonies; what it was that thrice wrung from Him, even after the
   act of self-oblation, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
   from me;" what visions, it may be, of the cup and of the cross were
   held out to Him; how He wrestled, until by a direct consent, and choice
   of the will, He drank it, in foretaste, to the dregs? As yet His
   fleshly crucifixion had not begun. It was His spiritual cross; the
   sharp inward wounding of the soul, that crucified even the body before
   its time, and impressed its passion upon His earthlier nature. "His
   sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground."
   [70]

   4. And, as the chief of all His sorrows, He suffered we know not what
   darkness of soul upon the cross. True it is, that the Holy One of God,
   even when most beset by afflictions from without,, was calm and
   illuminated within. The rays of His Father's face shone secretly in
   upon Him. To Him, as to all saints of God, all the avenues of heaven
   were open. The pure lights and soft dews of His Father's kingdom were
   His continual refreshment. It was not for His own sake that He endured
   a darkness of soul; neither for His own sake did He hunger, or thirst,
   or become man, or die: so, like wise, whatsoever mysterious desolation
   of heart came upon Him, He endured as the Saviour of sinners. He was
   "made sin for us." He was made to know the wages of sin, even as
   sinners must needs know it; and desolation of soul, and the forsaking
   of the light of God's countenance, is our portion in the lot of
   sinners: and this He suffered even as He suffered the scourge and the
   crown of thorns. It may be that, as soul and body were afterwards
   separated, so the shining of His Father's face was for a time
   concealed. He learned the full misery of fallen man. Of all His passion
   we know but a little part: His "unknown sufferings" were beyond them
   all: of them we can know nothing. We can gather them only from His own
   words, few and broken, when He was passing through His hidden agonies:
   "If it be possible," and "Why hast Thou forsaken me?" But, what death
   is: what shall be after death: what, in the hour of passing, is the
   world which lies between the sinner's soul and God: to what mysterious
   nearness of conformity to the doom of a transgressor He humbled Himself
   for our redemption from death and hell, is not revealed: all this,
   whatsoever it be, He suffered: but we are speaking of what we know not.

   This, then, is a dim outline of His spiritual cross. The visible
   sufferings on Calvary were the filling up of His afflictions, and the
   symbol or revelation of His hidden agonies: and it was in these that
   the full mastery over sin was chiefly won. The body, though a partaker
   both in sin and death, is not the chief either in the transgression or
   the penalty, but the spirit of man. It was on his spiritual nature that
   God's image was stamped in the beginning; and through the power of that
   spiritual being he became a rebel against God. The soul was the seat of
   the rebellion; there it was that the powers of spiritual wickedness
   erected their dominion; and in that same region of His being, the Man
   who alone was without sin, suffered all the penalty which sin had drawn
   upon the world. In a word, what pain is to the body, sorrow is to the
   soul; and the scourge, the crown of thorns, and the cross, are, as it
   were, a parable of bitterness, anguish, and affliction.

   Now from all this we may understand what that cross is of which all
   must be partakers: not the visible material cross, but that which is
   more real than the reality of fleshly crucifixion. It is not so much by
   sufferings in the body as in the spirit, that we are likened to Him.
   The railing thief was more nearly conformed to His visible passion than
   all, save one or two, in all the multitude of saints. Yet, though
   conformed to Him in the flesh, he was not likened to Him in spirit. St.
   John and the blessed Virgin did not suffer indeed in the flesh, yet
   were they truly nailed with Him upon His cross. So in all ages of the
   Church, kings and princes, no less than bishops and pastors of His
   flock, not only in sackcloth and solitude, but in soft clothing and in
   the throng of royal courts, have borne the marks of the Lord Jesus, and
   shared the reality of His passion. Weak women too, moving in silence
   and a veil, unseen of the world, and never breathed on by its rough
   oppositions, have both carried their cross with Him, and on it hung
   beside Him. They have died with Him in will, and in sacrifice of self;
   in mortifying the choices and affections of their earthlier nature; in
   a glad forsaking of bright hopes and fair promises in life, sitting at
   His feet without distraction, and bearing withal a burden of many
   sorrows, partly the awful tokens of their Master's love, and partly
   laid upon them by the wrong and enmity of the world. Among many
   samples, let this one suffice. We read in the life of one to whom was
   meted out a death-sickness of uncommon anguish, that as she drew near
   the end, for a long season she was uncheered by the divine consolations
   which were the wonted stay of her soul. She complained in sadness to
   her spiritual guide of this strange and appalling desolation, until she
   learned to read in it the gift of a higher measure of conformity to
   Him, who in His last passion cried aloud, "My God, my God, why hast
   Thou forsaken me?" In like manner there is many a sorrow fearfully
   hidden from the world's hard gaze, many an overlooked affliction, many
   a piercing of heart by the lesser sharpnesses of our common griefs,
   which not the less, when borne in silence for God, make the mourning
   spirit to partake of His mysterious cross.

   There is one more truth that we may learn from what has been said. I
   mean, what necessity there is that all should thus be crucified with
   Him. Sin is an inward and unseen malady: though manifested in act, its
   origin and being is in the spirit. "Out of the heart proceed evil
   thoughts;" therefore its overthrow must be by an inward mastery: and
   this is to be won only by suffering the buffetings of sin, rather than
   yield to its dominion. The strife is within a man. It is by a patient
   wrestling with temptation; by a steady rule over our own temper; by a
   life of high and severe fellowship with Christ, that we must be likened
   to Him. There is no smoother, no other way of eternal life. Let this be
   a warning to all sinful and shallow Christians; to all easy, formal,
   exterior minds; and to the worldly, self-sparing, and light-hearted.
   They that have no fellowship with the Man of Sorrows have no share of
   His cross, no promise of His crown. Let this be also a consolation for
   all the blessed company of the sorrowful; for all who, with a pricked
   or broken heart, are moving upward against the stream of this visible
   world, which bears down in a heavy tide away from God. They must be
   buffeted by it, or be borne along with it. But all this is likening
   them to the Lord of sufferings, and making them partakers of His
   sorrow. In a little time all will be over. It is sharp and piercing,
   but it cleanses and purifies; it moulds and draws the spirit into the
   form of the Son of God; it puts in the sharper lines and the deeper
   colouring; it is as the shadow of His crown of thorns. Blessed are they
   that have entered into the company of mourners: life has nothing more
   for them either to hope or fear; they linger on in this visible world,
   but their true life is in the world unseen. Blessed lot! how calm, how
   even, how unmoved! all has been suffered: they are "afraid of no evil
   tidings," of no new and sudden strokes; all is known. No joy nor sorrow
   now can shake them from their rest. They are of his fellowship who
   said, "Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear in my body the
   marks of the Lord Jesus." [71]

SERMON XIX.

  THE HIDDEN POWER OF CHRIST'S PASSION.

    ST. JOHN xii. 32.

   "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."

   OUR blessed Lord here reveals the great end of all His holy passion. He
   was lifted up from the earth, nailed upon the tree, that He might draw
   all men from all nations, both Jews and Gentiles, to Himself. By His
   precious blood-shedding, He took away the sin of the world: and by the
   mighty virtues of that one great sacrifice, He has been gathering
   together again in one body the children of God who are scattered
   abroad.

   First, then, in these words He foretells the gathering out and knitting
   together of His mystical body, which is the Church. From the time of
   His ascension into heaven, and the shedding abroad of the Holy Ghost,
   He has been working unseen upon the spirits of mankind; He has been
   drawing together the living stones of His spiritual house; by the
   apostolic priesthood, by preaching, by His holy sacraments, by the
   interweaving of His providential government with the working of man's
   will, and by all the wonderful mutations of two thousand years; by the
   movements of the reason of man, and by what men call the civilisation
   of the world; by the rise and fall of empires, and the organised system
   of human polities. He has thus been working out this great
   all-comprehending aim--the perfection of His Church. First He drew a
   remnant of the Jews to the foot of His mystical cross; then to them he
   drew the Gen tiles, first proselytes, then they that before were
   "strangers from the covenants of promise:" laying thereby in all the
   world the first foundations of the Catholic Church: and then into that
   same area He drew people unknown before by name; and, as they entered
   into the holy precinct, they put off their old natures--they came in as
   conquerors, and then dwelt in it as conquered. They were taken in a
   snare, and were subdued by the power they had seemed to overthrow. And
   thenceforward in all ages of the Church, He has wrought, through the
   sacramental power of its visible polity, upon the multitude of nations,
   drawing them together into the bond of peace; drawing them up ward to
   higher movements of spiritual life; building up His temple, not only in
   the majesty of its lofty stature, but in the glory and perfection of
   its parts. There has been not a change, but a growth: as the springing
   or unfolding of a stately tree; a growth, not only of bulk, but of
   beauty; ever opening itself to the drawings and invitations of a gentle
   sky: so His mystical body has grown from childhood to youth and
   manhood, throwing out new powers of illuminated reason and of
   regenerate will, ever advancing "unto a perfect man, unto the measure
   of the stature of the fulness of Christ."

   But this subject is too large for our present thoughts; and therefore I
   will not follow any further the mysterious economy by which He, through
   His Church, draws nations to Himself, and the whole body of His people
   to perfection. We will confine our thoughts to a more particular form
   of this great work of mercy; I mean, the way in which, in His Church,
   He draws men one by one unto Himself. Christ is in the midst of His
   Church. His eye and His hand have been upon us from the hour of our
   baptism. He is ever drawing us by His unseen virtues: we are all around
   Him, some nearer, some further off; some approaching, some receding
   from Him. There is a work going on, of which the day of judgment is
   only the end and summing up. There is between those that follow and
   those that resist His drawings, a real separation even now. "His fan is
   in His hand; and He will throughly purge His floor, and gather the
   wheat into His garner, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
   fire." With those, however, that resent His gracious drawings I have
   nothing now to do. Let us speak only of those who are approaching, be
   it never so slowly and far off, the foot of the spiritual cross; and of
   these I pass by penitents, and the first and imperfect forms of a
   character under the power of its second regeneration, as repentance was
   wont to be called; because in His sight we are all penitents, and
   because the degrees of such characters are in finite, and because they
   will be ultimately included in the more general forms, of which we
   shall speak hereafter.

   He is, I say, in the midst of His Church, and we are ranged around Him
   in many measures of approach, as if we were in the many courts or
   precincts which surround His eternal throne.

   First, and farthest off, among the better kind are blameless and
   amiable people; against whom no greater charge can be laid, than that
   they are harmless unemphatic Christians; there is nothing high or deep
   about them--nothing that has any meaning below the surface of their
   life. They have no great measure of devotion, and of contemplation
   still less; they want awe and reverence, because they lack a
   consciousness of things unseen. And hence their characters are shallow
   and disappointing: they raise, and dash, your hopes of them in turn:
   they fall short both of your expectations and of their own resolutions.
   It seems as if their nature were incapable of taking a sharp and true
   impression. They mix in the world, and are highly esteemed, because
   they are amiable; but no man is awed by them; for, after all, they are
   poor characters. Now even such as these are ever drawing nearer to Him;
   but their slight retrogressions are so many, and their advance so slow,
   that it is imperceptible. By measuring together large periods of their
   life, the change may be detected: on a death-bed it is perhaps seen
   more plainly. But there is an original fault about them, in some region
   of their spiritual life; something which retards their advance, and
   ever keeps them back. Of such men it is hard to know what we shall say.

   Again; there are those who, to all that I have described, add further,
   an inward conformity in many lesser features to the mind of Christ.
   They have feeling and zeal, and are visibly and sensibly religious; so
   much so, as to bear at least a shadow of the cross for His name's sake.
   They love the meditative parts of religion, the poetry and imagery of
   faith, and the consolations of Christianity. They have, unawares, gone
   so deep into religion, that they cannot go back. They cannot do without
   it; and onward they must go. Yet they are not near enough to Him to be
   at rest. Still they are afraid of going too near, and trusting Him
   wholly. There is much in them which would be precipitated,, as it were,
   by a closer approach to Him; and they are not yet willing to forego it.
   Nevertheless, they often pray for this; and are convinced that He, and
   He only, is enough so to fill all their heart, that if they had His
   presence, they should want nothing more. Such men are good Christians,
   but hardly saints; for that word has a deeper sense than they as yet
   can bear. There are too many reserved affections, and hopes, and
   wishes, yet clinging to them. But He will not let them rest where they
   are; unless, indeed, they wilfully go back from Him. He was lifted up
   from the earth for this very cause, that He might draw them still
   onward, nearer to Himself. He loves them too well to let them linger
   afar off; and therefore we find such people ever passing on, one by
   one, often unwillingly and with half a heart, drawing near as by the
   compulsion of angels' hands, until they enter another circle of
   approach to Him. There is a higher fellowship, to which they are
   destined.

   For there are those who are the true elect; the elect of the elect; the
   Christians indeed; the chosen ones, with whom is "the white stone," and
   "the hidden manna," and "the secret of the Lord," and the "new name
   which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it." On them the voice
   of Christ fell in childhood; or in riper years, it may be in the
   threshold of life, or in after-life, under some cloud and chill of
   heart; and they heard it, and were for a long while amazed, as Samuel,
   at the thrilling sound, knowing neither who spake, nor what to answer.
   Yet it pierced their heart, and they felt it could not stop there. Why,
   they knew not: but they knew within themselves that they could never
   have peace till they had heard that voice again. They feel that they
   must hear it more closely and more clearly, and know the meaning of the
   voice. Afterwards, at strange and unlooked-for times, they have caught,
   little by little, the will of Him that spake: more, as it were, from
   the meaning of the tone, than from any articulate words. And they have
   followed Him in silence, not knowing whither, saying deeply to
   themselves, I must go on. And they have felt a change passing on them,
   as from a chill to warmth, like men coming up out of a grave into the
   noon day sun. And this mild guiding power has drawn them from faults,
   and from weaknesses, and from vain hankerings, and from the world: and
   they have begun, as it were, to live anew--more thoughtfully, but more
   happily; and they verily thought the work was done. Alas for them! the
   greatest work was yet to be begun. They were still living in
   themselves: self, with its hopes, and promises, and dreams, had still
   hold of them; but He had begun to fulfil their prayers. They had asked
   for contrition, and He sent them sorrow; they had asked for purity, and
   He sent them a thrilling anguish; they had asked to be meek, and He had
   broken their heart; they had asked to be dead to the world, and He slew
   all their living hopes; they had asked to be made like unto Him, and He
   began to make them "perfect through sufferings;" they had asked to lay
   hold of His cross, and when He reached it out to them, it wounded their
   hands; they had asked, they knew not what, nor how, but He had taken
   them at their word, and granted all their petitions. They were hardly
   willing to follow on so far, or to draw so nigh to Him. They had upon
   them an awe and a fear, as Jacob at Bethel, and as Eliphaz in the
   night-visions; or as the apostles, when they "thought that they had
   seen a spirit," and "knew not that it was Jesus." They were not ready
   to give up so much, to make so great a surrender of self, to forego so
   many things which He permits others to enjoy, which they take as a
   matter of course, almost of necessity. The change in life was too
   searching and too deep. They felt in a perplexity. If they should draw
   back, they could never be happy again; and yet they feared His
   nearness. They could almost pray Him to depart from them, or to hide
   His awfulness. They find it easier to obey Him than to suffer; to do
   than to give up; to bear the cross than to hang upon it. They have
   found His service growing year by year more blessed, but more awful;
   dearer to them, but more searching; more full of heaven, but more
   exacting. Little did they know to what they pledged themselves, when,
   in that first season of awe, they arose and followed His voice. But now
   they cannot go back; for they are too near to the unseen cross, and its
   virtues have pierced too deeply within them. Day by day they are giving
   up their old waking dreams; things they have pictured out, and acted
   over, in their imaginations and their hopes; one by one they let them
   go, with saddened but willing hearts. They feel as if they had fallen
   under some irresistible attraction, which is hurrying them into the
   world unseen: and so in truth it is; He is fulfilling to them His
   promise, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
   unto me." Their turn is come at last: that is all. Before, they had
   only heard of the mystery; now, they feel it. He has fastened on them
   His look of love, even as on Peter and on Mary; and they cannot choose
   but follow, and in following Him altogether forget both themselves and
   all their visions of life. Little by little, from time to time, by
   fleeting gleams, the mystery of His spiritual cross shines out upon
   them. They behold Him high and lifted up, and the glory which rays
   forth from the wounds of His holy passion; and as they gaze upon it,
   they adore, and are changed into His likeness; and His mind shines out
   through them, for He dwells in them. They live alone with Him, in high
   and unspeakable fellowship; willing and glad to lack what others
   over-enjoy; to be unlike all, so that they are only like to Him. Such
   were the apostles; such in all ages were they who now follow the Lamb
   whithersoever He goeth. Had they chosen for themselves, or their
   friends for them, they would have chosen otherwise. They would have
   been brighter here, but less glorious in His kingdom; they would have
   had Lot's portion, not Abraham s; would have been full of happiness and
   of anxieties, of lower blessings and heavier burdens. If they had
   halted any where; if He had taken off His hand, and let them hang back,
   as they often yearned to do, what would they not have lost; what
   forfeits in the morning of the resurrection! But He stayed them up even
   against themselves. Many a time their "foot had well nigh slipped;" but
   He in His mercy held them up. And now, even in this life, they know
   that all He did was done well; that it was good for them to stand alone
   with Him upon the mountain and in the cloud; and that not their own
   will, but His was done in them.

   This, then, is the work which He has been doing with each one of you.
   Little as you may know it, your whole life, from baptism to this day,
   is a parable of which this is the key. Even with the sinful, and the
   enemies of His cross, He has been dealing in tenderness and
   long-suffering. He has been striving to draw them to His cross, while
   they have been wrestling against Him. Fearful thought, that a man
   should be in open warfare against the will and work of Christ, baffling
   by a stubborn heart the great mystery of His passion! "Woe unto him
   that striveth with his Maker: let the potsherd strive with the potsherd
   of the earth;" [72] but woe thrice told to him that striveth with his
   Saviour: "He that falleth on this stone shall be broken; but on
   whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder." [73]

   All of you has He been drawing; and if you look back, you can see the
   links in the chain by which He has drawn you until now. A word, a
   thought, a chance, a sickness, a sorrow, a burden of sadness in the
   day-time, or a dream of the past in the night-season, alone, or in the
   throng of men, in your chamber, or at the altar, something pierced deep
   into your soul, and there abode; and you carried it about like a barbed
   arrow, which no hand could draw but the same that launched it. And then
   He has led you, little by little, with gentle steps, hiding the full
   length of the way that you must tread, lest you should start aside in
   fear, and faint for weariness. And as it has been, so it must be:
   onward you must go: He will not leave you here: there is yet in store
   for you more contrition, more devotion, more delight in Him. A few
   years hence, and you will see how true these words are. If by that time
   you have not forsaken Him, you will be nearer still, walking in
   strange, it may be solitary paths, in ways that are "called desert;"
   but knowing Him, as now you know Him not, with a fulness of knowledge,
   and a bowing of heart, and a holy self-renouncement, and a joy that you
   are altogether His. What now seems too much, shall then seem all too
   little; what too nigh, not nigh enough to His awful cross. How our
   thoughts change! A few years ago, and you would have thought your
   present state excessive and severe; you would have shrunk from it then,
   as at this time you shrink from the here after. But now you look back,
   and know that all was well. In all your past life you would not have
   one grief the less, or one joy the more. It is all well; though, when
   it happened, you knew it not. "What I do, thou knowest not now; but
   thou shalt know hereafter." Therefore shun all things which may hinder
   your approach to Him: follow His drawings with a free and willing
   heart. Though restless and perplexed at first, yield to His mysterious
   will; even as Peter, who first strove with Him, and then said, "Lord,
   not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." [74] Wait for the
   end. Men mar their whole destiny in life by prescribing to God's
   providence. They either thwart it by outrunning it, or hinder it by
   hanging back. What we are to be He has determined, and in due time will
   reveal it. Your place, your crown, your ministry, in His unseen
   kingdom, are all marked out for you. He is drawing you towards your
   everlasting portion. At that day, when He shall have brought unto Mount
   Sion the last of His redeemed flock, and every lost sheep shall "pass
   under the hand of him that telleth them;" when the mystical number
   shall be full; and all the saints of God, from Abel the righteous to
   the last that shall be quick on earth at His coming, shall be gathered
   round the Lamb that was slain, then shall we know what He is now doing
   with us under a veil and in silence. We shall no more follow Him
   unseen; but behold Him face to face.

SERMON XX.

  SUFFERING THE SCHOOL OF OBEDIENCE,

    HEBREWS v. 8.

   "Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He
   suffered."

   ALTHOUGH we are taught that the godhead and manhood were so united in
   the person of our blessed Lord as to be absolutely one, there yet
   remains unrevealed a wonderful mystery respecting the conditions of His
   human nature; as, for instance, where He said of His second coming, "Of
   that day and that hour knoweth no man; no, not the angels which are in
   heaven, neither the Son, but the Father." [75] How did He not know? How
   should any thing be hidden from "the Son of Man, which is in heaven?"
   [76] All that we can say is, that in these words He declared to us that
   the mystery of His incarnation was in some way ordered by the laws and
   conditions of our manhood. We have another example of this kind in the
   text: St. Paul here tells us that Christ Himself "learned obedience by
   the things which He suffered."

   And, first, this may be understood of the passive nature which, by
   taking upon Himself our humanity, He assumed into His divine person. As
   God He was impassible, immortal, incapable of being tempted by evil;
   infinite, and therefore unchangeable: neither growth, nor weariness,
   nor faintness, nor thirst, nor hunger, could reach the Eternal. He was
   above the conditions of a creature; but by the mystery of His
   incarnation, what things before could not reach or fasten upon His
   divine nature, were admitted to His manhood. He, therefore, took on Him
   our flesh and blood, that He might come under the dominion of suffering
   and mortality, of spiritual warfare and bodily infirmities. As He
   assumed the passive conditions of humanity, so He partook of the
   susceptibilities of its several ages. And therefore we read that "Jesus
   increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man." [77]
   And these words are no mere economy or condescension, as when we read
   of God's repenting, or awaking, or plucking His right hand out of His
   bosom; but deep mysterious realities, as plainly to be taken and
   understood as the Word being made flesh, and weeping at the grave of
   Lazarus, and being nailed upon the cross. Such was the humiliation of
   the Eternal Son. He was made man, not only to suffer, but to learn; He
   assumed the imperfections of His creatures, and "compassed" Himself
   "with infirmity;" that, as before there was nothing in Godhead which
   was not in Him, so -afterward there was nothing in manhood, sin only
   excepted, of which He did not partake. It is plain, then, that He
   "learned obedience" in the very truth of our nature, even as we learn
   it; that is, by measure and degrees, and by discipline, and in time.

   And this brings us to one more truth. There are different ways both of
   knowing and of learning. A large part of our knowledge is either
   intuitive and ideal, residing in the pure reason; or speculative, that
   is, gathered by deduction and mental inference: and this is one kind of
   knowledge, and one way of learning. Another kind is learned by what we
   call life; by experience, personal trial, entanglement with events,
   struggles in doing and suffering: and what we learn in this way, we
   know with a depth and familiarity far beyond all other knowledge; it is
   a part of our living energies and powers, and dwells in our very being.
   Not only is its stamp imprinted on us, but it so passes into us as to
   blend with our whole inner nature. We are what we have done and
   suffered. And this is what we commonly call "experience." Now, if we
   consider that the impassible Word took on Him our passible nature, we
   shall see in what sense even He "learned obedience by the things that
   He suffered." As there is a difference in kind between the knowledge we
   possess of those things which we have, and those things which we have
   not, learned by experience; so the same is true also of His perfect
   manhood; and more visibly true of the knowledge of an omniscient
   impassible Being compared with the experience of suffering humanity. It
   is a mode and kind of knowledge which could not otherwise consist with
   the perfections of the Godhead.

   He made trial, then, in a passible nature, of human suffering. He
   learned, by actual partaking of sorrow, what is the power of sin over
   mankind. Into His pure manhood the guilt of sin could no more enter
   than into His eternal Godhead: but the sinless infirmities of our
   fallen state, and its large capacities of agony, He took; and, girded
   about with them, He offered Himself to the strife of evil. He obeyed,
   in that He stood in the place of a sufferer. And in it He learned in
   very deed, by feeling and tasting, the nakedness and the bitterness of
   the fall of man. What was impossible to the Godhead, He as man endured
   in the wilderness, suffering the suggestions and solicitations of the
   Evil One; so likewise in the garden, He passed through an agony which
   cannot be uttered; there lay on Him a crushing burden of fleshly and
   spiritual woes, the like of which never man yet bare. In the betrayal,
   and in the judgment before Annas, and Caiaphas, and Herod, and Pilate,
   and by the way-side, and in the ascent of Calvary, and upon the cross,
   He learned a mystery of suffering, of pangs and agony, such as no son
   of man had ever known. Into all this the Eternal Word entered, through
   His passive nature as man. Strange words, yet most true, though so
   awful to the ear as almost to make us fear to speak them. He that
   suffered the rack of the spiritual cross, and the unutterable torments
   of bodily pain, was God. He to whom all mysteries lie open as the light
   of noon, learned, by the things which He suffered, what as God He could
   never taste. Through that life, short in days, but in sorrows above all
   measure long, through humiliation, and peril, and contempt, and cold,
   and fasting, and weariness, and thirst, and hunger, and faintness, and
   ingratitude, and contradiction of sinners, and treachery, and
   false-witness, and unjust condemnation, and buffetting, and spitting,
   and mockery, and the smiting of the reed, and the crown of thorns, and
   the vinegar and gall, and the rending cross, and the hiding of His
   Father's face,--He the Eternal, the Word of God, the everlasting Son of
   the Father, learned the mystery of suffering. What, then, was it that
   He learned? St. Paul says, obedience: that is, by trial, and
   discipline, and self-denial, He took the will of His Father for His
   own. All the assaults of the tempter, whether by allurement or by
   opposition, could not move Him from His loyalty; all the long lingering
   daily toil, and all the piercing agonies of His passion, could not
   withdraw so much as a thought of His heart from His Father's will. Even
   though He, the great and true Melchisedec, "in the days of His flesh,"
   made oblation [78] of "prayers and supplications, with strong crying
   and tears, unto Him that was able to save Him from death, and was heard
   in that He feared;" [79] yet the prayer of His heart was, "not My will,
   but Thine be done;" and He was heard, yet not so that the cup should
   pass, but that His will should yield to His Father's, and become one
   with it. This, then, He learned even as we: as He hungered like us, and
   wept like us, so, by trial and discipline, He learned to bear the
   sufferings of our nature. All through His humiliation, He was
   realising, by actual energy and patience, the pledge He gave of old:
   "Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God."

   And in thus learning obedience, He learned also to enter by sympathy
   into the sorrows of those that suffer: "We have not an high priest
   which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in
   all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin." [80] For in that
   "He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succour them
   that are tempted." [81] All divine as He was before, and therefore
   infinite in love and pity, He has yet condescended further to our
   fallen state, and interposed, between His eternal mercies and our
   imperfect being, the tender sympathy of His own crucified humanity; as
   if it were not enough that He should pity us "like as a father pitieth
   his children," but that He must feel with us in our sorrows even as one
   of ourselves. And for this cause He suffered, that He might learn to
   sympathise with those that suffer through obedience. He has made full
   trial of all; there is no posture of the afflicted soul with which He
   is not familiar; no measure of bodily or spiritual sorrow which, "in
   the days of His flesh," He endured not to the uttermost; and what He
   endured in the weakness of humanity, passed into the depths of His
   divine compassion.

   Though He was God, yet was there something still to be learned for our
   sakes; though He was a Son, yet were there deeper mysteries of
   obedience which He must needs learn through suffering. All holy even as
   man, altogether obedient to His Father's will, yet, by some law which
   governs the realities of the spiritual world, there were deep things
   lying hid in the nature of sorrow and pain, and in the energy and
   patience of the will, which were yet to be learned by warfare and by
   agony; and for this end He was made flesh, and bowed Himself to the
   cross of our humiliation; and was made not only like us, but one with
   us; so that it was our mingled and sensitive being which in Him
   suffered, and was taught and disciplined in the relation of a creature
   to his God, and of a sinner to his righteous Judge.

   Now there is one broad and obvious truth flowing from what has been
   said: namely, that suffering is the school or discipline of obedience.
   In His wisdom and power, God has laid even upon sorrow the destiny of
   fulfilling His purposes of mercy. In the beginning, sorrow was the
   wages of sin, penal and working death; by the law of Christ's
   redemption it is become a discipline of cleansing and perfection. God
   permits it still to abide in His kingdom, but He has reduced it to
   subjection. It is now changed to be a minister, not more of His
   severity than of His mercy. To the impenitent, and such as will not
   obey the truth, it is still, as ever, a dark and crushing penalty: to
   the contrite and obedient, it is as the refiner's fire, keen and
   searching, purging out the soils, and perfecting the renewal of our
   spiritual nature. It is the discipline of saints, and the safest,
   though the austerest, school of sanctity; and that because suffering,
   or, as we are wont to say, trial, turns our knowledge into reality. God
   has many ways of teaching us; and from our childhood we are ever
   learning, from parents, and teachers, and sermons, and books; from the
   holy Scriptures and the sacraments of the Church, and from the changes
   and chances of the world: all these form the habit of obedience in
   faithful minds. But a season of suffering is beyond them all. When pain
   searches into the body or the spirit, we feel as if we had awoke up to
   know that we had learned nothing really until then. There is laid upon
   us a mighty hand, from whose shadow we cannot flee. All general truths
   teem with a particular meaning, and speak to us with a piercing
   emphasis. God is come nigh to us, and is dealing with us at last, one
   by one. It is our turn now; and we feel as if we saw the tokens of His
   presence shaping themselves for a moment to our sight, and then
   withdrawing themselves again; coming and going in an awful way, as if
   to gaze upon us, and search out our very thoughts: we feel as if the
   prophet's words were in some way true of ourselves: "In the year that
   king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted
   up, and His train filled the temple." [82] Something is before the eye
   of the soul; what it is as yet we cannot clearly see: but we are
   conscious that we are brought in contact with the order of the eternal
   world; and that God has turned His hand upon us, to make us meet for
   His kingdom; that henceforward it is most likely that our trials will
   follow quickly, one upon another; and that there is no other rest in
   store for us until we put off this body, and pass into the realities of
   the world unseen. Such are the effects wrought by sorrows, sicknesses,
   bodily pains, anxieties, and the like. They seem to take away the
   imaginative and visionary parts of our life, and to turn it into a
   severe and impressive reality: they make all our past life appear as a
   mere day-dream, as if we had never been in earnest till now. We have
   heard of submission, and resignation, and giving up of our own will;
   but it has been as yet little more than hearsay. At last we find these
   things required at our hands. We must give more than words now: God is
   exacting realities. And then there comes down upon the mind, as it
   were, a full stream of words and sayings, which we have heard or read
   in time past, and only half understood, and well nigh forgotten. They
   have lain pent up in the hidden recesses of our memory, not altogether
   forgotten, and yet hardly remembered: like dormant truths, which lie in
   the reason of children, ready to start into vivid life when wisely
   touched, and yet sometimes never elicited, and therefore never known;
   so the things which we understand not when we first hear or read, rise
   up as lights "in the day of visitation;" half-truths unfold their full
   outline; scattered truths draw together into an expressive context; and
   we seem to hear a voice saying, "Why would you not understand this
   before? Why make all this necessary? It is not spoken out more plainly
   now than it was years ago; but you would not understand." Equally true
   this is, also, of all bright and blessed truths: they also are
   quickened with a living energy. The promises of heaven, and the times
   of refreshing, and the rest of the saints, and the love of God, and the
   presence of Christ, which we have so long thought of, and talked about,
   and felt after, and yet never seemed to grasp,--all these likewise
   become realities. They seem to gather round us, and shed sensible
   influences of peace upon our suffering hearts: and this is what we mean
   when we say, "I have long known these things to be true, but now I feel
   them to be true." As Job, after his trial, said, "I have heard of Thee
   by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth Thee." He had learned
   obedience through suffering.

   And, in the next place, sufferings so put our faith on trial as to
   strengthen and confirm it. They develop what was lying hid in us,
   unknown even to ourselves. And therefore we often see persons, who have
   shewn no very great tokens of high devotion, come out, under the
   pressure of trials, into a most elevated bearing. This is especially
   true of sickness and affliction. Not only are persons of a holy life
   made to shine with a more radiant brightness, but common Christians, of
   no note or visibleness, are changed to a saintly character. They
   wrestle with their trial, as the patriarch with his unknown companion,
   and will not let it go without a blessing; and thereby the gifts which
   lie enwrapped in a regenerate nature are unfolded into life and energy.
   Perhaps almost every one is able, in looking back on his life past, to
   fix on the seasons which gave his character some new and determinate
   cast. He can look back, perhaps, and say, "Until such a time I lived
   without real thoughts of God; and then such a sickness gave my mind a
   startling check; and after that I lived inconsistently, between right
   conviction and unamended habits, until such an anxiety spurred me to
   take a decided line; but even then I had only selfish thoughts for my
   own salvation, without care for others, until another trial came; and
   then, too, I remember that, for a long time, I had only the active and
   exciting parts of obedience, I had none of the passive features of
   faith, no meekness nor patience under wrong or slights, nor willingness
   to be overlooked and forgotten, and to die to the world, until a great
   sorrow came, and changed the whole current of my will. There have been
   stages and resting places in my course; and I have moved at an uneven
   pace, sometimes faster and sometimes slower, according, as I see now,
   to the trials which came upon me; and all the deeper and more decided
   changes of my character are dated from the heavier and sharper
   visitations of suffering. How little did I once know of what I see now
   with a clear insight! What I used hardly to reason out, is now an
   intuition. Had I been left to myself, I should have known none of these
   things. They would have continued to be as shadowy and unreal as they
   were in childhood, and all my character would have been straitened and
   stunted. I have been almost passive, while He has been working out His
   will in me: He has chosen, and gone before me, and guided me by the rod
   of His chastisement. Little as I know even now, yet all I know I have
   been taught by trials: I have learned obedience by the things which I
   have suffered." Now, I say, perhaps every man will be able to trace out
   a coincidence between these words and some part at least of his past
   life; and what does this shew, but the fact that God has been teaching
   him through the discipline of trials; making him to realise his
   knowledge, and unfolding his character into form and energy?

   Once more: nothing so likens us to the example of Christ as suffering.
   It seems to be an inevitable law, arising out of the fall of the old,
   and the perfecting of the new creation--first, that the second Adam
   should be a "Man of sorrows;" and next, that we should be conformed to
   Him in this aspect of His perfection: "it became Him for whom are all
   things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory,
   to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
   [83] And it is not more in relation to sanctity than to sufferings,
   that St. Paul says that we were predestinated "to be conformed to the
   image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren."
   [84] And therefore, in another place, he asks, "What son is he whom the
   father chasteneth not?" and argues that to be free from chastisement is
   an awful exemption, rather to be feared than coveted, as clouding the
   bright, though keen tokens of sonship, which are seen in those that
   suffer. There is a breadth and universality in this reasoning, which
   seems to force upon us the conviction, that no true member of His body
   who was made perfect through sufferings, shall pass out of life without
   at some time drinking of the cup that He drank of, and being baptised
   with the baptism that He was baptised with. And, indeed, if we look
   into the lives of His saints, we shall see that this is simply true.
   All that suffer are not therefore saints; alas! far from it, for many
   surfer with out the fruits of sanctity; but all saints at some time,
   and in some way and measure, have entered into the mystery of
   suffering. And this throws light on a very perplexing thought in which
   we sometimes entangle ourselves: I mean, on the wonderful fact that
   oftentimes the same persons are as visibly marked by sorrows as by
   sanctity. We often see the holiest of Christ's servants afflicted with
   a depth and multiplication of sufferings beyond other men. They seem
   never to pass out of the shadow of affliction; no sooner is one gone
   off than another has come up; "the clouds return after the rain;"
   sorrow gathers into sorrow; sickness gives way before sickness; fears
   are thrust out by fears; anxieties are only lost in anxieties; they
   seem to be a mark for all the storms and arrows of adversity; the world
   esteems them to be "stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted;" even
   religious people are perplexed at their trials. When we see eminently
   holy persons suddenly bereaved, or suffering sharp bodily anguish, and
   their trials long drawn out, or multiplied by succession, we often say,
   How strange and dark is this dispensation! who would have thought that
   one so pure, so patient, and resigned, should have been so visited and
   overwhelmed by strokes? If they had been slack, or lukewarm, or
   backward, or self-willed, or entangled in worldly affections, we could
   better read the meaning of this mysterious trial; but who more earnest
   and useful in all good works; who so advanced in holiness, so near to
   the kingdom of heaven, as they?--And yet all this shews how shallow and
   blind our faith is; for we know little even of those we know best; we
   readily overrate their character; at all events, they are far otherwise
   in the esteem of God than in our judgment: our thoughts are not His
   thoughts; we set up a poor, dim, depressed standard of perfection; and
   we should miserably defraud even those we love most, if it were in our
   power to mete out their trials by our measures: we little know what God
   is doing, and how can we know the way? and we often think that the
   sorrows of the saints are sent for their punishment, when they are sent
   for their perfection. Either way we are greatly ignorant. They may need
   far more of purification than we think; they may be suffering for an
   end higher than purification; for some end which includes purification,
   and unknown mysteries besides. We forget that Christ suffered, and why;
   and how He learned obedience, and what that obedience was. He was
   all-pure; suffering could find no more to cleanse than sin could find
   to fasten upon. The prince of this world "had nothing" in Him; yet
   whose-sorrow was like unto His sorrow, "wherewith the Lord afflicted"
   Him "in the day of His fierce anger?" and that, great as the mystery
   must ever be, not only and altogether as a vicarious suffering, but
   that in the truth of our manhood He might learn "obedience by the
   things that He suffered." He was made "perfect" by sufferings; and that
   "perfection," whatsoever it be, has an ineffable depth of meaning. It
   was not only a sacerdotal perfection by consecration to the priesthood
   of Melchisedec, but something of which that was the formal expression
   and manifestation; a great spiritual reality, a perfection of holiness,
   knowledge, obedience, will, and sympathy; this was the perfection in
   truth and spirit of "the one Mediator between God and man, the man
   Christ Jesus." And of this perfection, after the measures of a
   creature, and the proportions of our mere manhood, are the saints made
   to partake; they are purified, that they may be made perfect. And
   therefore the sorrows of the holiest minds are the nearest approaches
   to the mind of Christ, and are full of a meaning which is dark to us
   only from its exceeding brightness. Our weak faith, which can read the
   earthlier teaching of affliction, goes blind when it follows the
   mystery of sorrow upward to the perfection of Christ. We know not what
   things they learn,--things which it is riot lawful for a man to utter;
   and therefore their words are often to our ears incoherent, and we are
   ready to say, "What is this that he saith? . . . we cannot tell what he
   saith." It may be, that suffering plants the mind of man at a point of
   sight in the spiritual world, from which things altogether hidden from
   us who stand by and see his afflictions, and until then even from
   himself, become visible; such, for instance, as the nature of evil, of
   temptation, of disobedience, of the fall of man, of our birth-sin, of
   death, of the striving of the Holy Ghost with the unholy in the
   mystical body of Christ, of responsibility, and of a crucified will:
   such also, as the counterpart of these realities, the nature of
   regeneration, and of Christ's presence in the Church and holy
   sacraments and in the heart of the faithful, and the beauty of
   holiness, the resurrection of the body, the bliss of heaven, and the
   like. Now it must be remembered, that all these things we know from
   childhood; but suffering may be the necessary condition to our feeling
   them. If we would learn these things, it may be, we have need to be
   made like to our Lord, not only in His purity, but in His passion; for
   they are learned not so much by being presented to our minds, as by the
   posture of the will, and the attitude of the spiritual being, wrought
   through the discipline of suffering. We must be changed, before even
   what we see will be seen, or what we know will be known, aright. And,
   it may be, that anguish of soul, or pain of body, is that which alone
   can transfigure our inward being. And this throws light upon the whole
   subject of fasting, and self-affliction, and of the ascetic life, which
   are but lesser forms of the discipline of sorrow: but of this we cannot
   now speak. I will only add, that if we ponder on the incomprehensible
   nature of pain, mental and bodily; of its invisibleness, its vividness,
   its exceeding sharpness and penetrating omnipresence in our whole
   being, of its inscrutable origin, and the in dissoluble link which
   binds it to sin; and, lastly, of its mysterious relation to the passion
   and perfection of our Lord,--we shall see reason to believe that a
   power so near and awful has many energies, and fulfils many designs in
   God's kingdom secret from us.

   And therefore, when we look at the sufferings of pure and holy minds,
   let us rather stand in awe, as being called to behold, as it were, a
   shadow of our Redeemer's sorrows. The holier they are that suffer, the
   higher is the end for which they are afflicted. It may be, they are
   learning inscrutable things of the same order with those which the
   apostle saw in ecstacy. Even with bleeding hearts and deep-drawn
   prayers for their consolation, let us try to believe that God is
   endowing them with surpassing tokens of love, and with pledges of
   exceeding glory.

   And for ourselves, let us be sure, when we suffer, that for
   chastisement and for purification we need more a thousand-fold than all
   He lays upon us. The heaviest and the sharpest of our sorrows is only
   just enough to heal us: "He doth not willingly afflict." If any thing
   short of our present trial would have wrought His purpose of love to
   us, He would have sent the lighter, and kept back the heavier; He would
   have drawn over our hearts a smooth rod of warning, and not a sharp
   edge of correction. But nothing short of what we have would do; any
   thing less, perhaps, would have been a shadow of eternal misery, woe
   without repentance. Let us remember, too, that sufferings do not
   sanctify: they are only the sea sons of sanctification; their end will
   be for good or ill, as we bear and as we use them; they are no more
   than times of invitation to diligent toil, like the softness of the
   earth after a keen and penetrating shower. They hold in check, for a
   time, our spiritual faults, and prepare our hearts to receive and to
   retain deeper and sharper impressions of the likeness of our Lord. Let
   us count them precious, blessed seasons, though dim and over cast;
   seasons of promise and of springing freshness; tokens of His nearness
   and purpose to cleanse us for His own. "Blessed are ye that weep now."
   He that is greatly tried, if he be learning obedience, is not far from
   the kingdom of God. Our heavenly Father is perfecting the work He began
   in holy baptism; laying in the last touches with His wise and gentle
   hand. He that perfected His own Son through sufferings, has brought
   many sons to glory by the same rough road, even by the "way that is
   desert." He is now bringing you home to Himself. Do not shrink because
   the path is broken and solitary, for the way is short, and the end is
   blessed.

SERMON XXI.

  THE SLEEP OF THE FAITHFUL DEPARTED.

    1 THESS. iv. 13, 14.

   "I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which
   are asleep, that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope. For
   if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which
   sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him."

   ONE great miracle in the new creation of God is this, that death is
   changed to sleep; and therefore in the writings of the New Testament we
   do not read of the "death" of the saints. "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth;
   but I go that I may awake him out of sleep." [85] The "bodies of saints
   which slept arose." [86] "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
   changed." [87] "David, after he had served his own generation by the
   will of God, fell on sleep;" [88] even in the pelting of the bloody
   storm, the holy Stephen "fell asleep." [89] And therefore St. Paul in
   the text speaks of the saints unseen as of those that "sleep in Jesus;"
   and Christians were wont to call their burial-grounds cemeteries, or
   sleeping-places, where they laid up their beloved ones to sleep on and
   take their rest. Let us, therefore, see why we should thus speak of
   those whom we call the dead.

   First, it is because we know that they shall awake up again. What sleep
   is to waking, death is to the resurrection. It is only a prelude, a
   transitory state, ushering in a mighter power of life; therefore death
   is called sleep, to shew that it has a fixed end coming. Much as the
   heathen felt after this, and mused, and boded, yet, after all, death
   and the world of the dead was to them a dreary night. They saw men
   going down into the dust, but they saw none come back again: they had
   heard no whispers of the resurrection of the body. If the disembodied
   spirit should live on, that was all they could attain unto; but even
   this was clouded and dim. And their poets were wont to bewail the
   fleetingness of life, and the unknown condition of the dead. They were
   wont to say: "Alas, alas, the mallows and the fresh herbs of the field,
   when they die, return again to life, and spring another year; but we,
   the great, the mighty, the wise, when once we die, and are laid in the
   hollow earth, we sleep a long, an endless, and unbroken sleep!" Even
   the Jews but dimly saw the coming shadows of the resurrection. Death
   was too high, too mighty, and too absolute; they saw and felt his
   dominion. Of his overthrow they had both promise and prophecy; but as
   yet he seemed too tyrannously strong to pass away into a transitory
   sleep. It was for the Gospel to reveal this mystery by the miracle of
   Christ's resurrection. It was revealed in act; and now death is
   destroyed. It is a kindly soothing rest to the wearied and world-worn
   spirit; and there is a fixed end to its duration. There is a waking
   nigh at hand; so that the grave is little more than the longest night's
   sleep in the life of an undying soul.

   Again; death is changed to sleep, because they whom men call dead do
   really live unto God. They were dead while they lived this dying life
   on earth, and dead when they were in the last avenues of death. But
   after they had once died, death had no more dominion: they escaped as a
   "bird out of the snare of the fowler; the snare" was "broken," and they
   were delivered. It may sound strange to unbelieving ears to say, that
   we are dead while we live, and alive when we die. But so it is. Life
   does not hang on matter, nor on the organisation of matter. It is not
   as the harmony which rings out of a cunning instrument; but it is a
   breath, a spirit, a ray of the eternal being, pure, immaterial, above
   all grosser compounds, simple and indissoluble. In the body it is
   allayed and tempered with weakness, shrouded about with obstructions;
   its faculties pent up by a bounded organisation, and its energies
   repressed by "the body of this death." It is life subjected to the
   conditions of mortality. But, once dead, once dissolved, and the
   unclothed spirit is beyond the affections of decay. There is no
   weakness, nor weariness, nor wasting away, nor wandering of the
   burdened spirit; it is disenthralled, and lives its own life, unmingled
   and buoyant. When the coil of this body is loosed, death has done all,
   and his power is spent: thenceforth and for ever the sleeping soul
   lives mightily unto God.

   And, once more; those whom the world calls dead are sleeping, because
   they are taking their rest. "I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
   me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.
   Even so, saith the Spirit; for they rest from their labours." Not as
   the heretics of old vainly and coldly dreamed, as if they slept without
   thought or stir of consciousness from the hour of death to the morning
   of the resurrection. Their rest is not the rest of a stone, cold and
   lifeless; but of wearied humanity. They rest from their labours; they
   have no more persecution, nor stoning, nor scourging, nor crucifying;
   no more martyrdoms by fire, or the wheel, or barbed shafts; they have
   no more false-witness, nor cut ting tongues; no more bitterness of
   heart, nor iron entering into the soul; no more burdens of wrong, nor
   amazement, nor perplexity. Never again shall they weep for unkindness,
   and disappointment, and withered hopes, and desolation of heart. All is
   over now: they have passed under the share. The ploughers ploughed upon
   their back, and made long furrows; but it is all over, never to begin
   again. They rest, too, from the weight of "the body of our
   humiliation"--from its sufferings and pains. Their last sickness is
   over. They shall never again bear the tokens of coming dissolution: no
   more the hollow eye, and the sharp lines of distress, and the hues of
   fading loveliness. Now is their weariness changed into refreshment;
   their weakness into excellence of strength; their wasting into a spirit
   ever new; their broken words into the perfection of praise; their
   weeping into a chant of bliss. And not only so, but they rest also from
   their warfare against sin, against all its strength, and subtilties,
   and snares. Satan can tempt no more, the world cannot lure, self cannot
   betray: they have wrestled out the strife with the unseen powers of the
   wicked one, and they have won the mastery: there is no more inward
   struggle, no sliding back again, no swerving aside, no danger of
   falling: they have gained the shore of eternal peace. Above all, they
   rest from the bufferings of evil in themselves. It is not persecution,
   nor oppression, nor the rage of Satan, nor the thronging assaults of
   temptation, that so afflict a holy man, as the consciousness that evil
   dwells in his own inmost soul. It is the clinging power of spiritual
   evil that sullies his whole being: it seems to run through him in every
   part; it cleaves to every movement of his life; his living powers are
   burdened and biassed by its grasp. Evil tempers in sudden flashes,
   unholy thoughts shooting across the soul, and kindling fires in the
   imagination, thoughts of self in holiest seasons, consciousness of self
   in holiest acts, indevoutness of spirit, earthliness of heart, dull
   musing heaviness in the life of God,--all these burden even the highest
   saint with an oppressive weight. He feels always the stretch and
   tension of his spiritual frame, as a man that is weary and breathless
   grappling with a foe whom, if he would live, he must hold powerless to
   the earth. But from all this, too, they rest. The sin that dwelt in
   them died, when through death they began to live. The unimpeded soul
   puts forth its new-born life, as a tree in a kindly soil invited by a
   gentle sky: all that checked it is passed away; all that draws it into
   ripeness bathes it with fostering power. Then, at last, shall the bride
   hear the Bridegroom's voice: "Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come
   away; for, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone." [90] The
   Refiner shall perfect His work upon them, cleansing them seven-fold,
   even as gold seven times tried; and all the taint and bias of their
   spiritual being shall be detached and corrected; till, by direct and
   intense vision,--not as now in a glass darkly, but then face to
   face,--they shall become pure even as He is pure. Hidden as is the
   condition of their sleep, may we not believe that they remember us? How
   much of all that they were must they forfeit, if they lose both memory
   and love! Shall we think that we can remember Bethel, and Gibeon, and
   the Valley of Ajalon, and Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives; but that
   Jacob, and Joshua, and David, and the beloved disciple, remember them
   not? Or shall the lifeless dust that their feet stood upon be
   remembered, and the living spirits, who there dwelt with them, be clean
   forgotten? Surely we may believe that they who live unto God, live in
   the unfolded sameness of personal identity, replenished with charity,
   and filled with a holy light; reaching backward in spirit into this
   world of warfare, and onward in blissful expectation to the day of
   Christ's coming: and in that holy waiting adore, as the brightness of
   paradise ever waxes unto the perfect day, when the noontide of God's
   kingdom "shall be as the light of seven days," and shall stand for ever
   in a meridian splendour. He hath made His rest to be "glorious;" and
   there is He gathering in His jewels. There is the multitude of saints,
   waiting and worshipping: Abel is there, and Isaiah, and Rachel who
   would not be comforted, and the sonless widow, and Mary Magdalene, and
   all martyrs, and all the holy ones of God. They wore out with patience
   the years of this toilsome life; and they are resting now. They "sleep
   in Jesus." Theirs is a bliss only less perfect than the glory of His
   kingdom when the new creation shall be accomplished.

   For these reasons, then, death is changed to sleep: so that it becomes
   a pledge of rest, and a prophecy of the resurrection.

   And now consider shortly a few thoughts which follow from what has been
   said.

   And, first; we ought to mourn rather for the living than for the dead.
   For these six thousand years the whole earth has been full of wailing
   for the dead. And it was well for the heathen man, when he beheld the
   body of death, to bewail in passionate complaint the change and decay
   of his beloved ones. But not for us, who dwell in the new creation. If
   we needs must weep, then let us not weep for the dead, for they are at
   rest; but let us weep for the living, for they have yet to die,--and
   death is terrible. For, after all, death is a strange and awful thing,
   alien from a living spirit. It is a thing of fear; full of confused
   throes, and perturbations, and of shadows cast from the powers of evil.
   The dissolving of the bands of the flesh is a dark and fearful change,
   against which nature struggles, and in struggling suffers agony. And
   the passing of the soul is awful even to the saints. Who can so much as
   imagine the faintest thought of that fearful going forth of the
   houseless spirit into the wide world unseen; or of the first sights and
   sounds which shall throng upon its vivid consciousness? What are all
   the terrors of the night-season compared with that hour of fear? "In
   thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
   fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
   Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: it
   stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was
   before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, Shall
   mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his
   Maker?" But what is this to the passing of the soul into the piercing
   eyesight of our Judge? Wherefore let no man weep for the dead: that
   awful change for them is over. For this end we came into the world.
   They have fulfilled their task; ours tarrieth. Almost we are ready to
   say, Would it were over!--O fearful death! It has a lure which thrills
   in all my soul, and seems to draw me to itself; it fixes me by the
   fascination of its eye. Death is coming- towards me. I must one day
   die, and "how am I straitened till it be accomplished!" Blessed and
   happy dead! great and mighty dead! In them the work of the new creation
   is well nigh accomplished. What feebly stirs in us, in them is well
   nigh full. They have passed within the veil, and there remaineth only
   one more change for them--a change full of a foreseen, fore tasted
   bliss. How calm, how pure, how sainted, are they now! A few short years
   ago, and they were almost as weak and poor as we: burdened with the
   dying body we now bear about; harassed by temptations, often overcome,
   weeping in bitterness of soul, struggling, with faithful though fearful
   hearts, towards that dark shadow from which they shrank as we shrink
   now.

   And, lastly: in very truth, it is life, rather than death, that we
   ought to fear. For life, and all that it contains,--thought, and
   speech, and deed, and will,--is a deeper and more awful mystery. In
   life is the warfare of good and ill; in life is the "hour and the power
   of darkness," the lures and the assaults of the wicked one. Here is no
   rest, no shelter, no safety. What a charge, what a stewardship, is this
   little fleeting, squandered life of man! In every hour of it we are
   changing for good or ill; ever growing better or worse, nearer or
   farther from God, nearer to heaven or to hell. Surely, life, with all
   its powers, capacities, probation, and responsibility, is a thing to
   tremble at. And yet we are in the midst of it; and the world is moving
   on around us, and we are caught and drawn along in its movements, and
   all our life is gathering itself up for one great cast; and few men
   know for what. Their life is lived for them. Powers from without shape
   their character and fix their doom, and they are dragged along in a
   bond age of custom, which their fearless trifling with life has made to
   be irresistible. And who shall not fear the changes and chances of this
   mortal life? Who, even the most resolved? Between this hour and the
   hour of death, who can foresee what may befall us? what unknown
   swervings, what stumblings, what falls? Who shall promise himself the
   gift of perseverance? Who can but fear his own heart's treachery? Who
   but tremble at the awful words uttered by the Church as often as she
   buries her dead out of her sight--words not less of warning than of
   prayer, words of depth unutterable: "O holy and most merciful Saviour,
   suffer us not at our last hour for any pains of death to fall from
   Thee." Wherefore let us fear life, and we shall not be afraid to die.
   For in the new creation of God death walks harmless. Christ hath
   plucked out the sting; and "the sucking child shall play on the hole of
   the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's
   den." All is healed by Him who hath given His own flesh "for the life
   of the world." Therefore, when at last it comes nigh, we shall behold
   its darkness pierced every way by rays of a living light, and the gloom
   of its dread presence softened with the radiance of eternal peace. Even
   though our last passage be fearful to the flesh, though we be called to
   follow through the fire of a bodily anguish, still in the midst of all,
   and with we know not as yet what gracious visitations to allay our
   closing struggle,--even as they had of old, who bare witness from the
   torture and the flame,--we shall fall asleep. Let us therefore be much
   in thought with them that are at rest. They await our coming; for
   without us they shall "not be made perfect." Let us therefore remember,
   and love, and follow them; that when our last change is over, we, with
   them, may "sleep in Jesus."

SERMON XXII.

  THE COMMEMORATION OF THE FAITHFUL DEPARTED.

    1 COR. xv. 51.

   "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed."

   IT is plain from the writings of St. Paul, that even the apostles of
   our Lord did not know but that their Master's coming might be in their
   own life time. He had, for the secret ends of His divine wisdom, left
   the day of His return unknown, that they might never give over
   watching. With them the strange thing was, not that He should be so
   near at hand, but that He should tarry so long. But time ran on. Some
   were called away from their earthly vigil: they began one by one to
   fall asleep: they whose eyes were dim with age, and the martyrs who
   were early bid to follow their Lord unseen: and as the time still
   lingered, and the storm fell upon the Church, the visible fellowship of
   saints grew thin, and apostles, evangelists, bishops, and holy
   brethren, fell asleep one by one. But the Church neither forgot them,
   nor deemed that they were severed from her fellowship. The communion of
   saints was a part of their baptismal faith; and though hid from her
   eyes, she knew they were nigh in spirit. And she fostered them in
   memory, and wrote their names in her book; and whensoever the saints,
   that were still left on earth to watch for the Lord, met together in
   the communion of the holy eucharist, she read aloud their names, as
   bidding them to their wonted place in her choir. She commemorated them
   with thanksgivings, and commended them to God's keeping as her precious
   treasures.

   Now this was done, first of all, out of love to them and to their
   image. She fondly cherished every remembrance of their words and deeds,
   of their gentleness and purity: she rejoiced over them with a sorrowful
   gladness, as a mother musing over departed children: she could no
   longer behold them, and break bread with them; but she could prolong
   their presence by the vivid recollection of their beloved image, and by
   the consciousness of an united adoration: she knew that while she
   tarried praying without, they were but within the precinct of an inner
   court, nearer to the eternal throne.

   And next, she commemorated them in faith, to keep up the conscious
   unity of the Church. They were not severed, but only out of sight. The
   communion of saints was still one. Nothing was changed but the visible
   relations of an earthly life: all the unseen relations of love and fond
   attachment still remained, nay, were knit more closely; for they that
   were yet watching had an intenser love, softened and purified by
   sorrow; and they that slept were filled with the love of God. The unity
   of the saints on earth with the Church unseen is the closest bond of
   all. Hell has no power over it; sin cannot blight it; schism cannot
   rend it; death itself can but knit it more strongly. Nothing was
   changed but the relation of sight; like as when the head of a
   far-stretching procession, winding through a broken hollow land, hides
   itself in some bending vale: it is still all one; all advancing
   together; they that are farthest on ward in the way are conscious of
   their lengthened following; they that linger with the last are drawn
   forward, as it were, by the attraction of the advancing multitude. Even
   so they knew themselves to be ever moving on; they were ever pressing
   on beyond the bounds of this material world. They knew the life of the
   Church to be one, and indivisible; that seen or unseen, there was but
   one energy of spiritual being, in which all were united; that all were
   nourished by the same hidden manna, and slaked their thirst in the same
   waters of life. They were one in the personality of Christ's mystical
   body; and all their acts of love and adoration were shared in full by
   each several member.

   Again; they commemorated their sleeping brethren in faith, that they
   might give God the glory of their salvation from this evil world. They
   ceased not to render the sacrifice of thanks to Him for His
   accomplished mercy in forgiving them their many sins. They remembered
   what they had been at the first; how from blind Judaism, or blinder
   heathenism, or a proud philosophy, or from a sensual life, God had
   translated them "into the kingdom of His dear Son;" how He had made
   them new creatures. They did not forget John Baptist, and the
   ever-blessed Virgin, and John the beloved disciple, and Mary Magdalene,
   and Saul the persecutor, and those vessels of grace in whom was
   reflected the fulness of God's pardoning mercy. In the commemoration of
   the saints, they shewed forth the manifold grace of Christ, and the
   manifold fruits of His mysterious passion; and thus, while they
   lovingly cherished their memories, they also, and above all, glorified
   the King of Saints. But they had also another design in this act of
   commemoration; namely, to stir up the faithful in their warfare by the
   deeds of the saints in rest. Well did they know that nothing preaches
   like example. The day was not come when men should undertake by words
   and lifeless signs alone to win souls for Christ. They knew that words
   are as weak as deeds are almighty; that Moses was slow of tongue, and
   that some deemed even the speech of Paul contemptible; that deeds carry
   all before them. Therefore they unrolled, year after year, and feast
   after feast, the catalogue of saints, and read aloud their warfare and
   their victory; thereby to embolden with a holy daring the Church
   militant on earth; to put a new heart and a new life into the weary and
   the wavering; to shew what is possible, what is easy, for regenerate
   man to do; to provoke us to a manlier faith by desire for a crown like
   theirs, and by shame at a life like our own.

   I have now stated generally the intention of the Church in keeping up
   the memory of her sleeping members. It arose naturally, and by the
   unconscious promptings of love and faith. The perpetual commemoration
   of the saints fulfilled, even in the ages of the most enkindled charity
   and of the keenest faith, high and significant offices in the witness
   of the Church. But most of all is it of moment now, in days when faith
   is faint, and the love of many hath waxed cold. We will, then, consider
   awhile, of what especial moment is this affectionate commemoration in
   feasts and eucharists to the Church of these latter times.

   And, first of all, it is a witness against what I may call the
   Sadduceeism of Christianity. It is strange enough that faith and love
   should have waxed so chill and dead among the Jews of old, that any
   should have arisen to deny the resurrection, and the very being of
   angels and of spirits; but stranger far -that Christians should be sunk
   so low in cold, unfeeling torpor, as to live forgetful of the world
   unseen. Alas, how awful is the chastisement which follows on irreverent
   handling of holy things! Our forefathers too boldly ventured in within
   the veil, and troubled the sleep of the saints with importunate
   invocations; and thrust upon the followers of Him, who sought to hide
   Himself when men would have come to make Him a king, offices and
   dignities in God's kingdom, of which the prerogative is God's only. And
   from their first bold step they passed on to a prying curiosity into
   the secrets of God's hidden world; and must needs mete out the measures
   and conditions of the holy and unholy dead, and leave little known to
   God alone, but know all things, even beyond His revelations, and before
   His time: and in the realms of the unseen they grew bewildered, and
   thought they saw horrible phantoms, which mocked them into a belief of
   their own fevered imaginations. And on these they built up a lying
   doctrine, and beguiled men by a still more lying practice, and turned
   the unseen world into a fable, and the commemoration of the saints into
   a snare. And from this, by a not unnatural recoil, what they
   over-fondly doated on, we have coldly forgotten. The superstition of
   ages past has recoiled into the Sadduceeism of to-day. I am not
   speaking of free-thinkers, but of good and earnest people. They so
   overlook the time between death and resurrection, as virtually to shut
   it out of their belief: they make it almost a test of sound doctrine to
   leave out all teaching of the unseen state. With the entire book of the
   Apocalypse before their eyes, of which (except the last two chapters)
   the whole relates to the lifetime of this visible world, and the
   parallel state of waiting and adoration in the world invisible, they
   think a cold reserve the surest token of illuminated faith. Not,
   indeed, when sorrow breaks upon them, and loved ones pass into the
   paradise of God: then nature, and truth, and love, are too strong for
   them: and the instincts and affections of their new-born hearts, long
   pent up in a forced and unnatural constraint, come down in full tide
   upon them, and carry them over the narrow barriers of their
   unsympathising theology. A riven heart is the best expositor of God's
   teaching about the saints asleep. Few have ever sorrowed, and missed
   learning mysteries of consolation. Sometimes, alas, this is not so. The
   habitual unconsciousness of an unseen world, in which even good men
   have been content to live, so insensibly deadens the quickness of the
   spiritual perceptions, that the heaviest sorrow leaves upon their
   hearts but a shallow and short lived impress of the intermediate state.
   For a while their affections follow the departing spirit; and it may be
   they think their hearts will never return to this rough world, but
   dwell within the veil for ever. In a little time the first visions of
   the realities unseen, be they never so vivid, begin to fade into a
   colder light; and realities soften off into shadows, and shadows melt
   into films, and from films they draw themselves into motes; and this
   world and all its going-on of life, and the hurryings to and fro of
   every day, and the emptiness of home, and the loneliness of night, and
   the returning sadness of the morrow, so throng about a man, and first
   lower upon him, and then settle heavily upon him, that many give back
   from their first feelings, and unbind their resolutions, and shrink
   from the severe life of walking alone on the brink of the world unseen.
   The end of this is, that they become again, for the most part, what
   they were before: humbler, and it may be, more softened, more tender;
   on the whole, more religious,--but still entangled in the near and
   sensible things of this earthly life. And thus, it may be, they make
   forfeit of hidden blessings which God has tendered to them. They choose
   again a full home, rather than an empty one, fellowship rather than
   loneliness, a lower rather than a higher level in the life of God.

   But though this may be found even in better men, the full Sadduceeism
   of the day is to be seen in the great mass of less earnest minds. It is
   not too much to say, that in a little while they have for gotten the
   dead. Of course there are exceptions: warm hearts will always cling, by
   an involuntary and almost unconscious fondness, to the memory of the
   departed. But here is the very difference: it is to their memory, not
   to their fellowship; to what they were, not to what they are. They look
   back on them, and remember their poor struggling humanity, their life
   of earth, their body of humiliation; all their endearing images are of
   early days, and gleams of transient happiness, and soft smiles, and
   softer tears, and the smooth cheek, and the full eye of this life's
   painted fairness; so that, after all, it is an embodied image, a dream
   of the earth, that such fond hearts still dwell upon. O that they had
   learned a higher and holier lore! Their loved ones are still the same,
   and yet are not what they were: they have passed from the humiliation
   of the body to the majesty of the spirit. The weakness, and the
   littleness, and the abasement of life, are gone; they are now excellent
   in strength, full of heavenly light, ardent with love, above fallen
   humanity, akin to angels. And it is we that pity the dead, call them
   poor, and shed tears over their coil of dust, which they put off at
   their exaltation. The living pity the dead? horrible pride! blind
   folly! while it may be they muse sadly and lovingly on us, and on our.
   burdened and fretful life.

   Most earthly are the thoughts respecting the sleeping saints even in
   better minds: as for the rest of men, they soon forget them. When they
   have buried their dead out of their sight, the unseen world closes up
   with the mouth of the grave; and they turn back to their homes, and
   muse in sadness how they may begin to weave the same web over again,
   and make a new cast for happiness, and be gin life afresh. It makes
   one's blood run cold to hear some people talk of the departed. And why
   is all this? What should put so unnatural a force upon the very
   instincts of the heart, but the cold tradition of a Christian
   Sadduceeism? Against this, then, the commemoration of the Church is a
   direct and wholesome witness.

   Another most excellent benefit of this commemoration is, its tendency
   to heal the schisms of the visible Church. No particular branch of the
   visible body can be in energetic unity with the fellowship of other
   Churches, so long as its fellowship with the Church unseen is
   suspended. This contact with the invisible is the life of the visible
   Church: when once the bond of faith and love with this is loosened, the
   bond of visible unity also is well nigh dissolved. In all the contests
   of the Church on earth, all her members, be they never so much divided
   (unless by heresy or schism), still hold communion in the court of
   heaven. They all find a common head in the King, and a common
   fellowship in the communion of saints. Their hearts make, as it were, a
   silent appeal from each other's misunderstandings to that world where
   all things are fully understood. In the glorious company of the
   apostles, the goodly fellowship of the prophets, the noble army of
   martyrs, the holy Church throughout all the world is one. The eastern
   and the western are one in Athanasius and Cyprian, in Basil and
   Augustine; and in the lines of holy bishops, and the companies of
   blessed saints long ago fallen asleep, the Churches of the west are
   one. Schisms are half healed when hearts are chafed into love towards
   one common object; even as alienated sons meet and embrace in their
   love to one fond mother. And as the saints of Christendom are the
   unearthly bond even of divided Churches, so is the hallowed ancestry of
   each particular Church a bond of unity to its several members. Men are
   already half reconciled when they have agreed to honour one and the
   same spiritual lineage. It calls them out of themselves, and corrects
   the lordliness and pride of the individual will. O how infinitely mean
   appears all our fretfulness and littleness, which we would fain impose
   on others, and on ourselves, as zeal for truth, and jealousy for the
   glory of God! If they that sleep could read to us out of the book of
   their earthly life, how should we burn for shame at the poverty of our
   own! Therefore the Church commemorates their earthly warfare, that we
   may go forth out of ourselves in a reverent love for those whose
   sanctity abashes our inflated self-esteem. She bids us remember that,
   in comparison with her mighty dead, we are but worms; that the Church
   is not ours to rend and set in array, nor to patronise, and
   irreverently praise; that we are but one of a flowing tide of
   generations--one only--and that neither the wisest nor the best. Better
   were it for us to stand in awe at our own littleness. We are but a
   handful of restless, fretful, self-exalting children in the sight of
   the Church unseen.

   Therefore, year by year, let us reverently commemorate their names,
   remembering what they were, but stedfastly gazing at what they are.
   Their very words are still ringing in our ears: of some the beloved
   image too is full before us. Let us live as they would bid us, could
   they still speak: let us fulfil their known behests, following in their
   steps, filling up the works that they began, carrying on their hallowed
   offices now bequeathed to our care: let us be like them in deadness to
   sin, and unceasing homage to our unseen Lord. As we grow holier, we
   grow nearer to them: to be like them is to be with them: even now they
   are not far from us, we know not how nigh. As yet, for a time, the veil
   is drawn. We shall know all at His coming. It may be, we shall
   say--What! so near, and we could not see you? At times we could almost
   fancy we were not alone; but when we strained our sight, we saw
   nothing; when we listened, all was still.

SERMON XXIII.

  THE WAITING OF THE INVISIBLE CHURCH.

    REV. vi. 9, 10, 11.

   "And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls
   of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony
   which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O
   Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them
   that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of
   them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little
   season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should
   be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."

   THESE are the sights and sounds which St. John saw and heard in heaven,
   when the Lamb had opened the fifth of the seven seals which made fast
   the awful book. He saw an altar, and under it the souls of Christ's
   faithful servants who had been slain for His sake. And they were weary
   of waiting for the day when God should judge the earth. They were at
   rest, and yet there was a rising of desire for the end: "How long, O
   Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood?" They
   were impatient, not so much for their own wrongs as for the glory of
   God. They were weary that sin should so long war against the majesty of
   heaven; that God's world should so long be torn by the rending strife
   of spiritual evil. They had, in their lifetime, made full trial of its
   tyranny and hate; and the long train of remembered wrongs heaped on
   them for their loyalty to Heaven kindled a fire in their souls. But the
   time was not yet come. Very awful was the answer to their cry. "White
   robes were given unto every one of them;" some larger visitations of
   His sustaining grace: they were refreshed in their weariness by some
   mysterious gift; and it was said unto them--no need to say who it was
   that bade them tarry; for who but He could stay their yearnings?--it
   was said unto them, "that they should rest yet for a little season."
   God had a work yet to do. Their fellow-servants must needs be slain as
   they were; and all must be fulfilled. Then should the end come.

   Now there is one point in this to which we will direct our thoughts: I
   mean, the light it throws upon the great mystery of Christ's second
   coming. We may gather with all certainty from this wonderful revelation
   of the inner mysteries of the heavenly court, first, that God has a
   fixed time for the end of the world. This we know from our Lord's words
   while He was yet on earth. While He declared the secrecy of that time
   to be such that it was hidden from all, both men and angels, yet He
   specially added, that it was a time fixed and known to the Father. I do
   not mean simply known as all things must be known to an all-knowing
   God, but foreseen and fore-determined in the secrets of His hidden
   wisdom. And this leads on to another truth revealed in the same vision;
   namely, that God has fixed that time according to the measures of the
   work which He has to finish: even as Christ had a work to finish on
   earth; so that we read, again and again, that His "hour was not yet
   come." In like manner now in heaven, He has a definite fore seen scheme
   for the administration of His mediatorial kingdom; and according to the
   accomplishing of this work, will be the time of His coming. So much in
   a general way. But in this passage we have somewhat more specific and
   detailed.

   1. He has shadowed out to us the nature of the work that He has to do
   before the end come; that is, to make up a certain number whom God has
   foreseen and predestinated to life eternal. This we read throughout
   Holy Writ. "They shall be mine in that day when I make up my jewels,"
   [91] the Lord has said by the prophet Malachi. Then shall the angels
   "gather together His elect from the four winds." [92] And, to take only
   one more passage, the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews
   shews us how God has ever been gathering out His chosen ones, from
   righteous Abel to this day. After running down the list of the
   faithful, St. Paul adds, "These all died in faith, not having received
   the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of
   them, and embraced them." And, again, "God having provided some better
   thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect." [93]
   Abel waited for Enoch, and Enoch for Abraham, and Abraham for Moses,
   and Moses for Paul; and so all holy men, bishops, and pastors, and
   saints, along the whole line of this world's history, have waited for
   us; and we shall wait, it may be, for others yet to come. God is
   gathering out a mystical number--the hundred and forty and four
   thousand, which is a symbol of all numbers innumerable--of the twelve
   tribes of the Israel of God; and He has been gathering them out one by
   one, from an age or a generation, from a people, a family, or a
   household, taking one, and leaving another, in the inscrutable mystery
   of His choice. Whether this secret number be measured by the fall of
   angels, as some of old were wont to believe; whether the companies of
   angelic ministers shall be filled up by the redeemed of mankind,--we
   know not, but we know certainly that until the foreseen number is
   completed, the course of this turbulent world shall still run on. This,
   then, in general, is the nature and direction of the mystery of this
   seemingly entangled world. Out of the midst of it He is. drawing the
   children of the regeneration, knitting them in one fellowship, in part
   still visible, in part out of sight. When the Son of God passed into
   the heavens, He began to draw after Him a glorious train of saints,
   like as the departing sun seems to draw after him the lights which
   reflect his own splendour, till the night starts out full of silver
   stars. So shine the saints in an evil world; rising and falling above
   the boundaries of earth in stedfast and silent course, till all are
   lost in the brightness of the morning: and so shall the firmament of
   the Church break forth with the glory of the resurrection. But now, for
   a while, it tarries. Some saints are yet in the mid-heaven, and some
   are yet to rise upon the world; and, until all is fulfilled, the desire
   of the Church unseen is stayed with the "white robes," and the sound of
   the Bridegroom's voice.

   Again; in this gathering out of the mystical body of His Son, God is
   carrying on the probation of mankind. In the inscrutable secrets of His
   providential government, He is so ordering the strife of the seed of
   the woman with the seed of the serpent, of the Church with the world,
   as to fulfil the manifold purposes of love and of long-suffering.

   And, first, we see that this long-permitted strife is ordained for the
   perfecting of His saints.

   That holy fellowship is not more perfect in the integrity of its
   number, than in its absolute perfection of holiness. And the prolonged
   duration of this world is a school of discipline, to liken them to
   their perfect Lord. The powers of evil which are arrayed against the
   Majesty of heaven, are so overruled by the Almighty will as to work out
   unwittingly His high behest. The continual strife of spiritual good and
   evil is a mystery, of which we know only the outskirts. It has one end
   in the mystery of the fall, and the other in the mystery of the
   atonement: we know not what are the effects in the world unseen of this
   never-ending warfare. It is in some way related to the mystery of the
   cross; not, indeed, as propitiatory, which nothing can be, but as a
   carrying out and consequence of that great overthrow of evil in which
   the Conqueror was bruised by the foe He crushed. Therefore we find St.
   Paul speaking of filling up that which is behind of the afflictions of
   Christ in his flesh; [94] and of the apostles he says, that they were
   set forth last, as it were, appointed unto death, "a spectacle unto the
   world, and to angels, and to men:" [95] and "that now unto the
   principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known, by the
   Church, the manifold wisdom of God." [96] It would seem, then, that
   this relentless strife between the seed of the serpent and the body of
   Christ is fulfilling some unrevealed design of God in the world unseen;
   that even the spirits of heaven, the elect angels, look on as learners
   upon this sleepless war. We are greatly ignorant what may be the place
   of this world in the universal scheme of God's creatures; what we think
   to be a great and final end, may be only a subordinate means to some
   transcendent purpose. And thus much is plainly revealed to us, that the
   trial of the Church and the probation of the world shall run on till
   the purpose of the Divine wisdom is fulfilled. And this was the key of
   the strange earthly lot of those who had trial of cruel mockings and
   scourgings, of bonds and imprisonment; who were stoned, were sawn
   asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; who wandered about in
   sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented; of
   whom the world was not worthy. When they and their cause seemed lost
   for ever, then were they more than conquerors; even as Christ then
   overcame when He was crucified. In each one of them He overcame
   again.When they suffered most, they most mightily triumphed over the
   serpent. Let us remember, that not martyrs only are perfected through
   sufferings. They, indeed, are made glorious by a share of His
   sufferings in the flesh: but of His sorrow and self-denial all saints
   are partakers. The world is still the same; bitter, treacherous, and
   full of enmity against God. The law, that every man that will live
   godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution, is still unrepealed in
   this fallen earth. Every faithful man will have the grace-tokens of the
   cross upon his inmost soul. By temptation, by wrest ling against evil,
   by crucifixion of self, by wrongs and snares from without, by sorrow
   and afflictions from above, every brother of the First-born in the
   family of man will bear His likeness, and be perfected by the keen edge
   of pain. By this long-drawn and weary strife, our patience, meekness,
   faith, perseverance, boldness, and loyalty to Christ, are ever tried;
   and by trial made perfect.

   And this mysterious work, as it has an aspect of love towards the
   saints, so it has an aspect of long-suffering towards sinners. It is
   thus that God gives them a full season for repentance. Christ delays
   His return, and tarries in the heavens; and scoffers have asked, Where
   is the promise of His coming? "But the Lord is not slack concerning His
   promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward,
   not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
   repentance." [97] He lets the life of man run on through all its
   stages, from childhood to old age. He gives all things for our
   salvation, warnings, blessings, chastisements, sorrows, sicknesses,
   words of fire, and sacraments of love; He stays His hand, and leaves
   the sinner without excuse, that at the winding up of this weary life,
   "every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before
   God." What shall men say at that day? All the mysteries of truth and
   grace were ever near them; they lacked neither knowledge nor strength.
   They had a long life chequered with the tokens of His hand; sharp
   sicknesses, sudden accidents, desolating sorrows, slow death-beds, all
   speaking clearly and piercingly to the dull ear on which the words of
   grace had fallen in vain. They lacked nothing which could awaken the
   soul of man. The whole order of mysteries in His Church and in His
   providence worked together, interweaving their powers, and bringing
   them to bear, as one manifold divine influence, upon the hearts of the
   unawakened; if any thing were still lacking, it was that they lacked
   the will.

   Such is this wonderful work of unwearied love. And all the while His
   Church is crying out, "How long, O Lord, holy and true?" the saints
   unseen waiting and longing for their perfect bliss; the saints on earth
   crying, day by day, "Thy kingdom come:" day by day, from all lands,
   throughout the whole Church, this cry goes up into the ears of the Lord
   of Sabaoth: "the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
   together:" all things would hasten the coming end: heaven is well nigh
   weary, and earth sick, for bearing the burden of sin and wrong: and yet
   Christ tarries. We must rest yet "for a little season;" and then, so
   soon as the sinner's day is done, and the saints are tried, and the
   foreseen number full, the end shall come; and time shall be no longer.

   And now, from all this, we see what ought to be the master-aim of our
   lives: that is, to make sure of our fellowship in that mystical number.
   We see that it is not enough that we belong to the one visible Church.
   Many partake of the visible unity who in the invisible have no portion.
   The Church is like a sacrament, having both its out ward and inward
   parts. The true Church has both a body and a soul: the body is that
   one, uniform, organised, universal polity, of which the succession of
   the apostles is the essential first condition: the soul is that inward
   unity of energetic faith, hope, and charity, which knits all saints,
   from the highest to the lowest, in one spiritual family. These are the
   fruits, or result, of the visible unity; as the likeness of Christ is
   the effect of the holy sacraments in the faithful receiver. The visible
   unity is a sacramental means to the formation of this fellowship of
   sanctity. All regenerate men are saints in capability, but these are
   saints in fact. The former may be, the latter are, conformed to
   Christ's likeness. The difference is the same as between a moral nature
   and a moral habit: the nature may be passive, or be perverted; the
   habit must be developed by energy, and sustained by the powers of moral
   life. There is therefore no difficulty in testing ourselves. Every man
   can tell whether his life is energetically pure and holy or not. With
   the saints of old, martyrdom was the test, or saintliness of life, by
   which they bore martyrdom in the will, though they were never crowned
   with it in the body. And we, too, have no need to be doubtful of our
   state. The sure sign is the likeness of Christ growing in our hearts,
   waxing ever brighter from childhood, in boyhood, youth, and riper
   years; ever shining out more clearly as He draws nearer. This is His
   own countersign. Plainly the sinful, the slothful, the double-minded,
   the worldly, that is, all who, under the strong assimilating power of
   the world, are growing into its likeness, are aliens from the soul of
   the one Church, and are as yet severed from the mystical number which
   He is gathering out. It is true that we cannot draw any line so
   strongly marked as to cut off with absolute and visible certainty those
   who do, and those who do not, belong to that unseen fellowship. As
   there is twilight between noon and midnight, so are there infinite
   gradations of character: and yet this is certain, that no man that is
   not either freed from the power of sin, or repenting of his sin-soiled
   state, has any warrant to believe himself of that number. Many, indeed,
   there are of most imperfect sanctity; namely, those who are puffed up
   with vanity and ambition, and love of the pomps of life, its honour,
   power, high bearing, great friendships, and the like; and likewise
   those who are opinionated and self-confident, fond of controversy, and
   prone to a controversial temper; or again, tinged with
   self-complacency, and addicted to a self-sparing, soft, relaxed
   religion, which clings to the alluring, but shrinks with dislike from
   the severer precepts of the faith. Now all these, and the infinite
   shades of character contained in them, or related to them, may belong
   to the unseen fellowship; but their title to it is ambiguous, and their
   end doubtful. For all such the way is, not to strain after a high-toned
   devotion, till they have laid the deep basis of a thorough repentance.
   Their chief danger is, the weakness of an unnatural growth, which has
   got above its healthy powers. The imagination and the intellect have
   simulated the forms of faith and sanctity, and they are in danger of
   persuading themselves that they really are what they are so well able
   to delineate. Repentance is the threshold of the invisible sanctuary
   where the saints are gathering, and here they must fall down before
   they think to enter. None but they that have either a pure or a broken
   heart shall see God.

   Be careful, therefore, above all things, to commit yourselves to the
   great movement of God's providence in His Church, by which He is
   drawing His faithful within the curtains of His pavilion. Be not
   content to stand without, albeit in the precinct of the visible Church:
   there are more that gaze upon the outward ritual in which the earthly
   Church pays homage to her Lord, than enter into its mind and mystery.
   Pray Him to give you the white robes of sanctity and fellowship with
   the saints unseen, that you may wait in patience, lying under the
   altar, dead with Christ. Let daily worship, and the ever-returning
   sacrifice of the holy eucharist, be your life and food. We are fallen
   on an evil age; an age of bitterness and wrong, and deaf inexorable
   slander, accusation, and strife, and separation. Martyrdom, and all its
   high and stir ring fears, is gone, and the wearisome harassing of a
   petty warfare has fastened on the Church. We are fallen on an age in
   which the chief zeal for truth is, that men have not so absolutely
   ceased to care for it, as to keep from quarrelling about it. Almost are
   we tempted to cry out, Would that a season of stern trial might sift
   the Church of all shallow, petulant, self-loving, boastful men, that
   the true and loyal hearts might be made manifest, and, by one decisive
   trial, short as it is sharp, win their crown of life. But not so; God
   has willed otherwise. We must wait, and not be weary; we must bear all
   the fretfulness and provocation of earthly tempers and false tongues
   for a little sea son. Meanwhile, the perpetual worship of our unseen
   Master, and the communion of hidden saints, and the fellowship of the
   invisible Church, must be our strength and stay.

   And see, also, how broad a light this throws on our duties towards all
   around us. The first debt we owe them is, to endeavour by all means to
   draw them into the same blessed fellowship. We owe this to every member
   of Christ's visible Church, but, above all, to such as are bound to us
   by ties of an especial nearness, whether by blood or by the benediction
   of the Church. There is no other lasting basis of friendship or
   affection but this only, that our spirits be knit in the unseen unity
   of the saints. All else is mere falsehood. "Two men shall be working in
   the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left;" so shall all
   fellowships be cut asunder but those that meet in God. In the choice of
   friends, in all great changes and casts in life, let this be your rule.
   Such is the mysterious action and re-action of moral beings on each
   other, that no one can say what may be the end of an ill-chosen
   fellowship. "What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
   husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?"
   [98] On one side or the other the power of assimilation must prevail.
   How often has the earthlier mind drawn away a high and ripening spirit
   from the fellowship of saints! And O fearful fall which draws others in
   its ruin! Watch, then, and pray, that you may not only enter into the
   mystical sanctuary of saints, and go no more out, but gather in also
   all your loved ones, that there be no parting any more. Though God
   tarries, yet all things hasten on. Day by day we are nearer our last
   change. The unseen Church is crying "How long?" the Church in war fare
   ceases not continually to pray for the consummation of the elect. And
   albeit so short, yet this fleeting life to them is as a long and
   lingering night, which holds off a blessed morrow. Though the time be
   not yet, nevertheless there are tokens of changes coming on the earth.
   The shadows are lengthening out, and the day of its toilsome life is
   well nigh spent. Oh, when He comes, and the dead are judged, and the
   names of those that have overcome, which are written in the Lamb's book
   of life, are read one by one in our ears, how shall our hearts thrill
   to bursting, while we hear prophets, apostles, martyrs, and saints, bid
   "come up hither;" and all our loved ones, a friend, a sister, a
   husband, each in turn called out, and clad in white robes for the
   marriage-feast! What if we should be left out at last? What if our name
   be "not found written in the book of life?" [99] "Enter not into
   judgment with Thy servant, O Lord; for in Thy sight shall no man living
   be justified."

SERMON XXIV.

  THE WAITING OF THE VISIBLE CHURCH.

    1 COR. vii. 29, 30, 31.

   "This I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they
   that have wives be as though they had none; and they that weep, as
   though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced
   not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use
   this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth
   away."

   AFTER St. Paul had given to the Church in Corinth many counsels of
   wisdom and perfection, he brings all his teaching to this end:
   "Brethren, the time is short." Life is fleeting, and Christ is coming.
   In whatsoever state ye be, "the Lord is at hand." The apostles had been
   taught, by the parables of their Master, to look for Him at any time,
   as servants for their lord, and virgins for the bridegroom. The angels
   of His Father, who had received Him with glory into heaven, had bid
   them look for His coming even as He went away. And therefore they were
   for ever saying, "We shall not all sleep;" "We which are alive, and
   remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent those that are
   asleep; for the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are
   alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,
   to meet the Lord in the air." [100] Again, "The night is far spent, the
   day is at hand." [101] "The end of all things is at hand; be ye
   therefore sober, and watch unto prayer." [102] And this habitual
   expectation chastened and subdued their hearts with awe and gladness;
   with a faith full of joy, and yet of fear. Their Lord was taken from
   them; but He was coming again; and the Church of Christ was as a family
   that had received one great visitation, and is waiting for another. At
   such a time, all thoughts are absorbed into one; all feelings, all
   cares, all forecastings; and that one thought and feeling is too great
   for words. All levity is repressed; all common and unnecessary things
   suspended; only necessary du ties are tolerable, and they are done in
   an uncommon way. There is a check upon the mind, and a limit to all its
   movements. And men go about the business of life with a calm and sedate
   carriage, and meet each other with graver looks; for the one habitual
   master-thought of their hearts is, the greatness and nearness of God.

   And so it was that the Christians of early days did all things in the
   Lord: their buying and selling, marrying and giving in marriage, their
   weepings and rejoicings, were all measured, and checked, and subdued by
   the remembrance that "the time is short." They so lived as they would
   desire to be found by Him at His coming. There was a twofold process
   ever going on within them,--the energy of daily life, and the fixed
   contemplation of Christ's advent. Nevertheless, "they were not slothful
   in business," but "fervent in spirit;" and for this reason, because
   they were "serving the Lord:" and yet there was in them a thought which
   was the centre of all their actings, and gave a steadiness and balance
   to all their daily life. The ever-present consciousness of their
   Master's nearness was as some deep under tone which runs through a
   strain of music, and gives it a staid and solemn spirit.

   But if a man should enter the same household once in the hour of its
   first visitation, and again after a few years or months are gone, how
   would he find it changed! He would find it, as men say, calmed down,
   and grown more natural; become itself again, that is, in truth, become
   common place, having reverted, like a spring released from some
   antagonist pressure. The truth is, they that were so visited were, for
   a time, above and better than themselves; and while their trial lasted,
   they were sustained on a higher level; but now they are only as they
   were before; as a man makes an effort, or strains his eyesight for a
   moment, and then relaxes again. For all things draw us back to our
   former habits: we are soon recast into old shapes, and led back into
   old ways. For a time, while the shadow of God's hand was upon our
   heads, we resisted the power and attraction of the world; but what we
   were was only a condition, not a character. It was not the man, but his
   circumstances, and his outward state, that were changed; as a person
   may change his vesture, or his countenance, by choice, or sympathy, or
   any accidental cause. Day by day he becomes bolder and more
   self-possessed, more intent and concentrated upon things below God and
   heaven: every object around him grows larger and distincter, and the
   visible light in which he once saw its just proportions fades from his
   sight; and the thought of God which dwelt within him goes up, like the
   glory in the prophet's vision, [103] from the threshold of the house,
   as if to depart from it. All men have made trial of this at some time,
   and know that the effect of a visitation is strangely evanescent. The
   checked character comes out once more, and each man is his own
   unrestrained self again; and he throws himself wholly into his trade or
   his business, into his grief or his joy, into the long-drawn aims of
   his ambition, or the listless languor of his worldly life. In this and
   for this he lives. Things near at hand again bind round and overgrow
   his heart, and make it a part of themselves. He has no other energy of
   hope or fear; he neither looks nor waits for any thing beyond. The
   future has no power over him. It is too dim, too far off, and too
   unsubstantial, to counterpoise the gain of to-day, or the pleasure of
   to-morrow.

   And so, after a season of higher thoughts, the whole tone of the mind
   is let down and weakened; and a second visitation would come with the
   suddenness of the first, and find us as before. Such has been, and such
   still is, the state of Christ's Church and household; it has left off
   to watch for the signs of His coming. One by one His servants have
   fallen asleep, while the Lord seemed to linger. Here and there, indeed,
   in the great multitude of churches and Christians, some have waited as
   men that had nothing to do in the world but to prepare for His
   appearing, weeping as though they wept not, and rejoicing as though
   they joyed not, as if the earth were floating under their feet, and the
   "white cloud" [104] ready to appear in heaven. But the mass of
   Christians have been otherwise minded. The visible body has slumbered:
   and from that day began a decline of the high and devoted temper of
   faith; men left their first love; and one by one fell away from the
   "breaking of bread/ in which we shew forth the Lord's death till He
   come. While men watched for Him, this token was in some churches daily
   offered, in all weekly; but they began to forsake their testimony: and
   with this decline of diligent waiting upon God, declined also the
   ever-ready spirit of a Christian life. The power of the apostolic
   example seemed to have spent itself in the first generations, and men
   grew up into an earthly, commonplace habit of life. Then came debate
   and strife of words, vain doc trines spun out by the subtle, and true
   doctrines gainsayed by the unbelieving: and the simple faith of Christ
   crucified, in which "the wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not err,"
   has been overlaid by snares of words, and beset by learned fancies; and
   the poor of Christ have been bewildered by their very teachers, and
   Satan hath beguiled them both; and the Church, which left off to dwell
   on the one thing needful, hath doated on a multitude of fables. Satan
   laid snares in every doctrine and in every mystery: the memory of the
   saints, the sleep of the faithful dead, the food of life, and the altar
   of God, became his lurking-places. The Church, against which he could
   not prevail, he used as an ambush.

   And under this temptation, even the self-denying fainted; and a love of
   worldly ease, and pomp, and wealth, filled the disciples of the
   fishermen of Galilee; and they grew weary of waiting for their Master's
   kingdom, and would fain bring it about before its time by a cunning of
   their own. And in His name they claimed dominion, and subdued kingdoms,
   and wrought unrighteousness, and gave away the thrones of kings, and
   taught the world rebellion; and Christendom split asunder in the midst;
   and the heirs of the blessing cursed each other from the seats of
   Christ. Wars broke out between churches; and they that should have
   untaught men the arts of war armed nation against nation; and Christian
   kings made the sacred cross a sign of bloodshed, and filled the world
   with tumult, and their own kingdoms with confusion. And in all this din
   of the great and mighty, the still small voice of truth was drowned, or
   pent up into cloisters; and private men were overcome with a devoted,
   immoderate love of worldly things, and began to plant and build; and
   the days of Noe came back again, which is the forerunning sign of the
   last times. Even the best grew heavy and tame, and left little or no
   stamp of God upon the world; but drank of its spirit, and loitered
   securely in its ways. They lost the vividness of faith, and learned an
   easy acquiescence in a lower standard, and were content to move along
   upon a lower level; though in the main Christian, they were not
   heavenly but earthly minded. Like Lot, they lifted up their eyes, and
   saw the plain "fruitful and well watered;" and first pitched their
   tent, and then built them an abode.

   Such is now the every-day Christianity which we have inherited, and
   such our inconsistent state. Though we are ever saying, "He shall come
   again in glory to judge both the quick and the dead;" though we shew
   forth the Lord's death in the consecrated bread and wine; yet men are
   swallowed up in this mortal life. Fathers are mere fathers; husbands
   mere husbands; mourners are overwhelmed with grief; they that rejoice
   are excessive in their gladness. The man of science has few thoughts
   for a world unseen; the man of business no leisure; the calculator
   lives in his reckonings, the buyer in his bargain; the seller has no
   care beyond his price; the statesman is centred in his schemes, and his
   whole being terminates in his line of policy. Most men are just what
   they are in this life; and never rise above it, nor look out beyond it.
   No purpose of their heart is controlled and checked by the thought of
   the day of Christ. They know that it must come; and deceive themselves
   into thinking that they are swayed by the expectation; but they neither
   do nor leave undone any thing that they would not do or leave undone,
   though He should never come again. And even more thoughtful men
   silently prescribe a course for the providence of God; for where is
   there one who so feels himself uncertain of what shall be, as to say
   with St. Paul, "we shall not all sleep?" Men speak as if the apostle
   were mistaken, and themselves better taught. We all expect to live, and
   then in due time to die; and that Israel must be first grafted into
   Christ, and His kingdom be made universal, that there is much to be
   done before He can come again; and that whosoever shall be quick on
   earth at His appearing, yet surely we shall not. Both they that slight
   the prophecies of Christ, and they that over-wisely expound them, alike
   fall into the same snare; they would make some reckoning about that day
   and hour, of which no man knoweth--not even God's angels,--but the
   Father only. Surely it is as much a fault to say, It cannot be yet, as
   to say, It shall be at such time. Who can say when it shall be? Who
   dares to tell us when it shall not be? Uncertainty is the very
   condition of waiting, and the spur of expectation. All we know is, that
   Christ has not told us when He will come; but He has said, "Be ye also
   ready; for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh."

   Let us, then, draw some rules from what has been said, by which to
   bring this truth to bear on our own conduct.

   1. First, let us learn not to go out of our lot and character in life,
   but to live above it. What and where we are, is God's appointment. It
   is He who makes us to joy or weep, to have or to lose. We have a work
   to do for Him; and it is just that work which lies before us in our
   daily life. It is only the restless impatience of self-will that drives
   a man to throw himself into new and strange positions, other than God
   has ordered. There is no state or office (not being in itself sinful)
   in all the complex bearings of a Christian commonwealth, which may not,
   by the spirit of obedience, be sanctified to God; and every state has a
   becoming character, which we are bidden to realise in ourselves. But
   this character must begin and end in God; must take its rise in His
   will, and terminate in His glory. It is not simply by weeping or
   rejoicing, buying or selling, abounding or suffering want, that we are
   what we are; but by doing and suffering all things as He would have us
   to do and suffer them. To affect contempt for all these natural states
   and actions of life, with the plea that we live for God, is mere
   affectation and contempt of God's own ordinance: to live without
   habitual thought of God, and of the day of Christ's appearing, with the
   plea that we are controlled by the outward accidents of life, is mere
   self-deceit, and abandonment of God Himself. And yet to these two
   extreme faults almost all minds are continually tending: either to what
   is singular and ostentatious in religion, so ending in excitement, and
   often in declension; or to what is worldly and sullen, and, from a
   neglect of religion, ending in slighting and despising it. -

   2. To check these two extremes, then, let us strive to live as we would
   desire to be found by Him at His coming.

   Who can bear the thought of being taken unawares in the madness of a
   sinful life, in secret vice, or in undisguised folly; or with a temper
   unrestrained, or puffed up with self-esteem, or wavering at every gust
   of fashion, or fettered by false customs, or over-careful about money,
   or fretful in a low estate, or murmuring in affliction, or dreaming
   away this short life in the unrealities of empty self-indulgence, or
   forgetful of God amidst the abundance of His chiefest blessings? Let us
   strive, then, to put off these things with a steady boldness, and, if
   need be, with a severe self-restraint. The trader, or the man of
   letters, or of a learned profession, or of a full and easy habit of
   life,--each must needs look into his own state. There is a
   characteristic temptation which besets every state--so subtle and
   insensible, that it is like the ill habits of gait and manner, which,
   being formed unconsciously, become hardly distinguishable from our
   natural action, and yet produce some ill effects at last. Who is there
   that would not dread to be found at that day with a buried talent and
   an untrimmed lamp; with a sleepy conscience, or a shallow repentance,
   or a half-converted heart? Alas for the half-penitent, half-changed
   man, almost a Christian, and almost saved! It must not be so with us.
   At any cost, we must win eternal life. It is by living in our plain
   path of duty, but with an habitual remembrance of His coming; by .using
   the world as we use our daily food, not so much from choice as from
   necessity, and yet with no unthankful sullenness, but with gladness and
   singleness of heart; by being ever ready, both for the duties of the
   day, and for the coming hour of judgment,--by this twofold discipline
   of self is the Christian man so prepared, that the day of Christ can
   neither come too late nor too soon for him.

   3. Surely, then, we have need to lose no time; for "the time is short."
   If we dare not say, the time is not yet, how dare we live as if that
   were true which we dare not say? We shall lose no thing by being ever
   ready, and by living--if I may so speak, as men say of things they
   cannot calculate or control--on the chance. In the concerns of this
   life, the lightest overpoise of probability determines our strongest
   resolutions. Who would tarry under a loosened arch? who would go upon a
   doubtful bridge? nay, even though the chances were in favour of
   escaping;--but the lightest probability would fix our resolve as surely
   as the greatest. And yet the certain warning, if we could have it, that
   we should die this day ten years, would move us more deeply than the
   uncertain chance whether we shall not die to-night. Brethren, we have a
   large stewardship to account for--a tale of many years, with all the
   manifold workings of thought and life: our lot, our character, and
   every particular of what we are; all our opportunities, and all the
   gifts of God,--all this reckoning must be rendered at His coming. And
   we have a sharp warfare to maintain against ourselves, against the
   strong will that wrestles against conscience: we have a trying struggle
   to endure, that we may enter in at the narrow gate. And the time for
   this great mastery is wearing away, and the day of our probation is
   well nigh spent. To a man that looks for Christ's coming, how utterly
   worthless are all things that can perish! How awful is that which is
   alone imperishable! All things about us shall be abolished. The solid
   earth shall melt, and the canopy of heaven shall be rolled away: but
   there is one thing which can not die; one thing which will cleave and
   cling to us for ever; which we brought with us into the world; which,
   whether we will or no, we must carry out; which, for good or for evil,
   haunts every man at all times, abroad and at home, in the busy throng
   of men, or in the dead stillness of solitude; which shall be with us in
   the hour of death, and stand by us in the day of judgment;--each man's
   own imperishable self; the immortal spirit of life which, with all its
   capacities of good or ill, in the beginning came from God, and, with
   the stamp it has here taken, must return to God again. [105]

   Therefore, brethren, make sure your standing in His sight, and all
   things shall fall into their place; all parts of a Christian's life are
   in harmony,--time with eternity; his own soul with God. You will not
   joy the less, nor weep the more; the happiness of your home will not be
   clouded, nor the burden of your sorrow be freighted with a heavier
   load. No; to the true Christian the cares of life shall be an easy,
   tolerable yoke, and all the joys of his heart shall be deeper and more
   lasting. If we take all things as from God, and behold all things as in
   the light of the brightness of His coming, all shall be well. In a
   little while all will be unravelled, and the snares and bonds of life
   be broken, and we shall be where no man can be entangled, or offend, or
   fall any more. A little while, and the veil which hangs between heaven
   and earth shall be rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and all
   that you have here held of God and for God you shall carry with you
   into the holy place; and all that is gone before you shall be found
   perfect, at the feet of our great High Priest, who standeth before the
   eternal throne.

SERMON XXV.

  THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY.

    ST. LUKE xxiv. 39.

   "Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see;
   for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have."

   WHILE the apostles and the two disciples who had returned from Emmaus
   were speaking together of the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, He
   came and stood in the midst. They were "affrighted, and supposed that
   they had seen a spirit. And He said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and
   why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that
   it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and
   bones, as ye see me have." He assured them that He was the same Lord
   with whom they had so long conversed; that He was no bodiless spirit,
   but the same man Jesus Christ.

   From this we see that the very body which He took of the blessed
   Virgin, in which He "increased in wisdom and in stature/ which was also
   nailed upon the cross, was likewise raised from the dead. It was not
   another body like it, nor a mere appearance of His incarnate form; but
   the very same substantial and palpable frame which they were bidden to
   handle and see, in which He did "eat and drink" with them "after He
   rose from the dead." It was a body capable of all the energies of life,
   susceptible of all the perfect affections of our manhood, but
   impassible and deathless: for it was no longer a mortal body, but an
   immortal; and yet it was a body still: as the "natural," or animal
   body, of which St. Paul speaks, is a true body, not a disembodied life,
   so the "spiritual body" is a body, not a disembodied spirit. Therefore
   he says, "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body:
   there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body." [106] Either
   way, both before and after the resurrection, it is a true body. So here
   it was the same in all its identity; only a change had passed upon it:
   death had "no more dominion over" it: "Christ being raised from the
   dead dieth no more." His manhood was thence forward under the powers of
   "the spirit of life;" and in that human form He passed the closed
   doors, vanished out of the sight of Cleopas, and afterwards ascended
   into heaven.

   Now from this we may learn, in some measure, what shall be the
   resurrection of the flesh. We are told plainly, that it shall be the
   very same body we now dwell in, once more reorganised; purged of its
   earthly taint, and raised to the conditions of a spiritual life. To all
   questionings about the manner of this mystery, St. Paul answers, "Thou
   fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: and that
   which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare
   grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: but God giveth
   it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own body."
   [107] St. Paul does not more intend to silence a disputatious objector
   by a natural mystery, than to assert that the great laws of the natural
   world have their counterpart in the spiritual; that our dissolution is
   in order to our resurrection; and that the body which is buried is the
   seed and principle of the body which shall be raised. The ear of corn
   is not more contained in the seed than the spiritual body in the
   natural: in both there is identity of being, and development from weak
   beginnings to more perfect forms of life. It is therefore as plainly
   and as strictly true to say, that this very body shall rise again, as
   that this very seed shall spring into an ear; and that the glorified
   flesh of the saints is the very same they bore in suffering and death,
   as that the harvest of autumn is the very seed of spring. Of the
   mysterious changes and revolutions which fill up the interval between
   these two conditions of being, we know nothing; but there is a line of
   identity so running from each into the other as to make both one. Such,
   then, is the resurrection of the flesh.

   There are some truths flowing from this doc trine, which we will now go
   on to consider.

   1. We may learn, first, that the resurrection will be the restoration
   of the whole man, in spirit, and soul, and body; a restoration of all
   in which consists the integrity of our nature and the identity of our
   person. And this is emphatically the hope of the gospel. The light of
   nature could not shew this mystery. The heathen reached only to the
   immortality of the soul; and even that they saw but dimly, and often
   doubted. The sting of guilt, and the foreboding of conscience; the
   sense that the scheme of justice in this visible world is imperfect;
   and the instinct which feels after a retribution yet to come,--gave
   them some momentary insights into the world beyond the grave. They
   believed that there was a perfect justice somewhere above this wrongful
   world; and they could not but believe that, at some time, the
   inequalities of good and evil should be redressed; and they foreboded
   that the thinking, turbulent thing, which each man calls himself, must
   needs live on; their very hopes and fears prophesied of an hereafter.
   But for the body they knew not what to teach. They saw sickness
   fretting it away; old age bowing it down; death turning it into dust;
   the powers of nature taking it up into themselves; all that they saw
   looked on to dissolution: but that this corruptible and dissolving
   frame should ever be reorganised, nothing they saw and reasoned upon
   seemed to imply. They thought, therefore, that the world unseen should
   be peopled by spirits--a visionary world of bodiless shades--each still
   bearing his name and character, but so changed as to retain rather the
   likeness than the sameness of their former being.

   It would seem, too, that even the elder Church saw this mystery in
   broken and uncertain lights. They knew, indeed, that some had never
   died; that some had passed in the body into an unknown state in the
   world unseen. Enoch and Elijah might teach them of the immortality of
   the flesh. They might also gather some thoughts of a resurrection from
   the remembrance of those who, having died, awoke again, and returned to
   the quick on earth, before they saw corruption: but that a body, once
   turned into dust, should be knit again in its former unity, that its
   perfect organisation should be again restored, they had neither seen
   nor imagined; unless, indeed, we may believe that, here and there, a
   seer, illuminated above his fellows, saw the approach of greater things
   than even he himself conceived; as, for instance, Job, who in a twofold
   sense might say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall
   stand at the lat ter day upon the earth; and though, after my skin,
   worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall
   see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another." [108] And
   so, it may be, the Lord led onward His prophet's thoughts, when, in the
   valley of dry bones, He asked, "Son of man, can these bones live?"
   [109] And Daniel, we may believe, foresaw some great mystery, when he
   said, "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake:"
   [110] and Isaiah, when he said, "Thy dead men shall live, together with
   my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust:
   for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the
   dead." [111] Without doubt, they saw as it were the refracted light of
   the coming mystery; but in some sense their eyes were holden, while
   they ministered to us greater things than they themselves conceived:
   for St. Paul declares that "life and immortality" are "brought to light
   through the Gospel." [112] It may be that we do not see more than they
   saw; but that what at best they saw dimly, we see with clearness of
   sight: and now every baptised child knows what sages doubtfully
   foreboded, and even prophets saw beneath a veil. Every Christian child
   knows that as Christ rose from the dead, in like manner shall we rise
   again, in all the fulness and sameness of our nature and our person;
   that we shall be at that day what we are now, save only that
   "mortality" shall be "swallowed up of life." And yet when I say, every
   Christian child knows this, I do not mean, that any, even the wisest of
   the saints, can penetrate into the depths of the mystery. What
   inconceivable meaning may lie in the words, "In the day that thou
   eatest thereof thou shalt surely die;" or in the promise that "there
   shall be no more death," so that death shall have "no dominion over"
   us: what mysterious change passed upon the father of us all in the day
   of the transgression, what cold, dissolving poison ran through his
   mortal body; or what quickening virtue, in the morning of the
   resurrection, shall once more restore our earthly frame, and knit again
   in one the dust we once inhabited, we know not. Life and death are
   alike beyond our grasp: all we know is, that as we die, so shall we
   rise; and that as we are here subject to the powers of dissolution, so
   we shall there be death less as the angels of God.

   And as the resurrection is the perfect restoration of each several man,
   so shall it be of all man kind. They shall be as if they had never
   died. All the great stream of human life, issuing from the first living
   soul, and ever swelling itself by the multiplication of individual
   being, and the in crease of people and nations from age to age; all
   that have ever lived from the beginning, both the evil and the good;
   the righteous Abel, the first of saints that slept, and all they who
   have been gathered to the same paradise; and the first man, whosoever
   he be, that died in his sins, and all that have gone into the same
   abode of sorrow--all shall be raised to life, and all shall be
   immortal. The wicked shall be once more clothed in flesh and
   blood--even in that very same in which they sinned and died; but there
   shall have passed a change upon them, and they shall be endowed with
   capacities of suffering and a sense of agony which surpass the
   imaginations of our hearts. And in that awful nature they shall be for
   ever deathless: "In those days shall men seek death, and shall not find
   it, and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them," [113]
   Being itself shall become an intolerable anguish; much more when
   compassed about again with all the memorials and instruments of sin,
   with those very members wherewith they did despite unto the Spirit of
   grace. And so, likewise, shall it be with the holy dead: they shall be
   clothed with their hallowed flesh, but in a transfigured purity, the
   body of their humiliation being changed into the likeness of the body
   of His glory; [114] each in his measure, but all perfect; even as
   "there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
   another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in
   glory: so also is the resurrection of the dead." [115] All shall rise,
   "every man in his own order:" "the dead in Christ shall rise first:
   then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
   them." [116] First the children of the kingdom, then the children of
   the wicked one,--multitudes that no man can number: two mighty
   companies, in one great family, gathered on the right hand and on the
   left of the Son of Man.

   2. Now from what has been said, there is another truth which follows by
   an inference so direct as to be self-evident; and yet it is sometimes
   questioned. It is plain, then, that among those that are raised from
   the dead, there shall be a perfect recognition; and that not limited to
   the blessed, but, like the resurrection itself, comprehending the
   wicked also. It follows inseparably from the idea of personal identity,
   and the law of individual responsibility, that it should be so. Awful
   as the thought must be, we may not doubt that even in the outer
   darkness, they that have sinned together shall be conscious of their
   common anguish: and they that have here tempted their fellows in
   condemnation shall look in horror on the prey they have destroyed; and
   all the long-drawn consequences of their evil life shall be unfolded to
   their sight, in the misery of those that have fallen by their guilt:
   and in the kingdom of sorrow and spiritual wickedness, remorse, and
   revenge, and hate, and horror, and despair, and the implacable strife
   of wills that on earth consented to do evil, shall kindle and multiply
   the torment of lost souls; each one reflecting another's agony, and
   making more intense the piercing energy of pain. But this is not the
   part of the subject that people are wont to doubt of. It seems in
   harmony with the laws of eternal right, that mutual recognition in the
   abodes of misery, and conscious privation of bliss, and of the
   fellowship of blessed souls known here, but parted from them hereafter,
   should enter into the portion of the reprobate. The difficulties all
   arise on the other side; and these we will now consider. Some people
   out of a coldness of heart, and many out of a hoping timidity, as
   fondly desiring what they hardly dare to hope, often ask, "Is it not
   too blessed to be true? Can it be? Shall we indeed know again all whom
   we have loved here?" Surely it must be so. How else shall we be then
   what we are now, if one-half of all our conscious being shall be
   annihilated? If memory, and knowledge, and love be so dim and overcast,
   as that we shall not remember, and know, and love with all the absolute
   fulness and identity of our present being, how shall we be perfect?
   This would be a retrogression in the order of intelligences, not an
   exaltation; a straitening, not an unfolding, of our spiritual life. But
   it is sometimes argued--"If we shall recognise all those whom we meet
   again, shall we not also remember those whom we miss from that blessed
   company? Will not the consciousness that some are wanting there
   embitter even the bliss of heaven? Will the fellowship of some we love
   fill the heart which yearns for those that appear not in glory? Will
   there not be even in heaven a voice heard' as in Ramah; Rachel mourning
   for her children.' and refusing to be comforted for her children,'
   because they are not?" These are hard reasonings, and too entangled
   that we should unravel them. But there are other, and those not less
   difficulties in the works of God; and yet the apostle thought them no
   hinderance to the mysteries of truth, nor any signs of wisdom in those
   that started them. Some before now have asked, "How are the dead raised
   up, and with what body do they come?" We therefore need not go far to
   put these questionings to silence. But, after all, they are doubts
   which not only oppose themselves in the attitude of objections, but
   shape themselves into fears; they thrust their way unbidden into
   shrinking minds, that would fain believe them false. What shall we say,
   then? God has not drawn up the veil, and we cannot pierce its folds.
   W^e may give, in deed, some sort of answer; but we cannot allay the
   unrest which these misgivings breathe into our minds. Let us, however,
   consider that God recognises all, both them that are saved, and them
   that perish; He loves them beyond all love of ours, and His bliss is
   perfect: in heaven we are made par takers as of His will, so of His
   bliss; and both in us shall be perfect too. This must be answer enough
   for the understanding; and until we "know even as we are known," faith
   must make answer to our hearts.

   But these were no doubtful questions in times of a livelier faith.
   "Shall there not be, beloved," asked St. Austin, in preaching on the
   resurrection, "shall there not be a recognition of us all? Do ye think
   that ye shall recognise me then because ye know me now, and that ye
   shall not know my father whom ye have not known here, or the bishop who
   years ago ruled over this Church? Ye shall know all. They who shall be
   there, shall not therefore recognise each other because they shall
   behold his face; the mutual recognition of that place shall come from a
   higher knowledge. All shall see then, and much more excellently, as
   prophets here are wont to see. They shall see with a divine vision,
   when all shall be full of God." [117] So they believed of old, and so
   may we stedfastly believe now. All the saints of God shall have a
   transcendent and intuitive knowledge, not sought out of the memory, nor
   gathered from experience, nor drawn from reasonings, but by insights,
   and consciousness, and beatific vision. Shall we not know angels;
   Gabriel, who was sent of God to Nazareth; and him, too, whose name was
   "secret?" [118] And shall we know the angels, and not know the saints
   of God? Shall we know the angel Gabriel, and not know the faithful
   Abraham? Shall we not behold patriarchs and prophets, and apostles and
   martyrs, Enoch and Moses, and John Baptist and the Blessed Virgin?
   Shall these be to us (to speak like heathen men) as nameless spirits
   and unknown shades; or shall they not be revealed in all the fulness of
   that mysterious individual perfection which we now by faith believe and
   celebrate? Yes, of a truth, they that have come from "the east and the
   west" to "sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom
   of heaven," shall not fail to know them in that day. Surely we shall
   say, "Lo, there is he that never saw death; and there, the man greatly
   beloved;' and there, she that sat at the feet of Jesus, and the woman
   that stood behind Him weeping; and the disciple that lay on His bosom
   at that last sad supper; and there is he that thrice denied his Lord,
   and then wept bitterly; and there is the glorious apostle through whose
   preaching and martyrdom we sinners of the Gentiles' were bidden to the
   marriage-supper of the Lamb; and there are they that in the first age
   trod the purple path to a palm and crown; and they that, age aft^r age,
   followed the Lamb in sanctity and pureness: I have heard of them by
   hearsay, but now I see them each one face to face, as though I had
   lived and conversed with them in the days of the flesh." And if we
   shall know them whom we have not seen, how shall we not know them whom
   we have. seen? Shall we recognise the objects of our faith, and not
   know the objects of our love? Shall we know those of whose presence our
   imaginations have wrought in vain to shape so much as an outline, and
   not know those with whom we have here companied through the long years
   of our earthly sojourn; whose form, and bearing, and speaking looks,
   and every visible movement, are interwoven with our very consciousness;
   who are so knit to us as to be all but our very selves? Such, indeed,
   is the hope of the Gospel, and the faith of the Catholic Church. Let no
   man defraud you of your joy. When any would try you with a doubt, make
   answer, "I believe . . . in the communion of saints . . . the
   resurrection of the body." Say what you will, we are fools, and ye are
   wise; but, wise or foolish, this I know, we shall meet again even as we
   parted: yet not altogether; there shall be no more tokens of the fall,
   no more lines of sorrow, no more furrows of tears, no more distress, no
   more changes, no more fading, no more death; but all shall be fair, and
   radiant, and full of life, as in Him that said, "Behold . . . that it
   is I myself."

   There are one or two further remarks to be made on this doctrine, and
   with them I will conclude.

   And first; it throws a great light upon the true doctrine of what the
   Church is. We are so inclined to take a shallow and external view of
   it^ and to limit its character and office to this world, and to the
   successions of time, that we miss the real nature of the visible
   Church. It is not a form or piece of mechanism, moulded by the human
   will, or put together for the uses and expedients of men and nations;
   but a mystery, partaking of a sacramental character, framed and
   ordained by God Himself. In a word, the Church is the root of the new
   creation, which shall be raised in its fulness at the last day; it is
   in part earthly, in part heavenly; it is both fleshly and spiritual,
   visible and invisible, mortal and immortal; "there is one body and one
   spirit." And it is ever putting off its mortal shroud, casting its sere
   leaves upon the earth, and withdrawing its vitality into its hidden
   source. As the saints fall asleep one by one, the "dust returns to the
   earth as it was, and the spirit returns unto God that gave it." And
   these two miracles are ever working; the bodies of the saints are dying
   daily, their spirits changing to the likeness of their Lord. The earth
   is sowing with holy dust; and the world unseen replenishing with the
   souls of the righteous. The Church is, in very truth, the kingdom of
   the resurrection; which in its secret beginnings is being "fashioned
   beneath in the earth:" and though it pass through miraculous changes,
   yet it is one and the same Church still, even as He was the same Christ
   both before and after He rose from the dead; not two, but one only;
   first mortal, afterwards immortal. So also is the spouse of Christ one
   and the same, both now and hereafter; now imperfect, ever changing,
   outwardly decaying, inwardly transfigured; here after perfect,
   changeless, glorious, and eternal. And even now already, in the clear
   foresight of the Everlasting, to whom all things are present in their
   fulness, it is complete in Christ. But to us who see only in part, and
   by broken aspects, and on the outer surface, it is imperfect, and to
   come; but flowing on, and continually unfolding itself from age to age.
   Such, then, is the Church.

   And, lastly; we may learn what is the nature of the holy sacraments.
   Baptism is our first engrafting into the kingdom of the resurrection.
   We are thereby translated from the old creation to the new; from the
   powers of death to life. Our whole nature, in body, soul, and spirit,
   is made to partake of the resurrection of Christ, by the secret working
   of the same Spirit which raised Him from the dead. The nature which saw
   no corruption is the principle of an incorruptible life in us; so that
   it may be said of us, that we are "risen with Christ;" and that not
   only in figure, but in spirit; not only in pledge, but by unity with
   Him, who Himself is "the resurrection and the life." And so, in like
   manner, the holy eucharist is the food of our risen life, the hidden
   manna, the bread of the resurrection. In it we feed on Him who is the
   power of immortality; we are made partakers of the glorified manhood of
   the second Adam, bone of His bone, flesh of His flesh; [119] and, being
   "joined to the Lord," we are "one spirit."

   Therefore, brethren, as men baptised into Christ, and nourished with
   the living bread, you have been brought under the powers of the world
   unseen. The virtue of a holy resurrection is in your mortal bodies; the
   beginnings of the spiritual body are within you: cherish the gift you
   have received; beware how you wound or soil the holy thing "which by
   nature you could not have;" for immortality is a perilous endowment:
   whether in sorrow or in bliss, we must be deathless. And this our
   eternal destiny is now hanging in the balance. What more awful thought
   can the heart of man conceive than the fall of a regenerate spirit?
   what more fearful than the first movement towards declension? "for it
   is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of
   the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have
   tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if
   they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance." [120] The
   body with which we are clothed must either be quickened in holiness
   with our spirit, or it will turn back again toward the second death,
   and through it our spirit also become "twice dead." In the faithful it
   is kept under, and held in check by "the powers of the world to come;"
   but in the faithless it is a haunt of impurity, and a minister of sin
   and hell. Let us watch against the carnal mind; for though it be thrust
   down from its dominion, yet the infection of our nature abides still in
   the regenerate. The immortality which is in us may yet become "earthly,
   sensual, devilish." We may yet be doomed to an unhallowed resurrection,
   and to an endless life "where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not
   quenched." But it is also a blessed thought, that there is a change
   awaiting us. After all our toiling and self-chastisement, there still
   remains with us a fast-cleaving and mysterious evil; and a deep
   consciousness is ever telling us that, do what we may, we must bear the
   grave-clothes of the fall till the morning of the resurrection; that we
   must suffer under the load of an imperfect nature, until God shall
   resolve our sullied manhood into its original dust, and gather it up
   once more in a restored purity. The hope of the resurrection is the
   stay of our souls when they are wearied and baffled in striving against
   the disobedience of our passive nature. At that day we shall be
   delivered from the self which we abhor, and be all pure as the angels
   of God. O healing and kindly death, which shall refine our mortal flesh
   to a spiritual body, and make our lower nature chime with the Eternal
   will in faultless harmony! Let us, then, as they that in pledge and
   promise are risen with Christ, so live in sympathy with the ..world to
   come, that death, and the resurrection of the dead, may be not so much
   a change in our earthly life as the crown of its perfection. Let us so
   live that our earthly course may run on into eternity, and be itself
   eternal. Let us never doubt, because we see no visible tokens to
   bespeak the virtue which is passing on us. The Church itself is but a
   fellowship of men that shall die; but yet she is "all glorious within."
   Wait till the morning of the new creation, and then shall all be
   revealed; and the body, which now shrouds the spirit, shall be as clear
   as the noon-day light; and then shall be seen openly what now is
   shrined within; and "the righteous shine forth as the sun in the
   kingdom of their Father." [121]

SERMON XXVI.

  THE GLORY OF THE RIGHTEOUS.

    ST. MATTHEW xiii. 43.

   "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of
   their Father."

   IT is plain that these words are spoken of the end of the world, and of
   the condition of the righteous in God's eternal kingdom. The purpose
   for which Christ came into the world was, "to bring in everlasting
   righteousness." All other gifts and distributions of grace, mercy, and
   forgiveness, are but parts of this one great and perfect gift. It was
   for righteousness that the whole creation groaned and travailed
   together: wrong, and falsehood, and violence, and impurity, and
   darkness, and the torment of an evil heart, in one word,
   unrighteousness, was both the sin and the misery of mankind.

   So also, in one word, the redemption of man through the blood-shedding
   of Christ is the restoration of righteousness to the world. Noah was
   the "heir of the righteousness which is by faith." [122] The prophecy
   of the Gospel was, that "righteousness" should "look down from heaven;"
   [123] and again we read, "Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let
   the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them
   bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together:" [124]
   "Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your
   fallow ground: for it is time to seek the Lord, till He come and rain
   righteousness upon you." [125] And therefore, when the "Sun of
   righteousness" [126] arose upon the earth, "the ministration of
   righteousness" [127] was brought into the world, "that as sin hath
   reigned unto death, even so might grace reign, through righteousness,
   unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord." [128] And to this end we
   have received the "gift of righteousness," [129] which though perfect
   in itself, is not yet made perfect in us, but is ordered by the laws
   and measures of growth, and slow advancement; and therefore the whole
   mystical body of Christ, which is so made one with Him, that He is made
   "righteousness" unto us, is still waiting "for the hope of
   righteousness by faith." [130] All the regenerate are brought, by the
   working of His grace, into a relation to the perfect righteousness of
   His person and His kingdom; and they that are of faith shall partake in
   fulness what they now have only in pledge. "The path of the just," or
   "righteous," "is as the shining light, which shineth more and more unto
   the perfect day; "and "at His coming and His kingdom" they shall be
   "arrayed in fine linen, clean and white," which is "the righteousness
   of saints." [131] Such is the meaning of our Lord's words: "Then shall
   the righteous shine forth as the sun." From which we may learn:--

   In the first place, that righteousness is a gift which lies hid in us
   here in this earthly life; and that, partly because it is a thing in
   its very nature spiritual and inward, dwelling in the soul of man; and
   partly because it is concealed by the imperfections of our being, by
   the decay of our bodily frame, and the like. In this life it is so
   disguised, so shrouded in our mortality, and so mixed up with the
   changes and conditions of this world, that the gift of righteousness is
   rather an object of faith than of sight. We do, indeed, at all times
   see the tokens of its presence; but what we behold, and all that is
   indicated by the tokens we see, is but a very small measure of that
   abounding grace of righteousness which, like leaven in the mass, is hid
   in the world, for the restoration of mankind to eternal life. For
   instance, we are delivered from the power of death, and yet we must
   die; we are made righteous, and yet we are alloyed with imperfections.
   The very fact of death is full of mystery. We are delivered from death
   by dying; and, though redeemed from it, we must fall under its power.
   It is upon us at all times; all pains, and sicknesses, and gnawing
   diseases, and deadly humours which through life gather in us,--all
   these are death. All our life long we are in death; in very truth, we
   are dead while we live; for all the sufferings of the flesh are the
   shadows and the forerunners and the workings of death in us; all the
   bodily ills which fasten and prey upon mankind are laws of the kingdom
   of death. And so it has pleased God to ordain that even the righteous
   shall die; that they shall be bowed and bent with ills of the flesh,
   scathed and withered up by the powers of the visible world, by cold and
   heat, and pestilence, and famine, and the like; that their earthly
   nature shall be as it were warred upon, and beat down, and brought into
   bondage by the strife of matter. The earthly bodies of the holiest are
   oftentimes "marred more than any man" by sharp pains, and lingering
   anguish, and fearful forms of fleshly evil; or if not so afflicted, yet
   we see the faculties of nature decay, the sight wax dim, and the ear
   heavy, and the whole man grow weak and weary, and spent with bearing
   the burden and the load of a sinking body. And not only so, but even
   the powers which are most closely allied to the soul, which seem to
   inhere in the spiritual life, they too give way, or are hidden; as if
   they retired from manifestation and outward exercise, all the organs
   through which they were wont to act being blunted, and withdrew
   themselves into the depth of our secret immortality: "In the day when
   the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow
   themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that
   look out of the windows be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the
   streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at
   the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought
   low; also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears
   shall be in the way, and the almond-tree shall nourish, and the
   grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:" [132] then it
   comes to pass, that the wisest of men turns again to the wandering of a
   child; the most piercing reason is as dull as if it were worn away; the
   memory is misleading and confused; and all the intellectual powers seem
   to be suspended and concealed.

   But there is a greater mystery still. The decay of the flesh, and of
   the intellectual powers, which put themselves forth through the flesh
   and hold converse with this visible world, is a wonderful token of the
   fall, and a mark of humiliation left still upon the redeemed; yet all
   these powers and energies are external to the spiritual life, and abide
   rather at its circumference than in its centre; and therefore, though
   it must ever be an awful sight to behold even the righteous wasting
   away by natural decline, and, year by year, becoming dead, and bereft
   of the powers of our bodily and intellectual nature, yet it is in
   harmony with the laws which order all things. It is a sight full of
   deep and sorrowful thoughts, to see a man once endowed with strength,
   and wisdom, and knowledge, and skill, and power of speech, and with
   unbending firmness, whose whole life seemed to be taken up into one
   energy of righteousness, year by year passing off, unknown to himself,
   into lower and feebler movements, and at last so changed and clouded as
   to outlive his very self. And yet there are around us things which
   speak, as in a parable, of such decays. All the changes of nature--the
   falling of sapless branches, and the gathering clouds which hide the
   light of heaven--are so many mute witnesses, that there is none
   changeless and abiding but God alone; and that the powers of life are
   secret, often hid, without manifestation or a visible presence.

   But there is a mystery of humiliation even greater than this, into
   which, also, the righteous are permitted to enter. It is most certain
   that they partake, moreover, of what may be called the spiritual decays
   of old age. Sometimes, indeed, the righteous depart like Moses, the
   servant of the Lord, who "was an hundred and twenty years old when he
   died," and yet "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated:" but
   if we look at Jacob, and Eli, and David, and Solomon, and many more,
   and at many also of whom we read in the history of the Church, or whom
   we ourselves see around us, we shall discern that the decays of nature
   are felt also in the habits and powers of the spiritual life; and the
   moral failings which beset old age gather even about those in whom is
   the gift of righteousness. We see them, for instance, more or less
   under what may be called the powers of dissolution. Even the best of
   men, when they grow old, become credulous, and irresolute, and of a
   weak will, and feeble in self-control, and are quickly kindled, and
   haunted by false fears and fanciful suspicions, and break out into
   little eccentricities, and are sensitive if remarked upon, or resisted,
   or advised.

   And these little mists rise up and draw a haze over the brightness of
   the spirit. Without doubt, the righteous, who have made provision by
   self-discipline, and subjugation of temper, in the time of strength,
   have a great and visible advantage over all others-, yet it is not to
   be denied that even they, when they come under decay, enter into the
   shadows of our human infirmity.

   But I have thus far spoken only of the partial and casual obscurations
   which the righteous suffer at certain seasons and in certain states of
   life: it is also most evident, however, that all the righteous are,
   here in this life, as it were, under a cloud. It is true of every man
   living in the power of his regeneration, that he is for the most part
   hid from sight. The weakness of his nature, even though regenerate,
   baffles and dims the light which is struggling outward from within.
   This is the very condition of his sanctification: for the thing which
   by nature he could not have, is working mightily, subduing all things
   to itself; "but we see not yet all things put under" it. As is Christ's
   kingdom in the world, so is the beginning of righteousness in each
   several man. It has a deep root, striking out on every side, putting
   forth new energies, changing things inwardly into its own likeness,
   revealing itself outwardly by signs, and tokens, and a visible form,
   but is itself hidden and invisible. So far as the eye of the world
   reaches, the holy Catholic Church is no more than any other visible
   polity, and not the richest, nor strongest, nor, in an earthly sense,
   the most politic or prosperous. On the whole, though it is evidently
   something that has its own character and its own meaning, and is
   fulfilling some definite aim, whatsoever that aim be--and the world
   little knows or cares--still it has no overwhelming proofs of sanctity,
   no obtrusive tokens of a hidden life. Though it be both holy and
   visible, yet there is an inwardness and a retirement about it, even in
   its visibleness; and what is this but to say, that it is perfection
   dwelling in an imperfect form; eternity in time; heaven in earth;
   infinity in the finite; a shadow of its mysterious Head, in whom
   "dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily?" And therefore the
   Church has seemed, at times, to wane and to wax dim, and, at times, to
   grow dark outwardly; at the best it has exhibited to the world but a
   chequered light; rather a promise than a full orb of brightness.

   So has it ever been, and ever shall be, with the righteous. They look
   like other men; they have the same wants, the same toils, the same
   gains and losses, the same sicknesses and decays, the same besetting
   infirmities of a fallen nature; though there be something in them which
   often makes itself felt from within, and seems to be at the point of
   shewing itself openly to the world, yet it still lies under a veil. The
   light of the righteous does indeed "shine before men," but not in all
   its fulness: enough to bespeak the gift that is in them, but not to
   unfold its breadth and glory. Men can see that they are in some way
   higher than themselves; that "greater is He that is in" them "than he
   that is in the world:" but they cannot put together the characters that
   are impressed upon them, and read their meaning; just as men can tell
   that a secret cipher is a written language, though they cannot unravel
   what it says. Therefore the world, in all ages, has ever either
   blackened and maligned the righteous, or, at least, has distorted and
   deformed their character and actions. Nay, even more, the righteous
   themselves know but in part; they are too weak of sight to behold all
   that God is doing within them; they know that they have received a
   great gift from Him; that they have powers, and capacities, and
   sympathies, and an energy derived from the Infinite and Eternal; that
   wisdom, and love, and mercy, and purity, have no measure or limit,
   except the nature in which they dwell; as the powers of seeing or of
   knowing are limited only by the organisation of the body, and the
   conditions by which we attain to knowledge: and yet, with this teeming
   consciousness, the secret of their regeneration is not half known, even
   by themselves; they cannot comprehend it, because they are comprehended
   by it, as a thing that is greater than they; and in it they have their
   being; and nevertheless, as, on the one side, they are baffled by the
   greatness of the gift, so, on the other, are they straitened by the
   littleness of their own finite capacities. They feel themselves beset
   by earthly tempers, and narrow thoughts, and shadows which fall
   inwardly upon their hearts, and to their own eyes they seem to be of a
   dim and earthly nature; they know of themselves far more evil than
   good; the visible and prominent points of their own character are the
   darker lines, and the gloomier spots, which lie upon the surface; in
   their own sight they have no brightness, or, at the best, a pale sickly
   light, often overcast; and they ask, "Can this be the gift of
   righteousness? Can this swerving will, and faint striving, and ready
   yielding, and often slumbering, and all this throng of hasty tempers,
   and high thoughts, and unchastened imaginations, can all this dwell in
   the soul of the righteous? Am I not passing a cheat upon myself,
   counting myself to be what I am not?" And how must all this perplexity
   be multiplied when a righteous man falls, be it never so little, from
   his obedience; when to the abiding sense of inward evil is added the
   consciousness of fresh trangressions! What a mystery is the life of
   David, the man after God's own heart! how clouded and obscured, and
   that not by false tongues, but by his own evil deeds!

   Now, from all this we may see what is the hiddenness of our spiritual
   life--how little it is perceived and understood by others--how
   imperfectly it is apprehended even by ourselves--how it may be for a
   time, as it were, altogether hidden from our own eyes; and yet we feel
   within us some thing which prophesies of our lot in God's kingdom, and
   foretels the perfection of our being here after; we feel something
   which pledges to us that we shall not fall back again to the dominion
   of unrighteousness; something which assures us that we shall not be for
   ever bounded by the limits of imperfection: we feel yearnings, and
   aspirations, and breathing hopes, and conscious energies, which reach
   after a larger sphere of being. And so it shall be; for "the righteous
   shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father."

   We learn, then, in the next place, that this gift of righteousness,
   which now lies hid in us, shall hereafter be unfolded in its perfection
   in the kingdom of God: that is to say, when all things are fulfilled,
   and the end is come, and the righteous shall have passed through all
   the changes which lie between the decay of our mortal bodies and our
   perfect renewal in the image of God; that is, at the resurrection, when
   the whole man, in body, soul, and spirit, shall be raised from the
   dead, "then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun." By "the
   kingdom of their Father," therefore, is meant the kingdom of the
   resurrection. Then shall all that here lay hid in them be unfolded; all
   shall be perfect, and enlarged to an ineffable perfection. The very
   body shall become a vessel of glory, being made like to the glorious
   body of the second Adam; of whom, even in the days of His flesh, we
   read, in His one only season of transient brightness, that "His raiment
   was white and glistering," "white as the light," "exceeding white as
   snow, so as no fuller on earth can white them;" "and His face did shine
   as the sun:" so with our flesh; "it is sown in weakness, it is raised
   in power; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory." The body in
   which we have groaned "being burdened," in which we have often fainted
   and fallen back from "the law of the Spirit of life," in which we have
   been bowed down to earth with blindness, and deafness, and deadness of
   powers and sense,--even that same earthly frame shall be full of life,
   and penetrated with the light of heaven. There shall be in it no more
   any law warring against the law of the Spirit; no division of the man
   against himself; no strife in the being of the righteous: but the
   glorious body shall be the glad minister of a holy will, and quickened
   by the pervading unity of the glorified spirit. And we know that "they
   which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the
   resurrection from the dead," cannot "die any more; for they are equal
   to the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the
   resurrection." [133] Nay, more; we shall bear the likeness of the Son
   of God, of whom we read, when He appeared to St. John, that "His
   countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength." [134]

   And yet the glory of the body would seem to be chiefly but the
   manifestation of the glory of the spirit. Then shall our regeneration
   be fulfilled: "We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."
   What this mysterious likeness may mean, it is not for us too curiously
   to inquire. Certainly, we know that every saint while on earth has had
   impressed upon him by the hand of God his own definite character; and
   yet all have been likened to their Lord. All their several features of
   distinctness were comprehended in the perfect mind of Christ. They were
   all conformed to Him; they were all knit in unity together, by their
   universal likeness to one common pattern; and so shall they doubtless
   be hereafter, when the faint beginnings of perfection shall be unfolded
   in the fulness of God's kingdom. All the bonds and fetters of
   imperfection, all the heavy burden of earth and sinfulness, and all
   that checked or thwarted the energies of their regenerate
   spirit,--shall be abolished; and all that was in them of heaven and of
   God--all holy affections, and pure thoughts, and righteous
   intentions,--shall break forth into the perfection of glory. All that
   Noah, Daniel, and Job, or David, and Paul, and John, sought and strove
   to be, by self-chastisement, and prayer, and righteousness of life,
   such they shall be at "the manifestation of the sons of God." We see
   now in those around us, that each one has some characteristic feature:
   in the mind of one we see a deep wisdom; of another, a saintly
   meekness; of another, an angelic contemplation; of another, a burning
   charity;--each one being a law, a pattern to himself. We see, too, that
   this characteristic feature is ever corning out into a fuller shape,
   drawing towards its own perfect idea. So may we believe that, in the
   kingdom of the resurrection, all the gifts of God, all graces of the
   heart, and all endowments of the sanctified reason, shall then be made
   perfect: without doubt all that constitutes the mysterious
   individuality of each several man; all the inscrutable features by
   which his spiritual being is distinguished, without being opposed to,
   or divided from, the spirits of other men, shall be perpetuated
   hereafter; and then shall all differences be harmonised in the
   perfection of bliss, as all hues are blended in the unity of light.
   Sacraments, and prophecies, and signs, and all economies of grace, and
   shadows of truth, shall all have passed away; and this busy world, and
   all the works of it, shall be burned up; and all worldly sciences shall
   be abolished, and all false theories of truth, and all false hood which
   is interwoven with the truth, and all vain and unprofitable learning,
   shall be no more. And yet must we not believe, that as all that we have
   here received of grace, so also all that we have received of truth,
   shall be perfected and made eternal? All the mysteries of the Divine
   Mind, of which we have here partaken, shall surely still abide in the
   illuminated spirit. In the many orders and ranks of the blessed there
   shall be an ascent and scale of being. All the powers and endowments of
   the individual mind, and of all its contemplative energies, and all the
   characters and forms which truth has impressed upon the sons of wisdom
   in this life, shall doubtless then be carried onward to the fulness of
   knowledge; all shall be full of light, and yet all shall not be of an
   equal measure; all shall be admitted to the beatific vision, but some
   shall behold with a more piercing gaze; as it is here, so shall it be
   there. Manifold and inexhaustible variety is one of the tokens of the
   Divine Mind upon His visible works. It may be, that were all alike, it
   would be as the dull sound of one change less tone, without fall or
   harmony. As height, and breadth, and depth, and order, and degrees, and
   multitude, and unity, are laws of God's kingdom, so also is harmony,
   which is the unity of things various and manifold; and so, when "the
   righteous shine forth as the sun," all the individual perfection which
   has lain hid in the saints shall issue forth and blend into the eternal
   light. On the twelve gates of the heavenly Jerusalem are "the names of
   the twelve tribes of the children of Israel;" [135] on the twelve
   foundations "the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb;" the hundred
   and forty and four thousand were sealed each one in the name of his
   tribe; to him that overcometh shall be given "a white stone, and in the
   stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
   it." Each one several and distinct, even as here, so shall he be there;
   each one shining forth in his own blessedness; and yet the song of the
   redeemed, the everlasting chant of "all nations, and kindred, and
   people, and tongues," is but one; their voices without number, yet but
   one accordant hymn; so shall all perfection, and all righteousness, and
   all bliss, and all thanksgiving, be perfect in every saint, and united
   in one heavenly glory, which shall encompass the righteous.

   O wonderful and blessed thought, that the gift which is in us shall one
   day have the mastery over all obstructions; that all sins, and faults,
   and weaknesses, and ignorance, and all decay and wandering, and all the
   clouds which rest upon mortality, and all the hinderances of the world
   and of the flesh, shall be taken away; and that we shall be ripened
   into a mysterious perfection of the spiritual being! Blessed thought,
   and full of freshness and calm to the weary and heavy-laden, one day
   all their oppressions shall be rolled back from them, and they shall
   "shine forth as the sun!" Let us beware how we judge one another. Who
   knows what may lie hid in the man whom we slight and cast out as of no
   esteem? who can say how he may outshine his fellows in the kingdom of
   the resurrection? "We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to
   be without honour: how is he numbered with the children of God, and his
   lot is among the saints! Therefore have we erred from the way of truth,
   and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun of
   righteousness rose not upon us." [136] Wonderful and over whelming, to
   behold at that day the resurrection of the righteous, each one shining
   forth in his own distinguishable splendour! "Then shall we know even as
   also we are known;" and there shall be strange overrulings of our blind
   judgments. "Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be
   first." The poor man thou despisedst an hour ago shall sit higher than
   thou at the marriage-supper of the Lamb. And the simple and unlearned,
   and the lowly and slow of speech, whom the learned, and eloquent, and
   lofty, and prosperous, have contemned as mean and foolish, shall be
   arrayed in exceeding brightness,, before which they shall be dim and
   naked. Let us also beware how we give much care or thought to any thing
   but to the perfecting of our hidden life. What else is worth living
   for? What else shall endure at Christ's coming? Most awful and
   searching day, when "the light of the moon shall be as the light of the
   sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven
   days!" Let us therefore live ever waiting for that hour. What matter
   though we be poor, slighted, slandered, forgotten, moving in the
   shadows of the world,, so that we attain unto a glorious resurrection?
   O most glad hour, when it shall dawn towards the first day of the
   everlasting week; when there shall be a making ready in the heaven
   above and in the earth beneath; when legions of angels shall gather
   around the Sun of righteousness, and all orders and hosts of heaven
   shall know that the time for "the manifestation of the sons of God" is
   come! What joy shall there be at that hour in the world unseen! and
   what a thrill, as of a penetrating light, shall run through the dust
   where the saints are sleeping! When was there ever such a day-spring
   since the time when "God said, Let there be light, and there was
   light?" He shall come, and all His shining ones; ten thousand times ten
   thousand, whose countenances are "like lightning," and their "raiment
   white as snow;" all the heavenly court,--angels, archangels, cherubim
   and seraphim,--clad in unimaginable splendours; and the righteous shall
   arise from the grave, and the earth shall be lightened with their
   glory; they shall stretch forth their hands to meet Him, and bow
   themselves before the brightness of His coming. O blessed hour, after
   all the sorrows, and wrongs, and falsehoods, and darkness, and burdens
   of life, to see Him face to face; to be made sinless; to shine with an
   exceeding strength; to be as the light, in which there "is no darkness
   at all!" Be this our hope, our chiefest toil, our almost only prayer.

  THE END.
