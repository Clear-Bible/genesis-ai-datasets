THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

    OF THE

REV. JOHN BAMPTON,

    CANON OF SALISBURY.

   . . . . "I give and bequeath my Lands and Estates to the Chancellor,
   Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford for ever, to have and
   to hold all and singular the said Lands or Estates upon trust, and to
   the intents and purposes hereinafter mentioned; that is to say, I will
   and appoint that the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford for
   the time being shall take and receive all the rents, issues, and
   profits thereof, and (after all taxes, reparations, and necessary
   deductions made) that he pay all the remainder to the endowment of
   eight Divinity Lecture Sermons, to be established for ever in the said
   University, and to be performed in the manner following:

   "I direct and appoint, that, upon the first Tuesday in Easter Term, a
   Lecturer be yearly chosen by the Heads of Colleges only, and by no
   others, in the room adjoining to the Printing-House, between the hours
   of ten in the morning and two in the afternoon, to preach eight
   Divinity Lecture Sermons, the year following, at St. Mary's in Oxford,
   between the commencement of the last month in Lent Term, and the end of
   the third week in Act Term. "Also I direct and appoint, that the eight
   Divinity Lecture Sermons shall be preached upon either of the following
   Subjects--to confirm and establish the Christian Faith, and to confute
   all heretics and schismatics--upon the divine authority of the holy
   Scriptures--upon the authority of the writings of the primitive
   Fathers, as to the faith and practice of the primitive Church--upon the
   Divinity of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ--upon the Divinity of the
   Holy Ghost--upon the Articles of the Christian Faith, as comprehended
   in the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds.

   "Also I direct, that thirty copies of the eight Divinity Lecture
   Sermons shall be always printed, within two months after they are
   preached, and one copy shall be given to the Chancellor of the
   University, and one copy to the Head of every College, and one copy to
   the Mayor of the city of Oxford, and one copy to be put into the
   Bodleian Library; and the expense of printing them shall be paid out of
   the revenue of the Land or Estates given for establishing the Divinity
   Lecture Sermons; and the Preacher shall not be paid, nor be entitled to
   the revenue, before they are printed.

   "Also I direct and appoint, that no person shall be qualified to preach
   the Divinity Lecture Sermons, unless he hath taken the degree of Master
   of Arts at least, in one of the two Universities of Oxford or
   Cambridge; and that the same person shall never preach the Divinity
   Lecture Sermons twice."

PUBLISHERS' ADVERTISEMENT TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.

   The work, here offered to the American public, has been received with
   the most marked attention in England, and has already reached a third
   edition, though but few months have elapsed since the issue of the
   first. It is believed that its great merits will command for it a like
   attention wherever it is known; the rare learning and metaphysical
   ability with which it discusses problems, no less profound in their
   philosophical nature than practical in their religious applications;
   the devout reverence for the authority of the Bible, and the truly
   Christian spirit with which it is imbued, must gain for it a cherished
   place in the minds and hearts of all who wish well to a sound
   philosophy, and a pure, and we may add, a real, Christianity. In its
   more immediate aspect, it is eminently a work for the present times; so
   closely is it connected with the higher thinking of the present
   generation, and so boldly and triumphantly does it carry the Christian
   argument through the entire course of recent, and especially German,
   speculation. But rightly viewed, these Lectures of Mr. Mansel have a
   far wider scope than this; for, in unfolding his great theme, the
   author aims to lay the foundations of a sound religious philosophy in
   the laws of the human mind, and in the general conditions to which it
   is thereby necessarily subject in the attainment of all truth and
   knowledge; his work therefore belongs, in its principles and
   applications, to all periods of human inquiry, and is thus invested
   with a universal interest and a permanent value.

   But without enlarging upon the general merits of this work, the
   Publishers have only to mention the single change of any importance,
   which it has undergone in the present reprint. This change is the
   translation in the author's learned Notes--a most valuable portion of
   his work--of the numerous passages from foreign writers, Greek, Latin,
   French, and German, which in the English edition appear in the original
   languages. It has been thought best to translate these passages, in
   order to bring them within the reach of all general readers; and it is
   hoped that this proceeding will be regarded by scholars with indulgence
   at least, if not with entire approval.

   The translations have been made by Prof. John L. Lincoln, of Brown
   University, whose reputation as a scholar is deemed by the Publishers a
   sufficient guaranty for the execution of the work. It has been the
   translator's endeavor to reproduce the original with as much fidelity
   as possible; and to make only such departures, even in the form of the
   thought, as the English idiom seemed to require. The difficulties
   belonging to the task of translating isolated passages from so many and
   so different writers, will doubtless be best understood by those who
   are most familiar with the languages in which they are written, and
   with the abstruse subjects which they discuss.

   An Index of the Authors, quoted in the work, has been also prepared for
   the American edition, which will be of great service to readers, and
   will indicate the wide and various range of Mr. Mansel's studies.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.

   THE various Criticisms to which these Lectures have been subjected
   since the publication of the last Edition, seem to call for a few
   explanatory remarks on the positions principally controverted. Such
   remarks may, it is hoped, contribute to the clearer perception of the
   argument in places where it has been misunderstood, and are also
   required in order to justify the republication, with little more than a
   few verbal alterations, of the entire work in its original form.

   On the whole, I have no reason to complain of my Critics. With one or
   two exceptions, the tone of their observations has been candid,
   liberal, and intelligent, and in some instances more favorable than I
   could have ventured to expect. An argument so abstruse, and in some
   respects so controversial, must almost inevitably call forth a
   considerable amount of opposition; and such criticism is at least
   useful in stimulating further inquiry, and in pointing out to an author
   those among his statements which appear most to require explanation or
   defence. If it has not done more than this, it is because the original
   argument was not put forth without much previous consideration, nor
   without anticipation of many of the objections to which it was likely
   to be exposed.

   At present, I must confine myself to those explanations which appear to
   be necessary to the right appreciation of the main purposes of the
   work, on the supposition that its fundamental principles may be
   admitted as tenable. To reargue the whole question on first principles,
   or to reply minutely to the criticisms on subordinate details, would
   require a larger space than can be allotted to a preface, and would be
   at least premature at the present stage of the controversy, while the
   work has in all probability not yet completed the entire course of
   criticism which a new book is destined to undergo if it succeeds in
   attracting any amount of public attention.

   In the first place, it may be desirable to obviate some
   misapprehensions concerning the design of the work as a whole. It
   should be remembered, that to answer the objections which have been
   urged against Christianity, or against any religion, is not to prove
   the religion to be true. It only clears the ground for the production
   of the proper evidences. It shows, so far as it is successful, that the
   religion may be true, notwithstanding the objections by which it has
   been assailed; but it cannot by itself convert this admission into a
   positive belief. It only calls for an impartial hearing of the other
   grounds on which the question must be decided.

   When, therefore, a critic objects to the present argument, that "the
   presence of contradictions is no proof of the truth of a system;" that
   "we are not entitled to erect on this ethereal basis a superstructure
   of theological doctrine, only because it, too, possesses the same
   self-contradictions;" that "the argument places all religions and
   philosophies on precisely the same level;"--he merely charges it with
   accomplishing the very purpose which it was intended to accomplish. So
   far as certain difficulties are inherent in the constitution of the
   human mind itself, they must of necessity occupy the same position with
   respect to all religions,--the false no less than the true. It is
   sufficient if it can be shown that they have not, as is too often
   supposed, any peculiar force against Christianity alone. No sane man
   dreams of maintaining that a religion is true because of the
   difficulties which it involves: the utmost that can reasonably be
   maintained is that it may be true in spite of them. Such an argument of
   course requires, as its supplement, a further consideration of the
   direct evidences of Christianity; and this requirement is pointed out
   in the concluding Lecture. But it formed no part of my design to
   exhibit in detail the evidences themselves;--a task which the many
   excellent works already existing on that subject would have rendered
   wholly unnecessary, even if it could have been satisfactorily
   accomplished within the limits of the single Lecture which alone could
   have been given to it.

   But granting for the present the main position of these Lectures,
   namely, that the human mind inevitably and by virtue of its essential
   constitution, finds itself involved in self-contradictions whenever it
   ventures on certain courses of speculation; it may be asked, in the
   next place, what conclusion does this admission warrant, as regards the
   respective positions of Faith and Reason in determining the religious
   convictions of men. These Lectures have been charged with condemning,
   under the name of Dogmatism, all Dogmatic Theology; with censuring,
   "the exercise of Reason in defence and illustration of the truths of
   Revelation;" with including "schoolmen and saints and infidels alike"
   in one and the same condemnation. Such sweeping assertions are surely
   not warranted by anything that is maintained in the Lectures
   themselves. Dogmatism and Rationalism are contrasted with each other,
   not as employing reason for opposite purposes, but as employing it in
   extremes. The contrast was naturally suggested by the historical
   connection between the Wolfian philosophy and the Kantian, the one as
   the stronghold of Dogmatism, the other of Rationalism. The religious
   philosophy of Wolf and his followers, whose system, and not that of
   either "'schoolmen or saints," is cited as the chief specimen of
   Dogmatism, was founded on the assumption that philosophical proofs of
   theological doctrines were absolutely necessary in all cases. "He
   maintained," says a writer quoted in the Notes, "that philosophy was
   indispensable to theology, and that, together with biblical proofs, a
   mathematical or strictly demonstrative dogmatical system, according to
   the principles of reason, was absolutely necessary." Dogmatism, as thus
   exemplified, is surely not the use of reason in theology, but its
   abuse. Unless a critic is prepared to accept, as legitimate reasoning,
   Canz's demonstration of the Trinity, cited at p. 232 of the present
   volume, or the more modern specimen of the same method noticed at p.
   51, he must surely admit the conclusion which these instances were
   adduced to prove; namely, that the methods of the Dogmatist and the
   Rationalist are alike open to criticism, "in so far as they keep
   within, or go beyond those limits of sound thought which the laws of
   man's mind, or the circumstances in which he is placed, have imposed
   upon him."

   All Dogmatic Theology is not Dogmatism, nor all use of Reason
   Rationalism, any more than all drinking is drunkenness. The dogmatic or
   the rational method may be rightly or wrongly employed, and the
   question is to determine the limits of the legitimate or illegitimate
   use of each. It is expressly as extremes that the two systems are
   contrasted: each is described as leading to error in its exclusive
   employment, yet as being, in its utmost error, only a truth abused. If
   reason may not be used without restriction in the defence any more than
   in the refutation of religious doctrines; if there are any mysteries of
   revelation which it is our duty to believe, though we cannot
   demonstrate them from philosophical premises,--this is sufficient to
   show that the provinces of Faith and Reason are not coextensive. But to
   assert this is surely not to deny, that the dogmatic method may be and
   has been rightly used within certain limits. The dogmatism which is
   condemned is not system, but the extravagance of system. If systematic
   completeness is made the end which the theologian is bound to pursue,
   at every cost; if whatever is left obscure and partial in revealed
   truth is, as a matter of necessity, to be cleared and completed by
   definitions and inferences, certain or uncertain; if the declarations
   of Scripture are in all cases to be treated as conclusions to be
   supported by philosophical premises, or as principles to be developed
   into philosophical conclusions,--then indeed Dogmatic Theology is in
   danger of degenerating into mere Dogmatism. But it is only the
   indiscriminate use of the method which is condemned, and that not
   simply as an employment of reason in religious questions, but as an
   employment beyond its just limits. And if, in citing instances of this
   misuse, it has been occasionally necessary to point out the errors of
   writers whose names are justly honored in the Church, and whose labors,
   as a whole, are entitled to the reverence and gratitude of posterity, I
   wish distinctly to state, that the censure, such as it is, reaches only
   to the points directly indicated, by reference or quotation, and is not
   intended to apply further.

   What, then, is the practical lesson which these Lectures are designed
   to teach concerning the right use of reason in religious questions? and
   what are the just claims of a reasonable faith, as distinguished from a
   blind credulity? In the first place, it is obvious that, if there is
   any object whatever of which the human mind is unable to form a clear
   and distinct conception, the inability equally disqualifies us for
   proving or disproving a given doctrine, in all cases in which such a
   conception is an indispensable condition of the argument. If, for
   example, we can form no positive notion of the Nature of God as an
   Infinite Being, we are not entitled either to demonstrate the mystery
   of the Trinity as a necessary property of that Nature, or to reject it
   as necessarily inconsistent therewith. Such mysteries clearly belong,
   not to Reason, but to Faith; and the preliminary inquiry which
   distinguishes a reasonable from an unreasonable belief, must be
   directed, not to the premises by which the doctrine can be proved or
   disproved as reasonable or unreasonable, but to the nature of the
   authority on which it rests, as revealed or unrevealed. The brief
   summary of Christian Evidences contained in my concluding Lecture, [1]
   and others which might be added to them, are surely sufficient to form
   an ample field for the use of Reason, even in regard to those mysteries
   which it cannot directly examine. If to submit to an authority which
   can stand the test of such investigations, and to believe it when it
   tells us of things which we are unable to investigate,--if this be
   censured as a blind credulity, it is a blindness which in these things
   is a better guide than the opposite quality so justly described by the
   philosopher as "the sharp-sightedness of little souls."

   In the second place, a caution is needed concerning the kind of
   evidence which reason is competent to furnish within the legitimate
   sphere of its employment. If we have not such a conception of the
   Divine Nature as is sufficient for the a priori demonstration of
   religious truth, our rational conviction in any particular case must be
   regarded, not as a certainty, but as a probability. We must remember
   the Aristotelian rule, to be content with such evidence as the nature
   of the object-matter allows. A single infallible criterion of all
   religious truth can be obtained only by the possession of a perfect
   Philosophy of the Infinite. If such a philosophy is unattainable; if
   the infinite can only be apprehended under finite symbols, and the
   authority of those symbols tested by finite evidences,--there is always
   room for error, in consequence of the inadequacy of the conception to
   express completely the nature of the object. In other words, we must
   admit that human reason, though not worthless, is at least fallible, in
   dealing with religious questions; and that the probability of error is
   always increased in proportion to the partial nature of the evidence
   with which it deals. Those who set up some one supreme criterion of
   religious truth, their "Christian consciousness," their "religious
   intuitions," their "moral reason," or any other of the favorite idols
   of the subjective school of theologians, and who treat with contempt
   every kind of evidence which does not harmonize with this, are
   especially liable to be led into error. They use the weight without the
   counterpoise, to the imminent peril of their mental equilibrium. This
   is the caution which it was the object of my concluding Lecture to
   enforce, principally by means of two practical rules; namely, first,
   that the true evidence, for or against a religion, is not to be found
   in any single criterion, but in the result of many presumptions
   examined and compared together; and, secondly, that in proportion to
   the weight of the counter-evidence in favor of a religion, is the
   probability that we may be mistaken in supposing a particular class of
   objections to have any real weight at all.

   These considerations are no less applicable to moral than to
   speculative reasonings. The moral faculty, though furnishing
   undoubtedly some of the most important elements for the solution of the
   religious problem, is no more entitled than any other single principle
   of the human mind to be accepted as a sole and sufficient criterion. It
   is true that to our sense of moral obligation we owe our primary
   conception of God as a moral Governor; and it is also true that, were
   man left solely to a priori presumptions in forming his estimate of the
   nature and attributes of God, the moral sense, as being that one of all
   human faculties whose judgments are least dependent on experience,
   would furnish the principal, if not the only characteristics of his
   highest conception of God. But here, as elsewhere, the original
   presumption is modified and corrected by subsequent experience. It is a
   fact which experience forces upon us, and which it is useless, were it
   possible, to disguise, that the representation of God after the model
   of the highest human morality which we are capable of conceiving, is
   not sufficient to account for all the phenomena exhibited by the course
   of His natural Providence. The infliction of physical suffering, the
   permission of moral evil, the adversity of the good, the prosperity of
   the wicked, the crimes of the guilty involving the misery of the
   innocent, the tardy appearance and partial distribution of moral and
   religious knowledge in the world,--these are facts which no doubt are
   reconcilable, we know not how, with the Infinite Goodness of God; but
   which certainly are not to be explained on the supposition that its
   sole and sufficient type is to be found in the finite goodness of man.
   What right, then, has the philosopher to assume that a criterion which
   admits of so many exceptions in the facts of nature may be applied,
   without qualification or exception, to the statements of revelation?

   The assertion that human morality contains in it a temporal and
   relative element, and cannot, in its highest manifestation, be regarded
   as a complete measure of the absolute Goodness of God, has been
   condemned by one critic as "rank Occamism," [2] and contrasted with the
   teaching of "that marvellously profound, cautious, and temperate
   thinker," Bishop Butler; it has been denounced by another, of a very
   different school, as "destructive of healthful moral perception." That
   the doctrine in question, instead of being opposed to Butler, is
   directly taken from him, may be seen by any one who will take the
   trouble to read the extract from the Analogy quoted at p. 211. But it
   is of little importance by what authority an opinion is sanctioned, if
   it will not itself stand the test of sound criticism. The admission,
   that a divine command may, under certain circumstances, justify all act
   which would not be justifiable without it, is condemned by some critics
   as holding out an available excuse for any crime committed under any
   circumstances. If God can suspend, on any one occasion, the ordinary
   obligations of morality, how, it is asked, are we to know whether any
   criminal may not equally claim a divine sanction for his crimes? Now
   where, as in the present instance, the supposed exceptions are
   expressly stated as supernatural ones, analogous to the miraculous
   suspension of the ordinary laws of nature, this objection either proves
   too much, or proves nothing at all. If we believe in the possibility of
   a supernatural Providence at all, we may also believe that God is able
   to authenticate His own mission by proper evidences. The objection has
   no special relation to questions of moral duty. It may be asked, in
   like manner, how we are to distinguish a true from a false prophet, or
   a preacher sent by God from one acting on his own responsibility. The
   possibility of a special divine mission of any kind will of course be
   denied by those who reject the supernatural altogether; but this denial
   removes the question into an entirely different province of inquiry,
   where it has no relation to any peculiar infallibility supposed to
   attach to the moral reason, above the other faculties of the human
   mind.

   Those who believe, with the Scriptures, that the Almighty has, at
   certain times in the world's history, manifested Himself to certain
   nations or individuals in a supernatural manner, distinct from His
   ordinary government of the world by the institutions of society, will
   scarcely be disposed to admit the assumption, that God could not on
   such occasions justify by His own authority such acts as are every day
   justified by the authority of the civil magistrate whose power is
   delegated from Him. To assert, with one of my critics, that upon this
   principle, "the deed which is criminal on earth may be praiseworthy in
   heaven," is to distort the whole doctrine and to beg the whole
   question. For we must first answer the previous inquiry: Does not a
   deed performed under such circumstances cease to be criminal at all,
   even upon earth? The question, so far as moral philosophy is concerned,
   is simply this: Is the moral quality of right or wrong an attribute so
   essentially adhering to acts as acts, that the same act can never vary
   in its character according to the motives by which it is prompted, or
   the circumstances under which it is committed? If we are compelled, as
   every moralist is compelled, to answer this question in the negative,
   we must then ask, in the second place, whether the existence of a
   direct command from the supreme Governor of the world, supposing such a
   command ever to have been given, is one of the circumstances which can
   in any degree affect the character of an act. On this question, to
   judge merely by the conflicting statements on opposite sides, men whose
   moral judgments are equally trustworthy may differ one from another;
   but that very difference is enough to show that the moral reason is not
   by itself a sufficient and infallible oracle on such questions. The
   further inquiry, whether such a command has ever, as a matter of fact,
   been given; and how, if given, it can be distinguished from
   counterfeits, is one which does not fall within the province of moral
   philosophy, in itself or in its relation to theology. The philosopher,
   as such, can at most only prepare the way for this inquiry, if he can
   succeed in showing that there is nothing in the moral reason of man
   which entitles it to pronounce on a priori grounds, that such a command
   is absolutely impossible.

   It remains to make some remarks on another of the opinions maintained
   in the following Lectures, on which, to judge by the criticisms to
   which it has been subjected, a few words of explanation may be
   desirable. It has been objected by reviewers of very opposite schools.
   that to deny to man a knowledge of the Infinite is to make Revelation
   itself impossible, and to leave no room for evidences on which reason
   can be legitimately employed. The objection would be pertinent, if I
   had ever maintained that Revelation is or can be a direct manifestation
   of the Infinite Nature of God. But I have constantly asserted the very
   reverse. In Revelation, as in Natural Religion, God is represented
   under finite conceptions, adapted to finite minds; and the evidences on
   which the authority of Revelation rests are finite and comprehensible
   also. It is true that in Revelation, no less than in the exercise of
   our natural faculties, there is indirectly indicated the existence of a
   higher and more absolute truth, which, as it cannot be grasped by any
   effort of human thought, cannot be made the vehicle of any valid
   philosophical criticism. But the comprehension of this higher truth is
   no more necessary, either to a belief in the contents of Revelation or
   to a reasonable examination of its evidences, than a conception of the
   infinite divisibility of matter is necessary to the child before it can
   learn to walk.

   But it is a great mistake to suppose, as some of my critics have
   supposed, that if the Infinite, as an object, is inconceivable,
   therefore the language which denotes it is wholly without meaning, and
   the corresponding state of mind one of complete quiescence. A negative
   idea by no means implies a negation of all mental activity. [3] It
   implies an attempt to think, and a failure in accomplishing the
   attempt. The language by which such ideas are indicated is not like a
   word in an unknown tongue, which excites no corresponding affection in
   the mind of the hearer. It indicates a relation, if only of difference,
   to that of which we are positively conscious, and a consequent effort
   to pass from the one to the other. This is the case even with those
   more obvious negations of thought which arise from the union of two
   incongruous finite notions. We may attempt to conceive a space enclosed
   by two straight lines; and it is not till after the effort has been
   made that we become aware of the impossibility of the conception. And
   it may frequently happen, owing to the use of language as a substitute
   for thought, that a process of reasoning may be carried on to a
   considerable length, without the reasoner being aware of the
   essentially inconceivable character of the objects denoted by his
   terms. This is especially likely when the negative character of the
   notion depends, not, as in the above instance, on the union of two
   attributes which cannot be conceived in conjunction, but on the
   separation of those which cannot be conceived apart. We can analyze in
   language what we cannot analyze in thought; and the presence of the
   language often serves to conceal the absence of the thought. Thus, for
   example, it is impossible to conceive color apart from extension; an
   unextended color is therefore a purely negative notion. Yet many
   distinguished philosophers have maintained that the connection between
   these two ideas is one merely of association, and have argued
   concerning color apart from extension, with as much confidence as if
   their language represented positive thought. The speculations
   concerning the seat of the immaterial soul may be cited as another
   instance of the same kind. Forgetting that, to human thought, position
   in space and occupation of space are notions essentially bound
   together, and that neither can be conceived apart from the other, men
   have carried on various elaborate reasonings, and constructed various
   plausible theories, on the tacit assumption that it is possible to
   assign a local position to an unextended substance. Yet, considering
   that extension itself is necessarily conceived as a relation between
   parts exterior to each other, and that no such relation can be
   conceived as an ultimate and simple element of things, it would be the
   mere dogmatism of ignorance to assert that a relation between the
   extended and the unextended is in itself impossible; though assuredly
   we are unable to conceive how it is possible.

   It is thus manifest that, even granting that all our positive
   consciousness is of the Finite only, it may still be possible for men
   to speculate and reason concerning the Infinite, without being aware
   that their language represents, not thought, but its negation. They
   attempt to separate the condition of finiteness from their conception
   of a given object; and it is not till criticism has detected the
   self-contradiction involved in the attempt, that we learn at last that
   all human efforts to conceive the infinite are derived from the
   consciousness, not of what it is, but only of what it is not. [4]

   Whatever value may be attached, in different psychological theories, to
   that instinct or feeling of our nature which compels us to believe in
   the existence of the Infinite, it is clear that, so long as it remains
   a mere instinct or feeling, it cannot be employed for the purpose of
   theological criticism. The communication of mental phenomena from man
   to man must always be made in the form of thoughts conveyed through the
   medium of language. So long as the unbeliever can only say, "I feel
   that this doctrine is false, but I cannot say why;" so long as the
   believer can only retort, "I feel that it is true, but I can give no
   reason for my feeling,"--there is no common ground on which either can
   hope to influence the other. So long as a man's religion is a matter of
   feeling only, the feeling, whatever may be its influence on himself,
   forms no basis of argument for or against the truth of what he
   believes. But as soon as he interprets his feelings into thoughts, and
   proceeds to make those thoughts the instruments of criticism
   constructive or destructive, he is bound to submit them to the same
   logical criteria to which he himself subjects the religion on which he
   is commenting. In this relation, it matters not what may be the
   character of our feeling of the infinite, provided our conception
   cannot be exhibited without betraying its own inherent weakness by its
   own self-contradictions. That such is the case with that philosophical
   conception of the Absolute and Infinite which has prevailed in almost
   every philosophy of note, from Parmenides to Hegel, it has been the aim
   of these Lectures to show. If a critic maintains that philosophy,
   notwithstanding its past failures, may possibly hereafter succeed in
   bringing the infinite within the grasp of reason, we may be permitted
   to doubt the assertion until the task has been actually accomplished.

   The distinction between speculative and regulative truths, which has
   also been a good deal misapprehended, is one which follows inevitably
   from the abandonment of the philosophy of the Absolute. If human
   thought cannot be traced up to an absolutely first principle of all
   knowledge and all existence; if our highest attainable truths bear the
   marks of subordination to something higher and unattainable,--it
   follows, if we are to act or believe at all, that our practice and
   belief must be based on principles which do not satisfy all the
   requirements of the speculative reason. But it should be remembered
   that this distinction is not peculiar to the evidences of religion. It
   is shown that in all departments of human knowledge alike,--in the laws
   of thought, in the movement of our limbs, in the perception of our
   senses, the truths which guide our practice cannot be reduced to
   principles which satisfy our reason; and that, if religious thought is
   placed under the same restrictions, this is but in strict analogy to
   the general conditions to which God has subjected man in his search
   after truth. One half of the rationalist's objections against revealed
   religion would fall to the ground, if men would not commit the very
   irrational error of expecting clearer conceptions and more rigid
   demonstrations of the invisible things of God, than those which they
   are content to accept and act upon in all the concerns of their earthly
   life.

   The above are all the explanations which, so far as I can at present
   judge, appear to be desirable, to obviate probable misapprehensions
   regarding the general principles advocated in these pages. Had I
   thought it worth while to enter into controversy on minute questions of
   detail, or to reply to misapprehensions which are due solely to the
   inadvertence of individual readers, [5] I might have extended these
   remarks to a considerably greater length. For the present I shall
   content myself with only two further observations; one on a single
   sentence, the language of which, having been misinterpreted in more
   than one quarter, may perhaps need a brief explanation; the other on a
   matter affecting, not the literary merit of these Lectures, but the
   personal honesty of their author.

   The sentence occurs at p. 76, in the following words: "What kind of an
   Absolute Being is that,' says Hegel, which does not contain in itself
   all that is actual, even evil included?' We may repudiate the
   conclusion with indignation; but the reasoning is unassailable. If the
   Absolute and Infinite is an object of human conception at all, this,
   and none other, is the conception required."

   This passage has been censured by more than one critic, as involving
   the skeptical admission that a false conclusion can be logically
   deduced from true premises. The concluding words may explain the real
   meaning. The whole argument is designed to show that to speak of a
   conception of the Absolute implies a self-contradiction at the outset,
   and that to reason upon such a conception involves ab initio a
   violation of the laws of human thought. That reasoning based on this
   assumption must end by annihilating itself, is surely no very dangerous
   concession to the skeptic. Suppose that an author had written such a
   sentence as the following:

   "A circular parallelogram must have its opposite sides and angles
   equal, and must also be such that all lines drawn from the centre to
   the circumference shall be equal to each other. The conclusion is
   absurd; but the reasoning is unassailable, supposing that a circular
   parallelogram can be conceived at all."

   Would such a statement involve any formidable consequences either to
   geometry or to logic?

   It remains only to say a few words on a question of fact, involving one
   of the most serious accusations that can be brought against the
   character of an author. A writer in the Rambler, to whom in other
   respects I feel indebted for a liberal and kindly appreciation of my
   labors, has qualified his favorable judgment by the grave charge that
   the "whole gist of the book" is borrowed without acknowledgment from
   the teaching of Dr. Newman, as a preacher or as a writer. Against a
   charge of this kind there is but one possible defence. No obligation
   was acknowledged, simply because none existed. I say this, assuredly
   with no intention to speak slightingly of one whose transcendent gifts
   no differences should hinder me from acknowledging; but because it is
   necessary, in justice to myself, to state exactly the relation in which
   I stand towards him. Dr. Newman's teaching from the University pulpit
   was almost at its close before my connection with Oxford began: his
   parochial sermons I had very seldom an opportunity of hearing. His
   published writings might doubtless have given me much valuable
   assistance; but with these I was but slightly acquainted when these
   Lectures were first published; and the little that I knew contained
   nothing which appeared to bear upon my argument. This is but one out of
   many deficiencies, of which I have been painfully conscious during the
   progress of the work, and which I would gladly have endeavored to
   supply, had circumstances allowed me a longer time for direct
   preparation.

   The point, indeed, on which the Reviewer lays the most stress, is one
   in which there was little room for originality, either in myself or in
   my supposed teacher. That Revelation is accommodated to the limitations
   of man's faculties, and is primarily designed for the purpose of
   practical religion, and not for those of speculative philosophy, has
   been said over and over again by writers of almost every age, and is
   indeed a truth so obvious that it might have occurred independently to
   almost any number of thinkers. Doubtless there is no truth, however
   trite and obvious, which may not assume a new and striking aspect in
   the hands of a great and original writer; and in this, as in other
   respects, a better acquaintance with Dr. Newman's works might have
   taught me a better mode of expressing many arguments to which my own
   language may have done but imperfect justice. Even at this late hour, I
   am tempted to subjoin, as a conclusion to these observations, one
   passage of singular beauty and truth, of which, had I known it earlier,
   I would gladly have availed myself, as pointing out the true spirit in
   which inquiries like these should be pursued, and the practical lesson
   which they are designed to teach.

   "And should any one fear lest thoughts such as these should tend to a
   dreary and hopeless skepticism, let him take into account the Being and
   Providence of God, the Merciful and True; and he will at once be
   relieved of his anxiety. All is dreary till we believe, what our hearts
   tell us, that we are subjects of His Governance; nothing is dreary, all
   inspires hope and trust, directly we understand that we are under His
   hand, and that whatever comes to us is from Him, as a method of
   discipline and guidance. What is it to us whether the knowledge He
   gives us be greater or less, if it be He who gives it? What is it to us
   whether it be exact or vague, if He bids us trust it? What have we to
   care whether we are or are not given to divide substance from shadow,
   if He is training us heavenward by means of either? Why should we vex
   ourselves to find whether our deductions are philosophical or no,
   provided they are religious? If our senses supply the media by which we
   are put on trial, by which we are all brought together, and hold
   intercourse with each other, and are disciplined, and are taught, and
   enabled to benefit others, it is enough. We have an instinct within us,
   impelling us, we have external necessity forcing us, to trust our
   senses, and we may leave the question of their substantial truth for
   another world, till the day break, and the shadows flee away.' And what
   is true of reliance on our senses, is true of all the information which
   it has pleased God to vouchsafe to us, whether in nature or in grace."
   [6]

   [2] It is in fact the very reverse of the doctrine usually attributed
   to Occam, which admits of no distinction between absolute and relative
   morality, but maintains that, as all distinction of right and wrong
   depends upon obedience or disobedience to a higher authority, therefore
   the Divine Nature must be morally indifferent, and all good and evil
   the result of God's arbitrary Will. The above assertion, on the other
   hand, expressly distinguishes absolute from relative morality, and
   regards human virtue and vice as combining an eternal and a temporal
   element,--the one an absolute principle grounded in the immutable
   nature of God; the other a relative application, dependent upon the
   created constitution of human nature. But I am by no means sure that
   the "Invincible Doctor" has been quite fairly dealt with in this
   matter.

   [3] See Sir W. Hamilton's Discussions, p. 602.

   [4] A critic in the National Review is of opinion that "relative
   apprehension is always and necessarily of two terms together;" and "if
   of the finite, then also of the infinite." This is true as regards the
   meaning of the words; but by no means as regards the conception of the
   corresponding objects. If extended to the latter, it should in
   consistency be asserted that the conception of that which is
   conceivable involves also the conception of that which is
   inconceivable; that the consciousness of anything is also a
   consciousness of nothing; that the intuition of space and time is
   likewise an intuition of the absence of both.

   [5] A writer in the Christian Observer has actually mistaken the
   positions against which the author is contending for those which he
   maintains, and on the strength of this mistake has blundered through
   several pages of vehement denunciation of the monstrous consequences
   which follow from the assumption that the philosophical conception of
   the absolute is the true conception of God. The absolute and the
   infinite, he tells us (in opposition to the Lecturer!!!), "are names of
   God unknown to the Scriptures:" "The conception of infinity is plainly
   negative:" "the absolute and infinite, as defined in the Lectures after
   the leaders of German metaphysics, is no synonym for the true and
   living God:" and "a philosophy of the so-called absolute is a spurious
   theology." Est il possible? The same critic denounces, as "radically
   and thoroughly untrue," the distinction between speculative and
   regulative truths, and the consequent assertion that action, and not
   knowledge, is man's destiny and duty in this life, and that his highest
   principles, both in philosophy and in religion, have reference to this
   end. "On the contrary," he says, "all right action depends on right
   knowledge." As if this were not the very meaning of a regulative
   truth,--knowledge for the sake of action. Another critic asserts that
   the author "sweeps down schoolmen and saints and infidels alike, with
   the assertion that dogmatism and rationalism equally assign to some
   superior tribunal the right of determining what is essential to
   religion and what is not." Had he looked a second time at the page
   which he quotes, he would have seen that this is said of rationalism
   alone.

CONTENTS.

LECTURE I.

   Dogmatism and Rationalism as methods of religious philosophy--meaning
   of these terms--errors of the respective systems denoted by each; the
   one forcing reason into agreement with revelation, the other forcing
   revelation into agreement with reason.--Both methods may be regarded as
   attempts, from opposite sides, to produce exact coincidence between
   belief and thought.--Instances of each exhibited and examined.--Human
   conceptions are unavoidable in Theology; but there is need of some
   principle to determine their proper place in it.--Such a principle can
   only be gained by an investigation of the Limits of Human Thought.--The
   proper object of criticism is not religion, but the human mind in its
   relation to religion.--A direct criticism of religion as a
   representation of God can only be accomplished by the construction of a
   Philosophy of the Infinite.--It is therefore necessary to inquire
   whether such a philosophy is possible; and this can only be ascertained
   by an examination of the laws of human thought in general, which will
   determine those of religious thought in particular.--Analogous
   difficulties may be expected in philosophy and in religion, arising
   from the limitations of thought common to both.--Contrast between two
   opposite statements of the extent of human knowledge, in the words of
   St. Paul and of Hegel.--Purpose of the following Lectures, as an
   Examination of the Limits of Religious Thought, . . . . 45

LECTURE II.

   Statement of the two opposite methods by which a Philosophy of Religion
   may be attempted; the Objective or Metaphysical, based on a supposed
   knowledge of the nature of God, and the Subjective or Psychological,
   based on a knowledge of the mental faculties of man.--Relation of these
   methods respectively to the Criticism of Revelation--dependence of the
   former method upon the latter.--Further examination of the Objective or
   Metaphysical method. Two different modes in which man may be supposed
   to be capable of attaining to a knowledge of God--specimen of
   each--insufficiency of both to found a Rational Theology.--Examination
   of the fundamental ideas of Rational Theology,--the Absolute--the
   Infinite--the First Cause--mutual contradictions involved in these
   three ideas--conception of an eternal Causation incompatible with the
   Absolute--conception of a temporal Causation incompatible with the
   Infinite.--The Absolute cannot be conceived as a necessary and
   unconscious cause,--nor as a voluntary and conscious cause,--nor as
   possessing' consciousness at all,--nor as containing within itself any
   kind of relation,--nor as one and simple, out of all relation. Effect
   of these counter impossibilities on the conceptions of
   Theology--apparent contradictions in the conception of the Divine
   Attributes as absolute and infinite.--Further contradictions involved
   in the coexistence of the Relative with the Absolute, and of the Finite
   with the Infinite. Pantheism avoids these contradictions by denying the
   existence of the Finite and Relative--this solution
   untenable--self-contradictions of the Pantheistic
   hypothesis.--Alternative of Atheism, which denies the existence of the
   Infinite and Absolute--contradictions involved in this
   hypothesis.--Summary of conclusions.--Necessary failure of all attempts
   to construct a Metaphysical Theology--alternative necessitated by this
   failure.--Practical result of the above inquiry, . . . . 68

LECTURE III.

   Recapitulation of the results of the last Lecture.--Necessity of
   examining the Philosophy of Religion from the Subjective or
   Psychological side, as dependent upon a knowledge of the laws of the
   human mind.--General conditions of all human Consciousness.--First
   condition of Consciousness, Distinction between one Object and
   another--such a distinction necessarily implies Limitation--consequent
   impossibility of conceiving the Infinite.--Explanation of the
   contradictions involved in the idea of the Infinite--this idea
   inadmissible as the basis of a scientific Theology.--Second condition
   of Consciousness, Relation between Subject and Object--consequent
   impossibility of conceiving the Absolute.--Explanation of the
   contradictions involved in the idea of the Absolute.--Impossibility of
   a partial knowledge of the Infinite and Absolute.--Third condition of
   Consciousness, Succession and Duration in Time--hence all objects are
   conceived as finite--consequent impossibility of conceiving Creation,
   and counter impossibility of conceiving finite existence as
   uncreated.--Attempt to evade this limitation in Theology by the
   hypothesis of the existence of God out of Time--this hypothesis
   untenable in philosophy and unavailable in theology.--Fourth condition
   of Consciousness, Personality--Personality a limitation and a relation,
   and hence inadequate to represent the Infinite.--Theological
   consequences of this condition. Personality the source and type of our
   conception of Reality, and therefore the only fitting representation of
   God.--Necessity of thinking of God as personal and yet of believing in
   Him as infinite--apparent contradiction between these
   representations--hence Thought cannot be the measure of
   Belief.--Consequent impossibility of constructing a Rational
   Theology.--Attempt to avoid the above conclusions by placing the
   Philosophy of the Infinite in a point beyond Consciousness--necessary
   failure of this attempt.--Summary of Conclusions.--Practical lesson
   from the above inquiry. . . . . 91

LECTURE IV.

   Analysis of the religious Consciousness, reflective and
   intuitive.--Relation of the reflective Consciousness to Theology; its
   reasonings sufficient to correct our conception of a Supreme Being, but
   not to originate it--examination of some current theories on this
   point--statement of the value of the reflective faculties within their
   proper limits.--Reflection, as well as intuition necessary to distinct
   consciousness; but intuition is first in the order of nature, though
   not in that of time.--Two principal modes of religious intuition--the
   Feeling of Dependence and the Conviction of Moral Obligation, giving
   rise respectively to Prayer and Expiation.--Examination of these two
   modes of Consciousness.--Dependence implies a Personal Superior; hence
   our conviction of the Power of God--Moral Obligation implies a Moral
   Lawgiver; hence our conviction of the Goodness of God.--Limits of the
   Religious Consciousness--Sense of Dependence not a consciousness of the
   Absolute and Infinite--opposite theory of Schleiermacher on this
   point--objections to his view.--Sense of Moral Obligation not a
   consciousness of the Absolute and Infinite.--Yet the Infinite is
   indirectly implied by the religious consciousness, though not
   apprehended as such; for the consciousness of limitation carries with
   it an indirect conviction of the existence of the Infinite beyond
   consciousness.--Result of the above analysis--our knowledge of God
   relative and not absolute--the Infinite an object of belief, but not of
   thought or knowledge; hence we may know that an Infinite God exists,
   but not what He is as Infinite.--Further results of an examination of
   the religious consciousness.--God known as a Person through the
   consciousness of ourselves as Persons--this consciousness indispensable
   to Theism; for the denial of our own Personality, whether in the form
   of Materialism or of Pantheism, logically leads to Atheism.--Summary of
   conclusions--our religious knowledge is regulative, but not
   speculative--importance of this distinction in theological
   reasoning--conception of the Infinite inadmissible in Theology.--Office
   of religious philosophy, as limited to finite conceptions.--Practical
   benefits of this limitation.--Conclusion, . . . .114

LECTURE V.

   Distinction between Speculative and Regulative Truth further
   pursued.--In Philosophy, as well as Religion, our highest principles of
   thought are regulative and not speculative.--Instances in the Ideas of
   Liberty and Necessity; Unity and Plurality as implied in the conception
   of any object; Commerce between Soul and Body; Extension, as implied in
   external perception; and Succession, as implied in the entire
   consciousness.--Illustration thus afforded for determining the limits
   of thought- distinction between legitimate and illegitimate thought, as
   determined by their relation to the inexplicable and the
   self-contradictory respectively.--Conclusion to be drawn as regards the
   manner of the mind's operation--all Consciousness implies a relation
   between Subject and Object, dependent on their mutual action and
   reaction; and thus no principle of thought can be regarded as absolute
   and simple, as an ultimate and highest truth.--Analogy in this respect
   between Philosophy and Natural Religion which apprehends the Infinite
   under finite forms--corresponding difficulties to be expected in
   each.--Provinces of Reason and Faith.--Analogy extended to Revealed
   Religion--testimony of Revelation plain and intelligible when regarded
   as regulative, but ultimately incomprehensible to
   speculation--corresponding errors in Philosophy and Religion,
   illustrating this analogy.--Regulative conceptions not therefore
   untrue.--The above principles confirmed by the teaching of
   Scripture.--Revelation expressly adapted to the limits of human
   thought.--Relation of the Infinite to the Personal in the
   representations of God in the Old Testament.--Further confirmation from
   the New Testament.--Doctrine of the Incarnation; its practical position
   in Theology as a regulative truth; its perversion by modern philosophy,
   in the attempt to exhibit it as a speculative truth.--Instances in
   Hegel, Marheineke, and Strauss.--Conclusion, . . . .136

LECTURE VI.

   Result of the previous inquiries--religious ideas contain two elements,
   a Form, common to them with all other ideas, as being human thoughts;
   and a Matter, peculiar to themselves, as thoughts about religious
   objects--hence there may exist two possible kinds of difficulties; the
   one formal arising from the universal laws of human thought; the other
   material arising from the peculiar nature of religious evidence.--The
   principal objections suggested by Rationalism are of the former kind;
   common to all human thinking as such, and therefore to Rationalism
   itself.--Proof of this position by the exhibition of parallel
   difficulties in Theology and Philosophy.--Our ignorance of the nature
   of God compared with our ignorance of the nature of
   Causation.--Doctrine of the Trinity compared with the philosophical
   conception of the Infinite and the Absolute, as one and yet as
   many.--Doctrine of the eternal generation of the Son compared with the
   relation of an Infinite Sub stance to its Attributes.--Purpose of such
   comparisons, not to prove the doctrines, but to show the weakness of
   human reason with regard to them--true evidence of the doctrines to be
   found, not in Reason, but in Revelation.--Further parallels.--Doctrine
   of the twofold nature of Christ compared with the philosophical
   conception of the Infinite as coexisting with the Finite.--Reason thus
   shown not to be the supreme judge of religious truth; for Religion must
   begin with that which is above Reason.--Extension of the same argument
   to our conceptions of Divine Providence.--Representations of General
   Law and Special Interposition--supposed difficulty in the conception of
   the latter shown to be really common to all human conceptions of the
   Infinite.--Both representations equally imperfect as speculative
   truths, and both equally necessary as regulative.--Imperfections in the
   conception of General Law and mechanical action of the universe--this
   conception is neither philosophically necessary nor empirically
   universal; and hence it is not entitled to supersede all other
   representations--it is inapplicable to the phenomena of mind, and only
   partially available in relation to those of matter.--Conception of
   Miraculous Agency, as subordinate to that of Special Providence--no
   sufficient ground, either from philosophy or from experience, for
   asserting that miracles are impossible.--Comparison between the
   opposite conceptions of a miracle, as an exception to a law, or as the
   result of a higher law--both these conceptions are speculatively
   imperfect, but the former is preferable as a regulative truth.--Summary
   of Conclusions--parallel difficulties must exist in Theology and in
   Philosophy--true value and province of Reason in relation to both, . .
   . . 158

LECTURE VII.

   Philosophical parallel continued with regard to the supposed moral
   objections to Christian doctrines.--Error of the moral theory of
   Kant.--Moral convictions how far necessary and trustworthy, how far
   contingent and fallible--parallel in this respect between moral and
   mathematical science, as based on the formal conditions of
   experience--possibility of corresponding errors in both.--Human
   morality not absolute, but relative.--The Moral Law cannot be conceived
   as an absolute principle, apart from its temporal
   manifestations--parallel in the idea of Time and its
   relations.--Morality, as conceived by us, necessarily contains a human
   and positive element; and therefore cannot be the measure of the
   Absolute Nature of God.--Application of the above principles to
   Christian Theology.--The Atonement--weakness of the supposed moral
   objections to this doctrine-such objections equally applicable to any
   conceivable scheme of Divine Providence.--Predestination and Free
   Will--Predestination, as a determination of the Absolute Mind, is
   speculatively inconceivable, and therefore cannot be known to be
   incompatible with human Freedom--parallel in this respect between
   Predestination in Theology and Causation in Philosophy.--Eternal
   Punishment--rashness and ignorance of rationalist criticisms of this
   doctrine--the difficulties of the doctrine are not peculiar to
   Theology, but common to all Philosophy, and belong to the general
   problem of the existence of Evil at all, which is itself but a
   subordinate case of the universal impossibility of conceiving the
   coëxistence of the Infinite with the Finite.--Contrast between
   illegitimate and legitimate mode of reasoning on evil and its
   punishment--illustrations to be derived from analogies in the course of
   nature and in the constitution of the human mind.--Extension of the
   argument from analogy to other religious doctrines--Original
   Sin--Justification by Faith--Operation of Divine Grace.--Limits of the
   Moral Reason.--Conclusion, . . . . 182

LECTURE VIII.

   Right use of Reason in religious questions--Reason entitled to judge of
   a Religion in respect of its evidences, as addressed to men, but not in
   respect of its correspondence with philosophical conceptions of the
   Absolute Nature of God.--No one faculty of the human mind is entitled
   to exclusive preference as the criterion of religious truth--the true
   criterion is to be found in the general result of many and various
   Evidences--practical neglect of this rule by different
   writers.--Comparative value of internal and external evidences of
   religion, the former as negative, the latter as positive.--Cautions as
   requisite in the use of the negative argument from internal
   evidence--external and internal evidence can only be estimated in
   conjunction with each other.--Distinction between the proper and
   improper use of the Moral Sense in questions of religious
   evidence.--Application of this distinction to facts recorded in Sacred
   History.--Analogy between physical and moral laws as regards miraculous
   interventions.--Probable and partial character of the moral argument;
   error of supposing it to be demonstrative and complete; possibility of
   mistakes in its application.--General summary of Christian
   Evidences--alternative in the case of their rejection--Christ's
   teaching either wholly divine or wholly human.--Impossibility of an
   eclectic Christianity.--Value of the a priori presumption against
   miracles--nothing gained in point of probability by a partial rejection
   of the supernatural.--Christianity regarded as a Revelation must be
   accepted wholly or not at all.--Speculative difficulties in religion
   form a part of our probation--analogy between moral and intellectual
   temptations.--General result of an examination of the Limits of
   Religious Thought--Theology not a speculative science, nor in the
   course of progressive development.--Cautions needed in the treatment of
   religious knowledge as regulative--this view does not solve
   difficulties, but only shows why they are insoluble.--Instance of the
   neglect of this caution in Archbishop King's rule of scripture
   interpretation as regards the Divine Attributes.--No explanation
   possible of those difficulties which arise from the universal laws of
   human thought--such difficulties are inherent in our mental
   constitution, and form part of our training and discipline during this
   life.--The office of Philosophy is not to give us a knowledge of the
   absolute nature of God, but to teach us to know ourselves and the
   limits of our faculties.--Conclusion, . . . . 204

LECTURE I.

   YE SHALL NOT ADD UNTO THE WORD WHICH I COMMAND YOU, NEITHER SHALL YE
   DIMINISH AUGHT FROM IT.--DEUT. IV. 2.

   DOGMATISM and Rationalism are the two extremes between which religious
   philosophy perpetually oscillates. Each represents a system from which,
   when nakedly and openly announced, the well regulated mind almost
   instinctively shrinks back; yet which, in some more or less specious
   disguise, will be found to underlie the antagonist positions of many a
   theological controversy. Many a man who rejects isolated portions of
   Christian doctrine, on the ground that they are repugnant to his
   reason, would hesitate to avow broadly and unconditionally that reason
   is the supreme arbiter of all religious truth; thiough at the same time
   he would find it hard to point out any particular in which the position
   of reason, in relation to the truths which he still retains, differs
   from that which it occupies in relation to those which he rejects. And
   on the other hand, there are many who, while they would by no means
   construct a dogmatic system on the assumption that the conclusions of
   reason may always be made to coincide with those of revelation, yet,
   for want of an accurate distinction between that which is within the
   province of human thought and that which is beyond it, are accustomed
   in practice to demand the assent of the reason to positions which it is
   equally incompetent to affirm or to deny. Thus they not only lessen the
   value of the service which it is capable of rendering within its
   legitimate sphere, but also indirectly countenance that very intrusion
   of the human intellect into sacred things, which, in some of its other
   aspects, they so strongly and so justly condemn.

   In using the above terms, it is necessary to state at the outset the
   sense in which each is employed, and to emancipate them from the
   various and vague associations connected with their ordinary use. I do
   not include under the name of Dogmatism the mere enunciation of
   religious truths, as resting upon authority and not upon reasoning. The
   Dogmatist, as well as the Rationalist, is the constructor of a system;
   and in constructing it, however much the materials upon which he works
   may be given by a higher authority, yet in connecting them together and
   exhibiting their systematic form, it is necessary to call in the aid of
   human ability. Indeed, whatever may be their actual antagonism in the
   field of religious controversy, the two terms are in their proper sense
   so little exclusive of each other, that both were originally employed
   to denote the same persons;--the name Dogmatists or Rationalists being
   indifferently given to those medical theorists who insisted on the
   necessity of calling in the aid of rational principles, to support or
   correct the conclusions furnished by experience.^([1]1) A like
   signification is to be found in the later language of philosophy, when
   the term Dogmatists was used to denote those philosophers who
   endeavored to explain the phenomena of experience by means of rational
   conceptions and demonstrations; the intelligible world being regarded
   as the counterpart of the sensible, and the necessary relations of the
   former as the principles and ground of the observed facts of the
   latter.^([2]2) It is in a sense analogous to this that the term may be
   most accurately used in reference to Theology. Scripture is to the
   theological Dogmatist what Experience is to the philosophical. It
   supplies him with the facts to which his system has to adapt itself. It
   contains in an unsystematic form the positive doctrines, which further
   inquiry has to exhibit as supported by reasonable grounds and connected
   into a scientific whole. Theological Dogmatism is thus an application
   of reason to the support and defence of preëxisting statements of
   Scripture.^([3]3) Rationalism, on the other hand, so far as it deals
   with Scripture at all, deals with it as a thing to be adapted to the
   independent conclusions of the natural reason, and to be rejected where
   that adaptation cannot conveniently be made. By Rationalism, without
   intending to limit the name to any single school or period in
   theological controversy, I mean generally to designate that system
   whose final test of truth is placed in the direct assent of the human
   consciousness, whether in the form of logical deduction, or moral
   judgment, or religious intuition; by whatever previous process those
   faculties may have been raised to their assumed dignity as arbitrators.
   The Rationalist, as such, is not bound to maintain that a divine
   revelation of religious truth is impossible, nor even to deny that it
   has actually been given. He may admit the existence of the revelation
   as a fact: he may acknowledge its utility as a temporary means of
   instruction for a ruder age: he may even accept certain portions as of
   universal and permanent authority.^([4]4) But he assigns to some
   superior tribunal the right of determining what is essential to
   religion and what is not: he claims for himself and his age the
   privilege of accepting or rejecting any given revelation, wholly or in
   part, according as it does or does not satisfy the conditions of some
   higher criterion to be supplied by the human consciousness.^([5]5)

   In relation to the actual condition of religious truth, as communicated
   by Holy Scripture, Dogmatism and Rationalism may be considered as
   severally representing, the one the spirit which adds to the word of
   God, the other that which diminishes from it. Whether a complete system
   of scientific Theology could or could not have been given by direct
   revelation, consistently with the existing laws of human thought and
   the purposes which Revelation is designed to answer, it is at least
   certain that such a system is not given in the Revelation which we
   possess, but, if it is to exist at all, must be constructed out of it
   by human interpretation. And it is in attempting such a construction
   that Dogmatism and Rationalism exhibit their most striking contrasts.
   The one seeks to build up a complete scheme of theological doctrine out
   of the unsystematic materials furnished by Scripture, partly by the
   more complete development of certain leading ideas; partly by extending
   the apparent import of the Revelation to ground which it does not
   avowedly occupy, and attempting by inference and analogy to solve
   problems which the sacred volume may indeed suggest, but which it does
   not directly answer. The other aims at the same end by opposite means.
   It strives to attain to unity and completeness of system, not by
   filling up supposed deficiencies, but by paring down supposed
   excrescences. Commencing with a preconceived theory of the purpose of a
   revelation and the form which it ought to assume, it proceeds to remove
   or reduce all that will not harmonize with this leading idea; sometimes
   explaining away in the interpretation that which it accepts as given in
   the letter; sometimes denying, on a priori grounds, the genuineness of
   this or that portion of the sacred text; sometimes pretending to
   distinguish between the several purposes of Revelation itself, and to
   determine what portions are intended to convey the elements of an
   absolute religion, valid in all countries and for all ages, and what
   must be regarded as relative and accidental features of the divine
   plan, determined by the local or temporal peculiarities of the
   individuals to whom it was first addressed.

   The two methods thus contrasted may appear at first sight to represent
   the respective claims of Faith and Reason, each extended to that point
   at which it encroaches on the domain of the other. But in truth the
   contrast between Faith and Reason, if it holds good in this relation at
   all, does so merely by accident. It may be applicable in some instances
   to the disciples of the respective systems, but not to the teachers;
   and even as regards the former, it is but partially and occasionally
   true. The disciples of the Rationalist are not necessarily the
   disciples of reason. It is quite as possible to receive with
   unquestioning submission a system of religion or philosophy invented by
   a human teacher, as it is to believe, upon the authority of Revelation,
   doctrines which no human reason is competent to discover. The so-called
   freethinker is as often as any other man the slave of some self-chosen
   master; and many who scorn the imputation of believing anything merely
   because it is found in the Bible, would find it hard to give any better
   reason for their own unbelief than the ipse dixit of some infidel
   philosopher. But when we turn from the disciples to the teachers, and
   look to the origin of Dogmatism and Rationalism as systems, we find
   both alike to be the products of thought, operating in different ways
   upon the same materials. Faith, properly so called, is not
   constructive, but receptive. It cannot supply the missing portions of
   an incomplete system, though it may bid us remain content with the
   deficiency. It cannot of itself give harmony to the discordant voices
   of religious thought; it cannot reduce to a single focus the
   many-colored rays into which the light of God's presence is refracted
   in its passage through the human soul; though it may bid us look
   forward to a time when the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the
   ears of the deaf shall be unstopped; [7] when that apparent discord
   shall be known but as the echo of a halfheard concert, and those
   diverging rays shall be blended once more in the pure white light of
   heaven. But Faith alone cannot suggest any actual solution of our
   doubts: it can offer no definite reconciliation of apparently
   conflicting truths; for in order to accomplish that end, the hostile
   elements must be examined, compared, accommodated, and joined together,
   one with another; and such a process is an act of thought, not of
   belief. Considered from this point of view, both Dogmatism and
   Rationalism may be regarded as emanating from the same source, and
   amenable to the same principles of criticism; in so far as they keep
   within or go beyond those limits of sound thought which the laws of
   man's mind, or the circumstances in which lie is placed, have imposed
   upon him.

   In fact the two systems may be considered as both aiming, though in
   different ways, at the same end; that end being to produce a
   coincidence between what we believe and what we think; to remove the
   boundary which separates the comprehensible from the incomprehensible.
   The Dogmatist employs reason to prove, almost as much as the
   Rationalist employs it to disprove. The one, in the character of an
   advocate, accepts the doctrines of revealed religion as conclusions,
   but appeals to the reason, enlightened, it may be, by Revelation, to
   find premises to support them. The other, in the character of a critic,
   draws his premises from reason in the first instance; and, adopting
   these as his standard, either distorts the revealed doctrine into
   conformity with them, or, if it obstinately resists this treatment,
   sets it aside altogether. The one strives to lift up reason to the
   point of view occupied by Revelation: the other strives to bring, down
   Revelation to the level of reason. And both alike have prejudged or
   neglected the previous inquiry,--Are there not definite and discernible
   limits to the province of reason itself, whether it be exercised for
   advocacy or for criticism?

   Thus, to select one example out of many, the revealed doctrine of
   Christ's Atonement for the sins of men has been alternately defended
   and assailed by some such arguments as these. We have been told, on the
   one hand, that man's redemption could not have been brought about by
   any other means^([6]6):--that God could not, consistently with his own
   attributes, have suffered man to perish unredeemed, or have redeemed
   him by any inferior sacrifice^([7]7):--that man, redeemed from death,
   must become the servant of him who redeems him; and that it was not
   meet that he should be the servant of any other than God^([8]8):--that
   no other sacrifice could have satisfied divine justice^([9]9):--that no
   other victim could have endured the burden of God's wrath.^([10]10)
   These and similar arguments have been brought forward, as one of the
   greatest of their authors avows, to defend the teaching of the Catholic
   Faith on the ground of a reasonable necessity.^([11]11) While, on the
   other hand, it has been argued that the revealed doctrine itself cannot
   be accepted as literally true; because we cannot believe that God was
   angry, and needed to be propitiated^([12]12):--because it is
   inconsistent with the Divine Justice that the innocent should suffer
   for the sins of the guilty^([13]13):--because it is more reasonable to
   believe that God freely forgives the offences of his
   creatures^([14]14):--because we cannot conceive how the punishment of
   one can do away with the guilt of another.^([15]15)

   I quote these arguments only as specimens of the method in which
   Christian doctrines have been handled by writers on opposite sides. To
   examine them more in detail would detain me too long from my main
   purpose. I shall not therefore at present consider whether the
   conclusions actually arrived at, on the one side or on the other, are
   in themselves reasonable or unreasonable, orthodox or heretical. I am
   concerned only with the methods respectively employed, and the need of
   some rule for their employment. May reason be used without restriction
   in defence or refutation of religions doctrines? And if not, what are
   the conditions of its legitimate use? It may be that this man has
   defended, on reasonable grounds, none but the most essential articles
   of the Christian Faith: but has he pointed out any rule which can
   hinder the same or similar reasoning from being advanced by another in
   support of the most dangerous errors? It may be that that man has
   employed the test of reasonableness, only in the refutation of opinions
   concerning which the church has pronounced no positive judgment: but
   has he fenced his method round with any cautions to prevent its being
   used for the overthrow of Christianity itself? If we can find no other
   ground than the arbitrary will of the man himself, why he should stop
   short at the particular point which he has chosen, we may not perhaps
   condemn the tenets of the individual, but we may fairly charge his
   method with the consequences to which it logically leads us.

   Thus, we find a late lamented writer of our own day, and at that time
   of our own church, defending the doctrine of the Incarnation of Christ,
   on the metaphysical assumption of the real existence of an abstract
   humanity. "This," he tells us, "is why the existence of human nature is
   a thing too precious to be surrendered to the subtleties of logic,
   because, upon its existence depends that real manhood of Christ, which
   renders him a copartner with ourselves." And again: "To the reality of
   this work, the existence of that common nature is indispensable,
   whereby, as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, He Himself
   took part of the same. Else, how would the perfect assumption of
   humanity have consisted with His retaining that divine personality
   which it was impossible that He should surrender? Since it was no new
   person which He took, it can only have been the substratum, in which
   personality has its existence."^([16]16) In this case, our belief in
   the undeniable truth of the doctrine defended may dispose us to
   overlook the questionable character of the defence. But if we are
   inclined for a moment to acquiesce in this unnatural union of
   metaphysical premises and theological conclusions, we are recalled to
   ourselves by the recollection of the fearful consequence which Occam
   deduces from the same hypothesis, of the assumption by Christ of a
   "substratum in which personality has its existence;"--a consequence
   drawn in language which we shudder to read, even as it is employed by
   its author, merely for the purpose of reducing to an absurdity the
   principles of his antagonists.^([17]17)

   There is an union of Philosophy with Religion in which each contributes
   to the support of the other; and there is also an union which, under
   the appearance of support, does but undermine the foundations and prey
   upon the life of both. To which of these two the above argument
   belongs, it needs but a bare statement of its assumption to determine.
   It tells us that our belief in the doctrine of God manifest in the
   flesh, indispensably depends upon our acceptance of the Realist theory
   of the nature of universal notions. Philosophy and Theology alike
   protest against such an outrage upon the claims, both of Reason and of
   Revelation, as is implied in this association of one of the most
   fundamental truths of the Christian Faith with one of the most
   questionable speculations of mediaeval metaphysics. What does Theology
   gain by this employment of a weapon which may, at any moment, be turned
   against her? Does it make one whit clearer to our understandings that
   mysterious two-fold nature of one Christ, very God, and very Man? By no
   means. It was a truth above human comprehension before; and it remains
   a truth above human comprehension still. We believe that Christ is both
   God and Man; for this is revealed to us. We know not how He is so; for
   this is not revealed; and we can learn it in no other way. Theology
   gains nothing; but she is in danger of losing everything. Her most
   precious truths are cut from the anchor which held them firm, and cast
   upon the waters of philosophical speculation, to float hither and
   thither with the ever-shifting waves of thought. And what does
   Philosophy gain? Her just domains are narrowed, and her free limbs
   cramped in their onward course. The problems which she has a native
   right to sift to the uttermost, are taken out of the field of free
   discussion, and fenced about with religious doctrines which it is
   heresy to call in question. Neither Christian truth nor philosophical
   inquiry can be advanced by such a system as this, which revives and
   sanctifies, as essential to the Catholic Faith, the forgotten follies
   of Scholastic Realism, and endangers the cause of religion, by seeking
   to explain its greatest mysteries by the lifeless forms of a worn-out
   controversy. "Why seek ye the living among the dead? Christ is not
   here." [8]

   But if the tendency of Dogmatism is to endanger the interests of
   religious truth, by placing that which is divine and unquestionable in
   too close an alliance with that which is human and doubtful,
   Rationalism, on the other hand, tends to destroy revealed religion
   altogether, by obliterating the whole distinction between the human and
   the divine. Rationalism, if it retains any portion of revealed truth as
   such, does so, not in consequence of, but in defiance of, its
   fundamental principle. It does so by virtually declaring that it will
   follow reason up to a certain point, and no further; though the
   conclusions which lie beyond that point are guaranteed by precisely the
   same evidence as those which fall short of it. We may select a notable
   example from the writings of a great thinker, who has contributed,
   perhaps, more than any other person to give a philosophical sanction to
   the rationalizing theories of his countrymen, yet from whose
   speculative principles, rightly employed, might be extracted the best
   antidote to his own conclusions, even as the body of the scorpion,
   crushed upon the wound, is said to be the best cure for its own venom.

   Kant's theory of a rational religion is based upon the assumption that
   the sole purpose of religion must be to give a divine sanction to man's
   moral duties.^([18]18) He maintains that there can be no duties towards
   God, distinct from those which we owe towards men; but that it may be
   necessary, at certain times and for certain persons, to give to moral
   duties the authority of divine commands.^([19]19) Let us hear: then the
   philosopher's rational explanation, upon this assumption, of the duty
   of Prayer. It is a mere superstitious delusion, he tells us, to
   consider prayer as a service addressed to God, and as a means of
   obtaining His favor.^([20]20) The true purpose of the act is not to
   alter or affect in any way God's relation towards us; but only to
   quicken our own moral sentiments, by keeping alive within us the idea
   of God as a moral Lawgiver.^([21]21) He, therefore, neither admits the
   duty unconditionally, nor rejects it entirely; but leaves it optional
   with men to adopt that or any other means, by which, in their own
   particular case, this moral end may be best promoted;--as if any moral
   benefit could possibly accrue from the habitual exercise of an act of
   conscious self-deception.

   The origin of such theories is of course to be traced to that morbid
   horror of what they are pleased to call Anthropomorphism, which poisons
   the speculations of so many modern philosophers, when they attempt to
   be wise above what is written, and seek for a metaphysical exposition
   of God's nature and attributes.^([22]22) They may not, forsooth, think
   of the unchangeable God as if Ile were their fellow man, influenced by
   human motives, and moved by human supplications. They want a truer, a
   juster idea of the Deity as He is, than that under which He has been
   pleased to reveal Himself; and they call on their reason to furnish it.
   Fools, to dream that man can escape from himself, that human reason can
   draw aught but a human portrait of God! They do but substitute a marred
   and mutilated humanity for one exalted and entire: they add nothing to
   their conception of God as He is, but only take away a part of their
   conception of man. Sympathy, and love, and fatherly kindness, and
   forgiving mercy, have evaporated in the crucible of their philosophy;
   and what is the caput mortuum that remains, but only the sterner
   features of humanity exhibited in repulsive nakedness? The God who
   listens to prayer, we are told, appears in the likeness of human
   mutability. Be it so. What is the God who does not listen, but the
   likeness of human obstinacy? Do we ascribe to him a fixed purpose? our
   conception of a purpose is human. Do we speak of Him as continuing
   unchanged? our conception of continuance is human. Do we conceive Him
   as knowing and determining? what are knowledge and determination but
   modes of human consciousness? and. what know we of consciousness
   itself, but as the contrast between successive mental states? But our
   rational philosopher stops short in the middle of his reasoning. He
   strips off from humanity just so much as suits his purpose;--"and the
   residue thereof he maketh a god;" [9] --less pious in his idolatry than
   the carver of the graven image, in that he does not fall down unto it
   and pray unto it, but is content to stand off and reason concerning it.
   And why does he retain any conception of God at all, but that he
   retains some portions of an imperfect humanity? Man is still the
   residue that is left; deprived indeed of all that is amiable in
   humanity, but, in the darker features which remain, still man. Man in
   his purposes; man in his inflexibility; man in that relation to time
   from which no philosophy, whatever its pretensions, can wholly free
   itself; pursuing with indomitable resolution a preconceived design;
   deaf to the yearning instincts which compel his creatures to call upon
   him.^([23]23) Yet this, forsooth, is a philosophical conception of the
   Deity, more worthy of an enlightened reason than the human imagery of
   the Psalmist: "The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His
   ears are open unto their prayers." [10]

   Surely downright idolatry is better than this rational worship of a
   fragment of humanity. Better is the superstition which sees the image
   of God in the wonderful whole which God has fashioned, than the
   philosophy which would carve for itself a Deity out of the remnant
   which man has mutilated. Better to realize the satire of the Eleatic
   philosopher, to make God in the likeness of man, even as the ox or the
   horse might conceive gods in the form of oxen or horses, than to adore
   some half-hewn Hermes, the head of a man joined to a misshapen
   block.^([24]24) Better to fill down before that marvellous compound of
   human consciousness whose elements God has joined together, and no man
   can put asunder, than to strip reason of those cognate elements which
   together furnish all that we can conceive or imagine of conscious or
   personal existence, and to deify the emptiest of all abstractions, a
   something or a nothing, with just enough of its human original left to
   form a theme for the disputations of philosophy, but not enough to
   furnish a single ground of appeal to the human feelings of love, of
   reverence, and of fear. Unmixed idolatry is more religious than this.
   Undisguised atheism is more logical.

   Throughout every page of Holy Scripture God reveals himself, not as a
   Law, but as a Person. Throughout the breadth and height and depth of
   human consciousness, Personality manifests itself under one condition,
   that of a Free Will, influenced, though not coerced, by motives. And to
   this consciousness God addresses Himself, when lihe adopts its
   attributes as the image under which to represent to man His own
   incomprehensible and ineffable nature. Doubtless in this there is much
   of accommodation to the weakness of man's faculties; but not more than
   in any other representation of any of the divine attributes. By what
   right do we say that the conception of the God who hears and answers
   prayer [11] is an accommodation, while that of Him in whom is no
   variableness nor shadow of turning [12] is not so? By what right do we
   venture to rob the Deity of half His revealed attributes, in order to
   set up the other half, which rests on precisely the same evidence, as a
   more (absolute revelation of the truth? By what right do we enthrone,
   in the place of the God to whom we pray, an inexorable Fate or
   immutable Law--a thing with less than even the divinity of a Fetish;
   since that may be at least conceived by its worshipper as capable of
   being offended by his crimes and propitiated by his supplications?

   Yet surely there is a principle of truth of which this philosophy is
   the perversion. Surely there is a sense in which we may not think of
   God as though He were man; as there is also a sense in which we cannot
   help so thinking of Him. When we read in the same narrative, and almost
   in two consecutive verses of Scripture, "The Strength of Israel will
   not lie nor repent; for He is not a man that He should repent;" and
   again, "The Lord repented that He had made Saul king over Israel:" [13]
   we are imperfectly conscious of an appeal to two different principles
   of representation, involving opposite sides of the same truth; we feel
   that there is a true foundation for the system which denies human
   attributes to God; though the superstructure, which has been raised
   upon it, logically involves the denial of His very existence.

   What limits then can we find to determine the legitimate provinces of
   these two opposite methods of religious thought, each of which, in its
   exclusive employment, leads to errors so fatal; yet each of which, in
   its utmost error, is but a truth abused? If we may not, with the
   Dogmatist, force Philosophy into unnatural union with Revelation, nor
   yet, with the Rationalist, mutilate Revelation to make it agree with
   Philosophy, what guide can we find to point out the safe middle course?
   what common element of both systems can be employed to mediate between
   them? It is obvious that no such element can be found by the mere
   contemplation of the objects on which religious thought is exercised.
   We can adequately criticize that only which we know as a whole. The
   objects of Natural Religion are known to us in and by the ideas which
   we can form of them; and those ideas do not of themselves constitute a
   whole, apart from the remaining phenomena of consciousness. We must not
   examine them by themselves alone: we must look to their origin, their
   import, and their relation to the mind of which they are part. Revealed
   Religion, again, is not by itself a direct object of criticism: first,
   because it is but a part of a larger scheme, and that scheme one
   imperfectly comprehended; and secondly, because Revelation implies an
   accommodation to the mental constitution of its human receiver; and we
   must know what that constitution is, before we can pronounce how far
   the accommodation extends. But if partial knowledge must not be treated
   as if it were complete, neither, on the other hand, may it be
   identified with total ignorance. The false humility which assumes that
   it can know nothing, is often as dangerous as the false pride which
   assumes that it knows everything. The provinces of Reason and Faith,
   the limits of our knowledge and of our ignorance, must both be clearly
   determined: otherwise we may find ourselves dogmatically protesting
   against dogmatism, and reasoning to prove the worthlessness of reason.

   There is one point from which all religious systems must start, and to
   which all must finally return; and which may therefore furnish a common
   ground on which to examine the principles and pretensions of all. The
   primary and proper object of criticism is not Religion, natural or
   revealed, but the human mind in its relation to Religion. If the
   Dogmatist and the Rationalist have heretofore contended as combatants,
   each beating the air in his own position, without being able to reach
   his adversary; if they have been prevented from taking up a common
   ground of controversy, because each repudiates the fundamental
   assumptions of the other; that common ground must be sought in another
   quarter; namely, in those laws and processes of the human mind, by
   means of which both alike accept and elaborate their opposite systems.
   If human philosophy is not a direct guide to the attainment of
   religious truth (and its entire history too truly testifies that it is
   not), may it not serve as an indirect guide, by pointing out the limits
   of our faculties, and the conditions of their legitimate exercise?
   Witnessing, as it does, the melancholy spectacle of the household of
   humanity divided against itself, the reason against the feelings and
   the feelings against the reason, and the dim half-consciousness of the
   shadow of the infinite frowning down upon both, may it not seek, with
   the heathen Philosopher of old, to find the reconciling and regulating
   principle in that justice, of which the essential character is, that
   every member of the system shall do his own duty, and forbear to
   intrude into the office of his neighbor?^([25]25)

   A criticism of the human mind, in relation to religions truth, was one
   of the many unrealized possibilities of philosophy, sketched out in
   anticipation by the far-seeing genius of Bacon. "Here therefore," he
   writes, "I note this deficiency, that there hath not been, to my
   understanding, sufficiently enquired and handled the true limits and
   use of reason in spiritual things, as a kind of divine dialectic: which
   for that it is not done, it seemeth to me a thing usual, by pretext of
   true conceiving that which is revealed, to search and mine into that
   which is not revealed; and by pretext of enucleating inferences and
   contradictories, to examine that which is positive: the one sort
   falling into the error of Nicodemus, demanding to have things made more
   sensible than it pleaseth God to reveal them, Quomodo possit homo nasci
   cum sit senex?' the other sort into the error of the disciples, which
   were scandalized at a show of contradiction, Quid est hoc quod dicit
   nobis, Modicum, et non videbitis me; et iterum, modicum, et videbitis
   me?'"^([26]26)

   An examination of the Limits of Religious Thought is an indispensable
   preliminary to all Religious Philosophy. And the limits of religious
   thought are but a special manifestation of the limits of thought in
   general. Thus the Philosophy of Religion, on its human side, must be
   subject to those universal conditions which are binding upon Philosophy
   in general. It has ever fared ill, both with Philosophy and with
   Religion, when this caution has been neglected. It was an evil hour for
   both, when Fichte made his first essay, as a disciple of the Kantian
   school, by an attempted criticism of all Revelation.^([27]27) The very
   title of Kant's great work, and, in spite of many inconsistencies, the
   general spirit of its contents also, might have taught him a different
   lesson,--might have shown him that Reason, and not Revelation, was the,
   primary object of criticism. If Revelation is a communication from an
   infinite to a finite intelligence, the conditions of a criticism of
   Revelation on philosophical grounds must be identical with those which
   are required for constructing a Philosophy of the Infinite. For
   Revelation can make known the Infinite Being only in one of two ways;
   by presenting him as he is, or by representing him under symbols more
   or less adequate. A presentative Revelation implies faculties in man
   which can receive the presentation; and such faculties will also
   furnish the conditions of constructing a philosophical theory of the
   object presented. If, on the other hand, Revelation is merely
   representative, the accuracy of the representation can only be
   ascertained by a knowledge of the object represented; and this again
   implies the possibility of a philosophy of the Infinite. Whatever
   impediments, therefore, exist to prevent the formation of such a
   philosophy, the same impediments must likewise prevent the
   accomplishment of a complete criticism of Revelation. Whatever
   difficulties or contradictions are involved in the philosophical idea
   of the Infinite, the same or similar ones must naturally be expected in
   the corresponding ideas which Revelation either exhibits or implies.
   And if an examination of the problems of Philosophy and the conditions
   of their solution should compel us to admit the existence of principles
   and modes of thought which must be accepted as true in practice, though
   they cannot be explained in theory; the same practical acceptance may
   be claimed, on philosophical grounds, in behalf of the corresponding
   doctrines of Revelation.

   If it can be shown that the limits of religious and philosophical
   thought are the same; that corresponding difficulties occur in both,
   and, from the nature of the case, must occur, the chief foundation of
   religious Rationalism is cut away from under it. The difficulties which
   it professes to find in Revelation are shown to be not peculiar to
   Revelation, but inherent in the constitution of the human mind, and
   such as no system of Rationalism can avoid or overcome. The analogy,
   which Bishop Butler has pointed out, between Religion and the
   constitution and course of Nature, may be in some degree extended to
   the constitution and processes of the human mind. The representations
   of God which Scripture presents to us may be shown to be analogous to
   those which the laws of our minds require us to form; and therefore
   such as may naturally be supposed to have emanated from the same
   author. Such an inquiry occupies indeed but a subordinate place among
   the direct evidences of Christianity; nor is it intended to usurp the
   place of those evidences. But indirectly it may have its use, in
   furnishing an answer to a class of objections which were very popular a
   few years ago, and are not yet entirely extinguished. Even if it does
   not contribute materially to strengthen the position occupied by the
   defenders of Christianity, it may serve to expose the weakness of the
   assailants. Human reason may, in some respects, be weak as a supporter
   of Religion; but it is at least strong enough to repel an attack
   founded on the negation of reason.

   "We know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is
   perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. For now
   we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in
   part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." [14] Such is the
   Apostle's declaration of the limits of human knowledge. "The logical
   conception is the absolute divine conception itself; and the logical
   process is the immediate exhibition of God's self-determination to
   Being."^([28]28) Such is the Philosopher's declaration of the extent of
   human knowledge. On the first of these statements is founded the entire
   Theology of Scripture: on the second is founded the latest and most
   complete exposition of the Theology of Rationalism. The one represents
   God, not as He is in the brightness of His own glory, dwelling in the
   light which no man can approach unto; [15] but as He is reflected
   faintly in broken and fitful rays, glancing back from the restless
   waters of the human soul. The other identifies the shadow with the
   substance, not even shrinking from the confession that, to know God as
   He is, man must himself be God.^([29]29) It turns from the feeble image
   of God in the soul of the individual man, to seek the entire
   manifestation of Deity in the collective consciousness of mankind. "Ye
   shall be as gods," [16] was the earliest suggestion of the Tempter to
   the parents of the human race: "Ye are God," is the latest assurance of
   philosophy to the human race itself.^([30]30) Revelation represents the
   infinite God under finite symbols, in condescension to the finite
   capacity of man; indicating at the same time the existence of a further
   reality beyond the symbol, and bidding us look forward in faith to the
   promise of a more perfect knowledge hereafter. Rationalism, in the
   hands of these expositors, adopts an opposite view of man's powers and
   duties. It claims to behold God as He is now: it finds a common object
   for Religion and Philosophy in the explanation of God.^([31]31) It
   declares Religion to be the Divine Spirit's knowledge of himself
   through the mediation of the finite Spirit.^([32]32)

   "Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what
   we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like
   Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope
   in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure." [17] Philosophy too
   confesses that like must be known by like; but, reversing the hope of
   the Apostle, it finds God in the formis of human thought. Its kingdom
   is proclaimed to be Truth absolute and unveiled. It contains in itself
   the exhibition of God, as He is in His eternal essence, before the
   creation of a finite world.^([33]33) Which of these two representations
   contains the truer view of the capacities of human reason, it will be
   the purpose of the following Lectures to inquire. Such an inquiry must
   necessarily, during a portion at least of its course, assume a
   philosophical, rather than a theological aspect; yet it will not
   perhaps on that account be less ultimately serviceable in theological
   controversy. It has been acutely said, that even if Philosophy is
   useless, it is still useful, as the means of proving its own
   uselessness.^([34]34) But it is not so much the utility as the
   necessity of the study, which constitutes its present claim on our
   attention. So long as man possesses facts of consciousness and powers
   of reflection, so long he will continue to exercise those powers and
   study those facts. So long as human consciousness contains the idea of
   a God and the instincts of worship, so long mental philosophy will walk
   on common ground with religious belief. Rightly or wrongly, men will
   think of these things; and a knowledge of the laws under which they
   think is the only security for thinking soundly. If it be thought no
   unworthy occupation for the Christian preacher, to point out the
   evidences of God's Providence in the constitution of the sensible world
   and the mechanism of the human body; or to dwell on the analogies which
   may be traced between the scheme of revelation and the course of
   nature; it is but a part of the same argument to pursue the inquiry
   with regard to the structure and laws of the human mind. The path may
   be one which, of late years at least, has been less frequently trodden:
   the language indispensable to such an investigation may sound at times
   unwonted and uncouth; but the end is one with that of those plainer and
   more familiar illustrations which have taken their place among the
   acknowledged evidences of religion; and the lesson of the whole, if
   read aright, will be but to teach us that in mind, no less than in
   body, we are fearfully and wonderfully made [18] by Him whose praise
   both alike declare: that He who "laid the foundations of the earth, and
   shut up the sea with doors, and said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no
   further," is also He who "hath put wisdom in the inward parts, and hath
   given understanding to the heart." [19]

LECTURE II.

   KEEP THAT WHICH IS COMMITTED TO THY TRUST, AVOIDING PROFANE AND VAIN
   BABBLINGS, AND OPPOSITIONS OF SCIENCE FALSELY SO CALLED; WHICH SOME
   PROFESSING HAVE ERRED CONCERNING THE FAITH.--1 TIMOTHY VI. 20, 21.

   A PHILOSOPHY of Religion may be attempted from two opposite points of
   view, and by two opposite modes of development. It may be conceived
   either as a Philosophy of the Object of Religion; that is to say, as a
   scientific exposition of the nature of God; or as a Philosophy of the
   Subject of Religion; that is to say, as a scientific inquiry into the
   constitution of the human mind, so far as it receives and deals with
   religious ideas. The former is that branch of Metaphysics which is
   commonly known by the name of Rational Theology. Its general aim, in
   common with all metaphysical inquiries, is to disengage the real from
   the apparent, the true from the false: its special aim, as a Theology,
   is to exhibit a true representation of the Nature and Attributes of
   God, purified from foreign accretions, and displaying the exact
   features of their Divine Original. The latter is a branch of
   Psychology, which at its outset at least, contents itself with
   investigating the phenomena presented to it, leaving their relation to
   further realities to be determined at a later stage of the inquiry. Its
   primary concern is with the operations and laws of the human mind; and
   its special purpose is to ascertain the nature, the origin, and the
   limits of the religious element in man; postponing, till after that
   question has been decided, the further inquiry into the absolute nature
   of God.

   As applied to the criticism of Revelation, the first method, supposing
   its end to be attained, would furnish an immediate and direct criterion
   by which the claims of any supposed Revelation to a divine origin might
   be tested; while at the same time it would enable those possessed of it
   to dispense with the services of any Revelation at all. For on the
   supposition that we possess an exact idea of any attribute of the
   Divine Nature, we are at liberty to reject at once any portion of the
   supposed Revelation which contradicts that idea; and on the supposition
   that we possess a complete idea of that Nature as a whole, we are at
   liberty to reject whatever goes beyond it. And as, upon either
   supposition, the highest praise to which Revelation can aspire is that
   of coinciding, partially or wholly, with the independent conclusions of
   Philosophy, it follows that, so far as Philosophy extends, Revelation
   becomes superfluous.^([35]1) On the other hand, the second method of
   philosophical inquiry does not profess to furnish a direct criticism of
   Revelation, but only of the instruments by which Revelation is to be
   criticized. It looks to the human, not to the divine, and aspires to
   teach us no more than the limits of our own powers of thought, and the
   consequent distinction between what we may and what we may not seek to
   comprehend. And if, upon examination, it should appear that any portion
   of the contents of Revelation belongs to the latter class of truths,
   this method will enable us to reconcile with each other the conflicting
   claims of Reason and Faith, by showing that Reason itself, rightly
   interpreted, teaches the existence of truths that are above Reason.

   Whatever may be the ultimate use of the first of these methods of
   criticism, it is obvious that the previous question, concerning our
   right to use it at all, can only be satisfactorily answered by the
   employment of the second method. The possibility of criticism at all
   implies that human reason is liable to error: the possibility of a
   valid criticism implies that the means of distinguishing between its
   truth and its error may be ascertained by a previous criticism. Let it
   be granted, for the moment, that a religion whose contents are
   irreconcilable with human reason is thereby proved not to have come
   from God, but from man,--still the reason which judges is at least as
   human as the religion which is judged; and if the human representation
   of God is erroneous in the latter, how can we assume its infallibility
   in the former? If we grant for the present the fundamental position of
   Rationalism, namely, that man by his own reason can attain to a right
   conception of God, we must at any rate grant also, what every attempt
   at criticism implies, that he may also attain to a wrong one. We have
   therefore still to ask by what marks the one is to be distinguished
   from the other; by what method we are to seek the truth; and how we are
   to assume ourselves that we have found it. And to answer this question,
   we need a preliminary examination of the conditions and limits of human
   thought. Religious criticism is itself an act of thought; and its
   immediate instruments must, under any circumstances, be thoughts also.
   We are thus compelled in the first instance to inquire into the origin
   and value of those thoughts themselves.

   A Philosophy which professes to elicit from its own conceptions all the
   essential portions of religious belief, is bound to justify its
   profession, by showing that those conceptions themselves are above
   suspicion. The ideas thus exalted to the supreme criteria of truth must
   bear on their front unquestionable evidence that they are true and
   sufficient representations of the Divine Nature, such as may serve all
   the needs of human thought and human feeling, adequate alike for
   contemplation and for worship. They must manifest the clearness and
   distinctness which mark the strong vision of an eye gazing undazzled on
   the glory of Heaven, not the obscurity and confusion of one that turns
   away blinded from the glare, and gropes in its own darkness after the
   fleeting spectrum. The conviction which boasts itself to be superior to
   all external evidence must carry in its own inward constitution some
   sure indication of its truth and value.

   Such a conviction may be possible in two different ways. It may be the
   result of a direct intuition of the Divine Nature; or it may be gained
   by inference from certain attributes of human nature, which, though on
   a smaller scale, are known to be sufficiently representative of the
   corresponding properties of the Deity. We may suppose the existence in
   man of a special faculty of knowledge, of which God is the immediate
   object,--a kind of religious sense or reason, by which the Divine
   attributes are apprehended in their own nature:^([36]2) or we may
   maintain that the attributes of God differ from those of man in degree
   only, not in kind; and hence that certain mental and moral qualities,
   of which we are immediately conscious in ourselves, furnish at the same
   time a true and adequate image of the infinite perfections of
   God.^([37]3) The first of these suppositions professes to convey a
   knowledge of God by direct apprehension, in a manner similar to the
   evidence of the senses: the second professes to convey the same
   knowledge by a logical process, similar to the demonstrations of
   science. The former is the method of Mysticism, and of that Rationalism
   which agrees with Mysticism, in referring the knowledge of divine
   things to an extraordinary and abnormal process of intuition or
   thought.([38]4) The latter is the method of the vulgar Rationalism,
   which regards the reason of man, in its ordinary and normal operation,
   as the supreme criterion of religious truth.

   On the former supposition, a system of religious philosophy or
   criticism may be constructed by starting from the divine and reasoning
   down to the human: on the latter, by starting from the human and
   reasoning up to the divine. The first commences with a supposed
   immediate knowledge of God as He is in his absolute nature, and
   proceeds to exhibit the process by which that nature, acting according
   to its own laws, will manifest itself in operation, and become known to
   man. The second commences with an immediate knowledge of the mental and
   moral attributes of man, and proceeds to exhibit the manner in which
   those attributes will manifest themselves, when exalted to the degree
   in which they form part of the nature of God. If, for example, the two
   systems severally undertake to give a representation of the infinite
   power and wisdom of God, the former will profess to explain how the
   nature of the infinite manifests itself in the forms of power and
   wisdom; while the latter will attempt to show how power and wisdom must
   manifest themselves when existing in an infinite degree. In their
   criticisms of Revelation, in like manner, the former will rather take
   as its standard that absolute and essential nature of God, which must
   remain unchanged in every manifestation; the latter will judge by
   reference to those intellectual and moral qualities, which must exist
   in all their essential features in the divine nature as well as in the
   human.

   Thus, for example, it has been maintained by a modern philosopher, that
   the absolute nature of God is that of a pure Will, determining itself
   solely by a moral law, and subject to no affections which can operate
   as motives. Hence it is inferred that the same law of action must form
   the rule of God's manifestation to mankind as a moral Governor; and
   therefore that no revelation can be of divine origin, which attempts to
   influence men's actions by the prospect of reward or
   punishment.^([39]5) In this mode of reasoning, an abstract conception
   of the nature of God is made the criterion to determine the mode in
   which He must reveal Himself to man. On the other hand, we meet with an
   opposite style of criticism, which reasons somewhat as follows: All the
   excellences, it contends, of which we are conscious in the creature,
   must necessarily exist in the same manner, though in a higher degree,
   in the Creator. God is indeed more wise, more just, more merciful than
   man; but for that very reason, I-is wisdom and justice and mercy must
   contain nothing that is incompatible with the corresponding attributes
   in their human character.^([40]6) Hence, if the certainty of man's
   knowledge implies the necessity of the events which he knows, the
   certainty of God's omniscience implies a like necessity of all
   things:^([41]7) if man's justice requires that he should punish the
   guilty alone, it is inconsistent with God's justice to inflict the
   chastisement of sin upon the innocent:^([42]8) if man's mercy finds its
   natural exercise in the free forgiveness of offences, God's mercy, too,
   must freely forgive the sins of His creatures.^([43]9) From the same
   premises it is consistently concluded that no act which would be wrong,
   if performed by a man upon his own responsibility, can be justified by
   the plea of a direct command from God.^([44]10) Abraham may not be
   praised for his readiness to slay his son in obedience to God's
   command; for the internal prohibition must always be more certain than
   the external precept.^([45]11) Joshua cannot be warranted in obeying
   the Divine injunction to exterminate the Canaanites, unless he would be
   equally warranted in destroying them of his own accord.^([46]12) And,
   as the issuing of such commands is contrary to the moral nature of God,
   therefore the Book which represents them as so issued is convicted of
   falsehood, and cannot be regarded as a Divine Revelation.^([47]13) In
   this mode of reasoning, the moral or intellectual nature of man is made
   the rule to determine what ought to be the revealed attributes of God,
   and in what manner they must be exercised.

   Within certain limits, both these arguments may have their value; but
   each is chiefly useful as a check upon the exclusive authority of the
   other. The philosophy which reasons downwards from the infinite, is but
   an exaggeration of the true conviction that God's thoughts are not our
   thoughts, nor His ways our ways: [20] the philosophy which reasons
   upwards from the human, bears witness, even in its perversion, to the
   unextinguishable consciousness, that man, however fallen, was created
   in the image of God. [21] But this admission tends rather to weaken
   than to strengthen the claims of either to be received as the supreme
   criterion of religious truth. The criticisms of rationalism exhibit the
   weakness as well as the strength of reason; for the representations
   which it rejects, as dishonoring to God, are, on its own showing, the
   product of human thought, no less than the principle by which they are
   judged and condemned. If the human mind has passed through successive
   stages of religious cultivation, from the grovelling superstition of
   the savage to the intellectual elevation of the critic of all possible
   revelations, who shall assure the critic that the level on which he now
   stands is the last and highest that can be attained? If reason is to be
   the last court of appeal in religious questions, it must find some
   better proof of its own infallibility than is to be found in its own
   progressive enlightenment. Its preëminence must be shown, not by
   successive approximations to the truth, but by the possession of the
   truth itself. Of the limits within which reason may be legitimately
   employed, I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. At present, I am
   concerned only with its pretensions to such a knowledge of the Divine
   Nature, as can constitute the foundation of a Rational Theology.

   There are three terms, familiar as household words, in the vocabulary
   of Philosophy, which must be taken into account in every system of
   Metaphysical Theology. To conceive the Deity as He is, we must conceive
   Him as First Cause, as Absolute, and as Infinite. By the First Cause,
   is meant that which produces all things, and is itself produced of
   none. By the Absolute, is meant that which exists in and by itself,
   having no necessary relation to any other Being.^([48]14) By the
   Infinite, is meant that which is free from all possible limitation;
   that than which a greater is inconceivable; and which, consequently,
   can receive no additional attribute or mode of existence, which it had
   not from all eternity.

   The Infinite, as contemplated by this philosophy, cannot be regarded as
   consisting of a limited number of attributes, each unlimited in its
   kind. It cannot be conceived, for example, after the analogy of a line,
   infinite in length, but not in breadth; or of a surface, infinite in
   two dimensions of space, but bounded in the third; or of an intelligent
   being, possessing some one or more modes of consciousness in an
   infinite degree, but devoid of others. Even if it be granted, which is
   not the case, that such a partial infinite may without contradiction be
   conceived, still it will have a relative infinity only, and be
   altogether incompatible with the idea of the Absolute.^([49]15) The
   line limited in breadth is thereby necessarily related to the space
   that limits it: the intelligence endowed with a limited number of
   attributes, coëxists with others which are thereby related to it, as
   cognate or opposite modes of consciousness.^([50]16) The metaphysical
   representation of the Deity, as absolute and infinite, must
   necessarily, as tihe profoundest metaphysicians have acknowledged,
   amount to nothing less than the sum of all reality.^([51]17) "What kind
   of an Absolute Being is that," says Hegel, "which does not contain in
   itself all that is actual, even evil included?"^([52]18) We may
   repudiate the conclusion with indignation; but the reasoning is
   unassailable. If the Absolute and Infinite is an object of human
   conception at all, this, and none other, is the conception required.
   That which is conceived as absolute and infinite must be conceived as
   containing within itself the sum, not only of all actual, but of all
   possible, modes of being. For if any actual mode can be denied of it,
   it is related to that mode, and limited by it;^([53]19) and if any
   possible mode can be denied of it, it is capable of becoming more than
   it now is, and such a capability is a limitation. Indeed, it is obvious
   that the entire distinction between the possible and the actual can
   have no existence as regards the absolutely infinite; for an unrealized
   possibility is necessarily a relation and a limit. The scholastic
   saying, Deus est actus purus,^([54]20) ridiculed as it has been by
   modern critics, is in truth but the expression, in technical language,
   of the almost unanimous voice of philosophy, both in earlier and later
   times.([55]21)

   But these three conceptions, the Cause, the Absolute, the Infinite, all
   equally indispensable, do they not imply contradiction to each other,
   when viewed in conjunction, as attributes of one and the same Being? A
   Cause cannot, as such, be absolute: the Absolute cannot, as such, be a
   cause. The cause, as such, exists only in relation to its effect: the
   cause is a cause of the effect; the effect is an effect of the cause.
   On the other hand, the conception of the Absolute implies a possible
   existence out of all relation.^([56]22) We attempt to escape from this
   apparent contradiction, by introducing the idea of succession in time.
   The Absolute exists first by itself, and afterwards becomes a Cause.
   But here we are checked by the third conception, that of the Infinite.
   How can the Infinite become that which it was not from the first? If
   Causation is a possible mode of existence, that which exists without
   causing is not infinite; that which becomes a cause has passed beyond
   its former limits. Creation at any particular moment of time being thus
   inconceivable, the philosopher is reduced to the alternative of
   Pantheism, which pronounces the effect to be mere appearance, and
   merges all real existence in the cause.^([57]23) The validity of this
   alternative will be examined presently.

   Meanwhile, to return for a moment to the supposition of a true
   causation. Supposing the Absolute to become a cause, it will follow
   that it operates by means of free will and consciousness. For a
   necessary cause cannot be conceived as absolute and infinite. If
   necessitated by something beyond itself, it is thereby limited by a
   superior power; and if necessitated by itself, it has in its own nature
   a necessary relation to its effect. The act of causation must,
   therefore, be voluntary; and volition is only possible in a conscious
   being. But consciousness, again, is only conceivable as a relation.
   There must be a conscrious subject, and an object of which he is
   conscious. The subject is a subject to the object; the object is an
   object to the subject; and neither can exist by itself as the absolute.
   This difficulty, again, may be for the moment evaded, by distinguishing
   between the absolute as related to another, and the absolute as related
   to itself. The Absolute, it may be said, may possibly be conscious,
   provided it is only conscious of itself.^([58]24) But this alternative
   is, in ultimate analysis, no less self-destructive than the other. For
   the object of consciousness, whether a mode of the subject's existence
   or not, is either created in and by the act of consciousness, or has an
   existence independent of it. In the former case, the object depends
   upon the subject, and the subject alone is the true absolute. In the
   latter case, the subject depends upon the object, and the object alone
   is the true absolute. Or, if we attempt a third hypothesis, and
   maintain that each exists independently of the other, we have no
   absolute at all, but only a pair of relatives; for coexistence, whether
   in consciousness or not, is itself a relation.^([59]25)

   The corollary from this reasoning is obvious. Not only is the Absolute,
   as conceived, incapable of a necessary relation to anything else; but
   it is also incapable of containing, by the constitution of its own
   nature, an essential relation within itself; as a whole, for instance,
   composed of parts, or as a substance consisting of attributes, or as a
   conscious subject in antithesis to an object.^([60]26) For if there is
   in the absolute any principle of unity, distinct from the mere
   accumulation of parts or attributes, this principle alone is the true
   absolute. If, on the other hand, there is no such principle, then there
   is no absolute at all, but only a plurality of relatives.^([61]27) The
   almost unanimous voice of philosophy, in pronouncing that the absolute
   is both one and simple, must be accepted as the voice of reason also,
   so far as reason has any voice in the matter.^([62]28) But this
   absolute unity, as indifferent and containing no attributes, can
   neither be distinguished from the multiplicity of finite beings by any
   characteristic feature, nor be identified with them in their
   multiplicity.^([63]29) Thus we are landed in an inextricable dilemma.
   The Absolute cannot be conceived as conscious, neither can it be
   conceived as unconscious: it cannot be conceived as complex, neither
   can it be conceived as simple: it cannot be conceived by difference,
   neither can it be conceived by the absence of difference: it cannot be
   identified with the universe, neither can it be distinguished from it.
   The One and the Many, regarded as the beginning of existence, are thus
   alike incomprehensible.

   The fundamental conceptions of Rational Theology being thus
   self-destructive, we may naturally expect to find the same antagonism
   manifested in their special applications. These naturally inherit the
   infirmities of the principle from which they spring. If an absolute and
   infinite consciousness is a conception which contradicts itself, we
   need not wonder if its several modifications mutually exclude each
   other. A mental attribute, to be conceived as infinite, must be in
   actual exercise on every possible object: otherwise it is potential
   only with regard to those on which it is not exercised; and an
   unrealized potentiality is a limitation. Hence every infinite mode of
   consciousness must be regarded as extending over the field of every
   other; and their common action involves a perpetual antagonism. How,
   for example, can Infinite Power be able to do all things, and yet
   Infinite Goodness be unable to do evil? How can infinite Justice exact
   the utmost penalty for every sin, and yet Infinite Mercy pardon the
   sinner? How can Infinite Wisdom know all that is to come, and yet
   Infinite Freedom be at liberty to do or to forbear?^([64]30) How is the
   existence of Evil compatible with that of an infinitely perfect Being;
   for if he wills it, he is not infinitely good; and if he wills it not,
   his will is thwarted and his sphere of action limited? Here, again, the
   Pantheist is ready with his solution. There is in reality no such thing
   as evil: there is no such thing as punishment: there is no real
   relation between God and man at all. God is all that really exists: He
   does, by the necessity of His nature, all that is done: all acts are
   equally necessary and equally divine: all diversity is but a distorted
   representation of unity: all evil is but a delusive appearance of
   good.^([65]31) Unfortunately, the Pantheist does not tell us whence all
   this delusion derives its seeming existence.

   Let us however suppose for an instant that these difficulties are
   surmounted, and the existence of the Absolute securely established on
   the testimony of reason. Still we have not succeeded in reconciling
   this idea with that of a Cause: we have done nothing towards explaining
   how the absolute can give rise to the relative, the infinite to the
   finite. If the condition of causal activity is a higher state than that
   of quiescence, the absolute, whether acting voluntarily or
   involuntarily, has passed from a condition of comparative imperfection
   to one of comparative perfection; and therefore was not originally
   perfect. If the state of activity is an inferior state to that of
   quiescence, the Absolute, in becoming a cause, has lost its original
   perfection.^([66]32) There remains only the supposition that the two
   states are equal, and the act of creation one of complete indifference.
   But this supposition annihilates the unity, of the absolute, or it
   annihilates itself. If the act of creation is real, and yet
   indifferent, we must admit the possibility of two conceptions of the
   absolute, the one as productive, the other as non-productive. If the
   act is not real, the supposition itself vanishes, and we are thrown
   once more on the alternative of Pantheism.

   Again, how can the Relative be conceived as coming into being? If it is
   a distinct reality from the absolute, it must be conceived as passing
   from non-existence into existence. But to conceive an object as
   non-existent, is again a self-contradiction; for that which is
   conceived exists, as an object of thought, in and by that conception.
   We may abstain from thinking of an object at all; but, if we think of
   it, we cannot but think of it as existing. It is possible at one time
   not to think of an object at all, and at another to think of it as
   already in being; but to think of it in the act of becoming, in the
   progress from not being into being, is to think that which, in the very
   thought, annihilates itself. Here again the Pantheistic hypothesis
   seems forced upon us. We can think of creation only as a change in the
   condition of that which already exists; and thus the creature is
   conceivable only as a phenomenal mode of the being of the
   Creator.^([67]33)

   The whole of this web of contradictions (and it might be extended, if
   necessary, to a far greater length) is woven from one original warp and
   woof;--namely, the impossibility of conceiving the coexistence of the
   infinite and the finite, and the cognate impossibility of conceiving a
   first commencement of phenomena, or the absolute giving birth to the
   relative. The laws of thought appear to admit of no possible escape
   from the meshes in which thought is entangled, save by destroying one
   or the other of the cords of which they are composed. Pantheism or
   Atheism are thus the alternatives offered to us, according as we prefer
   to save the infinite by the sacrifice of the finite, or to maintain the
   finite by denying the existence of the infinite. Pantheism thus
   presents itself, as to all appearance the only logical conclusion, if
   we believe in the possibility of a Philosophy of the Infinite. But
   Pantheism, if it avoids self-contradiction in the course of its
   reasonings, does so only by an act of suicide at the outset. It escapes
   from some of the minor incongruities of thought, only by the
   annihilation of thought and thinker alike. It is saved from the
   necessity of demonstrating its own falsehood, by abolishing the only
   conditions under which truth and falsehood can be distinguished from
   each other. The only conception which I can frame of substantive
   existence at all, as distinguished from the transient accidents which
   are merely modes of the being of something else, is derived from the
   immediate knowledge of my own personal unity, amidst the various
   affections which form the successive modes of my consciousness. The
   Pantheist tells me that this knowledge is a delusion; that I am no
   substance, but a mode of the absolute substance, even as my thoughts
   and passions are modes of me; and that in order to attain to a true
   philosophy of being, I must begin by denying my own being. And for what
   purpose is this act of self-destruction needed? In order to preserve
   inviolate certain philosophical conclusions, which I, the non-existent
   thinker, have drawn by virtue of my non-existent powers of thought. But
   if my personal existence, the great primary fact of all consciousness,
   is a delusion, what claim have the reasonings of the Pantheist himself
   to be considered as anything better than a part of the universal
   falsehood? If I am mistaken in supposing myself to have a substantial
   existence at all, why is that existence more true when it is presented
   to me under the particular form of apprehending and accepting the
   arguments of the pantheistic philosophy? Nay, how do I know that there
   is any argument at all? For if my consciousness is mistaken in
   testifying to the fact of my own existence, it may surely be no less
   mistaken in testifying to my apparent apprehension of an apparent
   reasoning. Nay, the very arguments which appear to prove the
   Pantheist's conclusion to be true, may in reality, for aught I know,
   prove it to be false. Or rather, no Pantheist, if he is consistent with
   himself, can admit the existence of a distinction between truth and
   falsehood at all. For if God alone exists, in whatever way that
   existence may be explained, He alone is the immediate cause of all that
   takes place. I-le thinks all that is thought, He does all that is done.
   There can be no difference between truth and falsehood; for God is the
   only thinker; and all thoughts are equally necessary and equally
   divine. There can be no difference between right and wrong; for God is
   the only agent; and all acts are equally necessary and equally
   divine.^([68]34) How error and evil, even in appearance, are
   possible,--how the finite and the relative can appear to exist, even as
   a delusion,--is a problem which no system of Pantheism has made the
   slightest approach towards solving.^([69]35)

   Pantheism thus failing us, the last resource of Rationalism is to take
   refuge in that which, with reference to the highest idea of God, is
   speculative Atheism, and to deny that the Infinite exists at
   all.^([70]36) And it must be admitted that, so long as we confine
   ourselves to one side only of the problem, that of the inconceivability
   of the Infinite, this is the only position logically tenable by those
   who would make man's power of thought the exact measure of his duty of
   belief. For the infinite, as inconceivable, is necessarily shown to be
   non-existent; unless we renounce the claim of reason to supreme
   authority in matters of faith, by admitting that it is our duty to
   believe what we are altogether unable to comprehend. But the logical
   advantage of the atheistic alternative vanishes, as soon as we view the
   question from the other side, and endeavor positively to represent in
   thought the sum total of existence as a limited quantity. A limit is
   itself a relation; and to conceive a limit as such, is virtually to
   acknowledge the existence of a correlative on the other side of
   it.^([71]37) By a law of thought, the significance of which has perhaps
   not yet been fully investigated, it is impossible to conceive a finite
   object of any kind, without conceiving it as one out of many,--as
   related to other objects, coexistent and antecedent. A first moment of
   time, a first unit of space, a definite sum of all existence, are thus
   as inconceivable as the opposite suppositions of an infinity of
   each.^([72]38) While it is impossible to represent in thought any
   object, except as finite, it is equally impossible to represent any
   finite object, or any aggregate of finite objects, as exhausting the
   universe of being. Thus the hypothesis which would annihilate the
   Infinite is itself shattered to pieces against the rock of the
   Absolute; and we are involved in the self-contradictory assumption of a
   limited universe, which yet can neither contain a limit in itself, nor
   be limited by anything beyond itself. For if it contains a limit in
   itself, it is both limiting and limited, both beyond the limit, and
   within it; and if it is limited by anything else, it is not the
   universe.^([73]39)

   To sum up briefly this portion of my argument. The conception of the
   Absolute and Infinite, from whatever side we view it, appears
   encompassed with contradictions. There is a contradiction in supposing
   such an object to exist, whether alone or in conjunction with others;
   and there is a contradiction in supposing it not to exist. There is a
   contradiction in conceiving it as one; and there is a contradiction in
   conceiving it as many. There is a contradiction in conceiving it as
   personal; and there is a contradiction in conceiving it as impersonal.
   It cannot without contradiction be represented as active; nor, without
   equal contradiction, be represented as inactive. It cannot be conceived
   as the sum of all existence; nor yet can it be conceived as a part only
   of that sum. A contradiction thus thoroughgoing, while it sufficiently
   shows the impotence of human reason as an a priori judge of all truth,
   yet is not in itself inconsistent with any form of religious belief.
   For it tells with equal force against all belief and all unbelief, and
   therefore necessitates the conclusion that belief cannot be determined
   solely by reason. No conclusion can be drawn from it in favor of
   universal skepticism; first, because universal skepticism equally
   destroys itself; and secondly, because the contradictions thus detected
   belong not to the use of reason in general, but only to its exercise on
   one particular object of thought. It may teach us that it is our duty,
   in some instances, to believe that which we cannot conceive; but it
   does not require us to disbelieve anything which we are capable of
   conceiving.

   What we have hitherto been examining, be it remembered, is not the
   nature of the Absolute in itself, but only our own conception of that
   nature. The distortions of the image reflected may arise only from the
   inequalities of the mirror reflecting it. And this consideration leads
   us naturally back to the second of the two methods of religious
   philosophy which were mentioned at the beginning of the present
   Lecture. If the attempt to grasp the absolute nature of the Divine
   Object of religious thought thus fails us on every side, we have no
   resource but to recommence our inquiry by the opposite process, that of
   investigating the nature of the human Subject. Such an investigation
   will not, indeed, solve the contradictions which our previous attempt
   has elicited; but it may serve to show us why they are insoluble. If it
   cannot satisfy to the full the demands of reason, it may at least
   enable us to lay a reasonable foundation for the rightful claims of
   belief. If, from an examination of the laws and limits of human
   consciousness, we can show that thought is not, and cannot be, the
   measure of existence; if it can be shown that the contradictions which
   arise in the attempt to conceive the infinite, have their origin, not
   in the nature of that which we would conceive, but in the constitution
   of the mind conceiving; that they are such as must necessarily
   accompany every form of religion, and every renunciation of religion;
   we may thus prepare the way for a recognition of the separate provinces
   of Reason and Faith. This task I shall endeavor to accomplish in my
   next Lecture. Meanwhile, I would add but a few words, to point out the
   practical lesson to be drawn from our previous inquiry. It is this:
   that so far is human reason from being able to construct a scientific
   Theology, independent of and superior to Revelation, that it cannot
   even read the alphabet out of which that Theology must be framed. It
   has not been without much hesitation that I have ventured to address
   you in language seldom heard in this place,--to transport to the
   preacher's pulpit the vocabulary of metaphysical speculation. But it
   was only by such a course that I could hope to bring the antagonist
   principles of true and false religious philosophy face to face with
   each other. It needs but a slight acquaintance with the history of
   opinions, to show how intimately, in various ages, the current forms of
   religious belief or unbelief have been connected with the prevailing
   systems of speculative philosophy. It was in no small degree because
   the philosophy of Kant identified religion with morality, and
   maintained that the supernatural and the historical were not necessary
   to belief;^([74]40) that Paulus explained away the miracles of Christ,
   as misrepresentations of natural events;^([75]41) and Wegscheider
   claimed for the moral reason supreme authority in the interpretation of
   Scripture;^([76]42) and Röhr promulgated a new Creed, from which all
   the facts of Christianity are rejected, to make way for ethical
   precepts.^([77]43) It was in like manner because the philosophy of
   Hegel was felt to be incompatible with the belief in a personal God,
   and a personal Christ, and a supernatural revelation;^([78]44) that
   Vatke rejected the Old Testament history, as irreconcilable with the
   philosophical law of religious development;^([79]45) and Strauss
   endeavored by minute cavils to invalidate the Gospel narrative, in
   order to make way for the theory of an ideal Christ, manifested in the
   whole human race;^([80]46) and Feuerbach maintained that the Supreme
   Being is but humanity deified, and that the belief in a superhuman God
   is contradictory in itself, and pernicious in its
   consequences.^([81]47) And if, by wandering for a little while in the
   tangled mazes of metaphysical speculation, we can test the worth of the
   substitute which this philosophy offers us in the place of the faith
   which it rejects; if we can show how little such a substitute can
   satisfy even the intellect of man (to the heart it does not pretend to
   appeal), the inquiry may do some service, slight and indirect though it
   be, to the cause of Christian Truth, by suggesting to the wavering
   disciple, ere he quits the Master with whom he has hitherto walked, the
   pregnant question of the Apostle, "Lord, to whom shall we go?" [22]
   When Philosophy succeeds in exhibiting in a clear and consistent form
   the Infinite Being of God; when her opposing schools are agreed among
   themselves as to the manner in which a knowledge of the Infinite takes
   place, or the marks by which it is to be discerned when known; then,
   and not till then, may she claim to speak as one having authority in
   controversies of Faith. But while she speaks with stammering lips, and
   a double tongue; while she gropes her way in darkness, and stumbles at
   every step; while she has nothing to offer us but the alternative of
   principles which abjure consciousness, or a consciousness which
   contradicts itself, we may well pause before we appeal to her decisions
   as the gauge and measure of religious truth.

   In one respect, indeed, I have perhaps departed from the customary
   language of the pulpit, to a greater extent than was absolutely
   necessary;--namely, in dealing with the ideas common to Theology and
   Metaphysics in the terms of the latter, rather than in those of the
   former. But there is a line of argument, in which the vague
   generalities of the Absolute and the Infinite may be more reverently
   and appropriately employed than the sacred names and titles of God. For
   we almost instinctively shrink back from the recklessness which thrusts
   forward, on every occasion, the holiest names and things, to be tossed
   to and fro, and trampled under foot, in the excitement of controversy.
   We feel that the name of Him whom we worship may not lightly be held up
   as a riddle for prying curiosity to puzzle over: we feel that the
   Divine Personality of our Father in Heaven is not a thing to be pitted
   in the arena of disputation, against the lifeless abstractions and
   sophistical word-jugglings of Pantheism. We feel that, though God is
   indeed, in His incomprehensible Essence, absolute and infinite, it is
   not as the Absolute and Infinite that He appeals to the love and the
   fear and the reverence of His creatures. We feel that the life of
   religion lies in the human relations in which God reveals Himself to
   man, not in the divine perfection which those relations veil and
   modify, though without wholly concealing. We feel that the God to whom
   we pray, and in whom we trust, is not so much the God eternal and
   infinite, without body, parts, or passions (though we acknowledge that
   He is all these), as the God who is "gracious and merciful, slow to
   anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth Him of the evil." [23]
   ^([82]48) Those who have observed the prevailing character of certain
   schools of religious thought, in that country which, more than any
   other, has made Religion speak the language of Metaphysics; those who
   have observed how often, in modern literature, both at home and abroad,
   the most sacred. names are played with, in familiar, almost in
   contemptuous intimacy, will need no other proof to convince them that
   we cannot attach too much importance to the duty of separating, as far
   as it can be effected, the language of prayer and praise from the
   definitions and distinctions of philosophy.

   The metaphysical difficulties which have been exhibited in the course
   of this Lecture almost suggest of themselves the manner in which they
   should be treated. We must begin with that which is within us, not with
   that which is above us; with the philosophy of Man, not with that of
   God. Instead of asking, what are the facts and laws in the constitution
   of the universe, or in the Divine Nature, by virtue of which certain
   conceptions present certain anomalies to the human mind, we should
   rather ask, what are the facts and laws in the constitution of the
   human mind, by virtue of which it finds itself involved in
   contradictions, whenever it ventures on certain courses of speculation.
   Philosophy, as well as Scripture, rightly employed, will teach a lesson
   of humility to its disciple; exhibiting, as it does, the spectacle of a
   creature of finite intuitions, surrounded by partial indications of the
   Unlimited; of finite conceptions, in the midst of partial
   manifestations of the Incomprehensible. Questioned in this spirit, the
   voice of Philosophy will be but an echo of the inspired language of the
   Psalmist: "Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand
   upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me: it is high; I cannot
   attain unto it." [24]

LECTURE III.

   AND HE SAID, THOU CANST NOT SEE MY FACE; FOR THERE SHALL NO MAN SEE ME,
   AND LIVE. AND THE LORD SAID, BEHOLD, THERE IS A PLACE BY ME, AND THOU
   SHALT STAND UPON A ROCK: AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS, WHILE MY GLORY
   PASSETH BY, THAT I WILL PUT THEE IN A CLEFT OF THE ROCK, AND WILL COVER
   THEE WITH MY HAND WHILE I PASS BY: AND I WILL TAKE AWAY MINE HAND, AND
   THOU SHALT SEE MY BACK PARTS; BUT MY FACE SHALL NOT BE SEEN.--EXODUS
   XXXIII. 20-23.

   MY last Lecture was chiefly occupied with an examination of the ideas
   of the Absolute and the Infinite,--ideas which are indispensable to the
   foundation of a metaphysical Theology, and of which a clear and
   distinct consciousness must be acquired, if such a Theology is to exist
   at all. I attempted to show the inadequacy of these ideas for such a
   purpose, by reason of the contradictions which to our apprehension they
   necessarily involve from every point of view. The result of that
   attempt may be briefly summed up as follows. We are compelled, by the
   constitution of our minds, to believe in the existence of an Absolute
   and Infinite Being,--a belief which appears forced upon us, as the
   complement of our consciousness of the relative and the finite. But the
   instant we attempt to analyze the ideas thus suggested to us, in the
   hope of attaining to an intelligible conception of them, we are on
   every side involved in inextricable confusion and contradiction. It is
   no matter from what point of view we commence our
   examination;--whether, with the Theist, we admit the coexistence of the
   Infinite and the Finite, as distinct realities; or, with the Pantheist,
   deny the real existence of the Finite; or, with the Atheist, deny the
   real existence of the Infinite;--on each of these suppositions alike,
   our reason appears divided against itself, compelled to admit the truth
   of one hypothesis, and yet unable to overcome the apparent
   impossibilities of each. The philosophy of Rationalism, thus traced
   upwards to its highest principles, finds no legitimate resting-place,
   from which to commence its deduction of religious consequences.

   In the present Lecture, it will be my endeavor to offer some
   explanation of the singular phenomenon of human thought, which is
   exhibited in these results. I propose to examine the same ideas of the
   Absolute and the Infinite from the opposite side, in order to see if
   any light can be thrown on the anomalies which they present to us, by a
   reference to the mental laws under which they are formed.
   Contradiction, whatever may be its ultimate import, is in itself not a
   quality of things, but a mode in which they are viewed by the mind; and
   the inquiry which it most immediately suggests is, not an investigation
   of the nature of things in themselves, but an examination of those
   mental conditions under which it is elicited in thought. Such an
   examination, if it does not enable us to extend the sphere of thought
   beyond a certain point, may at least serve to make us more distinctly
   conscious of its true boundaries.

   The much-disputed question, to what class of mental phenomena the
   religious consciousness belongs, must be postponed to a later stage of
   our inquiry. At present, we are concerned with a more general
   investigation, which the answer to that question will in nowise affect.
   Whether the relation of man to God be primarily presented to the human
   mind in the form of knowledge, or of feeling, or of practical impulse,
   it can be given only as a mode of consciousness, subject to those
   conditions under which alone consciousness is possible. Whatever
   knowledge is imparted, whatever impulse is communicated, whatever
   feeling is excited, in man's mind, must take place in a manner adapted
   to the constitution of its human recipient, and must exhibit such
   characteristics as the laws of that constitution impose upon it. A
   brief examination of the conditions of human consciousness in general
   will thus form a proper preliminary to any inquiry concerning the
   religious consciousness in particular.

   Now, in the first place, the very conception of Consciousness, in
   whatever mode it may be manifested, necessarily implies distinction
   between one object and another. To be conscious, we must be conscious
   of something; and that something can only be known as that which it is,
   by being distinguished from that which it is not.^([83]1) But
   distinction is necessarily limitation; for, if one object is to be
   distinguished from another, it must possess some form of existence
   which the other has not, or it must not possess some form which the
   other has. But it is obvious that the Infinite cannot be distinguished,
   as such, from the Finite, by the absence of any quality which the
   Finite possesses; for such absence would be a limitation. Nor yet can
   it be distinguished by the presence of an attribute which the Finite
   has not; for, as no finite part can be a constituent of an infinite
   whole, this differential characteristic must itself be infinite; and
   must at the same time have nothing in common with the finite. We are
   thus thrown back upon our former impossibility; for this second
   infinite will be distinguished from the finite by the absence of
   qualities which the latter possesses. A consciousness of the Infinite
   as such thus necessarily involves a self-contradiction; for it implies
   the recognition, by limitation and difference, of that which can only
   be given as unlimited and indifferent.^([84]2) That man can be
   conscious of the Infinite, is thus a supposition which, in the very
   terms in which it is expressed, annihilates itself. Consciousness is
   essentially a limitation; for it is the determination of the mind to
   one actual out of many possible modifications. But the Infinite, if it
   is to be conceived at all, must be conceived as potentially everything
   and actually nothing; for if there is anything in general which it
   cannot become, it is thereby limited; and if there is anything in
   particular which it actually is, it is thelreby excluded from being any
   other thing. But again, it must also be conceived as actually
   everything and potentially nothing; for an unrealized potentiality is
   likewise a limitation.^([85]3) If the infinite can be that which it is
   not, it is by that very possibility marked out as incomplete, and
   capable of a higher perfection. If it is actually everything, it
   possesses no characteristic feature, by which it can be distinguished
   from anything else, and discerned as an object of consciousness.

   This contradiction, which is utterly inexplicable on the supposition
   that the infinite is a positive object of human thought, is at once
   accounted for, when it is regarded as the mere negation of thought. If
   all thought is limitation,--if whatever we conceive is, by the very act
   of conception, regarded as finite,--the infinite, from a human point of
   view, is merely a name for the absence of those conditions under which
   thought is possible. To speak of a Conception of the Infinite is,
   therefore, at once to affirm those conditions and to deny them. The
   contradiction, which we discover in such a conception, is only that
   which we have ourselves placed there, by tacitly assuming the
   conceivability of the inconceivable. The condition of consciousness is
   distinction; and the condition of distinction is limitation. We have no
   consciousness of Being in general which is not some Being in
   particular; a thing, in consciousness, is one thing out of many. In
   assuming the possibility of an infinite object of consciousness, I
   assume, therefore, that it is at the same time limited and
   unlimited;--actually something, without which it could not be an object
   of consciousness, and actually nothing, without which it could not be
   infinite.^([86]4)

   Rationalism is thus only consistent with itself, when it refuses to
   attribute consciousness to God. Consciousness, in the only form in
   which we can conceive it, implies limitation and change,--the
   perception of one object out of many, and a comparison of that object
   with others. To be always conscious of the same object, is, humanly
   speaking, not to be conscious at all;^([87]5) and, beyond its human
   manifestation, we can have no conception of what consciousness is.
   Viewed on the side of the object of consciousness, the same principle
   will carry us further still. Existence itself, that so-called highest
   category of thought, is only conceivable in the form of existence
   modified in some particular manner. Strip off its modification, and the
   apparent paradox of the German philosopher becomes literally
   true;--pure being is pure nothing.^([88]6) We have no conception of
   existence which is not existence in some particular manner; and if we
   abstract from the manner, we have nothing left to constitute the
   existence. Those who, in their horror of what they call
   anthropomorphism, or anthropopathy, refuse to represent the Deity under
   symbols borrowed from the limitations of human consciousness, are
   bound, in consistency, to deny that God exists; for the conception of
   existence is as human and as limited as any other. The conclusion which
   Fichte boldly announces, awful as it is, is but the legitimate
   consequence of his premises. "The moral order of the universe is itself
   God: we need no other, and we can comprehend no other."^([89]7)

   A second characteristic of Consciousness is, that it is only possible
   in the form of a relation. There must be a Subject, or person
   conscious, and an Object, or thing of which he is conscious. There can
   be no consciousness without the union of these two factors; and, in
   that union, each exists only as it is related to the other.^([90]8) The
   subject is a subject, only in so far as it is conscious of an object:
   the object is an object, only in so far as it is apprehended by a
   subject: and the destruction of either is the destruction of
   consciousness itself. It is thus manifest that a consciousness of the
   Absolute is equally self-contradictory with that of the Infinite. To be
   conscious of the Absolute as such, we must know that an object, which
   is given in relation to our consciousness, is identical with one which
   exists in its own nature, out of all relation to consciousness. But to
   know this identity, we must compare the two together; and such a
   comparison is itself a contradiction. We are in fact required to
   compare that of which we are conscious with that of which we are not
   conscious; the comparison itself being an act of consciousness, and
   only possible through the consciousness of both its objects. It is thus
   manifest that, even if we could be conscious of the absolute, we could
   not possibly know that it is the absolute: and, as we can be conscious
   of an object as such, only by knowing it to be what it is, this is
   equivalent to an admission that we cannot be conscious of the absolute
   at all. As an object of consciousness, everything is necessarily
   relative; and what a thing may be out of consciousness, no mode of
   consciousness can tell us.

   This contradiction, again, admits of the same explanation as the
   former. Our whole notion of existence is necessarily relative; for it
   is existence as conceived by us. But Existence, as we conceive it, is
   but a name for the several ways in which objects are presented to our
   consciousness,--a general term, embracing a variety of relations. The
   Absolute, on the other hand, is a term expressing no object of thought,
   but only a denial of the relation by which thought is constituted. To
   assume absolute existence as an object of thought, is thus to suppose a
   relation existing when the related terms exist no longer. An object of
   thought exists, as such, in and through its relation to a thinker;
   while the Absolute, as such, is independent of all relation. The
   Conception of the Absolute thus implies at the same time the presence
   and the absence of the relation by which thought is constituted; and
   our various endeavors to represent it are only so many modified forms
   of the contradiction involved in our original assumption. Here, too,
   the contradiction is one which we ourselves have made. It does not
   imply that the Absolute cannot exist; but it implies, most certainly,
   that we cannot conceive it as existing.^([91]9)

   Philosophers who are anxious to avoid this conclusion have sometimes
   attempted to evade it, by asserting that we may have in consciousness a
   partial, but not a total knowledge of the infinite and the
   absolute.^([92]10) But here again the supposition refutes itself. To
   have a partial knowledge of an object, is to know a part of it, but not
   the whole. But the part of the infinite which is supposed to be known
   must be itself either infinite or finite. If it is infinite, it
   presents the same difficulties as before. If it is finite, the point in
   question is conceded, and our consciousness is allowed to be limited to
   finite objects. But in truth it is obvious, on a moment's reflection,
   that neither the Absolute nor the Infinite can be represented in the
   form of a whole composed of parts. Not the Absolute; for the existence
   of a whole is dependent on the existence of its parts. Not the
   Infinite; for if any part is infinite, it cannot be distinguished from
   the whole; and if each part is finite, no number of such parts can
   constitute the Infinite.

   It would be possible, did my limits allow, to pursue the argument at
   length, through the various special modifications which constitute the
   subordinate forms of consciousness. But with reference to the present
   inquiry, it will be sufficient to notice two other conditions, under
   which all consciousness is necessarily manifested; both of which have a
   special bearing on the relation of philosophy to theological
   controversy.

   All human consciousness, as being a change in our mental state, is
   necessarily subject to the law of Time, in its two manifestations of
   Succession and Duration. Every object, of whose existence we can be in
   any way conscious, is necessarily apprehended by us as succeeding in
   time to some former object of consciousness, and as itself occupying a
   certain portion of time. In the former point of view, it is manifest,
   from what has been said before, that whatever succeeds something else,
   and is distinguished from it, is necessarily apprehended as finite; for
   distinction is itself a limitation. In the latter point of view, it is
   no less manifest that whatever is conceived as having a continuous
   existence in time is equally apprehended as finite. For continuous
   existence is necessarily conceived as divisible into successive
   moments. One portion has already gone by; another is yet to come; each
   successive moment is related to something which has preceded, and to
   something which is to follow: and out of such relations the entire
   existence is made up. The acts, by which such existence is manifested,
   being continuous in time, have, at any given moment, a further activity
   still to come: the object so existing must therefore always be regarded
   as capable of becoming something which it is not yet actually,--as
   having an existence incomplete, and receiving at each instant a further
   completion. It is manifest therefore that, if all objects of human
   thought exist in time, no such object can be regarded as exhibiting, or
   representing the true nature of an Infinite Being.

   As a necessary consequence of this limitation, it follows, that an act
   of Creation, in the highest sense of the term,--that is to say, an
   absolutely first link in the chain of phenomena, preceded by no
   temporal antecedent,--is to human thought inconceivable. To represent
   in thought the first act of the first cause of all things, I must
   conceive myself as placed in imagination at the point at which temporal
   succession commences, and as thus conscious of the relation between a
   phenomenon in time and a reality out of time. But the consciousness of
   such a relation implies a consciousness of both the related members; to
   realize which, the mind must be in and out of time at the same moment.
   Time, therefore, cannot be regarded as limited; for to conceive a first
   or last moment of time would be to conceive a consciousness into which
   time enters, preceded or followed by one from which it is absent. But,
   on the other hand, an infinite succession in time is equally
   inconceivable; for this succession also cannot be bounded by time, and
   therefore can only be apprehended by one who is himself free from the
   law of conceiving in time. From a human point of view, such a
   conception could only be formed by thrusting back the boundary
   forever;--a process which itself would require an infinite time for its
   accomplishment.^([93]11) Clogged by these counter impossibilities of
   thought, two opposite speculations have in vain struggled to find
   articulate utterance, the one for the hypothesis of an endless duration
   of finite changes, the other for that of an existence prior to duration
   itself. It is perhaps another aspect of the same difficulty, that,
   among various theories of the generation of the world, the idea of a
   creation out of nothing seems to have been altogether foreign to
   ancient philosophy.^([94]12)

   The limited character of all existence which can be conceived as having
   a continuous duration, or as made up of successive moments, is so far
   manifest, that it has been assumed, almost as an axiom, by
   philosophical theologians, that in the existence of God there is no
   distinction between past, present, and future. "In the changes of
   things," says Augustine, there is a past and a future: in God there is
   a present, in which neither past nor future can be."^([95]13)
   "Eternity," says Boethius, "is the perfect possession of interminable
   life, and of all that life at once:"^([96]14) and Aquinas, accepting
   the definition, adds, "Eternity has no succession, but exists all
   together."^([97]15) But, whether this assertion be literally true or
   not (and this we have no means of ascertaining), it is clear that such
   a mode of existence is altogether inconceivable by us, and that the
   words in which it is described represent not thought, but the refusal
   to think at all. It is impossible that man, so long as he exists in
   time, should contemplate an object in whose existence there is no time.
   For the thought by which he contemplates it must be one of his own
   mental states: it must have a beginning and an end: it must occupy a
   certain portion of duration, as a fact of human consciousness. There is
   therefore no manner of resemblance or community of nature between the
   representative thought and that which it is supposed to represent; for
   the one cannot exist out of time, and the other cannot exist in
   it.^([98]16) Nay, more: even were a mode of representation out of time
   possible to a man, it is utterly impossible that he should know it to
   be so, or make any subsequent use of the knowledge thus conveyed to
   him. To be conscious of a thought as mine, I must know it as a present
   condition of my consciousness: to know that it has been mine, I must
   remember it as a past condition; and past and present are alike modes
   of time. It is manifest, therefore, that a knowledge of the infinite,
   as existing out of time, even supposing it to take place at all, cannot
   be known to be taking place, cannot be remembered to have taken place,
   and cannot be made available for any purpose at any period of our
   temporal life.^([99]17)

   The command, so often urged upon man by philosophers and theologians of
   various ages and schools, "In contemplating God, transcend
   time,"^([100]18) if meant for anything more than a figure of rhetoric,
   is equivalent to saying, "Be man no more; be thyself God." It amounts
   to the admission that, to know the infinite, the human mind must itself
   be infinite; because an object of consciousness, which is in any way
   limited by the conditions of human thought, cannot be accepted as a
   representation of the unlimited. But two infinites cannot be conceived
   as existing together; and if the mind of man must become infinite to
   know God, it must itself be God.^([101]19) Pantheism, or
   self-acknowledged falsehood, are thus the only alternatives possible
   under this precept. If the human mind, remaining in reality finite,
   merely fancies itself to be infinite in its contemplation of God, the
   knowledge of God is itself based on a falsehood. If, on the other hand,
   it not merely imagines itself to be, but actually is, infinite, its
   personality is swallowed up in the infinity of the Deity; its human
   existence is a delusion: God is, literally and properly, all that
   exists; and the Finite, which appears to be, but is not, vanishes
   before the single existence of the One and All.

   Subordinate to the general law of Time, to which all consciousness is
   subject, there are two inferior conditions, to which the two great
   divisions of consciousness are severally subject. Our knowledge of body
   is governed by the condition of space; our knowledge of mind by that of
   personality. I can conceive no qualities of body, save as having a
   definite local position; and I can conceive no qualities of mind, save
   as modes of a conscious self. With the former of these limitations our
   present argument is not concerned; but the latter, as the necessary
   condition of the conception of spiritual existence, must be taken into
   account in estimating the philosophical value of man's conception of an
   infinite Mind.

   The various mental attributes which we ascribe to God--Benevolence,
   Holiness, Justice, Wisdom, for example--can be conceived by us only as
   existing in a benevolent and holy and just and wise Being, who is not
   identical with any one of his attributes, but the common subject of
   them all; in one word, in a Person. But Personality, as we conceive it,
   is essentially a limitation and a relation.^([102]20) Our own
   personality is presented to us as relative and limited; and it is from
   that presentation that all our representative notions of personality
   are derived. Personality is presented to us as a relation between the
   conscious self and the various modes of his consciousness. There is no
   personality in abstract thought without a thinker: there is no thinker,
   unless he exercises some mode of thought. Personality is also a
   limitation; for the thought and the thinker are distinguished from and
   limit each other; and the several modes of thought are distinguished
   each from each by limitation likewise. If I am any one of my own
   thoughts, I live and die with each successive moment of my
   consciousness. If I am not any one of my own thoughts, I am limited by
   that very difference, and each thought, as different from another, is
   limited also. This, too, has been clearly seen by philosophical
   theologians; and accordingly, they have maintained that in God there is
   no distinction between the subject of consciousness and its modes, nor
   between one mode and another. "God," says Augustine, "is not a Spirit
   as regards substance, and good as regards quality; but both as regards
   substance. The justice of God is one with his goodness and with his
   blessedness; and all are one with his spirituality."^([103]21) But this
   assertion, if it be literally true (and of this we have no means of
   judging), annihilates Personality itself, in the only form in which we
   can conceive it. We cannot transcend our own personality, as we cannot
   transcend our own relation to time: and to speak of an Absolute and
   Infinite Person, is simply to use language to which, however true it
   may be in a superhuman sense, no mode of human thought can possibly
   attach itself.

   But are we therefore justified, even on philosophical grounds, in
   denying the Personality of God? or do we gain a higher or a truer
   representation of Him, by asserting, with the ancient or the modern
   Pantheist, that God, as absolute and infinite, can have neither
   intelligence nor will?^([104]22) Far from it. We dishonor God far more
   by identifying Him with the feeble and negative impotence of thought,
   which we are pleased to style the Infinite, than by remaining content
   within those limits which He for his own good purposes has imposed upon
   us, and confining ourselves to a manifestation, imperfect indeed and
   inadequate, and acknowledged to be so, but still the highest idea that
   we can form, the noblest tribute that we can offer. Personality, with
   all its limitations, though far from exhibiting the absolute nature of
   God as He is, is yet truer, grander, more elevating, more religious,
   than those barren, vague, meaningless abstractions in which men babble
   about nothing under the name of the Infinite. Personal, conscious
   existence, limited though it be, is yet the noblest of all existences
   of which man can dream; for it is that by which all existence is
   revealed to him: it is grander than the grandest object which man can
   know; for it is that which knows, not that which is known.^([105]23)
   "Man," says Pascal, "is but a reed, the frailest in nature; but he is a
   reed that thinks. It needs not that the whole universe should arm
   itself to crush him;--a vapor, a drop of water, will suffice to destroy
   him. But should the universe crush him, man would yet be nobler than
   that which destroys him; for he knows that he dies; while of the
   advantage which the universe has over him, the universe knows
   nothing."^([106]24) It is by consciousness alone that we know that God
   exists, or that we are able to offer Him any service. It is only by
   conceiving Him as a Conscious Being, that we can stand in any religious
   relation to Him at all; that we can form such a representation of Him
   as is demanded by our spiritual wants, insufficient though it be to
   satisfy our intellectual curiosity.

   It is from the intense consciousness of our own real existence as
   Persons, that the conception of reality takes its rise in our minds: it
   is through that consciousness alone that we can raise ourselves to the
   faintest image of the supreme reality of God. What is reality, and what
   is appearance, is the riddle which Philosophy has put forth from the
   birthday of human thought; and the only approach to an answer has been
   a voice from the depths of the personal consciousness: "I think;
   therefore I am."^([107]25) In the antithesis between the thinker and
   the object of his thought,--between myself and that which is related to
   me,--we find the type and the source of the universal contrast between
   the one and the many, the permanent and the changeable, the real and
   the apparent. That which I see, that which I hear, that which I think,
   that which I feel, changes and passes away with each moment of iy
   varied existence. I, who see, and hear, and think, and feel, am the one
   continuous self, whose existence gives unity and connection to the
   whole. Personality comprises all that we know of that which exists:
   relation to personality comprises all that we know of that which seems
   to exist. And when, from the little world of man's consciousness and
   its objects, we would lift up our eyes to the inexhaustible universe
   beyond, and ask, to. whom all this is related, the highest existence is
   still the highest personality; and the Source of all Being reveals
   Himself by His name, I AM. [25] ^([108]26)

   If there is one dream of a godless philosophy to which, beyond all
   others, every moment of our consciousness gives the lie, it is that
   which subordinates the individual to the universal, the person to the
   species; which deifies kinds and realizes classifications; which sees
   Being in generalization, and Appearance in limitation; which regards
   the living and conscious man as a wave on the ocean of 1the unconscious
   infinite; his life, a momentary tossing to and fro on the shifting
   tide; his destiny, to be swallowed up in the formless and boundless
   universe.^([109]27) The final conclusion of this philosophy, in direct
   antagonism to the voice of consciousness, is, "I think; therefore I am
   not." When men look around them in bewilderment for that which lies
   within them; when they talk of the enduring species and the perishing
   individual, and would find, in the abstractions which their own minds
   have made, a higher and truer existence than in the mind which made
   them;--they seek for that which they know, and know not that for which
   they seek.^([110]28) They would fain lift up the curtain of their own
   being, to view the picture which it conceals. Like the painter of old,
   they know not that the curtain is the picture.^([111]29)

   It is our duty, then, to think of God as personal; and it is our duty
   to believe that He is infinite. It is true that we cannot reconcile
   these two representations with each other; as our conception of
   personality involves attributes apparently contradictory to the notion
   of infinity. But it does not follow that this contradiction exists any
   where but in our own minds: it does not follow that it implies any
   impossibility in the absolute nature of God. The apparent
   contradiction, in this case, as in those previously noticed, is the
   necessary consequence of an attempt on the part of the human thinker to
   transcend the boundaries of his own consciousness. It proves that there
   are limits to man's power of thought; and it proves no more.

   The preceding considerations are equally conclusive against both the
   methods of metaphysical theology described in my last Lecture,--that
   which commences with the divine to reason down to the human, and that
   which commences with the human to reason up to the divine. For though
   the mere abstract expression of the infinite, when regarded as
   indicating nothing more than the negation of limitation, and,
   therefore, of conceivability, is not contradictory in itself; it
   becomes so the instant we attempt to apply it in reasoning to any
   object of thought. A thing--an object--an attribute--a person--or any
   other term signifying one out of many possible objects of
   consciousness, is by that very relation necessarily declared to be
   finite. An infinite thing, or object, or attribute, or person, is,
   therefore, in the same moment declared to be both finite and infinite.
   We cannot, therefore, start from any abstract assumption of the divine
   infinity, to reason downwards to any object of human thought. And, on
   the other hand, if all human attributes are conceived under the
   conditions of difference, and relation, and time, and personality, we
   cannot represent in thought any such attribute magnified to infinity;
   for this, again, is to conceive it as finite and infinite at the same
   time. We can conceive such attributes, at the utmost, only
   indefinitely: that is to say, we may withdraw our thought, for the
   moment, from the fact of their being limited; but we cannot conceive
   them as infinite: that is to say, we cannot positively think of the
   absence of the limit; for, the instant we attempt to do so, the
   antagonist elements of the conception exclude one another, and
   annihilate the whole.

   There remains but one subterfuge to which Philosophy can have recourse,
   before she is driven to confess that the Absolute and the Infinite are
   beyond her grasp. If consciousness is against her, she must endeavor to
   get rid of consciousness itself And, accordingly, the most
   distinguished representatives of this philosophy in recent times,
   however widely differing upon other questions, agree in maintaining
   that the foundation for a knowledge of the infinite must be laid in a
   point beyond consciousness.^([112]30) But a system which starts from
   this assumption postulates its own failure at the outset. It attempts
   to prove that consciousness is a delusion; and consciousness itself is
   made the instrument of proof; for by consciousness its reasonings must
   be framed and apprehended. It is by reasonings, conducted in conformity
   to the ordinary laws of thought, that the philosopher attempts to show
   that the highest manifestations of reason are above those laws. It is
   by representations, exhibited under the conditions of time and
   difference, that the philosopher endeavors to prove the existence, and
   deliver the results, of an intuition in which time and difference are
   annihilated. They thus assume, at the same moment, the truth and the
   falsehood of the normal consciousness; they divide the human mind
   against itself; and by that division prove no more than that two
   supposed faculties of thought mutually invalidate each other's
   evidence. Thus, by an act of reason, philosophy destroys reason itself:
   it passes at once from rationalism to mysticism, and makes
   inconceivability the criterion of truth. In dealing with religious
   truths, the theory which repudiates with scorn the notion of believing
   a doctrine although it is incomprehensible, springs at one desperate
   bound clear over faith into credulity, and proclaims that its own
   principles must be believed because they are incomprehensible. The
   rhetorical paradox of the fervid African is adopted in cold blood as an
   axiom of metaphysical speculation: "It is certain, because it is
   impossible."^([113]31) Such a theory is open to two fatal
   objections,--it cannot be communicated, and it cannot be verified. It
   cannot be communicated; for the communication must be made in words;
   and the meaning of those words must be understood; and the
   understanding is a state of the normal consciousness. It cannot be
   verified; for, to verify, we must compare the author's experience with
   our own; and such a comparison is again a state of consciousness. Let
   it be granted for a moment, though the concession refutes itself, that
   a man may have a cognizance of the infinite by some mode of knowledge
   which is above consciousness. He can never say that the idea thus
   acquired is like or unlike that possessed by any other man; for
   likeness implies comparison; and comparison is only possible as a mode
   of consciousness, and between objects regarded as limited and related
   to each other. That which is out of consciousness cannot be pronounced
   true; for truth is the correspondence between a conscious
   representation and the object which it represents. Neither can it be
   pronounced false; for falsehood consists in the disagreement between a
   similar representation and its object. Here, then, is the very suicide
   of Rationalism. To prove its own truth and the falsehood of
   antagonistic systems, it postulates a condition under which neither
   truth nor falsehood is possible.

   The results, to which an examination of the facts of consciousness has
   conducted us, may be briefly summed up as follows. Our whole
   consciousness manifests itself as subject to certain limits, which we
   are unable, in any act of thought, to transgress. That which falls
   within these limits, as an object of thought is known to us as relative
   and finite. The existence of a limit to our powers of thought is
   manifested by the consciousness of contradiction, which implies at the
   same time an attempt to think and an inability to accomplish that
   attempt. But a limit is necessarily conceived as a relation between
   something within and something without itself; and thus the
   consciousness of a limit of thought implies, though it does not
   directly present to us, the existence of something of which we do not
   and cannot think. When we lift up our eyes to that blue vault of
   heaven, which is itself but the limit of our own power of sight, we are
   compelled to suppose, though we cannot perceive, the existence of space
   beyond, as well as within it; we regard the boundary of vision as
   parting the visible from the invisible. And when, in mental
   contemplation, we are conscious of relation and difference, as the
   limits of our power of thought, we regard them, in like manner, as the
   boundary between the conceivable and the inconceivable; though we are
   unable to penetrate, in thought, beyond the nether sphere, to the
   unrelated and unlimited which it hides from us.^([114]32) The Absolute
   and the Infinite are thus, like the Inconceiveable and the
   Imperceptible, names indicating, not an object of thought or of
   consciousness at all, but the mere absence of the conditions under
   which consciousness is possible. The attempt to construct in thought an
   object answering to such names, necessarily results in contradiction; a
   contradiction, however, which we have ourselves produced by the attempt
   to think;--which exists in the act of thought, but not beyond
   it;--which destroys the conception as such, but indicates nothing
   concerning the existence or non-existence of that which we try to
   conceive. It proves our own impotence, and it proves nothing more. Or
   rather, it indirectly leads us to believe in the existence of that
   Infinite which we cannot conceive; for the denial of its existence
   involves a contradiction, no less than the assertion of its
   conceivability. We thus learn that the provinces of Reason and Faith
   are not coëxtensive;--that it is a duty, enjoined by Reason itself, to
   believe in that which we are unable to comprehend.

   I have now concluded that portion of my argument in which it was
   necessary to investigate in abstract terms the limits of human thought
   in general, as a preliminary to the examination of religious thought in
   particular. As yet, we have viewed only the negative side of man's
   consciousness;--we have seen how it does not represent God, and why it
   does not so represent Him. There remains still to be attempted the
   positive side of the same inquiry,--namely, what does our consciousness
   actually tell us concerning the Divine Existence and Attributes; and
   how does its testimony agree with that furnished by Revelation. In
   prosecuting this further inquiry, I hope to be able to confine myself
   to topics more resembling those usually handled in this place, and to
   language more strictly appropriate to the treatment of Christian
   Theology. Yet there are advantages in the method which I have hitherto
   pursued, which may, I trust, be accepted as a sufficient cause for
   whatever may have sounded strange and obscure in its phraseology. So
   long as the doubts and difficulties of philosophical speculation are
   familiar to us only in their religious aspect and language, so long we
   may be led to think that there is some peculiar defect or perplexity in
   the evidences of religion, by which it is placed in apparent antagonism
   to the more obvious and unquestionable conclusions of reason. A very
   brief examination of cognate questions in their metaphysical aspect,
   will suffice to dissipate this misapprehension, and to show that the
   philosophical difficulties, which rationalists profess to discover in
   Christian doctrines, ale in fact inherent in the laws of human thought,
   and must accompany every attempt at religious or irreligious
   speculation.

   There is also another consideration, which may justify the Christian
   preacher in examining, at times, the thoughts and language of human
   philosophy, apart from their special application to religious truths. A
   religious association may sometimes serve to disguise the real
   character of a line of thought which, without that association, would
   have little power to mislead. Speculations which end in unbelief are
   often commenced in a believing spirit. It is painful, but at the same
   time instructive, to trace the gradual progress by which an unstable
   disciple often tears off strip by strip the wedding garment of his
   faith,--scarce conscious the while of his own increasing
   nakedness,--and to mark how the language of Christian belief may remain
   almost untouched, when the substance and the life have departed from
   it. While Philosophy speaks nothing but the language of Christianity,
   we may be tempted to think that the two are really one; that our own
   speculations are but leading us to Christ by another and a more
   excellent way. Many a young aspirant after a philosophical faith,
   trusts himself to the trackless ocean of rationalism in the spirit of
   the too-confident Apostle: "Lord, bid me to come unto thee on the
   water." [26] And for a while he knows not how deep he sinks, till the
   treacherous surface on which he treads is yielding on every side, and
   the dark abyss of utter unbelief is yawning to swallow him up. Well is
   it indeed with those who, even in that last fearful hour, can yet cry,
   "Lord, save me!" and can feel that supporting hand stretched out to
   grasp them, and hear that voice, so warning, yet so comforting, "O thou
   of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"

   But who that enters upon this course of mistrust shall dare to say that
   such will be the end of it? Far better is it to learn at the outset the
   nature of that unstable surface on which we would tread, without being
   tempted by the phantom of religious promise, which shines delusively
   over it. He who hath ordered all things in measure and number and
   weight, [27] has also given to the reason of man, as to his life, its
   boundaries, which it cannot pass. [28] And if, in the investigation of
   those boundaries, we have turned for a little while, to speak the
   language of human philosophy, the result will but be to show that
   philosophy, rightly understood, teaches one lesson with the sacred
   volume of Revelation. With that lesson let us conclude, as it is given
   in the words of our own judicious divine and philosopher. "Dangerous it
   were for the feeble brain of man to wade far into the doings of the
   Most High; whom although to know be life, and joy to make mention of
   His name; yet our soundest knowledge is to know that -we know Him not
   as indeed He is, neither can know Hiln: and our safest eloquence
   concerning Him is our silence, when we confess without confession that
   His glory is inexplicable, His greatness above our capacity and reach.
   He is above, and we upon earth; therefore it behoveth our words to be
   wary and few."^([115]33)

LECTURE IV.

   O THOU THAT HEAREST PRAYER, UNTO THEE SHALL ALL FLESH COME.--PSALM LXV.
   2.

   THAT the Finite cannot comprehend the Infinite, is a truth more
   frequently admitted in theory than applied in practice. It has been
   expressly asserted by men who, almost in the same breath, have
   proceeded to lay down canons of criticism, concerning the purpose of
   Revelation, and the truth or falsehood, importance or insignificance,
   of particular doctrines, on grounds which are tenable only on the
   supposition of a perfect and intimate knowledge of God's Nature and
   Counsels.^([116]1) Hence it becomes necessary to bring down the above
   truth from general to special statements;--to inquire more particularly
   wherein the limitation of man's faculties consists, and in what manner
   it exhibits itself in the products of thought. This task I endeavored
   to accomplish in my last Lecture. To pursue the conclusion thus
   obtained to its legitimate consequences in relation to Theology, we
   must next inquire how the human mind, thus limited, is able to form the
   idea of a relation between man and God, and what is the nature of the
   conception of God which arises from the consciousness of this relation.
   The purpose of our inquiry is to ascertain the limits of religious
   thought; and, for this purpose, it is necessary to proceed from the
   limits of thought and of human consciousness in general, to those
   particular forms of consciousness which, in thought, or in some other
   mode, especially constitute the essence of Religion.

   Reasonings, probable or demonstrative, in proof of the being and
   attributes of God, have met with a very different reception at
   different periods. Elevated at one time, by the injudicious zeal of
   their advocates, to a certainty and importance to which they have no
   legitimate claim, at another, by an equally extravagant reäction, they
   have been sacrificed in the mass to some sweeping principle of
   criticism, or destroyed piecemeal by minute objections in detail. While
   one school of theologians has endeavored to raise the whole edifice of
   the Christian Faith on a basis of metaphysical proof,^([117]2) others
   have either expressly maintained that the understanding has nothing to
   do with religious belief, or have indirectly attempted to establish the
   same conclusion by special refutations of the particular
   reasonings.^([118]3)

   An examination of the actual state of the human mind, as regards
   religious ideas, will lead us to a conclusion intermediate between
   these two extremes. On the one hand, it must be allowed that it is not
   through reasoning that men obtain the first intimation of their
   relation to the Deity; and that, had they been left to the guidance of
   their intellectual faculties alone, it is possible that no such
   intimation might have taken place; or at best, that it would have been
   but as one guess, out of many equally plausible and equally natural.
   Those who lay exclusive stress on the proof of the existence of God
   from the marks of design in the world, or from the necessity of
   supposing a first cause of all phenomena, overlook the fact that man
   learns to pray before he learns to reason,--that he feels within him
   the consciousness of a Supreme Being, and the instinct of worship,
   before he can argue from effects to causes, or estimate the traces of
   wisdom and benevolence scattered through the creation. But, on the
   other hand, arguments which would be insufficient to create the notion
   of a Supreme Being in a mind previously destitute of it, may have great
   force and value in enlarging or correcting a notion already existing,
   and in justifying to the reason the unreasoning convictions of the
   heart. The belief in a God, once given, becomes the nucleus round which
   subsequent experiences cluster and accumulate; and evidences which
   would be obscure or ambiguous, if addressed to the reason only, become
   clear and convincing, when interpreted by the light of the religious
   consciousness.

   We may therefore, without hesitation, accede to the argument of the
   great critic of metaphysics, when he tells us that the speculative
   reason is unable to prove the existence of a Supreme Being, but can
   only correct our conception of such a Being, supposing it to be already
   obtained.^([119]4) But, at the same time, it is necessary to protest
   against the pernicious extent to which the reaction against the use of
   the reason in theology has in too many instances been carried. When the
   same critic tells us that we cannot legitimately infer, from the order
   and design visible in the world, the omnipotence and omniscience of its
   Creator, because a degree of power and wisdom short of the very highest
   might possibly be sufficient to produce all the effects which we are
   able to discern;^([120]5) or when a later writer, following in the same
   track, condemns the argument from final causes, because it represents
   God exclusively in the aspect of an artist;^([121]6) or when a third
   writer, of a different school, tells us that the processes of thought
   have nothing to do with the soul, the organ of religion;^([122]7)--we
   feel that systems which condemn the use of reasoning in sacred things
   may be equally one-sided and extravagant with those which assert its
   Supreme authority. Reasoning must not be condemned for failing to
   accomplish what no possible mode of human consciousness ever does or
   can accomplish. If consciousness itself is a limitation; if every mode
   of consciousness is a determination of the mind in one particular
   manner out of many possible;--it follows indeed that the infinite is
   beyond the reach of man's arguments; but only as it is also beyond the
   reach of his feelings or his volitions. We cannot indeed reason to the
   existence of an infinite Cause from the presence of finite effects, nor
   contemplate the infinite in a finite mode of knowledge; but neither can
   we feel the infinite in the form of a finite affection, nor discern it
   as the law of a finite action. If our whole consciousness of God is
   partial and incomplete, composed of various attributes manifested in
   various relations, why should we condemn the reasoning which represents
   Him in a single aspect, so long as it neither asserts nor implies that
   that aspect is the only one in which He can be represented? If man is
   not a creature composed solely of intellect, or solely of will, why
   should any one element of his nature be excluded from participating in
   the pervading consciousness of Him in whom we live, and move, and have
   our being? [29] A religion based solely on the reason may starve on
   barren abstractions, or bewilder itself with inexplicable
   contradictions; but a religion which repudiates thought to take refuge
   in feeling, abandons itself to the wild follies of fanaticism, or the
   diseased ecstasies of mysticism; while one which acknowledges the
   practical energies alone, may indeed attain to Stoicism, but will fall
   far short of Christianity. It is our duty indeed to pray with the
   spirit; but it is no less our duty to pray with the understanding also.
   [30]

   Taking, then, as the basis of our inquiry, the admission that the whole
   consciousness of man, whether in thought, or in feeling, or in
   volition, is limited in the manner of its operation and in the objects
   to which it is related, let us endeavor, with regard to the religious
   consciousness in particular, to separate from each other the
   complicated threads which, in their united web, constitute the
   conviction of man's relation to a Supreme Being. In distinguishing,
   however, one portion of these as forming the origin of this conviction,
   and another portion as contributing rather to its further development
   and direction, I must not be understood to maintain or imply that the
   former could have existed and been recognized, prior to and
   independently of the cooperation of the latter. Consciousness, in its
   earliest discernible form, is only possible as the result of an union
   of the reflective with the intuitive faculties. A state of mind, to be
   known at all as existing, must be distinguished from other states; and,
   to make this distinction, we must think of it, as well as experience
   it. Without thought as well as sensation, there could be no
   consciousness of the existence of an external world: without thought as
   well as emotion and volition, there could be no consciousness of the
   moral nature of man. Sensation without thought would at most amount to
   no more than an indefinite sense of uneasiness or momentary irritation,
   without any power of discerning in what manner we are affected, or of
   distinguishing our successive affections from each other. To
   distinguish, for example, in the visible world, any one object from any
   other, to know the house as a house, or the tree as a tree, we must be
   able to refer them to distinct notions; and such reference is an act of
   thought. The same condition holds good of the religious consciousness
   also. In whatever mental affection we become conscious of our relation
   to a Supreme Being, we can discern that consciousness, as such, only by
   reflecting upon it as conceived under its propel notion. Without this,
   we could not know our religious consciousness to be what it is; and, as
   the knowledge of a fact of consciousness is identical with its
   existence,--without this, the religious consciousness, as such, could
   not exist.

   But, notwithstanding this necessary coöperation of thought in every
   manifestation of human consciousness, it is not to the reflective
   faculties that we must look, if we would discover the origin of
   religion. For, to the exercise of reflection, it is necessary that
   there should exist an object on which to reflect; and though, in the
   order of time, the distinct recognition of this object is simultaneous
   with the act of reflecting upon it, yet, in the order of nature, the
   latter presupposes the former. Religious thought, if it is to exist at
   all, can only exist as representative of some fact of religious
   intuition,--of some individual state of mind, in which is presented, as
   an immediate fact, that relation of man to God, of which man, by
   reflection, may become distinctly and definitely conscious.

   Two such states may be specified, as dividing between them the rude
   material out of which Reflection builds up the edifice of Religious
   Consciousness. These are the Feeling of Dependence and the Conviction
   of Moral Obligation. To these two facts of the inner consciousness may
   be traced, as to their sources, the two great outward acts by which
   religion in various forms has been manifested among men;--Prayer, by
   which they seek to win God's blessing upon the future, and Expiation,
   by which they strive to atone for the offences of the past.^([123]8)
   The feeling of Dependence is the instinct which urges us to pray. It is
   the feeling that our existence and welfare are in the hands of a
   superior Power;--not of an inexorable Fate or immutable Law; but of a
   Being having at least so far the attributes of Personality, that He can
   show favor or severity to those dependent upon Him, and can be regarded
   by them with the feelings of hope, and fear, and reverence, and
   gratitude. It is a feeling similar in kind, though higher in degree, to
   that which is awakened in the mind of the child towards his parent, who
   is first manifested to his mind as the (giver of such things as are
   needful, and to whom the first language he addresses is that of
   entreaty. It is the feeling so fully and intensely expressed in the
   language of the Psalmist: "Thou art he that took me out of my mother's
   womb: thou wast my hope, when I hanged yet upon my mother's breasts. I
   have been left unto thee ever since I was born: thou art my God even
   from my mother's womb. Be not thou far from me, O Lord: thou art my
   succour; haste thee to help me. I will declare thy Name unto my
   brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee." [31]
   With the first development of consciousness, there grows up, as a part
   of it, the innate feeling that our life, natural and spiritual, is not
   in our power to sustain or to prolong;--that there is One above us, on
   whom we are dependent, whose existence we learn, and whose presence we
   realize, by the sure instinct of Prayer. We have thus, in the Sense of
   Dependence, the foundation of one great element of Religion,--the Fear
   of God.

   But the mere consciousness of dependence does not of itself exhibit the
   character of the Being on whom we depend. It is as consistent with
   superstition as with religion;--with the belief in a malevolent, as in
   a benevolent Deity: it is as much called into existence by the
   severities, as by the mercies of God; by the suffering which we are
   unable to avert, as by the benefits which we did not ourselves
   procure.^([124]9) The Being on whom we depend is, in that single
   relation, manifested in the infliction of pain, as well as in the
   bestowal of happiness. But in order to make suffering, as well as
   enjoyment, contribute to the religious education of man, it is
   necessary that he should be conscious, not merely of suffering, but of
   sin;--that he should look upon pain not merely as inflicted, but as
   deserved; and should recognize in its Author the justice that punishes,
   not merely the anger that harms. In the feeling of dependence, we are
   conscious of the Power of God, but not necessarily of His Goodness.
   This deficiency, however, is supplied by the the other element of
   religion,--the Consciousness of Moral Obligation,--carrying with it, as
   it necessarily does, the Conviction of Sin. It is impossible to
   establish, as a great modern philosopher has attempted to do, the
   theory of an absolute Autonomy of the Will; that is to say, of an
   obligatory law, resting on no basis but that of its own imperative
   character.^([125]10) Considered solely in itself, with no relation to
   any higher authority, the consciousness of a law of obligation is a
   fact of our mental constitution, and it is no more. The fiction of an
   absolute law, binding on all rational beings, has only an apparent
   universality; because we can only conceive other rational beings by
   identifying their constitution with our own, and making, human reason
   the measure and representative of reason in general. Why then has one
   part of our constitution, merely as such, an imperative authority over
   the remainder? What right has one portion of the human consciousness to
   represent itself as duty, and another merely as inclination? There is
   but one answer possible. The moral Reason, or Will, or Conscience, of
   Man, call it by what name we please, can have no authority, save as
   implanted in him by some higher Spiritual Being, as a Law emanating
   from a Lawgiver. Man can be a law unto himself, only on the supposition
   that he reflects in himself the Law of God;--that he shows, as the
   Apostle tells us, the works of that law written in his heart. [32] If
   he is absolutely a law unto himself; his duty and his pleasure are
   undistinguishable from each other; for he is subject to no one, and
   accountable to no one. Duty, in this case, becomes only a higher kind
   of pleasure,--a balance between the present and the future, between the
   larger and the smaller gratification. We are thus compelled, by the
   consciousness of moral obligation, to assume the existence of a moral
   Deity, and to regard the absolute standard of right and wrong as
   constituted by the nature of that Deity.^([126]11) The conception of
   this standard, in the human mind, may indeed be faint and fluctuating,
   and must be imperfect: it may vary with the intellectual and moral
   culture of the nation or the individual: and in its highest human
   representation, it must fall far short of the reality. But it is
   present to all mankind, as a basis of moral obligation and an
   inducement to moral progress: it is present in the universal
   consciousness of sin; in the conviction that we are offenders against
   God; in the expiatory rites by which, whether inspired by some natural
   instinct, or inherited from some primeval tradition, divers nations
   have, in their various modes, striven to atone for their
   transgressions, and to satisfy the wrath of their righteous
   Judge.^([127]12) However erroneously the particular acts of religious
   service may have been understood by men: yet, in the universal
   consciousness of innocence and guilt, of duty and disobedience, of an
   appeased and offended God, there is exhibited the instinctive
   confession of all mankind, that the moral nature of man, as subject to
   a law of obligation, reflects and represents, in some degree, the moral
   nature of a Deity by whom that obligation is imposed.

   But these two elements of the religious consciousness, however real and
   efficient within their own limits, are subject to the same restrictions
   which we have before noticed as binding upon consciousness in general.
   Neither in the feeling of dependence, nor in that of obligation, can we
   be directly conscious of the Absolute or the Infinite, as such. And it
   is the more necessary to notice this limitation, inasmuch as an
   opposite theory has been maintained by one whose writings have had
   perhaps more influence than those of any other man, in forming the
   modern religious philosophy of his own country; and whose views, in all
   their essential features, have been ably maintained and widely diffused
   among ourselves. According to Schleiermacher, the essence of Religion
   is to be found in a feeling of absolute and entire dependence, in which
   the mutual action and reaction of subject and object upon each other,
   which constitutes the ordinary consciousness of mankind, gives way to a
   sense of utter, passive helplessness,--to a consciousness that our
   entire personal agency is annihilated in the presence of the infinite
   energy of the Godhead. In our intercourse with the world, he tells us,
   whether in relation to nature or to human society, the feeling of
   freedom and that of dependence are always present in mutual operation
   upon each other; sometimes in equilibrium; sometimes with a vast
   preponderance of the one or the other feeling; but never to the entire
   exclusion of either. But in our communion with God, there is always an
   accompanying consciousness that the whole activity is absolutely and
   entirely dependent upon Him; that, whatever amount of freedom may be
   apparent in the individual moments of life, these are but detached and
   isolated portions of a passively dependent whole.^([128]13) The theory
   is carried still further, and expressed in more positive terms, by an
   English disciple, who says that, "Although man, while in the midst of
   finite objects, always feels himself to a certain extent independent
   and free; yet in the presence of that which is self-existent, infinite,
   and eternal, he may feel the sense of freedom utterly pass away, and
   become absorbed in the sense of absolute dependence." "Let the
   relation," he continues, "of subject and object in the economy of our
   emotions become such that the whole independent energy of the former
   merges in the latter as its prime cause and present sustainer; let the
   subject become as nothing,--not, indeed, from its intrinsic
   insignificance or incapacity of moral action, but by virtue of the
   infinity of the object to which it stands consciously opposed: and the
   feeling of dependence must become absolute; for all finite power is as
   nothing in relation to the Infinite."^([129]14)

   Of this theory it may be observed, in the first place, that it
   contemplates God chiefly in the character of an object of infinite
   magnitude. The relations of the object to the subject, in our
   consciousness of the world, and in that of God, differ from each other
   in degree rather than in kind. The Deity is manifested with no
   attribute of personality: He is merely the world magnified to infinity:
   and the feeling of absolute dependence is in fact that of the
   annihilation of our personal existence in the Infinite Being of the
   Universe. Of this feeling, the intellectual exponent is pure Pantheism;
   and the infinite object is but the indefinite abstraction of Being in
   general, with no distinguishing characteristic to constitute a Deity.
   For the distinctness of an object of consciousness is in the inverse
   ratio to the intensity of the passive affection. As the feeling of
   dependence becomes more powerful, the knowledge of the character of the
   object on which we depend must necessarily become less and less; for
   the discernment of any object as such is a state of mental energy and
   reaction of thought upon that object. Hence the feeling of absolute
   dependence, supposing it possible, could convey no consciousness of God
   as God, but merely an indefinite impression of dependence upon
   something. Towards an object so vague and meaningless, no real
   religious relation is possible.^([130]15)

   In the second place, the consciousness of an absolute dependence in
   which our activity is annihilated, is a contradiction in terms; for
   consciousness itself is an activity. We can be conscious of a state of
   mind as such, only by attending to it; and attention is in all cases a
   mode of our active energy. Thus the state of absolute dependence,
   supposing it to exist at all, could not be distinguished from other
   states; and, as all consciousness is distinction, it could not, by any
   mode of consciousness, be known to exist.

   In the third place, the theory is inconsistent with the duty of Prayer.
   Prayer is essentially a state in which man is in active relation
   towards God; in which he is intensely conscious of his personal
   existence and its wants; in which he endeavors by entreaty to prevail
   with God. Let any one consider for a moment the strong energy of the
   language of the Apostle: "Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord
   Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive
   together with me in your prayers to God for me;" [33] or the
   consciousness of a personal need, which pervades that Psalm in which
   David so emphatically declares his dependence upon God: "My God, my
   God, look upon me; why hast thou forsaken me, and art so far from my
   health, and from the words of my complaint? O my God, I cry in the
   day-time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season also I take no
   rest;" [34] --let him ponder the words of our Lord himself: "Shall not
   God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him:" [35] --and
   then let him say if such language is compatible with the theory which
   asserts that man's personality is annihilated in his communion with
   God.^([131]16)

   But, lastly, there is another fatal objection to the above theory. It
   makes our moral and religious consciousness subversive of each other,
   and reduces us to the dilemma that either our faith or our practice
   must be founded on a delusion. The actual relation of man to God is the
   same, in whatever degree man may be conscious of it. If man's
   dependence on God is not really destructive of his personal freedom,
   the religious consciousness, in denying that freedom, is a false
   consciousness. If, on the contrary, man is in reality passively
   dependent upon God, the consciousness of moral responsibility, which
   bears witness to his free agency, is a lying witness. Actually, in the
   sight of God, we are either totally dependent, or, partially at least,
   free. And as this condition must be always the same, whether we are
   conscious of it or not, it follows, that, in proportion as one of these
   modes of consciousness reveals to us the truth, the other must be
   regarded as testifying to a falsehood.^([132]17)

   Nor yet is it possible to find in the consciousness of moral obligation
   any immediate apprehension of the Absolute and Infinite. For the free
   agency of man, which in the feeling of dependence is always present as
   a subordinate element, becomes here the centre and turning-point of the
   whole. The consciousness of the Infinite is necessarily excluded;
   first, by the mere existence of a relation between two distinct agents;
   and, secondly, by the conditions under which each must necessarily be
   conceived in its relation to the other. The moral consciousness of man,
   as subject to law, is, by that subjection, both limited and related;
   and hence it cannot in itself be regarded as a representation of the
   Infinite. Nor yet can such a representation be furnished by the other
   term of the relation,--that of the Moral Lawgiver, by whom human
   obligation is enacted. For, in the first place, such a Lawgiver must be
   conceived as a Person; and the only human conception of Personality is
   that of limitation. In the second place, the moral consciousness of
   such a Lawgiver can only be conceived under the form of a variety of
   attributes; and different attributes are, by that very diversity,
   conceived as finite. Nay, the very conception of a moral nature is in
   itself the conception of a limit; for morality is the compliance with a
   law; and a law, whether imposed from within or from without, can only
   be conceived to operate by limiting the range of possible actions.

   Yet along with all this, though our positive religious consciousness is
   of the finite only, there yet runs through the whole of that
   consciousness the accompanying conviction that the Infinite does exist,
   and must exist;--though of the manner of that existence we can form no
   conception; and that it exists along with the Finite;--though we know
   not how such a coëxistence is possible. We cannot be conscious of the
   Infinite; but we can be and are conscious of the limits of our own
   powers of thought; and therefore we know that the possibility or
   impossibility of conception is no test of the possibility or
   impossibility of existence. We know that, unless we admit the existence
   of the Infinite, the existence of the Finite is inexplicable and
   self-contradictory; and yet we know that the conception of the Infinite
   itself appears to involve contradictions no less inexplicable. In this
   impotence of Reason, we are compelled to take refuge in Faith, and to
   believe that an Infinite Being exists, though we know not how; and that
   He is the same with that Being who is made known in consciousness as
   our Sustainer and our Lawgiver. For to deny that an Infinite Being
   exists, because we cannot comprehend the manner of His existence, is,
   of two equally inconceivable alternatives, to accept the one which
   renders that very inconceivability itself inexplicable. If the Finite
   is the universe of existence, there is no reason why that universe
   itself should not be as conceivable as the several parts of which it is
   composed. Whence comes it then that our whole consciousness is
   compassed about with restrictions, which we are ever striving to pass,
   and ever failing in the effort? Whence comes it that the Finite cannot
   measure the Finite? The very consciousness of our own limitations of
   thought bears witness to the existence of the Unlimited, who is beyond
   thought. The shadow of the Infinite still broods over the consciousness
   of the finite; and we wake up at last from the dream of absolute
   wisdom, to confess, "Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it
   not." [36]

   We are thus compelled to acquiesce in at least one portion of Bacon's
   statement concerning the relation of human knowledge to its object:
   "Natura percutit intellectum radio directo; Deus autem, propter medium
   inæquale (creaturas scilicet), radio refracto."^([133]18) To have
   sufficient grounds for believing in God is a very different thing from
   having sufficient grounds for reasoning about Him. The religious
   sentiment, which compels men to believe in and worship a Supreme Being,
   is an evidence of His existence, but not an exhibition of His nature.
   It proves that God is, and makes known some of His relations to us; but
   it does not prove what God is in His own Absolute Being.^([134]19) The
   natural senses, it may be, are diverted and colored by the medium
   through which they pass to reach the intellect, and present to us, not
   things in themselves, but things as they appear to us. And this is
   manifestly the case with the religious consciousness, which can only
   represent the Infinite God under finite forms. But we are compelled to
   believe, on the evidence of our senses, that a material world exists,
   even while we listen to the arguments of the idealist, who reduces it
   to an idea or a nonentity; and we are compelled, by our religious
   consciousness, to believe in the existence of a personal God; though
   the reasonings of the Rationalist, logically followed out, may reduce
   us to Pantheism or Atheism. But to preserve this belief uninjured, we
   must acknowledge the true limits of our being: we must not claim for
   any fact of human consciousness the proud prerogative of revealing God
   as He is; for thus we throw away the only weapon which can be of avail
   in resisting the assaults of Skepticism. We must be content to admit,
   with regard to the internal consciousness of man, the same restrictions
   which the great philosopher just now quoted has so excellently
   expressed with reference to the external senses. "For as all works do
   show forth the power and skill of the workman, and not his image; so it
   is of the works of God, which do show the omnipotency and wisdom of the
   maker, but not his image. . . . . . . Wherefore by the contemplation of
   nature to induce and inforce the acknowledgment of God, and to
   demonstrate his power, is an excellent argument; . . . . . but on the
   other side, out of the contemplation of nature, or ground of human
   knowledge, to induce any verity or persuasion concerning the points of
   faith, is in my judgment not safe . . . . . . . For the heathens
   themselves conclude as much in that excellent and divine fable of the
   golden chain: That men and gods were not able to draw Jupiter down to
   the earth; but contrariwise, Jupiter was able to draw them up to
   heaven."^([135]20)

   One feature deserves especial notice, as common to both of those modes
   of consciousness which primarily exhibit our relation towards God. In
   both, we are compelled to regard ourselves as Persons related to a
   Person. In the feeling of dependence, however great it may be, the
   consciousness of myself, the dependent element, remains unextinguished;
   and, indeed, without that element there could be no consciousness of a
   relation at all. In the sense of moral obligation, I know myself as the
   agent on whom the law is binding: I am free to choose and to act, as a
   person whose principle of action is in himself. And it is important to
   observe that it is only through this consciousness of personality that
   we have any ground of belief in the existence of a God. If we admit the
   arguments by which this personality is annihilated, whether on the side
   of Materialism or on that of Pantheism, we cannot escape from the
   consequence to which those arguments inevitably lead,--the annihilation
   of God himself. If, on the one hand, the spiritual element within me is
   merely dependent on the corporeal,--if myself is a result of my bodily
   organization, and may be resolved into the operation of a system of
   material agents,--why should I suppose it to be otherwise in the great
   world beyond me? If I, who deem myself a spirit distinct from and
   superior to matter, am but the accident and product of that which I
   seem to rule, why may not all other spiritual existence, if such there
   be, be dependent upon the constitution of the material
   universe?^([136]21) Or if, on the other hand, I am not a distinct
   substance, but a mode of the infinite,--a shadow passing over the face
   of the universe,--what is that universe which you would have me
   acknowledge a God? It is, says the Pantheist, the One and
   All.^([137]22) By no means: it is the Many, in which is neither All nor
   One. You have taught me that within the little world of my own
   consciousness there is no relation between the one and the many; but
   that all is transient and accidental alike. If I accept your
   conclusion, I must extend it to its legitimate consequence. Why should
   the universe itself contain a principle of unity? why should the Many
   imply the One? All that I see, all that I know, are isolated and
   unconnected phenomena; I myself being one of them. Why should the
   Universe of Being be otherwise? It cannot be All; for its phenomena are
   infinite and innumerable; and all implies unity and completeness. It
   need not be One; for you have yourself shown me that I am deceived in
   the only ground which I have for believing that a plurality of modes
   implies an unity of substance. If there is no Person to pray; if there
   is no Person to be obedient;--what remains but to conclude that He to
   whom prayer and obedience are due,--nay, even the mock-king who usurps
   His name in the realms of philosophy,--is a shadow and a delusion
   likewise?

   The result of the preceding considerations may be summed up as follows.
   There are two modes in which we may endeavor to contemplate the Deity:
   the one negative, based on a vain attempt to transcend the conditions
   of human thought, and to expand the religious consciousness to the
   infinity of its Divine Object; the other positive, which keeps within
   its proper limits, and views the object in a manner accommodated to the
   finite capacities of the human thinker. The first aspires to behold God
   in His absolute nature: the second is content to view Him in those
   relations in which he has been pleased to manifest Himself to his
   creatures. The first aims at a speculative knowledge of God as He is;
   but, bound by the conditions of finite thought, even in the attempt to
   transgress them, obtains nothing more than a tissue of ambitious
   self-contradictions, which indicate only what He is not.^([138]23) The
   second, abandoning the speculative knowledge of the infinite, as only
   possible to the Infinite Intelligence itself, is content with those
   regulative ideas of the Deity, which are sufficient to guide our
   practice, but not to satisfy our intellect;^([139]24)--which tell us,
   not what God is in Himself, but how He wills that we should think of
   Him.^([140]25) In renouncing all knowledge of the Absolute, it
   renounces at the same time all attempts to construct a priori schemes
   of God's Providence as it ought to be: it does not seek to reconcile
   this or that phenomenon, whether in nature or in revelation, with the
   absolute attributes of Deity; but confines itself to the actual course
   of that Providence as manifested in the world; and seeks no higher
   internal criterion of the truth of a religion, than may be derived from
   its analogy to other parts of the Divine Government. Guided by this,
   the only true Philosophy of Religion, man is content to practise where
   he is unable to speculate. He acts, as one who must give an account of
   his conduct: he prays, believing that his prayer will be answered. He
   does not seek to reconcile this belief with any theory of the Infinite;
   for he does not even know how the Infinite and the Finite can exist
   together. But he feels that his several duties rest upon the same
   basis: he knows that, if human action is not incompatible with Infinite
   Power; neither is human worship with Infinite Wisdom and Goodness:
   though it is not as the Infinite that God reveals Himself in His moral
   government; nor is it as the Infinite that he promises to answer
   prayer.

   "O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee shall all flesh come."
   Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and offering for sin,
   Thou requirest no more; for He whom these prefigured has offered
   Himself as a sacrifice once for all. [37] But He who fulfilled the
   sacrifice, commanded the prayer, and Himself taught us how to pray. He
   tells us that we are dependent upon God for our daily bread, for
   forgiveness of sins, for deliverance from evil;--and how is that
   dependence manifested? Not in the annihilation of our personality; for
   we appeal to Him under the tenderest of personal relations, as the
   children of Our Father who is in heaven. Not as passive in
   contemplation, but as active in service; for we pray, "Thy will be
   done, as in heaven, so in earth." In this manifestation of God to man,
   alike in Consciousness as in Scripture, under finite forms to finite
   minds, as a Person to a Person, we see the root and foundation of that
   religious service, without which belief is a speculation, and worship a
   delusion; which, whatever would be philosophical theologians may say to
   the contrary, is the common bond which unites all men to God. All are
   God's creatures, bound alike to reverence and obey their Maker. Ail are
   God's dependents, bound alike to ask for his sustaining, bounties. All
   are God's rebels, needing daily and hourly to implore His forgiveness
   for their disobedience. All are God's redeemed, purchased by the blood
   of Christ, invited to share in the benefits of His passion and
   intercession. All are brought by one common channel into communion with
   that God to whom they are related by so many common ties. All are
   called upon to acknowledge their Maker, their Governor, their
   Sustainer, their Redeemer; and the means of their acknowledgment is
   Prayer.

   And, apart from the fact of its having been God's good pleasure so to
   reveal Himself, there are manifest, even to human understanding, wise
   reasons why this course should have been adopted, benevolent ends to be
   answered by this gracious condescension. We are not called upon to live
   two distinct lives in this world. It is not required of us that the
   household of our nature should be divided against itself;--that those
   feelings of love, and reverence, and gratitude, which move us in a
   lower degree towards our human relatives and friends, should be
   altogether thrown aside, and exchanged for some abnormal state of
   ecstatic contemplation, when we bring our prayers and praises and
   thanks before the footstool of our Father in heaven. We are none of us
   able to grasp in speculation the nature of the Infinite and Eternal;
   but we all live and move among our fellow-men, at times needing their
   assistance, at times soliciting their favors, at times seeking to turn
   away their anger. We have all, as children, felt the need of the
   supporting care of parents and guardians: we have all, in the gradual
   progress of education, required instruction from the wisdom of
   teachers: we have all offended against our neighbors, and known the
   blessings of forgiveness, or the penalty of unappeased anger. We can
   all, therefore, taught by the inmost consciousness of our human
   feelings, place ourselves in communion with God, when He manifests
   Himself under human images. "He that loveth not his brother whom he
   hath seen," says the Apostle St. John, "how can he love God whom he
   hath not seen?" [38] Our heavenly affections must in some measure take
   their source and their form from our earthly ones: our love towards
   God, if it is to be love at all, must not be wholly unlike our love
   towards our neighbor: the motives and influences which prompt us, when
   we make known our wants and pour forth our supplications to an earthly
   parent, are graciously permitted by our heavenly Father to be the type
   and symbol of those by which our intercourse with Him is to be
   regulated,--with which He bids us "come boldly unto the throne of
   grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of
   need." [39]

   So should it be during this transitory life, in which we see through a
   glass, darkly; [40] in which God reveals Himself in types and shadows,
   under human images and attributes, to meet graciously and deal tenderly
   with the human sympathies of His creatures. And although, even to the
   sons of God, it doth not yet appear what we shall be, when we shall be
   like him, and shall see Him as He is; [41] yet, if it be true that our
   religious duties in this life are a training and preparation for that
   which is to come;--if we are encouraged to look forward to and
   anticipate that future state, while we are still encompassed with this
   earthly tabernacle; if we are taught to look, as to our great Example,
   to One who in love and sympathy towards His brethren was Very Man;--if
   we are bidden not to sorrow without hope concerning them which are
   asleep, [42] and are comforted by the promise that the ties of love
   which are broken on earth shall be united in heaven,--we may trust that
   not wholly alien to such feelings will be our communion with God face
   to face, when the redeemed of all flesh shall approach once more to Him
   that heareth prayer;--no longer in the chamber of private devotion; no
   longer in the temple of public worship; but in that great City where no
   temple is; "for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of
   it." [43]

LECTURE V.

   FOR AFTER THAT IN THE WISDOM OF GOD THE WORLD BY WISDOM KNEW NOT GOD,
   IT PLEASED GOD BY THE FOOLISHNESS OF PREACHING TO SAVE THEM THAT
   BELIEVE. FOR THE JEWS REQUIRE A SIGN, AND THE GREEKS SEEK AFTER WISDOM:
   BUT WE PREACH CHRIST CRUCIFIED, UNTO THE JEWS A STUMBLINGBLOCK, AND
   UNTO THE GREEKS FOOLISHNESS; BUT UNTO THEM WHICH ARE CALLED, BOTH JEWS
   AND GREEKS, CHRIST TI1E POWER OF GOD, AND THE WISDOM OF GOD.--1
   CORINTHIANS 1. 21-24.

   "THOUGH it were admitted," says Bishop Butler, "that this opinion of
   Necessity were speculatively true; yet, with regard to practice, it is
   as if it were false, so far as our experience reaches; that is, to the
   whole of our present life. For the constitution of the present world,
   and the condition in which we are actually placed, is as if we were
   free. And it may perhaps justly be concluded that, since the whole
   process of action, through every step of it, suspense, deliberation,
   inclining one way, determining, and at last doing as we determine, is
   as if we were free, therefore we are so. But the thing here insisted
   upon is, that under the present natural government of the world, we
   find we are treated and dealt with as if we were free, prior to all
   consideration whether we are or not."^([141]1)

   That this observation has in any degree settled the speculative
   difficulties involved in the problem of Liberty and Necessity, will not
   be maintained by any one who is acquainted with the history of the
   controversy. Nor was it intended by its author to do so. But, like many
   other pregnant sentences of that great thinker, it introduces a
   principle capable of a much wider application than to the inquiry which
   originally suggested it. The vexed question of Liberty and necessity,
   whose counter-arguments have become a by-word for endless and
   unprofitable wrangling, is but one of a large class of problems, some
   of which meet us at every turn of our daily life and conduct, whenever
   we attempt to justify in theory that which we are compelled to carry
   out in practice. Such problems arise inevitably, whenever we attempt to
   pass from the sensible to the intelligible world, from the sphere of
   action to that of thought, from that which appears to us to that which
   is in itself: In religion, in morals, in our daily business, in the
   care of our lives, in the exercise of our senses, the rules which guide
   our practice cannot be reduced to principles which satisfy our
   reason.^([142]2)

   The very first Law of Thought, and, through Thought, of all
   Consciousness, by which alone we are able to discern objects as such,
   or to distinguish them one from another, involves in its constitution a
   mystery and a doubt, which no effort of Philosophy has been able to
   penetrate:--How can the One be many, or the Many one?^([143]3) We are
   compelled to regard ourselves and our fellow-men as persons, and the
   visible world around us as made up of things: but what is personality,
   and what is reality, are questions which the wisest have tried to
   answer, and have tried in vain. Man, as a Person, is one, yet composed
   of many elements;--not identical with any one of them, nor yet with the
   aggregate of them all; and yet not separable from them by any effort of
   abstraction. Man is one in his thoughts, in his actions, in his
   feelings, and in the responsibilities which these involve. It is I who
   think, I who act, I who feel; yet I am not thought, nor action, nor
   feeling, nor a combination of thoughts and actions and feelings heaped
   together. Extension, and resistance, and shape, and the various
   sensible qualities, make up my conception of each individual body as
   such; yet the body is not its extension, nor its shape, nor its
   hardness, nor its color, nor its smell, nor its taste; nor yet is it a
   mere aggregate of all these with no principle of unity among them. If
   these several parts constitute a single whole, the unity, as well as
   the plurality, must depend upon some principle which that whole
   contains: if they do not constitute a whole, the difficulty is removed
   but a single step; for the same question,--what constitutes
   individuality?--must be asked in relation to each separate part. The
   actual conception of every object, as such, involves the combination of
   the One and the Many; and that combination is practically made every
   time we think at all. But at the same time, no effort of reason is able
   to explain how such a relation is possible; or to satisfy the
   intellectual doubt which necessarily arises on the contemplation of it.

   As it is with the first law of Thought, so it is with the first
   principle of Action and of Feeling. All action, whether free or
   constrained, and all passion, implies and rests upon another great
   mystery of Philosophy,--the Commerce between Mind and Matter. The
   properties and operations of matter are known only by the external
   senses: the faculties and acts of the mind are known only by the
   internal apprehension. The energy of the one is motion: the energy of
   the other is consciousness. What is the middle term which unites these
   two? and how c8n their reciprocal action, unquestionable as it is in
   fact, be conceived as possible in theory?^([144]4) How can a contact
   between body and body produce consciousness in the immaterial soul? How
   can a mental self-determination produce the motion of material
   organs?^([145]5) How can mind, which is neither extended nor figured
   nor colored itself, represent by its ideas the extension and figure and
   color of bodies? How can the body be determined to a new position in
   space by an act of thought, to which space has no relation? How can
   thought itself be carried on by bodily instruments, and yet itself have
   nothing in common with bodily affections? What is the relation between
   the last pulsation of the material brain and the first awakening of the
   mental perception? How does the spoken word, a merely material
   vibration of the atmosphere, become echoed, as it were, in the silent
   voice of thought, and take its part in an operation wholly spiritual?
   Here again we acknowledge, in our daily practice, a fact which we are
   unable to represent in theory; and the various hypotheses to which
   Philosophy has had recourse,--the Divine Assistance, the Preëstablished
   Harmony, the Plastic Medium, and others,^([146]6) are but so many
   confessions of the existence of the mystery, and of the extraordinary,
   yet wholly insufficient efforts made by human reason to penetrate
   it.^([147]7)

   The very perception of our senses is subject to the same restrictions.
   "No priestly dogmas," says Hume, "ever shocked common sense more than
   the infinite divisibility of extension, with its
   consequences."^([148]8) He should have added, that the antagonist
   assumption of a finite divisibility is equally incomprehensible; it
   being as impossible to conceive an ultimate unit, or least possible
   extension, as it is to conceive the process of division carried on to
   infinity. Extension is presented to the mind as a relation between
   parts exterior to each other, whose reality cannot consist merely in
   their juxtaposition. We are thus compelled to believe that extension
   itself is dependent upon some higher law;--that it is not an original
   principle of things in themselves, but a derived result of their
   connection with each other. But to conceive how this generation of
   space is possible,--how unextended objects can by their conjunction
   produce extension,--baffles the utmost efforts of the wildest
   imagination or the profoundest reflection.^([149]9) We cannot conceive
   how unextended matter can become extended; for of unextended matter we
   know nothing, either in itself or in its relations; though we are
   apparently compelled to postulate its existence, as implied in the
   appearances of which alone we are conscious. The existence of mental
   succession in time is as inexplicable as that of a material extension
   in space;--a first moment and an infinite regress of moments being both
   equally inconceivable, no less than the corresponding theories of a
   first atom and an infinite division.

   The difficulty which meets us in these problems may help to throw some
   light on the purposes for which human thought is designed, and the
   limits within which it may be legitimately exercised. The primary fact
   of consciousness, which is accepted as regulating our practice, is in
   itself inexplicable, but not inconceivable. There is mystery; but there
   is not yet contradiction. Thought is baffled, and unable to pursue the
   track of investigation; but it does not grapple with an idea and
   destroy itself in the struggle. Contradiction does not begin till we
   direct our thoughts, not to the fact itself, but to that which it
   suggests as beyond itself. This difference is precisely that which
   exists between following the laws of thought, and striving to transcend
   them;--between leaving the mystery of Knowing and Being unsolved, and
   making unlawful attempts to solve it. The facts,--that all objects of
   thought are conceived as wholes composed of parts; that mind acts upon
   matter, and matter upon mind; that bodies are extended in space, and
   thoughts successive in time,--do not, in their own statement, severally
   contain elements repulsive of each other. As mere facts, they are so
   far front being inconceivable, that they embody the very laws of
   conception itself, and are experienced at every moment as true: but
   though we are able, nay, compelled to conceive them as facts, we find
   it impossible to conceive them as ultimate facts. They are made known
   to us as relations; and all relations are in themselves complex, and
   imply simpler principles;--objects to be related, and a ground by which
   the relation is constituted. The conception of any such relation as a
   fact thus involves a further inquiry concerning its existence as a
   consequence; and to this inquiry no satisfactory answer can be given.
   Thus the highest principles of thought and action, to which we can
   attain, are regulative, not speculative;--they do not serve to satisfy
   the reason, but to guide the conduct; they do not tell us what things
   are in themselves, but how we must conduct ourselves in relation to
   them.

   The conclusion which this condition of human consciousness almost
   irresistibly forces upon us, is one which equally exhibits the strength
   and the weakness of the human intellect. We are compelled to admit that
   the mind, in its contemplation of objects, is not the mere passive
   recipient of the things presented to it; but has an activity and a law
   of its own, by virtue of which it reäcts upon the materials existing
   without, and moulds them into that form in which consciousness is
   capable of apprehending them. The existence of modes of thought, which
   we are compelled to accept as at the same time relatively ultimate and
   absolutely derived,--as limits beyond which we cannot penetrate, yet
   which themselves proclaim that there is a further truth behind and
   above them,---suggests, as its obvious explanation, the hypothesis of a
   mind cramped by its own laws, and bewildered in the contemplation of
   its own forms. If the mind, in the act of consciousness, were merely
   blank and inert;--if the entire object of its contemplation came from
   without, and nothing from within; -no fact of consciousness would be
   inexplicable; for everything would present itself as it is. No reality
   would be suggested, beyond what is actually given: no question would be
   asked which is not already answered. For how can doubt arise, where
   there is no innate power in the mind to think beyond what is placed
   before it,--to reäct upon that which acts upon it? But upon the
   contrary supposition, all is regular, and the result such as might
   naturally be expected. If thought has laws of its own, it cannot by its
   own act go beyond them; yet the recognition of law, as a restraint,
   implies the existence of a sphere of liberty beyond. If the mind
   contributes its own element to the objects of consciousness, it must,
   in its first recognition of those objects, necessarily regard them as
   something complex, something generated partly from without and partly
   from within. Yet in that very recognition of the complex, as such, is
   implied an impossibility of attaining to the simple; for to resolve the
   composition is to destroy the very act of knowledge, and the relation
   by which consciousness is constituted. The object of which we are
   conscious is thus, to adopt the well-known language of the Kantian
   philosophy, a phenomenon, not a thing in itself;--a product, resulting
   from the twofold action of the thing apprehended, on the one side, and
   the faculties apprehending it, on the other. The perceiving subject
   alone, and the perceived object alone, are two unmeaning elements,
   which first acquire a significance in and by the act of their
   conjunction.^([150]10)

   It is thus strictly in analogy with the method of God's Providence in
   the constitution of man's mental faculties, if we believe that, in
   Religion also, He has given us truths which are designed to be
   regulative, rather than speculative; intended, not to satisfy our
   reason, but to guide our practice; not to tell us what God is in His
   absolute nature, but how He wills that we should think of Him in our
   present finite state.^([151]11) In my last Lecture, I endeavored to
   show that our knowledge of God is not a consciousness of the Infinite
   as such, but that of the relation of a Person to a Person;--the
   conception of personality being, humanly speaking, one of limitation.
   This amounts to the admission that, in natural religion at least, our
   knowledge of God does not satisfy the conditions of speculative
   philosophy, and is incapable of reduction to an ultimate and absolute
   truth. And this, as we now see, is in accordance with the analogy which
   the character of human philosophy in other provinces would naturally
   lead us to expect.^([152]12) It is reasonable also that we should
   expect to find, as part of the same analogy, that the revealed
   manifestation of the Divine nature and attributes should also carry on
   its face the marks of subordination to some higher truth, of which it
   indicates the existence, but does not make known the substance. It is
   to be expected that our apprehension of the revealed Deity should
   involve mysteries inscrutable and doubts insoluble by our present
   faculties: while, at the same time, it inculcates the true spirit in
   which such doubts should be dealt with; by warning us, as plainly as
   such a warning is possible, that we see a part only, and not the whole;
   that we behold effects only, and not causes; that our knowledge of God,
   though revealed by Himself, is revealed in relation to human faculties,
   and subject to the limitations and imperfections inseparable from the
   constitution of the human mind.^([153]l3) We may neglect this warning
   if we please: we may endeavor to supply the imperfection, and thereby
   make it more imperfect still: we may twist and torture the divine image
   on the rack of human philosophy, and call its mangled relics by the
   high-sounding titles of the Absolute and the Infinite; but these
   ambitious conceptions, the instant we attempt to employ them in any act
   of thought, manifest at once, by their inherent absurdities, that they
   are not that which they pretend to be;--that in the place of the
   Absolute and Infinite manifested in its own nature, we have merely the
   Relative and Finite contradicting itself.

   We may indeed believe, and ought to believe, that the knowledge which
   our Creator has permitted us to attain to, whether by Revelation or by
   our natural faculties, is not given to us as an instrument of
   deception. We may believe, and ought to believe, that, intellectually
   as well as morally, our present life is a state of discipline and
   preparation for another; and that the conceptions which we are
   compelled to adopt, as the guides of our thoughts and actions now, may
   indeed, in the sight of a higher intelligence, be but partial truth,
   but cannot be total falsehood. But in thus believing, we desert the
   evidence of Reason, to rest on that of Faith; and of the principles on
   which Reason itself depends, it is obviously impossible to have any
   other guarantee. But such a Faith, however well founded, has itself
   only a regulative and practical, not a speculative and theoretical
   application. It bids us rest content within the limits which have been
   assigned to us; but it cannot enable us to overleap those limits, nor
   exalt to a more absolute character the conclusions obtained by finite
   thinkers under the conditions of finite thought. But, on the other
   hand, we must beware of the opposite extreme,--that of mistaking the
   inability to affirm for the ability to deny. We cannot say that our
   conception of the Divine Nature exactly resembles that Nature in its
   absolute existence; for we know not what that absolute existence is.
   But, for the same reason, we are equally unable to say that it does lot
   resemble; for, if we know not the Absolute and Infinite at all, we
   cannot say how far it is or is not capable of likeness or unlikeness to
   the Relative and Finite. We must remain content with the belief that we
   have that knowledge of God which is best adapted to our wants and
   training. How far that knowledge represents God as He is, we know not,
   and we have no need to know.

   The testimony of Scripture, like that of our natural faculties, is
   plain and intelligible, when we ale content to accept it as a fact
   intended for our practical guidance: it becomes incomprehensible, only
   when we attempt to explain it as a theory capable of speculative
   analysis. We are distinctly told that there is a mutual relation
   between God and man, as distinct agents;--that God influences man by
   His grace, visits him with rewards or punishments, regards him with
   love or anger;--that man, within his own limited sphere, is likewise
   capable of "prevailing with God;" [44] that his prayers may obtain an
   answer, his conduct call down God's favor or condemnation. There is
   nothing self-contradictory or even unintelligible in this, if we are
   content to believe that it is so, without striving to understand how it
   is so. But the instant we attempt to analyze the ideas of God as
   infinite and man as finite;--to resolve the scriptural statements into
   the higher principles on which their possibility apparently
   depends;--we are surrounded on every side by contradictions of our own
   raising; and, unable to comprehend how the Infinite and the Finite can
   exist in mutual relation, we are tempted to deny the fact of that
   relation altogether, and to seek a refuge, though it be but insecure
   and momentary, in Pantheism, which denies the existence of the Finite,
   or in Atheism, which rejects the Infinite. And here, again, the
   parallel between Religion and Philosophy holds: the same limits of
   thought are discernible in relation to both. The mutual intercourse of
   mind and matter has been explained away by rival theories of Idealism
   on the one side and Materialism on the other. The unity and plurality,
   which are combined in every object of thought, have been assailed, on
   this side by the Eleatic, who maintains that all things are one, and
   variety a delusion;^([154]14) on that side by the Skeptic, who tells us
   that there is no unity, but merely a mixture of differences; that
   nothing is, but all things are ever becoming; that mind and body, as
   substances, are mere philosophical fictions, invented for the support
   of isolated impressions and ideas.^([155]15) The mystery of Necessity
   and Liberty has its philosophical as well as its theological aspect:
   and a parallel may be found to both, in the counter-labyrinth of
   Continuity in Space, whose mazes are sufficiently bewildering to show
   that the perception of our bodily senses, however certain as a fact,
   reposes, in its ultimate analysis, upon a mystery no less insoluble
   than that which envelops the free agency of man in its relation to the
   Divine Omniscience.^([156]16)

   Action, and not knowledge, is man's destiny and duty in this life; and
   his highest principles, both in philosophy and in religion, have
   reference to this end. But it does not follow, on that account, that
   our representations are untrue, because they are imperfect. To assert
   that a representation is untrue, because it is relative to the mind of
   the receiver, is to overlook the fact that truth itself is nothing more
   than a relation. Truth and falsehood are not properties of things in
   themselves, but of our conceptions, and are tested, not by the
   comparison of conceptions with things in themselves, but with things as
   they are given in some other relation. My conception of an object of
   sense is true, when it corresponds to the characteristics of the object
   as I perceive it; but the perception itself is equally a relation, and
   equally implies the coöperation of human faculties. Truth in relation
   to ho intelligence is a contradiction in terms: our highest conception
   of absolute truth is that of truth in relation to all intelligences.
   But of the consciousness of intelligences different from our own we
   have no knowledge, and can make no application. Truth, therefore, in
   relation to man, admits of no other test than the harmonious consent of
   all human faculties; and, as no such faculty can take cognizance of the
   Absolute, it follows that correspondence with the Absolute can never be
   required as a test of truth.^([157]17) The utmost deficiency that can
   be charged against human faculties amounts only to this:--that we
   cannot say that we know God as God knows himself; ^([158]18)--that the
   truth of which our finite minds are susceptible may, for aught we know,
   be but the passing shadow of some higher reality, which exists only in
   the Infinite Intelligence.

   That the true conception of the Divine Nature, so far as we are able to
   receive it, is to be found in those regulative representations which
   exhibit God under limitations accommodated to the constitution of man;
   not in the unmeaning abstractions which, aiming at a higher knowledge,
   distort, rather than exhibit, the Absolute and the Infinite; is thus a
   conclusion warranted, both deductively, from the recognition of the
   limits of human thought, and inductively, by what we can gather from
   experience and analogy concerning, God's general dealings with mankind.
   There remains yet a third indispensable probation, to which the same
   conclusion must be subjected; namely, how far does it agree with the
   teaching of Holy Scripture?

   In no respect is the Theology of the Bible, as contrasted with the
   mythologies of human invention, more remarkable, than in the manner in
   which it recognizes and adapts itself to that complex and self-limiting
   constitution of the human mind, which man's wisdom finds so difficult
   to acknowledge. To human reason, the personal and the infinite stand
   out in apparently irreconcilable antagonism; and the recognition of the
   one in a religious system almost inevitably involves the sacrifice of
   the other. The Personality of God disappears in the Pantheism of India;
   His Infinity is lost sight of in the Polytheism of Greece.^([159]19) In
   the Hebrew Scriptures, on the contrary, throughout all their variety of
   Books and Authors, one method of Divine teaching is constantly
   manifested, appealing alike to the intellect and to the feelings of
   man. From first to last we hear the echo of that first great
   Commandment: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: and thou
   shalt love thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and
   with all thy might." [45] God is plainly and uncompromisingly
   proclaimed as the One and the Absolute: "I am the first, and I am the
   last; and beside me there is no God:" [46] yet this sublime conception
   is never for an instant so exhibited as to furnish rood for that
   mystical contemplation to which the Oriental mind is naturally so
   prone. On the contrary, in all that relates to the feelings and duties
   by which religion is practically to be regulated, we cannot help
   observing how the Almighty, in communicating with His people,
   condescends to place Himself on what may, humanly speaking, be called a
   lower level than that on which the natural reason of man would be
   inclined to exhibit Him. While His Personality is never suffered to
   sink to a merely human representation; while it is clearly announced
   that His thoughts are not our thoughts, nor His ways our ways, [47] yet
   His Infinity is never for a moment so manifested as to destroy or
   weaken the vivid reality of those human attributes, under which He
   appeals to the human sympathies of His creature. "The Lord spake unto
   Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend." [48] He will
   listen to our supplications: [49] He will help those that cry unto Him:
   [50] He reserveth wrath for His enemies. [51] He is appeased by
   repentance: [52] "He showeth mercy to them that love Him. [53] As a
   King, He listens to the petitions of His subjects: [54] as a Father, He
   pitieth His own children. [55] It is impossible to contemplate this
   marvellous union of the human and divine, so perfectly adapted to the
   wants of the human servant of a divine Master, without feeling that it
   is indeed the work of Him who formed the spirit of man, and fitted him
   for the service of His Maker. "He showeth His word unto Jacob, His
   statutes and ordinances unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any
   nation; neither have the heathen knowledge of His laws." [56]

   But if this is the lesson taught us by that earlier manifestation in
   which God is represented under the likeness of human attributes, what
   may we learn from that later and fuller revelation which tells us of
   One who is Himself both God and Man? The Father has revealed Himself to
   mankind under human types and images, that He may appeal more earnestly
   and effectually to man's consciousness of the human spirit within him.
   The Son has done more than this: He became for our sakes very Man, made
   in all things like unto His brethren; [57] the Mediator between God and
   men, [58] being both God and Man.^([160]20) Herein is our
   justification, if we refuse to aspire beyond those limits of human
   thought in which He has placed us. Herein is our answer, if any man
   would spoil us through philosophy and vain deceit. [59] Is it
   irrational to contemplate God under symbols drawn from the human
   consciousness? Christ is our pattern: "for in Him dwelleth all the
   fulness of the Godhead bodily." [60] ^([161]21) Is it unphilosophical
   that our thoughts of God should be subject to the law of time? It was
   when the fulness of the time was come, that God sent forth his Son.
   [61] ^([162]22) Does the philosopher bid us strive to transcend the
   human, and to annihilate our own personality in the presence of the
   Infinite? The Apostle tells us to look forward to the time when we
   shall "all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the
   Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the
   fulness of Christ." [62] Does human wisdom seek, by some transcendental
   form of intuition, to behold God as He is in his infinite nature;
   repeating in its own manner the request of Philip, "Lord, show us the
   Father, and it sufficeth us?" Christ Himself has given the rebuke and
   the reply: "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest
   thou then, Show us the Father? " [63]

   The doctrine of a personal Christ, very God and very Man, has indeed
   been the great stumblingblock in the way of those so-called
   philosophical theologians who, in their contempt for the historical and
   temporal, would throw aside the vivid revelation of a living and acting
   God, to take refuge in the empty abstraction of an impersonal idea. And
   accordingly, they have made various elaborate attempts to substitute in
   its place a conception more in accordance with the supposed
   requirements of speculative philosophy. Let us hear on this point, and
   understand as we best may, the language of the great leader of the
   chief modern school of philosophical rationalists. "To grasp rightly
   and definitely in thought," says Hegel, "the nature of God as a Spirit,
   demands profound speculation. These propositions are first of all
   contained therein: God is God only in so far as He knows Himself: His
   own self-knowledge is moreover His self-consciousness in man, and man's
   knowledge of God, which is developed into man's self-knowledge in God."
   . . . "The Form of the Absolute Spirit," he continues, "separates
   itself from the Substance, and in it the different phases of the
   conception part into separate spheres or elements, in each of which the
   Absolute Substance exhibits itself, first as an eternal substance,
   abiding in its manifestation with itself; secondly, as a distinguishing
   of the eternal Essence from its manifestation, which through this
   distinction becomes the world of appearance, into which the substance
   of the absolute Spirit enters; thirdly, as an endless return and
   reconciliation of the world thus projected with the eternal Essence, by
   which that Essence goes back from appearance into the unity of its
   fulness."^([163]23) The remainder of the passage carries out this
   metaphysical caricature of Christian doctrine into further details,
   bearing on my present argument, but with even additional obscurity;--an
   obscurity so great, that the effect of a literal translation would be
   too ludicrous for an occasion like the present. But enough has been
   quoted to show that if rationalizing philosophers have not made much
   progress, since the days of Job, in the ability to find out the
   Almighty unto perfection, [64] they have at least not gone backwards in
   the art of darkening counsel by words without knowledge. [65]

   What is the exact meaning of this profound riddle, which the author has
   repeated in different forms in various parts of his
   writings;^([164]24)--whether he really means to assert or to deny the
   existence of Christ as a man;--whether he designs to represent the
   Incarnation and earthly life of the Son of God as a fact, or only as
   the vulgar representation of a philosophical idea,--is a point which
   has been stoutly disputed among his disciples, and which possibly the
   philosopher himself did not wish to see definitely settled.^([165]25)
   But there is another passage, in which he has spoken somewhat more
   plainly, and which, without being quite decisive, may be quoted as
   throwing some light on the tendency of his thought. "Christ," says this
   significant passage, "has been called by the church the God-Man. This
   monstrous combination is to the understanding a direct contradiction;
   but the unity of the divine and human nature is in this respect brought
   into consciousness and certainty in man; in that the Diversity, or, as
   we may also express it, the Finiteness, Weakness, Frailty of human
   nature, is not incompatible with this Unity, as in the eternal Idea
   Diversity in nowise derogates from the Unity which is God. This is the
   monstrosity whose necessity we have seen. It is therein implied that
   the divine and human nature are not in themselves different. God in
   human form. The truth is, that there is but one Reason, one Spirit;
   that the Spirit as finite has no real existence."^([166]26)

   The dark sentences of the master have been, as might naturally be
   expected, variously developed by his disciples. Let us hear how the
   same theory is expressed in the language of one who is frequently
   commended as representing the orthodox theology of this school, and who
   has striven hard to reconcile the demands of his philosophy with the
   belief in a personal Christ. Marheineke assures us, that "the
   possibility of God becoming Man shows in itself that the divine and
   human nature awe in themselves not separate:" that, "as the truth of
   the human nature is the divine, so the reality of the divine nature is
   the human."^([167]27) And towards the conclusion of a statement worthy
   to rank with that of his master for grandiloquent obscurity, he says,
   "As Spirit, by renouncing Individuality, Man is in truth elevated above
   himself, without having abandoned the human nature: as Spirit
   renouncing Absoluteness, God has lowered Himself to human nature,
   without having abandoned his existence as Divine Spirit. The unity of
   the divine and human nature is but the unity in that Spirit whose
   existence is the knowledge of the truth, with which the doing of good
   is identical. This Spirit, as God in the human nature and as Man in the
   divine nature, is the God-Man. The man wise in divine holiness, and
   holy in divine wisdom, is the God-Man. As a historical fact," he
   continues, "this union of God with man is manifest and real in the
   Person of Jesus Christ: in Him the divine manifestation has become
   perfectly human. The conception of the God-Man in the historical Person
   of Jesus Christ, contains in itself two phases in one; first, that God
   is manifest only through man; and in this relation Christ is as yet
   placed on an equality with all other men: He is the Son of Man, and
   therein at first represents only the possibility of God becoming Man:
   secondly, that in this Man, Jesus Christ, God is manifest, as in none
   other: this manifest Man is the manifest God; but the manifest God is
   the Son of God; and in this relation, Christ is God's Son; and this is
   the actual fulfilment of the possibility or promise; it is the reality
   of God becoming Man."^([168]28)

   But this kind of halting between two opinions, which endeavors to
   combine the historical fact with the philosophical theory, was not of a
   nature to satisfy the bolder and more logical minds of the same school.
   In the theory of Strauss, we find the direct antagonism between the
   historical and the philosophical Christ fairly acknowledged; and the
   former is accordingly set aside entirely, to make way for the latter.
   And here we have at least the advantage, that the trumpet gives no
   uncertain sound;--that we are no longer deluded by a phantom of
   Christian doctrine enveloped in a mist of metaphysical obscurity; but
   the two systems stand out sharply and clearly defined, in their utter
   contrariety to each other. "In an individual, a God-Man," he tells us,
   "the properties and functions which the church ascribes to Christ
   contradict themselves; in the idea of the race, they perfectly agree.
   Humanity is the union of the two natures--God become Man, the infinite
   manifesting itself in the finite, and the finite Spirit remembering its
   infinitude: it is the child of the visible Mother and the invisible
   Father, Nature and Spirit: it is the worker of miracles, in so far as
   in the course of human history the spirit more and more completely
   subjugates nature, both within and around man, until it lies before him
   as the inert matter on which he exercises his active power: it is the
   sinless one, for the course of its development is a blameless one;
   pollution cleaves to the individual only, but in the race and its
   history it is taken away. It is Humanity that dies, rises, and ascends
   to heaven; for from the negation of its natural state there ever
   proceeds a higher spiritual life; from the suppression of its finite
   character as a personal, national, and terrestrial Spirit, arises its
   union with the infinite Spirit of the heavens. By faith in this Christ,
   especially in his death and resurrection, man is justified before God:
   that is, by the kindling within him of the idea of Humanity, the
   individual man participates in the divinely human life of the species.
   Now the main element of that idea is, that the negation of the merely
   natural and sensual life, which is itself the negation of the spirit
   (the negation of negation, therefore), is the sole way to true
   spiritual life."^([169]29)

   These be thy gods, O Philosophy: these are the Metaphysics of
   Salvation.^([170]30) This is that knowledge of things divine and human,
   which we are called upon to substitute for the revealed doctrine of the
   Incarnation of the eternal Son in the fulness of time. It is for this
   philosophical idea, so superior to all history and fact,--this
   necessary process of the unconscious and impersonal Infinite,--that we
   are to sacrifice that blessed miracle of Divine Love and Mercy, by
   which the Son of God, of His own free act and will, took man's nature
   upon Him for man's redemption. It is for this that we are to obliterate
   from our faith that touching picture of the pure and holy Jesus, to
   which mankind for eighteen centuries has ever turned, with the devotion
   of man to God rendered only more heartfelt by the sympathy of love
   between man and man: which from generation to generation has nurtured
   the first seeds of religion in the opening mind of childhood, by the
   image of that Divine Child who was cradled in the manger of Bethlehem,
   and was subject to His parents at Nazareth: which has checked the fiery
   temptations of youth, by the thought of Him who "was in all points
   tempted like as we are, yet without sin:" [66] which has consoled the
   man struggling with poverty and sorrow, by the pathetic remembrance of
   Him who on earth had not where to lay his head: [67] which has blended
   into one brotherhood the rich and the poor, the mighty and the mean
   among mankind, by the example of Him who, though He was rich, yet for
   our sakes became poor; [68] though He was equal with God, yet took upon
   Him the form of a servant: [69] which has given to the highest and
   purest precepts of morality an additional weight and sanction, by the
   records of that life in which the marvellous and the familiar are so
   strangely yet so perfectly united;--that life so natural in its human
   virtue, so supernatural in its divine power: which has robbed death of
   its sting, and the grave of its victory, by faith in Him who "was
   delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our
   justification:" [70] which has ennobled and sanctified even the wants
   and weaknesses of our mortal nature, by the memory of Him who was an
   hungered in the wilderness and athirst upon the cross; who mourned over
   the destruction of Jerusalem, and wept at the grave of Lazarus.

   Let Philosophy say what she will, the fact remains unshaken. It is the
   consciousness of the deep wants of our human nature, that first awakens
   God's presence in the soul; it is by adapting His Revelation to those
   wants that God graciously condescends to satisfy them. The time may
   indeed come, though not in this life, when these various manifestations
   of God, "at sundry times and in divers manners," [71] may be seen to be
   but different sides and partial representations of one and the same
   Divine Reality;--when the light which now gleams in restless flashes
   from tlle ruffled waters of the human soul, will settle into the
   steadfast image of God's face shining on its unbroken surface. But ere
   this shall be, that which is perfect must come, and that which is in
   part must be done away. [72] But as regards the human wisdom which
   would lead us to this consummation now, there is but one lesson which
   it can teach us; and that it teaches in spite of itself. It teaches the
   lesson which the wise king of Israel learned from his own experience:
   "I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things
   that are done under heaven: I have seen all the works that are done
   under the sun: and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. And I
   gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I
   perceived that this also is vexation of spirit." [73] And if ever the
   time should come to any of us, when, in the bitter conviction of that
   vanity and vexation, we, who would be as gods in knowledge, wake up
   only to the consciousness of our own nakedness, happy shall we be, if
   then we may still hear, ringing in our ears and piercing to our hearts,
   an echo from that personal life of Jesus which our philosophy has
   striven in vain to pervert or to destroy: "Lord, to whom shall we go?
   thou hast the words of eternal life: and we believe and are sure that
   thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God." [74]

LECTURE VI.

   FOR WHAT MAN KNOWETH THE THINGS OF A MAN, SAVE THE SPIRIT OF MAN WHICH
   IS IN HIM? EVEN SO THE THINGS OF GOD KNOWETH NO MAN, BUT THE SPIRIT OF
   GOD.--1 CORINTHIANS II. 11.

   THE conclusion to be drawn from our previous inquiries is, that the
   doctrines of Revealed Religion, like all other objects of human
   thought, have a relation to the constitution of the thinker to whom
   they are addressed; within which relation their practical application
   and significance is confined. At the same time, this very relation
   indicates the existence of a higher form of the same truths, beyond the
   range of human intelligence, and therefore not capable of
   representation in any positive mode of thought. Religious ideas, in
   short, like all other objects of man's consciousness, are composed of
   two distinct elements,--a Matter, furnished from without, and a Form,
   imposed from within by the laws of the mind itself. The latter element
   is common to all objects of thought as such: the former is the peculiar
   and distinguishing feature, by which the doctrines of Revelation are
   distinguished from other religious representations, derived from
   natural sources; or by which, in more remote comparison, religious
   ideas in general may be distinguished from those relating to other
   objects. Now it is indispensable, before we can rightly estimate the
   value of the various objections which are adduced against this or that
   representation of Christian doctrine, to ascertain which of these
   elements it is, against which the force of the objection really makes
   itself felt. There may be objections whose force, such as it is, tells
   against the revealed doctrine alone, and which are harmless when
   directed against any other mode of religious representation. And there
   may also be objections which are applicable to the form which revealed
   religion shares in common with other modes of human thinking, and whose
   force, if they have any, is in reality directed, not against Revelation
   in particular, but against all Religion, and indeed against all
   Philosophy also. Now if, upon examination, it should appear that the
   principal objections which are raised on the side of Rationalism
   properly so called,--those, namely, which turn on a supposed
   incompatibility between the doctrine of Scripture and the deductions of
   human reason, are of the latter kind, and not of the former,
   Christianity is at least so far secure from any apprehension of danger
   from the side of rational philosophy. For the weapon with which she is
   assailed exhibits its own weakness in the very act of assailing. If
   there is error or imperfection in the essential forms of human thought,
   it must adhere to the thought criticizing, no less than to the thought
   criticized; and the result admits of but two legitimate alternatives.
   Either we must abandon ourselves to an absolute Skepticism, which
   believes nothing and disbelieves nothing, and which thereby destroys
   itself in believing that nothing is to be believed; or we must confess
   that reason, in thus criticizing, has transcended its legitimate
   province: that it has failed, not through its inherent weakness, but
   through being misdirected in its aim. We must then shift the inquiry to
   another field, and allow our belief to be determined, not solely by the
   internal character of the doctrines themselves, as reasonable or
   unreasonable, but partly at least, by the evidence which can be
   produced in favor of their asserted origin as a fact. The reasonable
   believer, in short, must abstain from pronouncing judgment on the
   nature of the message, until he has fairly examined the credentials of
   the messenger.

   There are two methods by which such an examination of objections may be
   conducted. We may commence by an analysis of thought in general,
   distinguishing the Form, or permanent element, from the Matter, or
   variable element; and then, by applying the results of that analysis to
   special instances, we may show, upon deductive grounds, the formal or
   material character of this or that class of objections. Or we may
   reverse the process, commencing by an examination of the objections
   themselves; and, by exhibiting them in their relation to other
   doctrines besides those of Revelation, we may arrive at the same
   conclusion as to their general or special applicability. The former
   method is perhaps the most searching and complete, but could hardly be
   adequately carried out within my present limits, nor without the
   employment of a language more technical than would be suitable on this
   occasion. In selecting the latter method, as the more appropriate, I
   must request my hearers to bear in mind the general principles which it
   is proposed to exhibit in one or two special instances. These are,
   first, that there is no rational difficulty in Christian Theology which
   has not its corresponding difficulty in human Philosophy: and,
   secondly, that, therefore we may reasonably conclude that the
   stumblingblocks which the rationalist professes to find in the
   doctrines of revealed religion arise, not from defects peculiar to
   revelation, but from the laws and limits of human thought in general,
   and are thus inherent in the method of rationalism itself, not in the
   objects which it pretends to criticize.

   But, before applying this method to the peculiar doctrines of the
   Christian revelation, it will be desirable to say a few words on a
   preliminary condition, on which our belief in the possibility of any
   revelation at all is dependent. We must justify, in the first instance,
   the limitations which have been assigned to human reason in relation to
   the great foundation of all religious belief whatsoever: we must show
   how far the same method warrants the assertion which has been already
   made on other grounds; namely, that we may and ought to believe in the
   existence of a God whose nature we are unable to comprehend; that we
   are bound to believe that God exists; and to acknowledge Him as our
   Sustainer and our Moral Governor: though we are wholly unable to
   declare what He is in His own Absolute Essence.^([171]1)

   Many philosophical theologians, who are far from rejecting any of the
   essential doctrines of revelation, are yet unwilling to ground their
   acceptance of them on the duty of believing in the inconceivable. "The
   doctrine of the incognizability of the Divine essence," says the
   learned and deep-thinking Julius Müller, "with the intention of
   exalting God to the highest, deprives Him of the realities, without
   which, as it is itself obliged to confess, we cannot really think of
   Him. That this negative result, just as decidedly as the assumption of
   an absolute knowledge of God, contradicts the Holy Scriptures, which
   especially teach that God becomes revealed in Christ, as it does that
   of the simple Christian consciousness, may be too easily shown for it
   to be requisite that we should here enter upon the same: it is also of
   itself clear into what a strange position theology must fall by the
   renunciation of the knowledge of its essential object."^([172]2) As
   regards the former part of this objection, I endeavored, in my last
   Lecture, to show that a full belief in God, as revealed in Christ, is
   not incompatible with a speculative inability to apprehend the Divine
   Essence. As regards the latter part, it is important to observe the
   exact parallel which in this respect exists between the fundamental
   conception of Theology and that of Philosophy. The Principle of
   Causality, the father, as it has been called, of metaphysical
   science,^([173]3) is to the philosopher what the belief in the
   existence of God is to the theologian. Both are principles inherent in
   our nature, exhibiting, whatever may be their origin, those
   characteristics of universality and certainty which mark them as part
   of the inalienable inheritance of the human mind. Neither can be
   reduced to a mere logical inference from the facts of a limited and
   contingent experience. Both are equally indispensable to their
   respective sciences: without Causation, there can be no Philosophy; as
   without God there can be no Theology. Yet to this day, while
   enunciating now, as ever, the fundamental axiom, that for every event
   there must be a Cause, Philosophy has never been able to determine what
   Causation is; to analyze the elements which the causal nexus involves;
   or to show by what law she is justified in assuming the universal
   postulate upon which all her reasonings depend.^([174]4) The Principle
   of Causality has ever been, and probably ever will be, the battle
   ground on which, from generation to generation, Philosophy has
   struggled for her very existence in the death-gripe of Skepticism; and
   at every pause in the contest, the answer has been still the same: "We
   cannot explain it, but we must believe it." Causation is not the mere
   invariable association of antecedent and consequent: we feel that it
   implies something more than this.^([175]5) Yet, beyond the little
   sphere of our own volitions, what more can we discover? and within that
   sphere, what do we discover that we can explain?^([176]6) The unknown
   something, call it by what name you will,--power, effort,
   tendency,--still remains absolutely concealed, yet is still conceived
   as absolutely indispensable. Of Causality, as of Deity, we may almost
   say, in the emphatic language of Augustine, "Cujus nulla scientia est
   in anima, nisi scire quomodo eum nesciat."^([177]7) We can speak out
   boldly and clearly of each, if we are asked, what it is not: we are
   silent only when we are asked, what it is. The eloquent words of the
   same great father are as applicable to human as to divine Philosophy:
   [75] "Deus ineffabilis est: facilius dicimus quid non sit, quam quid
   sit. Terram cogitas; non est hoc Deus: mare cogitas; non est hoc Deus:
   omnia quæ sunt in terra, homines et animalia; non est hoc Deus: omnia
   quæ sunt in mari, quæ volant per aerem; non est hoc Deus: quidquid
   lucet in coelo, stellæ, sol et luna; non est hoc Deus: ipsum coelum;
   non est hoc Deus. Angelos cogita, Virtutes, Potestates, Archangelos,
   Thronos, Sedes, Dominationes; non est hoc Deus. Et quid est? Hoc solum
   potui dicere, quid non sit."^([178]8)

   From the fundamental doctrine of Religion in general, let us pass on to
   that of Christianity in particular. "The Catholic Faith is this: that
   we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity." How, asks the
   objector, can the One be Many, or the Many One? or how is a distinction
   of Persons compatible with their perfect equality?^([179]9) It is not a
   contradiction to say, that we are compelled by the Christian Verity to
   acknowledge every Person by Himself to be God and Lord; and yet are
   forbidden by the Catholic Religion to say, There be three Gods, or
   three Lords.^([180]10)

   To exhibit the philosophical value of this objection, we need only make
   a slight chance in the language of the doctrine criticized. Instead of
   a plurality of persons in the Divine Unity, we have only to speak of a
   plurality of Attributes in the Divine Essence. How can there be a
   variety of Attributes, each infinite in its kind, and yet all together
   constituting but one Infinite? or how, on the other hand, can the
   Infinite be conceived as existing without diversity at all? We know,
   indeed, that various attributes exist in man constituting in their
   plurality one and the same conscious self. Even here, there is a
   mystery which we cannot explain; but the fact is one which we are
   compelled, by the direct testimony of consciousness, to accept without
   explanation. But in admitting, as we are compelled to do, the
   coexistence of many attributes in one person, we can conceive those
   attributes only as distinct from each other, and as limiting each
   other. Each mental attribute is manifested as a separate and
   determinate mode of consciousness, marked off and limited, by the very
   fact of its manifestation as such. Each is developed in activities and
   operations from which the others are excluded. But this type of the
   conscious existence fails us altogether, when we attempt to transfer it
   to the region of the Infinite. That there can be but one Infinite,
   appears to be a necessary conclusion of reason; for diversity is itself
   a limitation: yet here we have many Infinites, each distinct from the
   other, yet all constituting one Infinite, which is neither identical
   with them nor distinguishable from them. If Reason, thus baffled, falls
   back on the conception of a simple Infinite Nature, composed of no
   attributes, her case is still more hopeless. That which has no
   attributes is nothing conceivable; for things are conceived by their
   attributes. Strip the Infinite of the Attributes by which it is
   distinguished as infinite, and the Finite of those by which it is
   distinguished as finite; and the residue is neither the Infinite as
   such, nor the Finite as such, nor any one being as distinguished from
   any other being. It is the vague and empty conception of Being in
   general, which is no being in particular,--a shape,

     "If Shape it might be called, that shape had none
     Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb,
     Or Substance might be called, that Shadow seemed,
     For each seemed either."^([181]11)

   The objection, "How can the One be Many, or the Many One?" is thus so
   far from telling with peculiar force against the Catholic doctrine of
   the Holy Trinity, that it has precisely the same power or want of
   power, and may be urged with precisely the same effect, or want of
   effect, against any conception, theological or philosophical, in which
   we may attempt to represent the Divine Nature and Attributes as
   infinite, or, indeed, to exhibit the Infinite at all. The same argument
   applies with equal force to the conception of the Absolute. If the
   Divine Nature is conceived as being nothing more than the sum of the
   Divine Attributes, it is not Absolute; for the existence of the wilole,
   wtill be dependent on the existence of its several parts. It; on the
   other hand, it is something distinct from the Attributes, and capable
   of existing without them, it becomes, in its absolute essence, an
   absolute void,--an existence manifested by no characteristic
   features,--a conception constituted by nothing conceivable.^([182]12)

   The same principle may be also applied to another portion of this great
   fundamental truth. The doctrine of the Son of God, begotten of the
   Father, and yet coeternal with the Father, is in nowise more or less
   comprehensible by human reason, than the relation between the Divine
   Essence and its Attributes.^([183]13) In the order of Thought, or of
   Nature, the substance to which attributes belong has a logical priority
   to the attributes which exist in relation to it. The Attributes are
   attributes of a Substance. The former are conceived as the dependent
   and derived; the latter as the independent and original existence. Yet
   in the order of Time (and to the order of Time all human thought is
   limited), it is as impossible to conceive the Substance existing before
   its Attributes, as the Attributes before the Substance.^([184]14) We
   cannot conceive a being originally simple, developing itself in the
   course of time into a complexity of attributes; for absolute simplicity
   cannot be conceived as containing within itself a principle of
   development, nor as differently related to different periods of time,
   so as to commence its development at any particular moment.^([185]15)
   Nor yet can we conceive the attributes as existing prior to the
   substance; for the very conception of an attribute implies relation to
   a substance. Yet the third hypothesis, that of their coexistence in all
   time, is equally incomprehensible; for this is to merge the Absolute
   and Infinite in an eternal relation and difference. We cannot conceive
   God as first existing, and then as creating His own attributes; for the
   creative power must then itself be created. Nor yet can we conceive the
   Divine Essence as constituted by the eternal coexistence of attributes;
   for then we have many Infinites, with no bond of unity between them.
   The mystery of the Many and the One, which has baffled philosophy ever
   since philosophy began, meets it here, as everywhere, with its eternal
   riddle. Reason gains nothing by repudiating Revelation; for the mystery
   of Revelation is the mystery of Reason also.

   I should not for an instant dream of adducing this metaphysical
   parallel as offering the slightest approach to a proof of the Christian
   doctrine of the Trinity in Unity. What it really illustrates is, not
   God's Nature, but man's ignorance. Without an Absolute Knowing there
   can be no comprehension of Absolute Being.^([186]16) The position of
   human reason, with regard to the ideas of the Absolute and the
   Infinite, is such as equally to exclude the Dogmatism which would
   demonstrate Christian Doctrine from philosophical premises, and the
   Rationalism which rejects it on the ground of philosophical
   difficulties, as well as that monstrous combination of both, which
   distorts it in pretending to systematize it. The Infinite is known to
   human reason, merely as the negation of the Finite: we know what it is
   not; and that is all. The conviction, that an Infinite Being exists,
   seems forced upon us by the manifest incompleteness of our finite
   knowledge; but we have no rational means whatever of determining what
   is the nature of that Being.^([187]17) The mind is thus perfectly blank
   with regard to any speculative representation of the Divine Essence;
   and for that very reason, Philosophy is not entitled, on internal
   evidence, to accept any, or to reject any. The only question which we
   are reasonably at liberty to ask in this matter, relates to the
   evidences of the Revelation as a fact. If there is sufficient evidence,
   on other grounds, to show that the Scripture, in which this doctrine is
   contained, is a Revelation from God, the doctrine itself must be
   unconditionally received, not as reasonable, nor as unreasonable, but
   as scriptural. If there is not such evidence, the doctrine itself will
   lack its proper support; but the Reason which rejects it is utterly
   incompetent to substitute any other representation in its place.

   Let us pass on to the second great doctrine of the Catholic
   Faith,--that which asserts the union of two Natures in the Person of
   Christ. "The right Faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man: God of the Substance of
   the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Substance of
   His Mother, born in the world."^([188]18)

   Our former parallel was drawn from the impossibility of conceiving, in
   any form, a relation between the Infinite and the Infinite. Our present
   parallel may be found in the equal impossibility of conceiving, by the
   natural reason, a relation between the Infinite and the Finite;--an
   impossibility equally insurmountable, whether the two natures are
   conceived as existing in one Being, or in divers. Let us attempt, if we
   can, to conceive, at any moment of time, a finite world coming into
   existence by the fiat of an Infinite Creator. Can we conceive that the
   amount of existence is thereby increased,--that the Infinite and the
   Finite together contain more reality than formerly existed in the
   Infinite alone? The supposition annihilates itself; for it represents
   Infinite Existence as capable of becoming greater still. But, on the
   other hand, can we have recourse to the opposite alternative, and
   conceive the Creator as evolving the world out of His own Essence; the
   amount of Being remaining as before, yet the Infinite and the Finite
   both existing? This supposition also annihilates itself; for if the
   Infinite suffer diminution by that portion of it, which becomes the
   Finite, it is infinite no longer; and if it suffers no diminution, the
   two together are but equal to the Infinite alone, and the Finite is
   reduced to absolute nonentity.^([189]19) In any mode whatever of human
   thought, the coexistence of the Infinite and the Finite is
   inconceivable; and yet the non-existence of either is, by the same laws
   of consciousness, equally inconceivable. If Reason is to be the supreme
   Judge of Divine Truths, it will not be sufficient to follow its
   guidance up to a certain point, and to stop when it is inconvenient to
   proceed further. There is no logical break in the chain of
   consequences, from Socinianism to Pantheism, and from Pantheism to
   Atheism, and from Atheism to Pyrrhonism; and Pyrrhonism is but the
   suicide of Reason itself. "Nature," says Pascal, "confounds the
   Pyrrhonists, and reason confounds the Dogmatists. What then becomes of
   man, if he seeks to discover his true condition by his natural reason?
   He cannot avoid one of these sects, and he cannot subsist in
   either."^([190]20)

   Let Religion begin where it will, it must begin with that which is
   above Reason. What then do we gain by that parsimony of belief, which
   strives to deal out the Infinite in infinitesimal fragments, and to
   erect the largest possible superstructure of deduction upon the
   smallest possible foundation of faith? We gain just this: that we
   forsake an incomprehensible doctrine, which rests upon the word of God,
   for one equally incomprehensible, which rests upon the word of man.
   Religion, to be a relation between God and man at all, must rest on a
   belief in the Infinite, and also on a belief in the Finite; for if we
   deny the first, there is no God; and if we deny the second, there is no
   Man. But the coexistence of the Infinite and the Finite, in any manner
   whatever, is inconceivable by reason; and the only ground that can be
   taken for accepting one representation of it rather than another, is
   that one is revealed, and another is not revealed. We may seek as we
   will for a "Religion within the limits of the bare Reason;" and we
   shall not find it; simply because no such thing exists; and if we dream
   for a moment that it does exist, it is only because we are unable or
   unwilling to pursue reason to its final consequences. But if we do not,
   others will; and the system which we have raised on the shifting basis
   of our arbitrary resting-place, waits only till the wind of controversy
   blows against it, and the flood of unbelief descends upon it, to
   manifest itself as the work of the "foolish man which built his house
   upon the sand." [76]

   Having thus endeavored to exhibit the limits of human reason in
   relation to those doctrines of Holy Scripture which reveal to us the
   nature of God, I shall next attempt briefly to apply the same argument
   to those representations which more directly declare His relation to
   the world.

   The course of Divine Providence, in the government of the world, is
   represented in Scripture under the twofold aspect of General Law and
   Special Interposition. Not only is God the Author of the universe, and
   of those regular laws by which the periodical recurrence of its natural
   phenomena is determined; [77] but He is also exhibited as standing in a
   special relation to mankind; as the direct cause of events by which
   their temporal or spiritual welfare is affected: as accessible to the
   prayers of His servants; as to be praised for His special mercies
   towards each of us in particular. [78] But this scriptural
   representation has been discovered by Philosophy to be irrational. God
   is unchangeable; and therefore He cannot be moved by man's entreaty. He
   is infinitely wise and good; and therefore He ought not to deviate from
   the perfection of His Eternal Counsels. "The religious man," says a
   writer of the present day, "who believes that all events, mental as
   well as physical, are preordered and arranged according to the decrees
   of infinite wisdom, and the philosopher, who knows that, by the wise
   and eternal laws of the universe, cause and effect are indissolubly
   chained together, and that one follows the other in inevitable
   succession,--equally feel that this ordination--this chain--cannot be
   changeable at the cry of man. . . . If the purposes of God were not
   wise, they would not be formed;--if wise, they cannot be changed, for
   then they would become unwise. . . . The devout philosopher, trained to
   the investigation of universal system,--the serene astronomer, fresh
   from the study of the changeless laws which govern innumerable
   worlds,--shrinks from the monstrous irrationality of asking the great
   Architect and Governor of all to work a miracle in his behalf,--to
   interfere, for the sake of his convenience or his plans, with the
   sublime order conceived by the Ancient of Days in the far Eternity of
   the Past; for what is a special providence but an interference with
   established laws? and what is such interference but a
   miracle?"^([191]21)

   Now here, as in the objections previously noticed, the rationalist
   mistakes a general difficulty of all human thought for a special
   difficulty of Christian belief. The really insoluble problem is, how to
   conceive God as acting at all; not how to conceive Him as acting in
   this way, rather than in that. The creation of the world at any period
   of time;--the establishment, at any moment, of immutable laws for the
   future government of that world;--this is the real mystery which reason
   is unable to fathom, this is the representation which seems to
   contradict our conceptions of the Divine Perfection. To that
   pretentious perversion of the finite which philosophy dignifies with
   the name of the Infinite, it is a contradiction to suppose that any
   change can take place at any moment;--that any thing can begin to
   exist, which was not from all eternity. To conceive the Infinite
   Creator, at any moment of time, calling into existence a finite world,
   is, in the human point of view, to suppose an imperfection, either
   before the act, or after it. It is to suppose the development of a
   power hitherto unexercised, or the limiting to a determinate act that
   which was before general and indeterminate.

   May we not then repeat our author's objection in another form? How can
   a Being of Infinite Wisdom and Goodness, without an act of
   self-deterioration, change the laws which have governed His own
   solitary existence in the far Eternity when the world was not? Or
   rather, may we not ask what these very phrases of "changeless laws" and
   "far Eternity" really mean? Do they not represent God's existence as
   manifested under the conditions of duration and succession,--conditions
   which necessarily involve the conception of the imperfect and the
   finite? They have not emancipated the Deity from the law of Time: they
   have only placed Him in a different relation to it. They have merely
   substituted, for the revealed representation of the God who from time
   to time vouchsafes His aid to the needs of His creatures, the
   rationalizing representation of the God who, throughout all time,
   steadfastly refuses to do so.^([192]22)

   If, then, the condition of Time is inseparable from all human
   conceptions of the Divine Nature, what advantage do we gain, even in
   philosophy, by substituting the supposition of immutable order in time
   for that of special interposition in time? Both of these
   representations are doubtless speculatively imperfect: both depict the
   Infinite God under finite symbols. But for the regulative purposes of
   human conduct in this life, each is equally necessary: and who may
   dare, from the depths of his own ignorance, to say that each may not
   have its prototype in the ineffable Being of God?^([193]23) We are
   sometimes told that it gives us a more elevated idea of the Divine
   Wisdom and Power, to regard the Creator as having finished His work
   once for all, and then abandoned it to its own unerring laws, than to
   represent Him as interfering, from time to time, by the way of direct
   personal superintendence;--just as it implies higher mechanical skill
   to make an engine which shall go on perpetually by its own motion, than
   one which requires to be continually regulated by the hand of its
   maker.^([194]24) This ingenious simile fails only in the important
   particular, that both its terms are utterly unlike the objects which
   they profess to represent. The world is not a machine; and God is not a
   mechanic. The world is not a machine; for it consists, not merely of
   wheels of brass, and springs of steel, and the fixed properties of
   inanimate matter; but of living and intelligent and free-acting
   persons, capable of personal relations to a living and intelligent and
   free-acting Ruler. And God is not a mechanic; for the mechanic is
   separated from his machine by the whole diameter of being; as mind,
   giving birth to material results; as the conscious workman, who meets
   with no reciprocal consciousness in his work. It may be a higher
   evidence of mechanical skill, to abandon brute matter once for all to
   its own laws; but to take this as the analogy of God's dealings with
   His living creatures--as well tell us that the highest image of
   parental love and forethought is that of the ostrich, "which leaveth
   her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust." [79] ^([195]25)

   But if such conclusions are not justified by our a priori knowledge of
   the Divine nature, are they borne out empirically by the actual
   constitution of the world? Is there any truth in the assertion, so
   often put forth as an undeniable discovery of modern science, "that
   cause and effect are indissolubly chained together, and that one
   follows the other in inevitable succession?" There is just that amount
   of half-truth which makes an error dangerous; and there is no more.
   Experience is of two kinds, and Philosophy is of two kinds;--that of
   the world of matter, and that of the world of mind,--that of physical
   succession, and that of moral action. In the material world, if it be
   true that the researches of science tend towards (though who can say
   that they will ever reach?) the establishment of a system of fixed and
   orderly recurrence; in the mental world, we are no less confronted, at
   every instant, by the presence of contingency and free will.^([196]26)
   In the one we are conscious of a chain of phenomenal effects; in the
   other of self, as an acting and originating cause. Nay, the very
   conception of the immutability of the law of cause and effect, is not
   so much derived from the positive evidence of the former, as from the
   negative evidence of the latter. We believe the succession to be
   necessary, because nothing but mind can be conceived as interfering
   with the successions of matter; and, where mind is excluded, we are
   unable to imagine contingence.^([197]27) But what right has this
   so-called philosophy to build a theory of the universe on material
   principles alone, and to neglect what experience daily and. hourly
   forces upon our notice,--the perpetual interchange of the relations of
   matter and mind? In passing from the material to the moral world, we
   pass at once from the phenomenal to the real; from the successive to
   the continuous; from the many to the one; from an endless chain of
   mutual dependence to an originating and self-determining source of
   power. That mysterious, yet unquestionable presence of Will;--that
   agent, uncompelled, yet not uninfluenced, whose continuous existence
   and productive energy are summoned up in the word Myself;--that
   perpetual struggle of good with evil;--those warnings and promptings of
   a Spirit, striving with our spirit, commanding, yet not compelling;
   acting upon us, yet leaving us free to act for ourselves;--that twofold
   consciousness of infirmity and strength in the hour of
   temptation;--that grand ideal of what we ought to be, so little, alas!
   to be gathered from the observation of what we are;--that overwhelming
   conviction of Sin in the sight of One higher and holier than we;--that
   irresistible impulse to Prayer, which bids us pour out our sorrows and
   make our wants known to One who hears and will answer us; -that
   indefinable yet inextinguishable consciousness of a direct intercourse
   and communion of man with God, of God's influence upon man, yea, and
   (with reverence be it spoken) of man's influence upon God:--these are
   facts of experience, to the full as real and as certain as the laws of
   p1lnetary motions and chemical affinities;--facts which Philosophy is
   bound to take into account, or to stand convicted as shallow and
   one-sided;--facts which can deceive us, only if our whole Consciousness
   is a liar, and the boasted voice of Reason itself but an echo of the
   universal lie.

   Even within the domain of Physical Science, however much analogy may
   lead us to conjecture the universal prevalence of law and orderly
   sequence, it has been acutely remarked, that the phenomena which are
   most immediately important to the life and welfare of man, are
   precisely those which he never has been, and probably never will be,
   able to reduce to a scientific calculation.^([198]28) The astronomer,
   who can predict the exact position of a planet in the heavens a
   thousand years hence, knows not what may be his own state of health
   to-morrow, nor how the wind which blows upon him will vary from day to
   day. May we not be permitted to conclude, with a distinguished
   Christian philosopher of the present day, that there is a Divine
   Purpose in this arrangement of nature; that, while enough is displayed
   to stimulate the intellectual and practical energies of man, enough is
   still concealed to make him feel his dependence upon God?^([199]29)

   For man's training in this life, the conceptions of General Law and of
   Special Providence are both equally necessary; the one, that he may
   labor for God's blessings, and the other, that he may pray for them.
   Ile sows, and reaps, and gathers in his produce, to meet the different
   seasons, as they roll their unchanging course: he acknowledges also
   that "neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth;
   but God that giveth the increase." [80] He labors in the moral training
   of himself and others, in obedience to the general laws of means and
   ends, of motives and influences; while he asks, at the same time, for
   wisdom from above to guide his course aright, and for grace to enable
   him to follow that guidance. Necessary alike during this our state of
   trial, it may be that both conceptions alike are but shadows of some
   higher truth, in which their apparent oppositions are merged in one
   harmonious whole. But when we attempt, from our limited point of view,
   to destroy the one, in order to establish the other more surely, we
   overlook the fact that our conception of General Law is to the full as
   human as that of Special Interposition;--that we are not really thereby
   acquiring a truer knowledge of the hidden things of God, but are
   measuring Him by a standard derived from the limited representations of
   man.^([200]30)

   Subordinate to the Conception of Special Providence, and subject to the
   same laws of thought in its application, is that of Miraculous Agency.
   I am not now going to waste an additional argument in answer to that
   shallowest and crudest of all the assumptions of unbelief, which
   dictatorially pronounces that Miracles are impossible;--an assumption
   which is repudiated by the more philosophical among the leaders of
   Rationalism itself;^([201]31) and which implies, that he who maintains
   it has such a perfect and intimate acquaintance with the Divine Nature
   and Purposes, as to warrant him in asserting that God cannot or will
   not depart from the ordinary course of His Providence on any occasion
   whatever. If, as I have endeavored to show, the doctrine of Divine
   Interposition is not in itself more opposed to reason than that of
   General Law; and if the asserted immutability of the laws of nature is,
   at the utmost, tenable only on the supposition that material nature
   alone is spoken of,--we are not warranted, on any ground, whether of
   deduction from principles or of induction from experience, in denying
   the possible suspension of the Laws of Matter by the will of the Divine
   Mind. But the question on which it may still be desirable to say a few
   words, before concluding this portion of my argument, is one which is
   disputed, not necessarily between the believer and the unbeliever, but
   often between believers equally sincere and equally pious, differing
   only in their modes of representing to their own minds the facts and
   doctrines which both accept. Granting, that is to say, that variations
   from the established sequence of physical phenomena may take place, and
   have taken place, as Scripture bears witness;--are such variations to
   be represented as departures from or suspensions of natural law; or
   rather, as themselves the result of some higher law to us unknown, and
   as miraculous only from the point of view of our present
   ignorance?^([202]32)

   Which of these representations, or whether either of them, is the true
   one, when such occurrences are considered in their relation to the
   Absolute Nature of God, our ignorance of that Nature forbids us to
   determine. Speculatively, to human understanding, it appears as little
   consistent with the nature of the Absolute and Infinite, to be subject
   to universal law, as it is to act at particular moments. But as a
   regulative truth, adapted to the religious wants of man's constitution,
   the more natural representation, that of a departure from the general
   law, seems to be also the more accurate. We are liable, in considering
   this question, to confound together two distinct notions under the
   equivocal name of Law. The first is a positive notion, derived from the
   observation of facts, and founded, with various modifications, upon the
   general idea of the periodical recurrence of phenomena. The other is a
   merely negative notion, deduced from a supposed apprehension of the
   Divine Nature, and professing to be based on the idea of the eternal
   Purposes of God. Of the former, the ideas of succession and repetition
   form an essential part. To the latter, the idea of Time, in any form,
   has no legitimate application; and it is thus placed beyond the sphere
   of human thought. Now, when we speak of a Miracle as the possible
   result of some higher law, do we employ the term law in the former
   sense, or in the latter? do we mean, a law which actually exists in the
   knowledge of God; or one which, in the progress of science, may come to
   the knowledge of man? -one which might be discovered by a better
   acquaintance with the Divine Counsels, or one which might be inferred
   from a larger experience of natural phenomena? If we mean the former,
   we do not know that a more perfect acquaintance with the Divine
   Counsels, implying, as it does, the elevation of our faculties to a
   superhuman level, might not abolish the conception of Law altogether.
   If we mean the latter, we assume that which no experience warrants us
   in assuming; we endanger the religious significance and value of the
   miracle, only for the sake of removing God a few degrees further back
   from that chain of phenomena which is admitted ultimately to depend
   upon Him. A miracle, in one sense, need not be necessarily a violation
   of the laws of nature. God may make use of natural instruments, acting
   after their kind; as man himself, within his own sphere, does in the
   production of artificial combinations. The great question, however,
   still remains: Has God ever, for religious purposes, exhibited
   phenomena in certain relations, which the observed course of nature,
   and the artistic skill of man, are unable to bring about, or to account
   for?

   I have thus far endeavored to apply the principle of the Limits of
   Religious Thought to some of these representations which are usually
   objected to by the Rationalist, as in apparent opposition to the
   Speculative Reason of Man. In my next Lecture, I shall attempt to
   pursue the same argument, in relation to those doctrines which are
   sometimes regarded as repugnant to man's Moral Reason. The lesson to be
   derived from our present inquiry may be given in the pregnant sentence
   of a great philosopher, but recently taken from us: "No difficulty
   emerges in Theology, which had not previously emerged in
   Philosophy."^([203]33) The intellectual stumblingblocks, which men find
   in the doctrines of Revelation, are not in consequence of any
   improbability or error peculiar to the things revealed; but are such as
   the thinker brings with him to the examination of the question;--such
   as meet him on every side, whether he thinks with or against the
   testimony of Scripture; being inherent in the constitution and laws of
   the Human Mind itself. But must we therefore acquiesce in the
   melancholy conclusion, that self-contradiction is the law of our
   intellectual being;--that the light of Reason, which is God's gift, no
   less than Revelation, is a delusive light, which we follow to our own
   deception? Far from it: the examination of the Limits of Thought leads
   to a conclusion the very opposite to this. Reason does not deceive us,
   if we will only read her witness aright; and Reason herself gives us
   warning, when we are in danger of reading it wrong. The light that is
   within us is not darkness; only it cannot illuminate that which is
   beyond the sphere of its rays. The self-contradictions, into which we
   inevitably fall, when we attempt certain courses of speculation, are
   the beacons placed by the hand of God in the mind of man, to warn us
   that we are deviating from the track that He designs us to pursue; that
   we are striving to pass the barriers which He has planted around us.
   The flaming sword turns every way against those who strive, in the
   strength of their own reason, to force their passage to the tree of
   life. Within her own province, and among her own objects, let Reason go
   forth, conquering and to conquer. The finite objects, which she can
   clearly and distinctly conceive, are her lawful empire and her true
   glory. The countless phenomena of the visible world; the unseen things
   which lie in the depths of the human soul;--these are given into her
   hand; and over them she may reign in unquestioned dominion. But when
   she strives to approach too near to the hidden mysteries of the
   Infinite;--when, not content with beholding afar off the partial and
   relative manifestations of God's presence, she would "turn aside and
   see this great sight," and know why God hath revealed Himself
   thus;--the voice of the Lord Himself is heard, as it were, speaking in
   warning from the midst: "Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from
   off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground." [81]

LECTURE VII.

   YET YE SAY, THE WAY OF THE LORD IS NOT EQUAL. HEAR NOW, O HOUSE OF
   ISRAEL; IS NOT MY WAY EQUAL? ARE NOT YOUR WAYS UNEQUAL?-EZEKIEL XVIII.
   25.

   "IF I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a
   transgressor." [82] This text might be appropriately prefixed to an
   examination of that system of moral and religious criticism which, at
   the close of the last century, succeeded for a time in giving a
   philosophical connection to the hitherto loose and floating theological
   rationalism of its age and country.^([204]1) It was indeed a marvellous
   attempt to send forth from the same fountain sweet waters and bitter,
   to pull down and to build up by the same act and method. The result of
   the Critical Philosophy, as applied to the speculative side of human
   Reason, was to prove beyond all question the existence of certain
   necessary forms and laws of Intuition and thought, which impart a
   corresponding character to all the objects of which Consciousness,
   intuitive or reflective, can take cognizance. Consciousness was thus
   exhibited as a Relation between the human mind and its object; and this
   conclusion, once established, is fatal to the very conception of a
   Philosophy of the Absolute. But by an inconsistency scarcely to be
   paralleled in the history of philosophy, the author of this
   comprehensive criticism attempted to deduce a partial conclusion from
   universal premises, and to exempt the speculations of moral and
   religious thought from the relative character with which, upon his own
   principles, all the products of human consciousness were necessarily
   invested. The Moral Law, and the ideas which it carries with it, are,
   according to this theory, not merely facts of human consciousness,
   conceived under the laws of human thought, but absolute, transcendental
   realities, implied in the conception of all Reasonable Beings as such,
   and therefore independent of the law of time, and binding, not on man
   as man, but on all possible intelligent beings, created or
   uncreated.^([205]2) The Moral Reason is thus a source of absolute and
   unchangeable realities; while the Speculative Reason is concerned only
   with phenomena, or things modified by the constitution of the human
   mind.^([206]3) As a corollary to this theory, it follows, that the law
   of human morality must be regarded as the measure and adequate
   representative of the moral nature of God;--in fact, that our knowledge
   of the Divine Being is identical with that of our own moral
   duties;--for God is made known to us, as existing at all, only in and
   by the moral reason: we do not look upon actions as binding because
   they are commanded by God; but we know them to be divine commands
   because we are bound by them.^([207]4) Applying these principles to the
   criticism of Revealed Religion, the philosopher maintains that no code
   of laws claiming divine authority can have any religious value, except
   as approved by the moral reason;^([208]5) that there can be no duties
   of faith or practice towards God, distinct from the moral obligations
   which reason enjoins;^([209]6) and that, consequently, every doctrine
   to which this test is inapplicable is either no part of revelation at
   all, or at best can only be given for local and temporary purposes, of
   which the enlightened reason need no longer take any account.^([210]7)

   Amid much that is true and noble in this teaching when confined within
   its proper limits, its fundamental weakness as an absolute criterion of
   religious truth is so manifest as hardly to need exposure. The fiction
   of a moral law binding in a particular form upon all possible
   intelligences, acquires this seeming universality, only because human
   intelligence is made the representative of all. I can conceive moral
   attributes only as I know them in consciousness: I can imagine other
   minds only by first assuming their likeness to my own. To construct a
   theory, whether of practical or of speculative reason, which shall be
   valid for other than human intelligences, it is necessary that the
   author should himself be emancipated from the conditions of human
   thought. Till this is done, the so-called Absolute is but the Relative
   under another name: the universal consciousness is but the human mind
   striving to transcend itself.

   The very characteristics of Universality and Necessity, with which our
   moral obligations are invested, point to an origin the very reverse of
   that which the above theory supposes. For these characteristics are in
   all cases due to the presence of the formal and personal element in the
   phenomena of consciousness, and appear most evidently in those
   conceptions in which the matter as well as the manner of thinking is
   drawn from the laws or formal conditions of experience. Of these
   conditions, I have in a former Lecture enumerated three--Time, Space,
   and Personality; the first as the condition of human consciousness in
   general: the second and third as the conditions of the same
   consciousness in relation to the phenomena of matter and of mind
   respectively.^([211]8) From these are derived three corresponding
   systems of necessary truths in the highest human sense of the term: the
   science of Numbers being connected. with the condition of Time; that of
   Magnitudes with Space; and that of Morals with Personality. These three
   sciences rest on similar bases, and are confined within the same
   limits: all being equally necessary and valid within the legitimate
   bounds of human intelligence; and all equally negative and
   self-contradictory, when we attempt to pass beyond those bounds. The
   contradictions involved in the conceptions of Infinite Number and
   Infinite Magnitude find their parallel when we attempt to conceive the
   attributes of an Infinite Morality: the necessity which is manifested
   in the finite relations of the two former is the counterpart of that
   which accompanies those of the latter.^([212]9) That Moral Obligation,
   conceived as a law binding upon man, must be regarded as immutable so
   long as man's nature remains unchanged, is manifest from the character
   of the conception itself, and follows naturally from a knowledge of its
   origin. An act of Duty is presented to my consciousness as enjoined by
   a Law whose obligation upon myself is directly and intuitively
   discerned. It thus differs essentially from the phenomena of external
   nature, whose laws are not immediately perceived, but inferred from the
   observed recurrence of facts. The immediate consciousness of Law
   unavoidably carries with it the conviction of necessity and
   immutability in relation to the agent who is subject to it. For to
   suppose that a moral law can be reversed or suspended in relation to
   myself;--to suppose a conviction of right unaccompanied by an
   obligation to act, or a conviction of wrong unaccompanied by an
   obligation to forbear,--is to suppose a reversal of the conditions of
   my personal existence;--a supposition which annihilates itself; since
   those conditions are implied in the attempt to conceive my personal
   existence at all. The Moral Sense is thus, like the intuitions of Time
   and Space, an a priori law of the human mind, not determined by
   experience as it is, but determining beforehand what experience ought
   to be. But it is not thereby elevated above the conditions of human
   intelligence; and the attempt so to elevate it is especially
   inadmissible in that philosophy which resolves Time and Space into
   forms of the human consciousness, and limits their operation to the
   field of the phenomena and the relative.

   That there is an Absolute Morality, based upon, or rather identical
   with, the Eternal Nature of God, is indeed a conviction forced upon us
   by the same evidence as that on which we believe that God exists at
   all. But what that Absolute Morality is, we are as unable to fix in any
   human conception, as we are to define the other attributes of the same
   Divine Nature. To human conception it seems impossible that absolute
   morality should be manifested in the form of a law of obligation; for
   such a law implies relation and subjection to the authority of a
   lawgiver. And as all human morality is manifested in this form, the
   conclusion seems unavoidable, that human morality, even in its highest
   elevation, is not identical with, nor adequate to measure, the Absolute
   Morality of God.^([213]10)

   A like conclusion is forced upon us by a closer examination of human
   morality itself. To maintain the immutability of moral principles in
   the abstract is a very different thing from maintaining the
   immutability of the particular acts by which those principles are
   manifested in practice. The parallel between the mathematical and the
   moral sciences, as systems of necessary truth, holds good in this
   respect also. As principles in the abstract, the laws of morality are
   as unchangeable as the axioms of geometry. That duty ought in all cases
   to be followed in preference to inclination, is as certain a truth as
   that two straight lines cannot enclose a space. In their concrete
   application, both principles are equally liable to error;--we may err
   in supposing a particular visible line to be perfectly straight; as we
   may err in supposing a particular act to be one of duty.^([214]11) But
   the two errors, though equally possible, are by no means equally
   important. For mathematical science, as such, is complete in its merely
   theoretical aspect; while moral science is valuable chiefly in its
   application to practice. It is in their concrete form that moral
   principles are adopted as guides of conduct and canons of judgment; and
   in this form they admit of various degrees of uncertainty or of
   positive error. But the difference between the highest and the lowest
   conception of moral duty is one of degree, not of kind; the interval
   between them is occupied by intermediate stages, separated from each
   other by minute and scarcely appreciable differences; and the very
   conception of a gradual progress in moral enlightenment implies the
   possibility of a further advance, of a more exalted intellect, and a
   more enlightened conscience. While we repudiate, as subversive of all
   morality, the theory which maintains that each man is the measure of
   his own moral acts; we must repudiate also, as subversive of all
   religion, the opposite theory, which virtually maintains that man may
   become the measure of the absolute Nature of God.

   God did not create Absolute Morality: it is coëternal with Himself; and
   it were blasphemy to say that there ever was a time when God was and
   Goodness was not. But God did create the human manifestation of
   morality, when He created the moral constitution of man, and placed him
   in those circumstances by which the eternal principles of right and
   wrong are modified in relation to the present life.^([215]12) For it is
   manifest, to take the simplest instances, that the sixth Commandment of
   the Decalogue, in its literal obligation, is relative to that state of
   things in which men are subject to death; and the seventh, to which
   there is marrying and giving in marriage; and the eighth, to that in
   which men possess temporal goods. It is manifest, to take a more
   general ground, that the very conception of moral obligation implies a
   superior authority, and an ability to transgress what that authority
   commands; that it implies a complex, and therefore a limited nature in
   the moral agent; the intellect, which apprehends the duty, being
   distinct from the will, which obeys or disobeys. That there is a higher
   and unchangeable principle embodied in these forms, we have abundant
   reason to believe; and yet we cannot, from our present point of view,
   examine the same duties apart from their human element, and separate
   that which is relative and peculiar to man in this life from that which
   is absolute and common to all moral beings. In this respect, again, our
   moral conceptions offer a remarkable analogy to the cognate phenomena
   on which other systems of necessary truth are based. Take, for example,
   the idea of Time, the foundation of the science of Number. We find no
   difficulty in conceiving that this present world was created at some
   definite point of time; but we are unable to conceive the same moment
   as the creation of Time itself. On the contrary, we are compelled to
   believe that there was a time before as well as after the creation of
   the world: that the being of God reaches back in boundless duration
   beyond the moment when He said, Let there be light; and there was
   light. But when we attempt to unite this conviction with another,
   necessary to the completion of the thought;--when we try to conceive
   God as an Infinite Being, existing in continuous duration,--the
   contradictions, which beset us on every side, admonish us that we have
   transcended the boundary within which alone human thought is possible.
   And so, too, while we are competent to believe that the creation of
   man's moral nature was not identical with the creation of morality
   itself;--that the great principles of all that is holy and righteous
   existed in God, before they assumed their finite form in the heart of
   man;--we still find ourselves baffled in every attempt to conceive an
   infinite moral nature, or its condition, an infinite personality: we
   find ourselves compelled to walk by faith, and not by sight;--to admit
   that we have knowledge enough to guide us in our moral training here;
   but not enough to unveil the hidden things of God.^([216]13)

   In so far, then, as Morality, in its human character, depends upon
   conditions not coëternal with God, but created along with man, in so
   far we are not justified in regarding the occasional suspension of
   human duties, by the same authority which enacted them, as a violation
   of the immutable principles of morality itself. That there are limits,
   indeed, within which alone this rule can be safely applied;--that there
   are doctrines and practices which carry on their front convincing proof
   that they cannot have been revealed or commanded by God;--that there
   are systems of religion which by this criterion may be shown to have
   sprung, not from divine appointment, but from human corruption,--is not
   for an instant denied. In my concluding Lecture, I shall endeavor to
   point out some of the conditions under which this kind of evidence is
   admissible. For the present, my argument is concerned, not with special
   and occasional commands, but with universal and perpetual doctrines;
   not with isolated facts recorded in sacred history, but with revealed
   truths, forming an integral portion of religious belief: In this point
   of view, I propose to apply the principle hitherto maintained, of the
   Limits of Religious Thought, to the examination of those doctrines of
   the Christian Faith which are sometimes regarded as containing
   something repugnant to the Moral Reason of man.

   The Atoning Sacrifice of Christ has been the mark assailed by various
   attacks of this kind; some of them not very consistent with each other,
   but all founded on some supposed incongruity between this doctrine and
   the moral attributes of the Divine Nature. By one critic, the doctrine
   is rejected because it is more consistent with the infinite mercy of
   God to pardon sin freely, without any atonement whatsoever.^([217]14)
   By another, because, from the unchangeable nature of God's laws, it is
   impossible that sin can be pardoned at all.^([218]15) A third maintains
   that it is unjust that the innocent should suffer for the sins of the
   guilty.^([219]16) A fourth is indignant at the supposition that God can
   be angry;^([220]17) while a fifth cannot see by what moral fitness the
   shedding of blood can do away with sin or its punishment.^([221]18) The
   principle which governs these and similar objections is, that we have a
   right to assume that there is, if not a perfect identity, at least an
   exact resemblance between the moral nature of man and that of God; that
   the laws and principles of infinite justice and mercy are but magnified
   images of those which are manifested on a finite scale;--that nothing
   can be compatible with the boundless goodness of God, which is
   incompatible with the little goodness of which man may be conscious in
   himself.

   The value of this principle, as an absolute criterion of religious
   truth, may be tested by the simple experiment of applying the same
   reasoning to an imaginary revelation constructed on the rational
   principles of some one of the objectors. Let us suppose, then, that,
   instead of the Christian doctrine of the Atonement, the Scriptures had
   told us of an absolute and unconditional pardon of sin, following upon
   the mere repentance of the sinner. It is easy to imagine how ready our
   reasoning theologians would be with their philosophical criticism,
   speculative or moral. Does it not, they might say, represent mall as
   influencing God,--the Finite as controlling, by the act of repentance,
   the unchangeable self-determinations of the Infinite? Does it not
   depict the Deity as acting in time, as influenced by motives and
   occasions, as subject to human feelings? Does it not tend to weaken our
   impression of the hatefulness of sin, and to encourage carelessness in
   the sinner, by the easy terms on which he is promised
   forgiveness?^([222]19) If it is un- worthy of God to represent Him as
   angry and needing to be propitiated, how can philosophy tolerate the
   conception that He is placable, and to be softened by repentance? And
   what moral fitness has repentance to do away with the guilt or
   punishment of a past transgression? Whatever moral fitness there exists
   between righteousness and God's favor, the same must exist between sin
   and God's anger: in whatever degree that which deserves punishment is
   not punished, in that degree God's justice is limited in its operation.
   A strictly moral theory requires, therefore, not free forgiveness, but
   an exactly graduated proportion between guilt and suffering, virtue and
   happiness.^([223]20) If, on the other hand, we maintain that there is
   no moral fitness in either case, we virtually deny the existence of a
   moral Deity at all: we make God indifferent to good and evil as such:
   we represent Him as rewarding and punishing arbitrarily and with
   respect of persons. The moral objection, in truth, so far as it has any
   weight at all, has no special application to the Christian doctrine: it
   lies against the entire supposition of the remission of sins on any
   terms and by any means: and if it has been more strongly urged by
   Rationalists against the Christian representation than against others,
   this is merely because the former has had the misfortune to provoke
   hostility by being found in the Bible.

   It is obvious indeed, on a moment's reflection, that the duty of man to
   forgive the trespasses of his neighbor, rests precisely upon those
   features of human nature which cannot by any analogy be regarded as
   representing an image of God.^([224]21) Man is not the author of the
   moral law: he is not, as man, the moral governor of his fellows: he has
   no authority, merely as man, to punish moral transgressions as such. It
   is not as sin, but as injury, that vice is a transgression against man:
   it is not that his holiness is outraged, but that his rights or his
   interests are impaired. The duty of forgiveness is imposed as a check,
   not upon the justice, but upon the selfishness of man: it is not
   designed to extinguish his indignation against vice, but to restrain
   his tendency to exaggerate his own personal injuries.^([225]22) The
   reasoner maintains, "it is a duty in man to forgive sins, therefore it
   must be morally fitting for God to forgive them also," overlooks the
   fact that this duty is binding upon man: on account of the weakness and
   ignorance and sinfulness of his nature; that he is bound to forgive, as
   one who himself needs forgiveness; as one whose weakness renders him
   liable to suffering; as one whose self-love is ever ready to arouse his
   passions and pervert his judgment.

   Nor yet would the advocates of the Moral Reason gain anything in
   Theology by the substitution of a rigid system of reward and
   punishment, in which nothing is forgiven, but every act meets with its
   appropriate recompense. We have only to suppose that this were the
   doctrine of Revelation, to imagine the outcry with which it would be
   assailed. "It is moral," the objector might urge, "only in the harsher
   and less amiable features of human morality: it gives us a God whom we
   may fear, but whom we cannot love; who has given us affections with
   which He has no sympathy, and passions for whose consequences He allows
   no redress: who created man liable to fall, and placed him in a world
   of temptations, knowing that he would fall, and purposing to take
   advantage of his frailty to the utmost." Criticisms of this kind may be
   imagined without number;--nay, they are actually found in more than one
   modern work, the writers of which have erroneously imagined that they
   were assailing the real teaching of Scripture.^([226]23) Verily, this
   vaunted Moral Reason is a "Lesbian rule."^([227]24) It may be applied
   with equal facility to the criticism of every possible scheme of Divine
   Providence; and therefore we may be permitted to suspect that it is not
   entitled to implicit confidence against any.^([228]25)

   The endless controversy concerning Predestination and Free Will,
   whether viewed in its speculative or in its moral aspect, is but
   another example of the hardihood of human ignorance. The question, as I
   have observed before, has its philosophical as well as its theological
   aspect: it has no difficulties peculiar to itself: it is but a special
   form of the fundamental mystery of the coëxistence of the Infinite and
   the Finite. Yet, with this mystery meeting and baffling human reason at
   every turn, theologians have not scrupled to trace in their petty
   channels the exact flow and course of Infinite wisdom; one school
   boldly maintaining that even Omniscience itself has no knowledge of
   contingent events; another asserting, with equal confidence, that God's
   knowledge must be a restraint on man's freedom.^([229]26) If philosophy
   offers for the moment an apparent escape from the dilemma, by
   suggesting that God's knowledge is not properly foreknowledge, as
   having no relation to time;^([230]27) the suggestion itself is one
   which can neither be verified as a truth, nor even intelligibly
   exhibited as a thought; and the Rationalist evades the solution by
   shifting the ground of attack, and retorts that Prophecy at least is
   anterior to the event which it foretells; and that a prediction of
   human actions is irreconcilable with freedom.^([231]28) But the whole
   meaning of the difficulty vanishes, as soon as we acknowledge that the
   Infinite is not an object of human thought at all. There can be no
   consciousness of a relation, whether of agreement or of opposition,
   where there is not a consciousness of both the objects related. That a
   man, by his own power, should be able with certainty to foretell the
   future, implies that the laws of that future are fixed and
   unchangeable; for man can only foresee particular occurrences through a
   knowledge of the general law on which they depend. But is this relation
   of cause to effect, of law to its consequences, really a knowledge or
   an ignorance? Is the causal relation itself a law of things, or only a
   human mode of representing phenomena? Supposing it were possible for
   man, in some other state of intelligence, to foresee a future event
   without foreseeing it as the result of a law,--would that knowledge be
   a higher or a lower one than he at present possesses?--would it be the
   removal of some reality which he now sees, or only of some limitation
   under which he now sees it?^([232]29) Man can only foresee what is
   certain; and from his point of view, the foreknowledge depends upon the
   certainty. But, apart from the human conditions of thought, in relation
   to a more perfect intelligence, can we venture to say, even as regards
   temporal succession, whether necessity is the condition of
   foreknowledge, or foreknowledge of necessity, or whether indeed
   necessity itself has any existence at all?^([233]30) May not the whole
   scheme of Law and Determinism indicate a weakness, rather than a power
   of the human mind; and are there not facts of consciousness which give
   some support to this conjecture?^([234]31) Can anything be necessary to
   an intellect whose thought creates its own objects? Can any necessity
   of things determine the cognitions of the Absolute Mind, even if those
   cognitions take place in succession to each other? These questions
   admit of no certain answer; but the very inability to answer them
   proves that dogmatic decisions on either side are the decisions of
   ignorance, not of knowledge.

   But the problem, be its difficulties and their origin what they may, is
   not peculiar to Theology, and receives no additional complication from
   its position in Holy Writ. The very same question may be discussed in a
   purely metaphysical form, by merely substituting the universal law of
   causation for the universal knowledge of God. What is the meaning and
   value of that law of the human mind which apparently compels us to
   think that every event whatever has its determining cause? And how is
   that conviction reconcilable with a liberty in the human will to choose
   between two alternatives? The answer is substantially the same as
   before. The freedom of the will is a positive fact of our
   consciousness: as for the principle of causality, we know not whence it
   is, nor what it is. We know not whether it is a law of things, or a
   mode of human representation; whether it denotes an impotence or a
   power; whether it is innate or acquired. We know not in what the causal
   relation itself consists; nor by what authority we are warranted in
   extending its significance beyond the temporal sequence which suggests
   it and the material phenomena in which that sequence is undisturbed.

   And is not the same conviction of the ignorance of man, and of his
   rashness in the midst of ignorance, forced upon us by the spectacle of
   the arbitrary and summary decisions of human reason on the most
   mysterious as well as the most awful of God's revealed judgments
   against sin,--the sentence of Eternal Punishment? We know not what is
   the relation of Sin to Infinite Justice. We know not under what
   conditions, consistently with the freedom of man, the final restoration
   of the impenitent sinner is possible; nor how, without such a
   restoration, guilt and misery can ever cease. We know not whether the
   future punishment of sin will be inflicted by way of natural
   consequence or of supernatural visitation; whether it will be produced
   from within or inflicted from without. We know not how man can be
   rescued from sin and suffering without the coöperation of his own will;
   nor what means can coöperate with that will, beyond those which are
   offered to all of us during our state of trial.^([235]32) It becomes us
   to speak cautiously and reverently on a matter of which God has
   revealed so little, and that little of such awful moment; but if we may
   be permitted to criticize the arguments of the opponents of this
   doctrine with the same freedom with which they have criticized the ways
   of God, we may re, mark that the whole apparent force of the moral
   objection rests upon two purely gratuitous assumptions. It is assumed,
   in the first place, that God's punishment of sin in the world to come
   is so far analogous to man's administration of punishment in this
   world, that it will take place as a special infliction, not as a
   natural consequence. And it is assumed, in the second place, that
   punishment will be inflicted solely with reference to the sins
   committed during the earthly life;--that the guilt will continue
   finite, while the misery is prolonged to infinity.^([236]33) Are we
   then so sure, it may be asked, that there can be no sin beyond the
   grave? Can any immortal soul incur God's wrath and condemnation, only
   so long as it is united to a mortal body? With as much reason might we
   assert that the angels are incapable of obedience to God, that the
   devils are incapable of rebellion. What if the sin perpetuates
   itself,--if the prolonged misery be the offspring of the prolonged
   guilt?^([237]34)

   Against this it is urged that sin cannot forever be triumphant against
   God.^([238]35) As if the whole mystery of iniquity were contained in
   the words for ever! The real riddle of existence--the problem which
   confounds all philosophy, aye, and all religion too, so far as religion
   is a thing of man's reason--is the fact that evil exists at all; not
   that it exists for a longer or a shorter duration. Is not God
   infinitely wise and holy and powerful now? and does not sin exist along
   with that infinite holiness and wisdom and power? Is God to become more
   holy, more wise, more powerful hereafter; and must evil be annihilated
   to make room for His perfections to expand? Does the infinity of His
   eternal nature ebb and flow with every increase or diminution in the
   sum of human guilt and misery? Against this immovable barrier of the
   existence of evil, the waves of philosophy have dashed themselves
   unceasingly since the birthday of human thought, and have retired
   broken and powerless, without displacing the minutest fragment of the
   stubborn rock, without softening one feature of its dark and rugged
   surface.^([239]36) We may be told that evil is a privation, or a
   negation, or a partial aspect of the universal good, or some other
   equally unmeaning abstraction; whilst all the while our own hearts bear
   testimony to its fearful reality, to its direct antagonism to every
   possible form of good.^([240]37) But this mystery, vast and inscrutable
   as it is, is but one aspect of a more general problem; it is but the
   moral form of the ever-recurring secret of the Infinite. How the
   Infinite and the Finite, in any form of antagonism or other relation,
   can exist together; how infinite power can coëxist with finite
   activity; how infinite wisdom can coëxist with finite contingency; how
   infinite goodness can coëxist with finite evil; how the Infinite can
   exist in any manner without exhausting the universe of reality;--this
   is the riddle which Infinite Wisdom alone can solve, the problem whose
   very conception belongs only to that Universal Knowing which fills and
   embraces the Universe of Being. When philosophy can answer this
   question; when she can even state intelligibly the notions which its
   terms involve,--then, and not till then, she may be entitled to demand
   a solution of the far smaller difficulties which she finds in revealed
   religion;--or rather, she will have solved them already; for from this
   they all proceed, and to this they all ultimately return.

   The reflections which this great and terrible mystery of Divine
   Judgment have suggested, receive perhaps some further support when we
   contemplate it in another aspect, and one more legitimately within the
   province of human reason; that is to say, in its analogy to the actual
   constitution and course of nature. "The Divine moral government which
   religion teaches us," says Bishop Butler, "implies that the consequence
   of vice shall be misery, in some future state, by the righteous
   judgment of God. That such consequent punishment shall take effect by
   His appointment, is necessarily implied. But, as it is not in any sort
   to be supposed that we are made acquainted with all the ends or
   reasons, for which it is fit future punishment should be inflicted, or
   why God has appointed such and such consequent misery should follow
   vice; and as we are altogether in the dark, how or in what manner it
   shall follow, by what immediate occasions, or by the instrumentality of
   what means,--there is no absurdity in supposing it may follow in a way
   analogous to that in which many miseries follow such and such courses
   of action at present: poverty, sickness, infamy, untimely death from
   diseases, death from the hands of civil justice. There is no absurdity
   in supposing future punishment may follow wickedness of course, as we
   speak, or in the way of natural consequence from God's original
   constitution of the world; from the nature He has given us, and from
   the condition in which He places us; or in a like manner as a person
   rashly trifling upon a precipice, in the way of natural consequence,
   falls down; in the way of natural consequence, breaks his limbs,
   suppose; in the way of natural consequence of this, without help
   perishes."^([241]38)

   And if we may be permitted to extend the same analogy from the
   constitution of external nature to that of the human mind, may we not
   trace something not wholly unlike the irrevocable sentence of the
   future, in that dark and fearful, yet too certain law of our nature, by
   which sin and misery ever tend to perpetuate themselves; by which evil
   habits gather strength with every fresh indulgence, till it is no
   longer, humanly speaking, in the power of the sinner to shake off the
   burden which his own deeds have laid upon him? In that mysterious
   condition of the depraved will, compelled, and yet free,--the slave of
   sinful habit, yet responsible for every act of sin, and gathering
   deeper condemnation as the power of amendment grows less and less,--may
   we not see some possible foreshadowing of the yet deeper guilt and the
   yet more hopeless misery of the worm that dieth not, and the fire that
   is not quenched? The fact, awful as it is, is one to which our every
   (lay's experience bears witness: and who shall say that the invisible
   things of God may not, in this as in other instances, be shadowed forth
   to us in the things that are seen?

   The same argument from analogy is indeed applicable to every one of the
   difficulties which Rationalism professes to discover in the revealed
   ways of God's dealings with man. The Fall of Adam, and the inherited
   corruption of his posterity, find their parallel in the liability to
   sin which remains unextinguished throughout man's moral progress; and
   in that mysterious, though certain dispensation of Providence, which
   ordains that not only bodily taints and infirmities, but even moral
   dispositions and tendencies should, in many instances, descend from
   father to son; and which permits the child of sinful parents to be
   depraved by evil example, before he knows how, by his own reason,
   clearly to discern between right and wrong; before lie has strength, of
   his own will, to refuse the evil and choose the good.^([242]39) There
   is a parallel, too, in that strange, yet too familiar fact, of vice
   persisted in, with the clearest and strongest conviction of its
   viciousness and wretchedness; and the skepticism which denies that man,
   if created sinless, could so easily have fallen from innocence, finds
   its philosophical counterpart in the paradox of the ancient moralist,
   who maintained that conscious sin is impossible, because nothing can be
   stronger than knowledge.^([243]40) Justification by faith through the
   merits of Christ is at least in harmony with that course of things
   established by Divine Providence in this world; in which so many
   benefits, which we cannot procure for ourselves or deserve by any merit
   of our own, are obtained for us by the instrumentality of others; and
   in which we are so often compelled, as an indispensable condition of
   obtaining the benefit, to trust in the power and good-will of those
   whom we have never tried, and to believe in the efficacy of means whose
   manner of working we know not.^([244]41) The operations of Divine
   Grace, influencing, yet not necessitating, the movements of the human
   soul, find their corresponding fact and their corresponding mystery in
   the determinations of the Will;--in that Freedom to do or leave undone,
   so certain in fact, so inexplicable in theory, which consists neither
   in absolute indifference nor in absolute subjection; which is acted
   upon and influenced by motives, yet in its turn acts upon and controls
   their influences, prevented by them, and yet working with
   them.^([245]42) But it is unnecessary to pursue further an argument
   which, in all its essential features, has already been fully exhibited
   by a philosopher whose profound and searching wisdom has answered by
   anticipation nearly every cavil of the latest form of Rationalism, no
   less than those of his own day. We may add here and there a detail of
   application, as the exigencies of controversy may suggest; but the
   principle of the whole, and its most important consequences, have been
   established and worked out more than a century ago, in the unanswerable
   argument of Butler.

   The warning which his great work contains against "that idle and not
   very innocent employment of forming imaginary models of a world, and
   schemes of governing it,"^([246]43) is as necessary now as then, as
   applicable to moral as to speculative theories. Neither with regard to
   the physical nor to the moral world, is man capable of constructing a
   Cosmogony; and those Babels of Reason, which Philosophy has built for
   itself, under the names of Rational Theories of Religion, and
   Criticisms of every Revelation, are but the successors of those elder
   children of chaos and night, which, with no greater knowledge, but with
   less presumption, sought to describe the generation. of the visible
   universe. It is no disparagement of the value and authority of the
   Moral Reason in its regulative capacity, within its proper sphere of
   human action, if we refuse to exalt it to the measure and standard of
   the Absolute and Infinite Goodness of God. The very Philosopher whose
   writings have most contributed to establish the supreme authority of
   Conscience in man, is also the one who has pointed out most clearly the
   existence of analogous moral difficulties in nature and in religion,
   and the true answer to both,--the admission that God's Government,
   natural as well as spiritual, is a scheme imperfectly comprehended.

   In His Moral Attributes, no less than in the rest of His Infinite
   Being, God's judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out.
   [83] While He manifests Himself clearly as a Moral Governor and
   Legislator, by the witness of the Moral Law which He has established in
   the hearts of men, we cannot help feeling, at the same time, that that
   Law, grand as it is, is no measure of His Grandeur, that He Himself is
   beyond it, though not opposed to it, distinct, though not alien from
   it. We feel that He who planted in man's conscience that stern,
   unyielding Imperative of Duty, must Himself be true and righteous
   altogether; that He from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and
   all just works do proceed, must Himself be more holy, more good, more
   just than these. But when we try to realize in thought this sure
   conviction of our faith, we find that here, as everywhere, the Finite
   cannot fathom the Infinite; that, while in our hearts we believe, yet
   our thoughts at times are sore troubled. It is consonant to the whole
   analogy of our earthly state of trial, that, in this as in other
   features of God's Providence, we should meet with things impossible to
   understand and difficult to believe; by which reason is baffled and
   faith tried;--acts whose purpose we see not; dispensations whose wisdom
   is above us; thoughts which are not our thoughts, and ways which are
   not our ways. In these things we hear, as it were, the same loving
   voice which spoke to the wondering disciple of old: "What I do, thou
   knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter." [84] The luminary by
   whose influence the ebb and flow of man's moral being is regulated,
   moves around and along with man's little world, in a regular and
   bounded orbit; one side, and one side only, looks downward upon its
   earthly centre; the other, which we see not, is ever turned upwards to
   the all-surrounding Infinite. And those tides have their seasons of
   rise and fall, their places of strength and weakness; and that light
   waxes and wanes with the growth or decay of man's mental and moral and
   religious culture; and its borrowed rays seem at times to shine as with
   their own lustre, in rivalry, even in opposition, to the source from
   which they emanate. Yet is that light still but a faint and partial
   reflection of the hidden glories of the Sun of Righteousness, waiting
   but the brighter illumination of His presence, to fade and be swallowed
   up in the full blaze of the heaven kindling around it;--not cast down
   indeed from its orbit, nor shorn of its true brightness and influence,
   but still felt and acknowledged in its real existence and power, in the
   memory of the past discipline, in the product of the present
   perfectness, though now distinct no more, but vanishing from sight to
   be made one with the Glory that beams from the "Father of lights, with
   whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." [85]

LECTURE VIII.

   THE WORKS WHICH THE FATHER HATH GIVEN ME TO FINISH, THE SAME WORKS THAT
   I DO, BEAR WITNESS OF ME, THAT THE FATHER HATH SENT ME.--ST. JOHN V.
   36.

   TO construct a complete Criticism of any Revelation, it is necessary
   that the Critic should be in possession of a perfect Philosophy of the
   Infinite. For, except on the supposition that we possess an exact
   knowledge of the whole Nature of God, such as only that Philosophy can
   furnish, we cannot know for certain what are the purposes which God
   intends to accomplish by means of Revelation, and what are the
   instruments by which those purposes may be best carried out. If then it
   can be shown, as I have attempted to show in the previous Lectures,
   that the attainment of a Philosophy of the Infinite is utterly
   impossible under the existing laws of human thought, it follows that it
   is not by means of philosophical criticism that the claims of a
   supposed Revelation can be adequately tested. We are thus compelled to
   seek another field for the right use of Reason in religious questions;
   and what that field is, it will not be difficult to determine. To
   Reason, rightly employed, within its proper limits and on its proper
   objects, our Lord himself and his Apostles openly appealed in proof of
   their divine mission; and the same proof has been unhesitatingly
   claimed by the defenders of Christianity in all subsequent ages. In
   other words, the legitimate object of a rational criticism of revealed
   religion, is not to be found in the contents of that religion, but in
   its evidences.

   At first sight it may appear as if this distinction involved no real
   difference; for the contents of a revelation, it might be objected, are
   included among its evidences. In one sense, no doubt they are; but that
   very inclusion gives them a totally different significance and weight
   from that to which they lay claim when considered as the basis of a
   philosophical criticism. In the one case, they are judged by their
   conformity to the supposed nature and purposes of God; in the other, by
   their adaptation to the actual circumstances and wants of man. In the
   one case they are regarded as furnishing a single and a certain
   criterion; for on the supposition that our reason is competent to
   determine, from our knowledge of the Divine Nature, what the
   characteristics of a true Revelation ought to be, we are entitled, by
   virtue of that criterion alone, to reject without hesitation whatever
   does not satisfy its requirements. In the other case, they are regarded
   as furnishing only one probable presumption out of many;--a presumption
   which may confirm and be confirmed by coinciding testimony from other
   sources, or, on the contrary, may be outweighed, when we come to
   balance probabilities, by conflicting evidence on the other side.

   The practical conclusion, which may be deduced from the whole previous
   survey of the Limits of Religious Thought, is this: that if no one
   faculty of the human mind is competent to convey a direct knowledge of
   the Absolute and the Infinite, no one faculty is entitled to claim
   preëminence over the rest, as furnishing especially the criterion of
   the truth or falsehood of a supposed Revelation. There are presumptions
   to be drawn from the internal character of the doctrines which the
   revelation contains: there are presumptions to be drawn from the facts
   connected with its first promulgation: there are presumptions to be
   drawn from its subsequent history and the effects which it has produced
   among mankind. But the true evidence, for or against the religion, is
   not to be found in any one of these taken singly and exclusively; but
   in the resultant of all, fairly examined and compared together; the
   apparently conflicting evidences being balanced against each other, and
   the apparently concurring evidences estimated by their united efficacy.

   A truth so obvious as this may be thought hardly worth announcing as
   the result of an elaborate inquiry. But the whole history of religious
   controversy bears witness that, however evident in theory, there is no
   truth m6re liable to be neglected in practice. The defenders of
   Christianity are not altogether free from the charge of insisting
   exclusively or preëminently upon some one alone of its evidences: the
   assailants, under the influence of a still more exclusive reäction,
   have assumed that a method which fails to accomplish everything has
   succeeded in accomplishing nothing; and, flying at once to the opposite
   extreme, have in their turn appealed to some one infallible criterion,
   as constituting a royal road to philosophical unbelief.

   In the present day we are feeling the pernicious effects of a reaction
   of this kind. Because the writings of Paley and his followers in the
   last generation laid a principal stress on the direct historical
   evidences of Christianity, we meet now with an antagonist school of
   writers, who perpetually assure us that history has nothing whatever to
   do with religion;^([247]1) that an external revelation of religious
   truth is impossible;^([248]2) that we may learn all that is essential
   to the Gospel by inward and spiritual evidence only.^([249]3) In the
   spirit of the Pharisees of old, who said, "This man is not of God,
   because he keepeth not the Sabbath day," [86] we are now told that the
   doctrine must in all cases prove the miracles, and not the miracles the
   doctrine;^([250]4) that the external evidence of miracles is entirely
   useless for the support of the religious philosophy of Christ;^([251]5)
   that man no more needs a miraculous revelation of things pertaining to
   religion than of things pertaining to agriculture or
   manufactures.^([252]6) And, as is usually the case in such reactions,
   the last state has become worse than the first;--a slight comparative
   neglect of the internal evidence on the one side has been replaced by
   an utter repudiation of all external evidence on the other; a trifling
   disproportion in the edifice of the Christian Faith has been remedied
   by the entire removal of some of its main pillars of support. The
   crying evil of the present day in religious controversy is the neglect
   or contempt of the external evidences of Christianity: the first step
   towards the establishment of a sound religious philosophy must consist
   in the restoration of those evidences to their true place in the
   Theological system.

   The evidence derived from the internal character of a religion,
   whatever may be its value within its proper limits, is, as regards the
   divine origin of the religion, purely negative. It may prove in certain
   cases (though even here the argument requires much caution in its
   employment) that a religion has not come from God; but it is in no case
   sufficient to prove that it has come from Him.^([253]7) For the
   doctrines revealed must either be such as are within the power of man's
   natural reason to verify, or such as are beyond it. In the former case,
   the reason which is competent to verify may also be competent to
   discover: the doctrine is tested by its conformity to the conclusions
   of human philosophy; and the wisdom which sits in judgment on the truth
   of a doctrine must itself be presumed to have an equal power of
   discerning the truth. In the latter case, where the doctrine is beyond
   the power of human reason to discover, it can be accepted only as
   resting on the authority of the teacher who proclaims it; and that
   authority itself must then be guaranteed by the external evidence of a
   superhuman mission. To advance a step beyond the merely negative
   argument, it is necessary that the evidence contained in the character
   of the doctrine itself should be combined with that derived from the
   exterior history. When, for example, the Divine Origin of Christianity
   is maintained, on the ground of its vast moral superiority to all
   Heathen systems of Ethics; or on that of the improbability that such a
   system could have been conceived by a Galilean peasant among the
   influences of the contemporary Judaism; the argument is legitimate and
   powerful: but its positive force depends not merely on the internal
   character of the doctrine, but principally on its relation to certain
   external facts.^([254]8)

   And even the negative argument, which concludes from the character of
   the contents of a religion that it cannot have come from God, however
   legitimate within its proper limits, is one which requires considerable
   caution in the application. The lesson to be learnt from an examination
   of the Limits of Religious Thought, is not that man's judgments are
   worthless in relation to divine things, but that they are fallible; and
   the probability of error in any particular case can never be fairly
   estimated, without giving their full weight to all collateral
   considerations. We are indeed bound to believe that a Revelation given
   by God can never contain anything that is really unwise or unrighteous;
   but we are not always capable of estimating exactly the wisdom or
   righteousness of particular doctrines or precepts. And we are bound to
   bear in mind that exactly in proportion to the strength of the
   remaining evidence for the divine origin of a religion, is the
   probability that we may be mistaken in supposing this or that portion
   of its contents to be unworthy of God. Taken in conjunction, the two
   arguments may confirm or correct each other: taken singly and
   absolutely, each may vitiate the result which should follow from their
   joint application. We do not certainly know the exact nature and
   operation of the moral attributes of God; we can but infer and
   conjecture from what we know of the moral attributes of man: and the
   analogy between the Finite and the Infinite can never be so perfect as
   to preclude all possibility of error in the process. But the
   possibility becomes almost a certainty, when any one human faculty is
   elevated by itself into an authoritative criterion of religious truth,
   without regard to those collateral evidences by which its decisions may
   be modified and corrected.

   "The human mind," says a writer of the present day, "is competent to
   sit in moral and spiritual judgment on a professed revelation; and to
   decide, if the case seems to require it, in the following tone: This
   doctrine attributes to God, that which we should all call harsh, cruel,
   or unjust in man: it is therefore intrinsically inadmissible." . . .
   "In fact," he continues, "all Christian apostles and missionaries, like
   the Hebrew prophets, have always refuted Paganism by direct attacks on
   its immoral and unspiritual doctrines; and have appealed to the
   consciences of heathens, as competent to decide in the
   controversy."^([255]9) Now, an appeal of this kind may be legitimate or
   not, according to the purpose for which it is made, and the manner in
   which it is applied. The primary and proper employment of man's moral
   sense, as of his other faculties, is not speculative, but regulative.
   It is not designed to tell us what are the absolute and immutable
   principles of Right, as existing in the eternal nature of God; but to
   discern those relative and temporary manifestations of them, which are
   necessary for human training in this present life. But if morality, in
   its human manifestation, contains a relative and temporary, as well as
   an absolute and eternal element, an occasional suspension of the human
   Law is by no means to be confounded with a violation of the divine
   Principle. We can only partially judge of the Moral government of God,
   on the assumption that there is an analogy between the divine nature
   and the human: and in proportion as the analogy recedes from perfect
   likeness, the decisions of the human reason necessarily become more and
   more doubtful. The primary and direct inquiry, which human reason is
   entitled to make concerning a professed revelation is,--how far does it
   tend to promote or to hinder the moral discipline of man. It is but a
   secondary and indirect question, and one very liable to mislead, to ask
   how far it is compatible with the Infinite Goodness of God.

   Thus, for example, it is one thing to condemn a religion on account of
   the habitual observance of licentious or inhuman rites of worship, and
   another to pronounce judgment on isolated acts, historically recorded
   as having been done by divine command, but not perpetuated in precepts
   for the imitation of posterity. The former are condemned for their
   regulative character, as contributing to the perpetual corruption of
   mankind; the latter are condemned on speculative grounds, as
   inconsistent with our preconceived notions of the character of God.
   "There are some particular precepts in Scripture," says Bishop Butler,
   "given to particular persons, requiring actions, which would be immoral
   and vicious, were it not for such precepts. But it is easy to see, that
   all these are of such a kind, as that the precept changes the whole
   nature of the case and of the action; and both constitutes and shows
   that not to be unjust or immoral, which, prior to the precept, must
   have appeared, and really have been so: which may well be, since none
   of these precepts are contrary to immutable morality. If it were
   commanded to cultivate the principles and act from the spirit of
   treachery, ingratitude, cruelty; the command would not alter the nature
   of the case or of the action, in any of these instances. But it is
   quite otherwise in precepts which require only the doing an external
   action; for instance, taking away the property or life of any. For men
   have no right to either life or property, but what arises solely from
   the grant of God: when this grant is revoked, they cease to have any
   right at all in either: and when this revocation is made known, as
   surely it is possible it may be, it must cease to be unjust to deprive
   them of either. And though a course of external acts, which without
   command would be immoral, must make an immoral habit; yet a few
   detached commands have no such natural tendency. . . . There seems no
   difficulty at all in these precepts, but what arises from their being
   offences: i. e. from their being liable to be perverted, as indeed they
   are, by wicked designing men, to serve the most horrid purposes; and,
   perhaps, to mislead the weak and enthusiastic. And objections from this
   head are not objections against revelation; but against the whole
   notion of religion, as a trial; and against the general constitution of
   nature."^([256]10)

   There is indeed an obvious analogy between these temporary suspensions
   of the laws of moral obligation and that corresponding suspension of
   the laws of natural phenomena which constitutes our ordinary conception
   of a Miracle. So much so, indeed, that the former might without
   impropriety be designated as Moral Miracles. In both, the Almighty is
   regarded as suspending, for special purposes, not the eternal laws
   which constitute His own absolute Nature, but the created laws, which
   he imposed at a certain time upon a particular portion of his
   creatures. Both are isolated and rare in their occurrence; and
   apparently, from the nature of the case, must be so, in order to unite
   harmoniously with the normal manifestations of God's government of the
   world. A perpetual series of physical miracles would destroy that
   confidence in the regularity of the course of nature, which is
   indispensable to the cultivation of man's intellectual and productive
   energies: a permanent suspension of practical duties would be similarly
   prejudicial to the cultivation of his moral character. But the isolated
   character of both classes of phenomena removes the objection which
   might otherwise be brought against them on this account: and this
   objection is the only one which can legitimately be urged, on
   philosophical grounds, against the conception of such cases as
   possible; as distinguished from the historical evidence, which may be
   adduced for or against their actual occurrence.

   Even within its own legitimate province, an argument of this kind may
   have more or less weight, varying from the lowest presumption to the
   highest moral certainty, according to the nature of the offence which
   we believe ourselves to have detected, and the means which we possess
   of estimating its character or consequences. It is certain that we are
   not competent judges of the Absolute Nature of God: it is not certain
   that we are competent judges, in all cases, of what is best fitted for
   the moral discipline of man. But granting to the above argument its
   full value in this relation, it is still important to remember that we
   are dealing, not with demonstrative but with probable evidence; not
   with a single line of reasoning, but with a common focus, to which many
   and various rays converge; that we have not solved the entire problem,
   but only obtained one of the elements contributing to its solution. And
   the combined result of all these elements is by no means identical with
   the sum of their separate effects. The image, hitherto employed, of a
   balance of probabilities, is, in one respect at least, very inadequate
   to express the character of Christian evidence. It may be used with
   some propriety to express the provisional stage of the inquiry, while
   we are still uncertain to which side the evidence inclines; but it
   becomes inapplicable as soon as our decision is made. For the
   objections urged against a religion are not like the weights in a
   scale, which retain their full value, even when outweighed on the other
   side;--on the contrary, they become absolutely worthless, as soon as we
   are convinced that there is superior evidence to prove that the
   religion is true. We may not say, for example, that certain parts of
   the Christian scheme are unwise or unrighteous, though outweighed by
   greater acts of righteousness and wisdom;--we are bound to believe that
   we were mistaken from the first in supposing them to be unwise or
   unrighteous at all. In a matter of which we are so ignorant and so
   liable to be deceived, the objection which fails to prove everything
   proves nothing: from him that hath not, is taken away even that which
   he seemeth to have. And on the other hand, the objection which really
   proves anything proves everything. If the teaching of Christ is in any
   one thing not the teaching of God, it is in all things the teaching of
   man: its doctrines are subject to all the imperfections inseparable
   from man's sinfulness and ignorance: its effects must be such as can
   fully be accounted for as the results of man's wisdom, with all its
   weakness and all its error.

   Here then is the issue, which the wavering disciple is bound seriously
   to consider. Taking into account the various questions whose answers,
   on the one side or the other, form the sum total of Evidences for or
   against the claims of the Christian Faith;--the genuineness and
   authenticity of the documents; the judgment and good faith of the
   writers; the testimony to the actual occurrence of prophecies and
   miracles, and their relation to the religious teaching with which they
   are connected; the character of the Teacher Himself, that one protrait,
   which, in its perfect purity and holiness and beauty, stands alone and
   unapproached in human history or human fiction; those rites and
   ceremonies of the elder Law, so significant as typical of Christ, so
   strange and meaningless without Him; those predictions of the promised
   Messiah, whose obvious meaning is rendered still more manifest by the
   futile ingenuity which strives to pervert them;^([257]11) the history
   of the rise and progress of Christianity, and its comparison with that
   of other religions; the ability or inability of human means to bring
   about the results which it actually accomplished; its antagonism to the
   current ideas of the age and country of its origin; its effects as a
   system on the moral and social condition of subsequent generations of
   mankind; its fitness to satisfy the wants and console the sufferings of
   human nature; the character of those by whom it was first promulgated
   and received; the sufferings which attested the sincerity of their
   convictions; the comparative trustworthiness of ancient testimony and
   modern conjecture; the mutual contradictions of conflicting theories of
   unbelief, and the inadequacy of all of them to explain the facts for
   which they are bound to account;--taking all these and similar
   questions into full consideration, are you prepared to affirm, as the
   result of the whole inquiry, that Jesus of Nazareth was an impostor, or
   an enthusiast, or a mythical figment; and his disciples crafty and
   designing, or well-meaning, but deluded men? For be assured, that
   nothing short of this is the conclusion which you must maintain, if you
   reject one jot or one tittle of the whole doctrine of Christ. Either He
   was what He proclaimed Himself to be,--the incarnate Son of God, the
   Divine Saviour of a fallen world--and if so, we may not divide God's
   Revelation, and dare to put asunder what He has joined together,--or
   the civilized world for eighteen centuries has been deluded by a
   cunningly devised fable; and He from whom that fable came has turned
   that world from darkness to light, from Satan to God, with a lie in His
   right hand.

   Many who would shrink with horror from the idea of rejecting Christ
   altogether, will yet speak and act as if they were at liberty to set up
   for themselves an eclectic Christianity; separating the essential from
   the superfluous portions of Christ's teaching; deciding for themselves
   how much is permanent and necessary for all men, and how much is
   temporary and designed only for a particular age and people.^([258]12)
   Yet if Christ is indeed God manifest in the flesh, it is surely
   scarcely less impious to attempt to improve His teaching, than to
   reject it altogether. Nay, in one respect it is more so; for it is to
   acknowledge a doctrine as the revelation of God, and at the same time
   to proclaim that it is interior to the wisdom of man. That it may
   indeed come, and has come, within the purposes of God's Providence, to
   give to mankind a Revelation partly at least designed for a temporary
   purpose, and for a limited portion of mankind;--a Law in which
   something was permitted to the hardness of men's hearts, [87] and much
   was designed but as a shadow of things to come; [88] --this we know, to
   whom a more perfect Revelation has been given. But to admit that God
   may make His own Revelation more perfect from time to time, is very
   different from admitting that human reason, by its own knowledge, is
   competent to separate the perfect from the imperfect, and to construct
   for itself an absolute religion out of the fragments of an incomplete
   Revelation. The experiment has been tried under the elder and less
   perfect dispensation; but the result can hardly be considered so
   successful as to encourage a repetition of the attempt. The
   philosophical improvement of the Hebrew Scriptures produced, not the
   Sermon on the Mount, but the Creed of the Sadducee. The ripened
   intelligence of the Jewish people, instructed, as modern critics would
   assure us, by the enlightening influence of time, and by intercourse
   with foreign nations, bore fruit in a conclusion singularly coinciding
   with that of modern rationalism: "The Sadducees say that there is no
   resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit." [89] ^([259]13) And doubtless
   there were many then, as now, to applaud this wonderful discovery, as a
   proof that "religious truth is necessarily progressive, because our
   powers are progressive;"^([260]14) and to find a mythical or critical
   theory, to explain or to set aside those passages of Scripture which
   appeared to inculcate a contrary doctrine. Unfortunately for human
   wisdom, Prometheus himself needs a Prometheus. The lapse of time, as
   all history bears witness, is at least as fruitful in corruption as in
   enlightenment; and reason, when it has done its best, still needs a
   higher reason to decide between its conflicting theories, and to tell
   us which is the advanced, which the retrograde Theology.^([261]15)

   In one respect, indeed, this semi-rationalism, which admits the
   authority of Revelation up to a certain point and no further, rests on
   a far less reasonable basis than the firm belief which accepts the
   whole, or the complete unbelief which accepts nothing. For whatever may
   be the antecedent improbability which attaches to a miraculous
   narrative, as cornpared with one of ordinary events, it can affect only
   the narrative taken as a whole, and the entire series of miracles from
   the greatest to the least. If a single miracle is once admitted as
   supported by competent evidence, the entire history is at once removed
   from the ordinary calculations of more or less probability. One miracle
   is sufficient to show that the series of events, with which it is
   connected, is one which the Almighty has seen fit to mark by exceptions
   to the ordinary course of His Providence: and this being once granted,
   we have no a priori grounds to warrant us in asserting that the number
   of such exceptions ought to be larger or smaller. If any one miracle
   recorded in the Gospels--the Resurrection of Christ, for example--be
   once admitted as true, the remainder cease to have any antecedent
   improbability at all, and require no greater evidence to prove them
   than is needed for the most ordinary events of any other history. For
   the improbability, such as it is, reaches no further than to show that
   it is unlikely that God should work miracles at all; not that it is
   unlikely that He should work more than a certain number.

   Our right to criticize at all depends upon this one question: "What
   think ye of Christ? whose Son is He?" [90] What is it that constitutes
   our need of Christ? Is it a conviction of guilt and wretchedness, or a
   taste for Philosophy? Do we want a Redeemer to save us from our sins,
   or a moral Teacher to give us a plausible theory of human duties?
   Christ can be our Redeemer only if He is what He proclaims himself to
   be, the Son of God, sent into the world, that the world through Him
   might be saved. [91] If He is not this, His moral teaching began with
   falsehood, and was propagated by delusion. And if He is this, what but
   contempt and insult can be found in that half-allegiance which
   criticizes while it bows; which sifts and selects while it submits;
   which approves or rejects as its reason or its feelings or its nervous
   sensibilities may dictate; which condescends to acknowledge Him as the
   teacher of a dark age and an ignorant people; bowing the knee before
   Him, half in reverence, half in mockery, and crying, "Hail, King of the
   Jews!" If Christ is a mere human teacher, we of this nineteenth century
   can no more be Christians than we can be Platonists or Aristotelians.
   He belongs to that past which cannot repeat itself; His modes of
   thought are not ours; His difficulties are not ours; His needs are not
   ours. He may be our Teacher, but not our Master; for no man is master
   over the free thoughts of his fellow-men: we may learn from him, but we
   sit in judgment while we learn; we modify his teaching by the wisdom of
   later ages; we refuse the evil and choose the good. But remember that
   we can do this, only if Christ is a mere human teacher, or if we of
   these latter days have received a newer and a better revelation. If
   now, as of old, He speaks as never man spake; [92] --if God, who at
   sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers
   by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son,
   [93] --what remains for us to do but to cast down imaginations, and
   every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and
   to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ? [94]
   The witness which Christ offers of Himself either proves every thing or
   it proves nothing. No man has a right to say, "I will accept Christ as
   I like, and reject him as I like; I will follow the holy Example; I
   will turn away from the atoning Sacrifice; I will listen to His
   teaching; I will have nothing to do with His mediation; I will believe
   Him when lie tells me that He came from the Father, because I feel that
   His doctrine has a divine beauty and fitness; but I will not believe
   Him when He tells me that He is one with the Father, because I cannot
   conceive how this unity is possible." This is not philosophy, which
   thus mutilates man; this is not Christianity, which thus divides
   Christ.^([262]16) If Christ is no more than one of us, let us honestly
   renounce the shadow of allegiance to an usurped authority, and boldly
   proclaim that every man is his own Redeemer. If Christ is God, no less
   than man, let us beware, lest haply we be found even to fight against
   God. [95]

   Beyond question, every doubt which our reason may suggest in matters of
   religion is entitled to its due place in the examination of the
   evidences of religion; if we will treat it as a part only and not the
   whole; if we will not insist on a positive solution of that which, it
   may be, is given us for another purpose than to be solved. It is
   reasonable to believe that, in matters of belief as well as of
   practice, God has not thought fit to annihilate the free will of man;
   but has permitted speculative difficulties to exist as the trial and
   the discipline of sharp and subtle intellects, as he has permitted
   moral temptations to form the trial and the discipline of strong and
   eager passions.^([263]17) Our passions are not annihilated when we
   resist the temptation to sin: why should we expect that our doubts must
   be annihilated if we are to resist the temptation to unbelief? This
   correspondence of difficulties is so far from throwing doubt on the
   divine origin of Revelation, that it rather strengthens the proof that
   it has emanated from that Giver whose other gifts are subject to like
   conditions. We do not doubt that the conditions of our moral trial tend
   towards good and not towards evil; that human nature, even in its
   fallen state, bears traces of the image of its Maker, and is fitted to
   be an instrument in His moral government. And we believe this,
   notwithstanding the existence of passions and appetites which, isolated
   and uncontrolled, appear to lead in an opposite direction. Is it then
   more reasonable to deny that a system of revealed religion, whose
   unquestionable tendency as a whole is to promote the glory of God and
   the welfare of mankind, can have proceeded from the same Author, merely
   because we may be unable to detect the same character in some of its
   minuter features, viewed apart from the system to which they belong?

   It would of course be impossible now to enter upon any detailed
   examination of the positive Evidences of Christianity. The purpose of
   the foregoing Lectures will have been answered; if they can only
   succeed in clearing the way for a candid and impartial inquiry; by
   showing what are the limits within which it must be confined, and what
   kind of reasoning is inadmissible, as transgressing those limits. The
   conclusion, which an examination of the conditions of human thought
   unavoidably forces upon us, is this: There can be no such thing as a
   positive science of Speculative Theology; for such a science must
   necessarily be based on an apprehension of the Infinite; and the
   Infinite, though we are compelled to believe in its existence, cannot
   be positively apprehended in any mode of the human Consciousness. The
   same impediment which prevents the formation of Theology as a science,
   is also manifestly fatal to the theory which asserts its progressive
   development. We can test the progress of knowledge, only by comparing
   its successive representations with the objects which they profess to
   represent: and as the object in this case is inaccessible to human
   faculties, we have no criterion by which to distinguish between
   progress and mere fluctuation. The so-called progress in Theology is in
   truth only an advance in those conceptions of man's moral and religious
   duties which form the basis of natural religion;--an advance which is
   regulative and not speculative; which is primarily and properly a
   knowledge, not of God's nature, but of man's obligations; and which is
   the result, not of an immediate intuition of the Nature of the
   Infinite, but of a closer study of the Laws of the Finite. A progress
   of this kind can obviously have no place in relation to those truths,
   if such there be, which human reason is incapable of discovering for
   itself: and to assert its applicability to the criticism of Revealed
   Religion, is to beg the entire question in dispute, by assuming,
   without the slightest authority, that Revelation cannot be anything
   more than a republication of Natural Religion.^([264]18)

   But, on the other hand, there is an opposite caution no less needed, in
   making use of the counter-theory, which regards the doctrines of
   Revelation as truths accommodated to the finite capacities of man; as
   serving for regulative, not for speculative knowledge; and as not
   amenable to any criticism based on human representations of the
   Infinite. This theory is useful, not as explaining the difficulties
   involved in religious thought, but as showing why we must leave them
   unexplained; not as removing the mysteries of revelation, but as
   showing why such mysteries must exist. This caution has not always been
   sufficiently observed, even by those theologians who have shown the
   most just appreciation of the limits of man's faculties in the
   comprehension of divine things. Thus, to mention an example of an
   ancient method of interpretation which has been revived with
   considerable ability and effect in modern times,--the rule, that the
   Attributes ascribed to God in Scripture must be understood as denoting
   correspondence in Effects, but not similarity of Causes, is one which
   is liable to considerable misapplication: it contains indeed a portion
   of truth, but a portion which is sometimes treated as if it were the
   whole. "Affectus in Deo," says Aquinas, "denotat effectum:"^([265]19)
   and the canon has been applied by a distinguished Prelate of our own
   Church, in language probably familiar to many of us. "The meaning,"
   says Archbishop King, "confessedly is, that He will as certainly punish
   the wicked as if He were inflamed with the passion of anger against
   them; that He will as infallibly reward the good, as we will those for
   whom we have a particular and affectionate love; that when men turn
   from their wickedness, and do what is agreeable to the divine command,
   He will as surely change His dispensations towards them, as if He
   really repented, and had changed His mind."^([266]20)

   This is no doubt a portion of the meaning; but is it the whole? Does
   Scripture intend merely to assert a resemblance in the effects and none
   at all in the causes? If so, it is difficult to see why the natural
   rule of accommodation should have been reversed; why a plain and
   intelligible statement concerning the Divine Acts should have been
   veiled under an obscure and mysterious image of the Divine Attributes.
   If God's Anger means no more than His infliction of punishments; if His
   Love means no more than His bestowal of rewards; it would surely have
   been sufficient to have told us that God punishes sin and rewards
   obedience, without the interposition of a fictitious feeling as the
   basis of the relation. The conception of a God who acts, is at least as
   human as that of a God who feels; and though both are but imperfect
   representations of the Infinite under finite images, yet, while both
   rest upon the same authority of Scripture, it is surely going beyond
   the limits of a just reserve in speaking of divine mysteries, to assume
   that the one is merely the symbol, and the other the interpretation. It
   is surely more reasonable, as well as more reverent, to believe that
   these partial representations of the Divine Consciousness, though, as
   finite, they are unable speculatively to represent the Absolute Nature
   of God, have yet each of them a regulative purpose to fulfil in the
   training of the mind of man: that there is a religious influence to be
   imparted to us by the thought of God's Anger, no less than by that of
   His Punishments; by the thought of His Love, no less than by that of
   His Benefits: that both, inadequate and human as they are, yet dimly
   indicate some corresponding reality in the Divine Nature; and that to
   merge one in the other is not to gain a purer representation of God as
   He is, but only to mutilate that under which He has been pleased to
   reveal Himself.^([267]21)

   It is obvious indeed that the theory of an adaptation of divine truths
   to human faculties, entirely changes its significance, as soon as we
   attempt to give a further adaptation to the adapted symbol itself; to
   modify into a still lower truth that which is itself a modification of
   a higher. The instant we undertake to say that this or that speculative
   or practical interpretation is the only real meaning of that which
   Scripture represents to us under a different image, we abandon at once
   the supposition of an accommodation to the necessary limits of human
   thought, and virtually admit that the ulterior significance of the
   representation falls as much within those limits as the representation
   itself.^([268]22) Thus interpreted, the principle no longer offers the
   slightest safeguard against Rationalism;--nay, it becomes identified
   with the fundamental vice of Rationalism itself,--that of explaining
   away what we are unable to comprehend.

   The adaptation for which I contend is one which admits of no such
   explanation. It is not an adaptation to the ignorance of one man, to be
   seen through by the superior knowledge of another; but one which exists
   in relation to the whole human race, as men, bound by the laws of man's
   thought; as creatures of time, instructed in the things of eternity; as
   finite beings, placed in relation to and communication with the
   Infinite. I believe that Scripture teaches, to each and all of us, the
   lesson which it was designed to teach, so long as we are men upon
   earth, and not as the angels in heaven.^([269]23) I believe that "now
   we see through a glass darkly,"--in an enigma;--but that now is one
   which encompasses the whole race of mankind, from the cradle to the
   grave, from the creation to the day of judgment: that dark enigma is
   one which no human wisdom can solve; which Reason is unable to
   penetrate; and which Faith can only rest content with here, in hope of
   a clearer vision to be granted hereafter. If there be any who think
   that the Laws of Thought themselves may change with the changing
   knowledge of man; that the limitations of Subject and Object, of
   Duration and Succession, of Space and Time, belong to the vulgar only,
   and not to the philosopher;--if there be any who believe that they can
   think without the consciousness of themselves as thinking, or of
   anything about which they think; that they can be in such or such a
   mental state, and yet for no period of duration; that they can remember
   this state and make subsequent use of it, without conceiving it as
   antecedent, or as standing in any order of time to their present
   consciousness; that they can reflect upon God without their reflections
   following each other, without their succeeding to any earlier or being
   succeeded by any later state of mind;--if there be any who maintain
   that they can conceive Justice and Mercy and Wisdom, as neither
   existing in a merciful and just and wise Being, nor in any way
   distinguishable from each other,--if there be any who imagine that they
   can be conscious without variety, or discern without
   differences;--these, and these alone, may aspire to correct Revelation
   by the aid of Philosophy; for such alone are the conditions under which
   Philosophy can attain to a rational knowledge of the Infinite God.

   The intellectual difficulties which Rationalism discovers in the
   contents of Revelation (I do not now speak of those which belong to its
   external evidences) are such as no system of Rational Theology can hope
   to remove; for they are inherent in the constitution of Reason itself.
   Our mental laws, like our moral passions, are designed to serve the
   purposes of our earthly culture and discipline; both have their part to
   perform in moulding the intellect and the will of man through the slow
   stages of that training here, whose completion is to be looked for
   hereafter. Without the possibility of temptation, where would be the
   merit of obedience? Without room for doubt, where would be the
   righteousness of faith?^([270]24) But there is no temptation which
   taketh us, as Christians, but such as is common to man; [96] and there
   is no doubt that taketh us but such as is common to man also. It is the
   province of Philosophy to teach us this; and it is the province of
   Religion to turn the lesson to account. The proud definition of ancient
   sages, which bade the philosopher, as a lover of wisdom, strive after
   the knowledge of things divine and human, would speak more soberly and
   more truly by enjoining a Knowledge of things human, as subservient and
   auxiliary to Faith in things divine.^([271]25) Of the Nature and
   Attributes of God in His Infinite Being, Philosophy can tell us
   nothing: of man's inability to apprehend that Nature, and why he is
   thus unable, she tells us all that we can know, and all that we need to
   know. "Know thyself," was the precept inscribed in the Delphic Temple,
   as the best lesson of Heathen wisdom.^([272]26) "Know thyself," was the
   exhortation of the Christian Teacher to his disciple, adding, "if any
   man know himself, he will also know God."^([273]27) He will at least be
   content to know so much of God's nature as God Himself has been pleased
   to reveal; and, where Revelation is silent, to worship without seeking
   to know more.

   Know thyself in the various elements of thy intellectual and moral
   being: all alike will point reverently upward to the throne of the
   Invisible; but none will scale that throne itself, or pierce through
   the glory which conceals Him that sitteth thereon. Know thyself in thy
   powers of Thought, which, cramped and confined on every side, yet bear
   witness, in their very limits, to the Illimitable beyond. Know thyself
   in the energies of thy Will, which, free and yet bound, the master at
   once and the servant of Law, bows itself under the imperfect
   consciousness of a higher Lawgiver, and asserts its freedom but by the
   permission of the Almighty. Know thyself in the yearnings of thy
   Affections, which, marvellously adapted as they are to their several
   finite ends, yet testify in their restlessness to the deep need of
   something better.^([274]28) Know thyself in that fearful and wonderful
   system of Human Nature as a whole, which is composed of all these, and
   yet not one with any nor with all of them;--that system to whose inmost
   centre and utmost circumference the whole system of Christian Faith so
   strangely yet so fully adapts itself. It is to the whole Man that
   Christianity appeals: it is as a Whole and in relation to the whole Man
   that it must be judged.^([275]29) It is not an object for the thought
   alone, nor for the will alone, nor for the feelings alone. It may not
   be judged by reference to this petty cavil or that minute scruple: it
   may not be cut down to the dimensions and wants of any single ruling
   principle or passion. We have no right to say that we will be
   Christians as far as pleases us, and no further; that we will accept or
   reject, according as our understanding is satisfied or
   perplexed.^([276]30) The tree is not then most flourishing, when its
   branches are lopped, and its trunk peeled, and its whole body cut down
   to one hard, unyielding mass; but when one principle of life pervades
   it throughout; when the trunk and the branches claim brotherhood and
   fellowship with the leaf that quivers, and the twig that bends to the
   breeze, and the bark that is delicate and easily wounded, and the root
   that lies lowly and unnoticed in the earth. And man is never so weak as
   when he seems to be strongest, standing alone in the confidence of an
   isolated and self-sufficing Intellect: he is never so strong as when he
   seems to be weakest, with every thought and resolve, and passion and
   affection, from the highest to the lowest, bound together in one by the
   common tie of a frail and feeble Humanity. He is never so weak as when
   he casts off his burdens, and stands upright and unincumbered in the
   strength of his own will; he is never so strong as when, bowed down in
   his feebleness, and tottering under the whole load that God has laid
   upon him, he comes humbly before the throne of grace, to cast his care
   upon the God who careth for him. [97] The life of man is one, and the
   system of Christian Faith is one; each part supplying something that
   another lacks; each element making good some missing link in the
   evidence furnished by the rest. But we may avail ourselves of that
   which satisfies our own peculiar needs, only by accepting it as part
   and parcel of the one indivisible Whole. Thus only shall we grow in our
   Christian Life in just proportion of every part; the intellect
   instructed, the will controlled, the affections purified, "till we all
   come, in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
   unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
   Christ: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
   carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and
   cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking
   the truth in love, may grow up into Him in all things, which is the
   Head, even Christ; from whom the whole body, fitly joined together and
   compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
   effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
   body unto the edifying of itself in love." [98]

LECTURE I.

   Note I., p. 46.

   SEE Galen, De Sectis, c. I. In this sense, the Dogmatists or
   Rationalists were distinguished from the Empirics. For the
   corresponding philosophical sense of the term, see Sextus Empiricus,
   Pyrrh. Hyp. I. § 1-3.

   Note II., p. 47.

   "Dogmatism has its name from this,--that it professes to demonstrate,
   i. e. to establish dogmatically, as a causal nexus, the relation
   between things per se and phenomena; and maintains that things per se
   contain the ground of all that we observe in man and in the world of
   nature."--Poelitz, Kant's Vorlesungen über die Metaphysik. Einleitung,
   p. xxi.

   Note III., p. 47.

   Of the theological method of Wolf, the leader of philosophical
   dogmatism in the eighteenth century, Mr. Rose observes: "He maintained
   that philosophy was indispensable to theology, and that, together with
   biblical proofs, a mathematical or strictly demonstrative dogmatical
   system, according to the principles of reason, was absolutely
   necessary. His own works carried this theory into practice, and after
   the first clamors against them had subsided, his opinions gained more
   attention, and it was not long before he had a school of vehement
   admirers who far outstripped him in the use of his own principles. We
   find some of them not content with applying demonstration to the truth
   of the system, but endeavoring to establish each separate dogma, the
   Trinity, the nature of the Redeemer, the Incarnation, the eternity of
   punishment, on philosophical, and, strange as it may appear, some of
   those truths on mathematical grounds." [99]

   The language of Wolf himself may be quoted as expressing exactly the
   relation between Scripture and human reason mentioned in the text.
   "Sacred Scripture serves as an aid to natural theology. For in the
   Scripture those things also are taught concerning God, which can be
   demonstrated from principles of reason; a thing which no one denies,
   who is versed in the reading of Scripture. It therefore furnishes
   natural theology with propositions, which ought to be demonstrated;
   consequently the philosopher is bound, not to invent, but to
   demonstrate them." [100]

   The writings of Canz, a disciple of the Wolfian philosophy, are
   mentioned by Mr. Rose and by Dr. Pusey (Historical Inquiry, p. 116), as
   exemplifying the manner in which this philosophy was applied to
   doctrinal theology. The following extracts from his attempted
   demonstration of the doctrine of the Trinity may be interesting to the
   reader, not only on account of the extreme rarity of the work from
   which they are taken, but also as furnishing a specimen of the dogmatic
   method, and showing the abuse to which it is liable in injudicious
   hands.

   "Since the character of every substance lies in some power of action,
   we must form our judgment of God from a power of action infinite and
   general. This power being infinite, embraces all perfections, and
   therefore, does not lie in a bare faculty, which sometimes ceases from
   activity; for that would imply imperfection; nor in the power of doing
   this thing only, or only that, for that in like manner would betray
   limitations; but in an ever-during act of working all things whatsoever
   in the most perfect and therefore the wisest manner. He is therefore a
   substance entirely singular.

   "Moreover, since God is pure actuality, working all in all, it follows
   that finite things, which may be and may not be, do not find the ground
   of their existence in themselves, but in Him who works all things, i.
   e. in God. There is therefore in God--and this we observe in the first
   place--an infinite Creative Power. "But since all created things relate
   to one another as means and ends, yet are themselves, in the ultimate
   scope, referred to the glory of God, it is plain that there is in God
   an infinite Faculty of Wisdom. . . . . .

   "Finally, inasmuch as there is infinite good in created things, and
   God, who works all, must be judged to have furnished forth all this
   good; it is not difficult to understand that there is in God an
   infinite Power of Love. For he loves, who increases, as far as
   possible, with various blessings, the happiness of others.

   "That which exists, is said to subsist, when it has reached its own
   full completion, and proceeds no farther. . . .

   "Whatever in this way, in its existence, proceeds no farther, is called
   by Metaphysicians huphistamenon, and if to this be added the gift of
   intelligence or reason, then there exists a Person (persona).

   "These things premised, let us see what there is in the nature of God
   that justifies the designation of Three Persons. There is certainly in
   God a boundless power of action, and therefore evidence of His being a
   wholly singular Substance. We can also discover a triple activity,
   which completes that power; a triple activity, which not only exists,
   as it presupposes a power of action, but subsists also, as it is
   neither a part, nor an adjunct, nor an operation of anything else.

   "And now there belongs to this triple unlimited activity, by which the
   Divine power is completed, a consciousness of itself, and a sense alike
   of the past and the future. It is therefore intelligent, and therefore
   a Person.

   "Since there are three activities of this kind in God, or in the Divine
   Nature, which is an unlimited power of action, it follows that there
   are in it Three Persons, which by a threefold unlimited operation
   complete and exercise that unlimited power.

   "Since in every created being, endowed with intelligence, the power of
   working, understanding, loving, cannot be completed except by one
   operation, or by one activity; it follows, that in every finite being
   there can only be one person.

   "There is therefore a Trinity of Persons in God, which proceeds from
   his Infinite Nature as such: which was the thing proposed for
   demonstration." [101]

   Note IV., p. 48.

   Kant defines Rationalism, as distinguished from Naturalism and
   Supernaturalism, in the following terms: "He who interprets natural
   religion as morally necessary, i. e. as Duty, may also be called (in
   matters of faith) Rationalist. When such an one denies the reality of
   all supernatural Divine revelation, he is called Naturalist; if now he
   allows this, but maintains that to know it and accept it as real is not
   a necessary requisite to Religion, he could be called a pure
   Rationalist; but if he holds a faith in the same to be necessary to all
   Religion, he would have to be called, in matters of faith, a pure
   Suspernaturalist." [102] In the text, the term is used in a somewhat
   wider extent than that of the above definition. It is not necessary to
   limit the name of Rationalist to those who maintain that Revelation as
   a whole is unnecessary to religion; nor to those whose system is based
   solely on moral principles. There may be a partial as well as a total
   Rationalism: it is possible to acknowledge in general terms the
   authority of Scripture, and yet to exercise considerable license in
   rejecting particular portions as speculatively incomprehensible or
   morally unnecessary. The term is sometimes specially applied to the
   Kantian school of theologians, of whom Paulus and Wegscheider are
   representatives. In this sense, Hegel declares his antagonism to the
   Rationalism of his day; [103] and Strauss, in his controversies with
   the naturalist critics of the Gospels, frequently speaks of their
   method as "Rationalism." In the sense in which the term is employed in
   the text, Hegel and Strauss are themselves as thoroughly rationalists
   as their opponents. Even Schleiermacher, though a decided antagonist of
   the naturalist school, is himself a partial Rationalist of another
   kind; for with him the Christian Consciousness, i. e. the internal
   experience resulting to the individual from his connection with the
   Christian community, is made a test of religious truth almost as
   arbitrary as the Moral Reason of Kant. On the strength of this
   self-chosen criterion, Schleiermacher sets aside, among other
   doctrines, as unessential to Christian belief, the supernatural
   conception of Jesus, the facts of his resurrection, ascension, and the
   prediction of his future judgment of the world; asserting that it is
   impossible to see how such facts can be connected with the redeeming
   power of Christ. [104] Indeed, in some of the details of his system, he
   falls into pure Rationalism; as in his speculations on the existence of
   Angels, good and evil, on the Fall of Man, on eternal Punishment, on
   the two Natures of Christ, and on the equality of the Persons in the
   Holy Trinity.

   The so-called Spiritualism of the present day is again only Rationalism
   disguised; for feeling or intuition is but an arbitrary standard,
   resting solely on the personal consciousness, and moreover must be
   translated into distinct thought, before it can be available for the
   purposes of religious criticism.

   Note V., p. 48.

   Thus Wegscheider represents the claim of the Rationalists. "They claim
   for sound reason the power of deciding upon any religious doctrine
   whatsoever, derived from a supposed supernatural revelation, and of
   determining the argument for it to be made out, only according to the
   laws of thought and action implanted in reason."--Inst. Theol. §10. See
   also Röhr, Briefe über den Rationalismus, p. 31.

   Note VI., p. 51.

   "Wherefore if it is not fitting in God to do anything contrary to
   justice or good order, it does not pertain to His freedom or goodness
   or will to let the sinner go unpunished, who does not pay to God, that
   of which he has robbed Him."--Anselm, Cur Deus Homo, i. 12. "For the
   voluntary satisfaction of sin, and (or) the exaction of punishment from
   him who makes no satisfaction, hold in the same universe their own
   place and fair order. And if the Divine wisdom should not make
   application of these, where sin is striving to disturb right order, the
   orderly beauty of that very universe which God ought to control, would
   be violated and disfigured, and God would seem to be deficient in his
   own administration. These two (suppositions) being as impossible as
   they are contrary to the fitness of things, either satisfaction or
   punishment is the necessary consequence of sin." Ibid. i. 15. "If
   therefore, as is evident, it is from men that the celestial state is to
   be made complete,--and this cannot be done unless the aforesaid
   satisfaction be made, which none can make but God, and none ought, but
   man,--then, as a necessary consequence, it must be made by
   Godman."--Ibid. ii. 6. Compare Alex. ab Ales. Summa Theologiæ, p. iii.
   Memb. 7, where the same argument is concisely stated.

   "God is in such way mercifiul, that He is also at the same time just;

   is in Him a perfect and admirable mingling of mercy and justice;
   therefore, without an equivalent price, sin could not, in the judgment
   of God, have been remitted to man, and the Divine justice have been
   unimpaired. There remained, therefore, no other remedy, than for the
   Son of God himself to assume human nature, and in it and through it to
   make satisfaction. God ought not, marln could not."--J. Gerhard, Loci

   Such is the demand of Anselm's interlocutor, which he himself
   undertakes to satisfy. "That I may understand on the ground of a
   reasonable necessity that all those things ought to be, which the
   Catholic faith teaches us to believe concerning Christ."--Cur Deus
   Homo, L. I. c. 25. To arguments founded on this principle the judicious
   remarks of Bishop Butler may be applied: "It may be needful to mention
   that several questions, which have been brought into the subject before
   us, and determined, are not in the least entered into here: questions
   which have been, I fear, rashly determined, and perhaps with equal
   rashness contrary ways. For instance, whether God could have saved the
   world by other means than the death of Christ, consistently with the
   general laws of his government." [105]

   "In what did this satisfaction consist? Was it that God was angry, and
   needed to be propitiated like some heathen deity of old? Such a thought
   refutes itself by the very indignation which it calls up in the human
   bosom."--Jowett, Epistles of St. Paul, vol. ii. p. 472. "Neither can
   there be any such thing as vicarious atonement or punishment, which,
   again, is a relic of heathen conceptions of an angered Deity, to be
   propitiated by offerings and sacrifices."--Greg, Creed of Christendom,
   p. 265. "The religion of types and notions can travel only in a circle
   from whence there is no escape. It is but an elaborate process of
   self-confutation. After much verbiage it demolishes what it created,
   and having begun by assuming God to be angry, ends, not by admitting
   its own gross mistake, but by asserting Him to be changed and
   reconciled."--Mackay, Progress of the Intellect, vol. ii. p. 504.

   justice."--Froude, Nemesis of Faith, p. 70. Compare Newman, Phases of
   Faith, p. 92; Greg, Creed of Christendom, p. 265. A similar objection
   is introduced, and apparently approved, by Mr. Maurice, Theological

   "There is no one who cannot, with the utmost justice, pardon and remit
   injuries done to himself, and debts contracted to himself, without
   having received any real satisfaction. Therefore, unless we mean to
   allow less to God than is allowed to men themselves, we must confess
   that God might justly have pardoned our sins without having received
   any real satisfaction for them."--F. Socinus, Prælect. Theol. c. xvi.

   "Now it is certainly required of us, that if our brother only repent,
   we should forgive him, even though he should repeat his offence seven
   times a day. On the same generous maxim, therefore, we cannot but
   conclude that the Divine being acts towards us."--Priestley, History of
   Corruptions, vol. i. p. 151. "Every good man has learnt to forgive, and
   when the offender is penitent, to forgive freely--without punishment or
   retribution: whence the conclusion is inevitable, that God also
   forgives, as soon as sin is repented of.'--Newman, The Soul, pp. 99,
   100. "Was it that there was a debt due to Him, which must be paid ere
   its consequences could be done away? But even a man's' debt may be
   freely forgiven."- Jowett, Epistles of St. Paul, vol. ii. p. 472.

   "Pecuniary penalties, therefore, can be paid for another, because one
   person's money can be made another's; as when any one pays money, as a
   penalty, for some other person, then he for whom it is paid is tacitly,
   in reality, first presented with the money, and is considered to have
   paid It himself. But the death, or any bodily distress, of one person,
   cannot be made another's."--F. Socinus, Prælect. Theol. c. xviii.
   "Since money is, as the jurists say, something real, and so can be
   transferred from one to another. But punishments, and the deserts of
   men's sins from the law of God, are something personal, and moreover of
   such sort that they perpetually adhere to him who suffers them, and
   cannot be transferred to another."--F. Socinus, Christianæ Religionis
   Institutio. (Opera, 1656. vol. i. p. 665.) "This original guilt . . . .
   . . cannot, so far as we see by the light of the law of Reason within
   us, be abolished by any one else, for it is no transmissible
   obligation, which, like a pecuniary debt (where it is indifferent to
   the creditor whether the debtor pay it himself or another pay it for
   him), can be transferred to another, but the most personal of all
   personal ones,--the guilt of sin, which only the guilty can bear, not'
   the innocent, be he ever so generous as to be willing to undertake
   it."-- Kant, Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, p.
   81, ed. Rosenkranz. Compare Coleridge, Aids to Reflection, p. 249, ed.
   1839. His argument is chiefly an expansion of Kant's.

   also partially appears, in a form more adapted to the realistic
   controversy, in Anselm, particularly in his treatise De Fide Trinitatis
   et de lncarnatione Verbi, written to refute the theological errors of
   the nominalist Roscelin. In modern times, a similar theory has found
   favor with those philosophers of the Hegelian school, who, in
   opposition to the development represented by Strauss, have undertaken
   the difficult task of reconciling the philosophy of their master with
   historical Christianity. In this point of view it has been adopted by
   Schaller in his "Der historische Christus und die Philosophie," and by
   Göschel in his "Beiträge zur Speculativen Philosophie von Gott und dem
   Menschen und von dem Gottmenschen." For an account of these theories
   see Dorner, p, 462, 477. A similar view is maintained by Marheineke,

   "Religion is (subjectively considered) the acknowledgment of all our

   says, "Since all religion sets forth God only as a moral lawgiver, all
   that is not commanded by the moral law within us, is not His, and there
   is no means of pleasing Him, except by the observance of this same
   moral law."--Versuch einer Kritik aller Offenbarung (Werke, v. p. 127).
   This is exactly the theory of Religion which is refuted in anticipation
   by Bishop Butler (Analogy, P. II. ch. 1.), as the opinion of those who
   hold that the "only design" of Revelation "must be to establish a
   belief of the moral system of nature, and to enforce the practice of
   natural piety and virtue."

   "A hearty wish to please God in all our conduct,--i. e. the
   disposition, accompanying all our actions, to do them as in the service
   of God,--is the spirit of prayer, which can and ought to be in us
   without ceasing.' But to clothe this wish in words and forms (be it
   only inwardly, even), can, at the utmost, only carry with it the value
   of a means for the repeated quickening of that disposition in
   ourselves, but can have no immediate relation to the divine favor; also
   on that account cannot be a universal duty, because a means can only be
   prescribed to him who needs it for certain ends."--Kant, Religion u. s.
   w. p. 235.--Cf. Fichte, Kritik aller Offenbarung, p. 127. For an
   account of a similar view advocated in Scotland in the last century, by
   Dr. Leechman and others, see Combe's Constitution of Man, ch. ix.
   Subsequent writers have repeated the above theory in various forms, and
   in various spirits, but all urging the same objection, from the
   supposed unchangreable nature of God. See Schleiermacher, Christliche
   Glaube, § 147, and his sermon "Die Kraft des Gebetes," Predigten, I. p.
   24; Strauss, Glaubenslehre, II. p. 387; Foxton, Popular Christianity,
   p. 113; Parker, Theism, Atheism, and Popular Theology, p. 65; Emerson,
   Essay on Self-Reliance; and a remarkable passage from Greg's Creed of
   Christendom, quoted in Lecture VI. p. 147. Some valuable remarks on the
   other side will be found in two writers, usually opposed to each other,
   but for once united in vindicating the religious instincts of mankind
   from the perversions of a false philosophy. See F. W. Newman, The Soul,
   p. 118, and "Correspondence of R. E. H. Greyson, Esq," p. 218 (Am.
   Ed.). Kant's theory is ably criticized by Drobisch, Grundlehren der
   Religionsphilosopie, p. 267.

   Note XXII., p. 56.

   Thus Fichte lays it down, as one of the tests of a true Revelation,
   that it must not countenance an objective Anthropomophism of God. In
   illustration of this canon, he says, "If we can really determine God by
   our feelings, can move him to sympathy, to compassion, to joy, then is
   He not the Unchangeable, the Only-sufficient, the Only-blessed, then is
   He determinable by something else than by the moral law; then can we
   hope to move Him, by moaning and contrition, to proceed otherwise with
   us, than the degree of our morality may have deserved. All these
   sensuous representations of divine attributes must not, therefore, be
   pronounced objectively valid; it must not be left doubtful, whether
   such be essentially the nature of God (Gott an sich), or whether he is
   willing to allow us so to think of it, in behoof of our sensuous
   needs." [106] On this principle, he considers the notions of a
   Resurrection and a Day of Judgment as having a merely subjective
   validity. [107] In another passage, he speaks of the representation of
   God under conditions of time, as "a gross Anthropomorphism;" [108]
   apparently not seeing that the notion of unchangeableness is at least
   as much one of time, and therefore of Anthropomorphism, as that of
   compassion or joy. In a similar spirit, a later writer observes: "With
   the great importance so often attached to the personality of God, is
   quite too easily mingled the interest of Anthropopathism and
   Anthropomorphism." [109] In another passage, Fichte says: "He who says,
   Form for thyself no idea of God, says, in other words, Make for thyself
   no idol; and his command has for the mind the same significance as the
   ancient Mosaic commandment had for the senses--Thou shalt make to
   thyself no graven image." [110] These words may perhaps have suggested
   the cognate remarks of Professor Jowett: "It would be little better
   than idolatry to fill the mind with an idea of God which represented
   Him in fashion as a man. And in using a figure of speech, we are bound
   to explain to all who are capable of understanding, that we speak in a
   figure only, and to remind them that logical categories may give as
   false and imperfect a conception of the Divine nature in our own age,
   as graven images in the days of the patriarchs." [111] If by logical
   categories are meant analogical representations formed from the facts
   of human consciousness, this passage may be so interpreted as to imply
   either an important truth, or a dangerous error. If interpreted to mean
   that such representations of God cannot be regarded as adequate
   expressions of His absolute and infinite nature, it states a truth, the
   importance of which can hardly be over-estimated; but if it be meant,
   as Fichte undoubtedly meant, to signify that mental no less than bodily
   images, are, regarded from a human point of view, false and idolatrous,
   the author would do well to tell us what we can substitute in their
   place. "We may confidently challenge all natural Theology," says Kant,
   "to name a single distinctive attribute of the Deity, whether denoting
   intelligence or will, which, apart from Anthropomorphism, is anything
   more than a mere word, to which not the slightest notion can be
   attached, which can serve to extend our theoretical knowledge." [112]
   Kant, however, attempts to avoid the conclusion to which this admission
   necessarily leads;--namely, that Anthropomorphism, in this sense of the
   term, is the indispensable condition of all human theology. As regards
   the charge of idolatry, it is best answered in the words of Storr: "The
   image of God we have not made for ourselves, but God has placed it
   before us." [113] The very commandment which forbids the representation
   of God by a bodily likeness, does so by means of two other human
   representations, that of a mental state, and that of a consequent
   course of action. "Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image; for
   I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers
   upon the children." The Satire of Xenophanes has been repeated by
   modern critics in a manner which deprives it entirely of its original
   point. Thus Mr. Theodore Parker says, "A Beaver or a Reindeer, if
   possessed of religions faculties, would also conceive of the Deity with
   the limitations of its own personality, as a Beaver or a Reindeer."
   [114] The satire loses its entire force, when transferred from bodily
   forms to mental attributes. In imagining a Beaver or a Reindeer with a
   personal consciousness, we so far imagine him as resembling man,
   notwithstanding the difference of bodily form. The sarcasm, therefore,
   amounts to no more than this: that human consciousness in another body
   would be subject to the same limits of religious thought as in its
   present one. The latest specimen of this kind of would-be philosophy is
   furnished by Professor Baden Powell, in his "Christianity without
   Judaism," p. 108. "It is not one of the least remarkable of these
   Anthropomorphisms," he says, "that (as in former instances) the
   disclosure of the Divine purposes is made under the figure of Jehovah
   entering into a covenant with his people,--an idea specially adapted to
   a nation of the lowest moral capacity." One would have thought that the
   fact that this image was selected by God Himself, as the symbol of His
   relation to His chosen people (to say nothing of its repetition in the
   New Testament), might have insured its more respectful treatment at the
   hands of a Clergyman. But Mr. Powell, in his zeal for "Christianity
   without Judaism," seems to forget that Judaism, as well as
   Christianity, was a Revelation from God.

   Note XXIII., p. 58.

   This remark may seem at first sight not so appropriate in relation to
   Kant as to some other advocates of a similar theory, such, for
   instance, as Mr. Greg, whose remarks on prayer are quoted in Lecture
   VI. p. 147. For Kant, in language at least, expressly denies that any
   temporal consecution can be included in the conception of God. [115]
   But, in truth, this denial is and must be merely verbal. For the moral
   law, in Kant's own theory, is regarded as a divine command because it
   is conceived as a perpetual obligation, binding upon all human acts;
   and the perpetuity of the obligation, in relation to successive acts,
   necessarily implies the idea of Time. Thus God in relation to man, as a
   moral Governor, is necessarily manifested under the condition of time;
   and this manifestation is the only philosophical representation of God
   which the Kantian philosophy recognizes as valid. Indeed, if Time be,
   as Kant maintains, a necessary form of human consciousness, the
   language which speaks of a Being existing out of time can have no
   significance to any human thinker.

   Versuch einer Kritik aller Offenbarung, Königsberg, 1792, 2d Ed. 1793.
   (Fichte's Werke, V. p. 9.) A few specimens of the criticisms hazarded
   in this work will be sufficient to show the arbitrary character of the
   method on which it proceeds. The author assumes that God is determined
   entirely and solely by the moral law as conceived by man; and that
   Religion, therefore, must consist solely in moral duties. [116] Hence
   he lays down, among others, the following criteria, without satisfying
   which, no revelation can be accepted as of divine origin.

   There must have been a moral necessity for it at the time of its
   publication (p. 113).

   It must not draw men to obedience by any other motive than reverence
   for God's holiness. Hence it must not contain any prospect of future
   reward or punishment (p. 115).

   It must not communicate any knowledge attainable by the natural reason
   (p. 122).

   It must contain only such moral rules as may be deduced from the
   principle of the practical reason (p. 124).

   It must not promise any supernatural aids to men in the performance of
   their duty (p. 129).

   Kant's own work, Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft,
   Königsberg, 1793, is based on a similar principle; and many of his
   conclusions are identical with those of Fichte. He agrees with his
   disciple in maintaining that no doctrine can be received on the
   authority of Revelation, without the concurrent testimony of Reason;
   [117] and that a moral life is the only duty which God can require of a
   man. [118] Hence he defines Religion as "the acknowledgment of all our
   duties as divine commands;" and asserts that there can be no special
   duties towards God distinct from our moral obligations to our
   fellow-men. [119] In accordance with these principles, he advocates,
   and in some instances applies, a method of Scripture interpretation,
   which consists in forcing every available doctrine and precept into a
   so-called moral significance, and rejecting as unessential whatever
   will not bear this treatment. [120] Thus, in the fifty-ninth Psalm, the
   enemies of David are interpreted to mean the evil passions which he
   wished to overcome.

   The narrowness of Kant's fundamental assumption, even as regards the
   human side of religion only, is pointed out by Willm, Histoire de la
   Philosophie Allemande, vol. ii. p. 47: "By regarding religion as
   chiefly a means of promoting morality, Kant has too much limited its
   divine mission; he has forgotten that religion must besides be a source
   of consolation and of hope, in the midst of the ills of the present
   life; and that by powerful motives and lofty meditations it must come
   to the succor of frail humanity, that it must serve as a support in the
   double struggle that we have to sustain against temptation to evil and
   against suffering." See also Drobisch, Grundlehren der
   Religionsphilosophie, p. 264, who adopts a similar ground of
   criticisin.

   Note XXVIII., p. 65.

   "In the exposition of the pure conception it has yet further been
   declared, that it is the absolute divine conception itself; so that in
   truth there would not be the relation of an application, but the
   logical process is the immediate exhibition of God's self-determination
   to Being."--Hegel, Logik. (Werke, V. p. 170.) In like manner his
   disciple Marheineke says, "Only as subsumed into this Idea. and
   sublated [121] in it, is the human spirit capable of knowing God. His
   true self-exalting to God by thinking, is however, ever at the same
   time, a being-exalted, the insertion of the human thinking of God into
   the divine thinking of God." [122] Such passages are instructive as
   showing the only conditions under which, according to the admission of
   its ablest advocates, a Philosophy of the Absolute is attainable by
   human thought. In reference to these lofty pretensions, Sir William
   Hamilton justly speaks of "the scheme of pantheistic omniscience, so
   prevalent among the sequacious thinkers of the day." [123]

   Note XXIX., p. 65.

   "Besides God there exists, truly and in the proper sense of the word,
   nothing at all but knowledge; and this knowledge is the divine
   Existence itself, absolutely and immediately, and in so far as we are
   knowledge, are we, in the deepest root of our being, the divine
   Existence."--Fichte, Anweisungen zum seligen Leben (Werke, V. p. 448).
   "Man, rational being in general, is ordained to be a complement of the
   phenomenal world; out of him, out of his activity, is to develop itself
   all that is wanting to the totality of the revelation of God, since
   nature receives, indeed, the whole divine substance, but only in the
   Real: rational being is to express the image of the same divine Nature,
   as it is in itself, accordingly, in the Ideal."--Schelling, Vorlesungen
   über die Methode des Academischen Studium, p. 18. "God is infinite, I
   finite--these are false expressions, forms not fitted to the idea, to
   the nature of the case. . . . . . . God is the movement to the finite,
   and thereby as sublation of the same to himself; in the I as the
   self-sublating as finite, God regresses to himself, and is only God as
   this regress."--Hegel, Vorlesungen, über die Philosophie der Religion
   (Werke, XI. p. 194). "Man's knowledge of God is, according to the
   essential communion, a common knowledge; i. e., man has knowledge of
   God, only in so far as God has knowledge of Himself; this knowledge is
   God's self-consciousness; but just so is it, too, His knowledge of man;
   and God's knowledge of man is man's knowledge of God."--Ibid. XII. p.
   496. "Rational knowledge of truth is, first of all, as a knowledge of
   God, knowledge through God, knowledge in his Spirit and through it. By
   finite, relative thinking, God, who is nothing finite and relative,
   cannot be thought and known. On the contrary, in the knowledge, the I
   is out beyond itself, and the subjectivity of the isolated
   consciousness of itself,--it is in God, and God in it." Marheineke,
   Grundlehren der Christlichen Dogmatik, § 115.

   Rationalism here takes up a common ground with Mysticism, and the
   logical process of the Hegelians becomes identical with the ecstatic
   intuition of the Neo-Platonists. Compare the language of Plotinus, Enn.
   VI. L. ix. c. 9. "It (the soul) may then see itself . . . . . .
   becoming God, or rather being God." In the same strain sings the
   "Cherubic Wanderer," Angelus Silesius:

   "In God is nothing known: He is the only One:
   What we in Him do know, that we ourselves must be." [124]

   For an exactly similar doctrine, asserted in the Hindu Vedas, see Dr.
   Mill's Observations on the application of pantheistic principles to the
   criticism of the Gospel, p. 159.

   Note XXX., p. 65.

   Hegel, in his Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion, thus interprets
   the history of Christ. "The truth. . . . . . which men have reached in
   this entire history is this: that the idea of God has for them a
   certainty; that the Human is immediate, present God; and indeed, in
   such wise, that in this history, as the spirit apprehends it, the
   exhibition of the process pertains to that, which constitutes man, the
   spirit." [125] The view here obscurely intimated is more explicitly
   stated by his disciple, Strauss, whose theory is little more than the
   legitimate development of his master's. In his Christliche
   Glaubenslehre, § 33, he sums up the result of the speculations of
   modern philosophy concerning the Personality of God, in the following
   words: "God being in himself the eternal Personality itself, has been
   forever bringing forth out from Himself his Other (or alterum) Nature,
   in order forever to return to Himself as self-conscious Spirit. Or, the
   Personality of God must not be thought of as single-personality, but as
   all-personality; instead of on our side personifying the absolute, we
   must learn to apprehend it as the endlessly Self-personifying." This
   view is still more plainly stated in a fearful passage of his Leben
   Jesu, § 151, which the reader will find quoted at length in Lecture V.
   p. 130. The critic of Strauss, Bruno Bauer, in his Kritik der
   evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker, § 91, adopts the same view,
   observing, "In general the religious consciousness is the Spirit
   estranged from itself;" and to this origin he ascribes the doctrine of
   Christ's Divinity: "The historical Christ is man, raised to heaven by
   the religious consciousness." Feuerbach, in his Wesen des
   Christenthums, [126] from a different point of view, arrives at a
   similar conclusion, maintaining that God is but the personification of
   the general notion of humanity. Emerson gives us occasional glimpses of
   the same philosophy. Thus in his "Christian Teacher" he explains the
   Divinity of Christ: "He saw that God incarnates himself in man, and
   evermore goes forth anew to take possession of his world. He said in
   this jubilee of sublime emotion: I am divine. Through me God acts;
   through me, speaks. Would you see God, see me; or see thee, when thou
   also thinkest as I now think.'" [127] And, in the "Over-Soul." in still
   more daring language, he says: "In all conversation between two
   persons, tacit reference is made as to a third party, to a common
   nature. That third party or common nature is not social; it is
   impersonal, is God." [128]

   Another form of this deification of humanity is that of M. Comte, who
   agrees with Strauss and Feuerbach, in finding God only in the human
   race. This discovery is announced as the grand consummation of Positive
   Philosophy. "This final estimation condenses l'ensemble of positive
   conceptions in the single notion of one Being immense and eternal,
   Humanity, whose sociological destinies develop themselves always under
   the necessary preponderance of biological and cosmological fatalities.
   Around this veritable Great-Being, the immediate mover of every
   existence, individual or collective, our affections centre as
   spontaneously as our thoughts and our actions." [129] From this grand
   ideal of humanity. unworthy individuals of the race are excluded; but,
   "sii ces producteurs de fumier ne font vraiment point partie de
   l'Humanité, une juste compensation vous prescrit de joindre au nouvel
   Etre-Suprême tous ses dignes auxiliaires animaux." [130] Such is the
   brilliant discovery which entitles its author, in his own modest
   estimate, to be considered as uniting in his own person the characters
   of St. Paul and Aristotle, as the founder at once of true religion and
   sound philosophy. [131]

   Compare Marheineke, Grundlehren der Christlichen Dogmatik, § 420.
   "Religion is, accordingly, nothing at all but the existence of the
   divine Spirit in the human; but an existence, which is life, a life
   which is consciousness, a consciousness which, in its truth, is
   knowledge. This human knowledge is essentially divine; for it is, first
   of all, the divine Spirit's knowledge, and religion in its
   absoluteness."

   Note XXXIII., p. 66.

   "Logic is consequently to be conceived as the system of the pure
   reason, as the realm of pure thought. This realm is truth unveiled and
   absolute. We may therefore say, that it contains in itself the
   exhibition of God, as He is in His eternal essence before the creation
   of nature and a finite spirit."--Hegel, Logik (Werke, III. p. 33).

LECTURE II.

   Note I., p. 69.

   "Unless we have independent means of knowing that God knows the truth,
   and is disposed to tell it to us, his word (if we be ever so certain
   that it is really his word) might as well not have been spoken. But if
   we know, independently of the Bible, that God knows the truth, and is
   disposed to tell it to us, obviously we know a great deal more also. We
   know not only the existence of God, but much concerning his character.
   For, only by discerning that he has Virtues similar in kind to human
   Virtues, do we know of his truthfulness and his goodness. Without this
   a priori belief, a book-revelation is a useless impertinence."--F. W.
   Newman, The Soul, p. 58. With this a priori belief, it is obvious that
   a book-revelation is, as far as our independent knowledge extends,
   still more impertinent; for it merely tells us what we knew before. See
   an able criticism of this theory in the Eclipse of Faith, p. 73 sqq.

   Note II., p. 71.

   "Furthermore, since, for us, that falls under the sphere of the
   understanding, which a great many philosophers before us have declared
   to be within the province of the reason, we shall have for the highest
   kind of intelligence a position unattained by them; and we shall define
   it as that by which finite and infinite are seen in the eternal, but
   not the eternal in the finite or in the infinite."--Schelling, Bruno,
   p. 163. (Compare p. 69.) "But there are still other spheres, which can
   be observed,--not merely those which are confined to a relativity of
   finite to finite, but those, too, wherein the divine in its
   absoluteness is in the consciousness."--Hegel, Philosophie der Religion
   (Werke, XI. p. 196). In like manner, Mr. Newman speaks of the Soul as
   "the organ of specific information to us," respecting things spiritual;
   [132] and Mr. Parker says, "that there is a connection between God and
   the soul, as between light and the eye, sound and the ear, food and the
   palate, etc." [133]

   Note III., p. 71.

   "This substance, simple, primitive, must comprise the perfections in
   eminent degree, contained in the derivative substances, which are its
   effects; thus it will have power, knowledge, good-will in perfection;
   that is, omnipotence, omniscience, supreme goodness. And as justice,
   taken generally, is nothing but goodness conformed to wisdom, there
   must also be in God a supreme justice."--Leibnitz, Principles de la
   Nature et de la Grace, § 9. "Being conscious that I have, personally, a
   little Love, and a little Goodness, I ask concerning it, as concerning
   Intelligence,--where did I pick it up? and I feel an invincible
   persuasion, that if I have some moral goodness, the great Author of my
   being has infinitely more. Ile did not merely make rocks, and seas, and
   stars, and brutes, but the human Soul also; and, therefore, I am
   assured he possesses all the powers and excellencies of that soul in an
   infinitely higher degree."--F. W. Newman, Reply to the Eclipse of
   Faith, p. 26. This argument, however true in its general principle, is
   liable to considerable error in its special applications. The remarks
   of Bishop Browne are worth consideration, as furnishing a caution on
   the other side. "To say that God is infinite in perfection, means
   nothing real and positive in him, unless we say, in a kind of
   perfection altogether inconceivable to us as it is in itself. For the
   multiplying or magnifying the greatest perfections whereof we have any
   direct conception or idea, and then adding our gross notion only of
   indefinite to them, is no other than heaping up together a number of
   imperfections to form a chimera of our imagination."--Divine Analogy,
   p. 171.

   Note IV., p. 72.

   Compare Wegscheider's definition of Mysticism, Instit. Theol. § 5.--"A
   near approach to superstition, or rather a species of it, is
   mzysticisnm; or a belief in a particular faculty of the soul, . . . . .
   by which it may reach even in this world an immediate intercourse with
   the Deity or with celestial natures, and enjoy immediately a knowledge
   of divine things."

   Note V., p. 73.

   Fichte, Versuch einer Kritik aller Offenbarung. (Werke, V. pp. 40,
   115.)--The following remarks of Mr. Parker are another application of
   the same principle, substituting, however, as if on purpose to show the
   contradictory conclusions to which such a method of reasoning may lead,
   the conception of perfect love and future compensation, for that of a
   moral nature with no affections and no future promises. "This we know,
   that the Infinite God must be a perfect Creator, the sole and
   undisturbed author of all that is in Nature. . . . . Now, a perfect
   Motive for creation,--what will that be? It must be absolute Love,
   producing a desire to bless everything which He creates. . . . . If God
   be infinite, then He must make and administer the world from perfect
   motives, for a perfect purpose, and as a perfect means,--all tending to
   the ultimate and absolute blessedness of each thing He directly or
   mediately creates; the world must be administered so as to achieve that
   purpose for each thing. Else God has made some things from a motive and
   for a purpose not benevolent, or as a means not adequate to the
   benevolent purpose. These suppositions are at variance with the nature
   of the Infinite God. I do not see how this benevolent purpose can be
   accomplished unless all animals are immortal, and find retribution in
   another life."--Theism, Atheism and the Popular Theology, pp. 108, 109,
   198.

   Note VI., p. 73.

   The nature of the case implies that the human mind is competent to sit
   in moral and spiritual judgment on a professed revelation, and to
   decide (if the case seem to require it) in the following tone. This
   doctrine attributes to God that which we should all call harsh, cruel,
   or unjust, in man: it is, therefore, intrinsically
   inadmissible.'"--Newman, The Soul, p. 58. For an able refutation of
   this reasoning, see the Defence of the Eclipse of Faith, p. 38.

   Note VII., p. 73.

   "To suppose the future volitions of moral agents not to be necessary
   events; or, which is the same thing, events which it is not impossible
   but that they may not come to pass; and yet to suppose that God
   certainly foreknows them, and knows all things; is to suppose God's
   Knowledge to be inconsistent with itself."--Edwards, On the Freedom of
   the Will, part 2 sect. 12.

   Note VIII., p. 73.

   "Let us suppose a great prince governing a wicked and rebellious
   people. lie has it in his power to punish: he thinks fit to pardon
   them. But he orders his only and well-beloved son to be put to death,
   to expiate their sins, and to satisfy his royal vengeance. Would this
   proceeding appear to the eye of reason, and in the unprejudiced light
   of nature, wise, or just, or good?"--Bolingbroke, Fragments or Minutes
   of Essays (Works, vol. v. p. 289, ed. 1754). Compare Newman, Phases of
   Faith, p. 92. See also above [277]Lecture I., Note 13.

   Note IX., p. 73.

   "Intellectually, we of necessity hold that the highest human perfection
   is the best type of the Divine. . . . . Every good man has learnt to
   forgive, and when the offender is penitent, to forgive freely,--without
   punishment or retribution: whence the conclusion is inevitable, that
   God also forgives, as soon as sin is repented of."--Newman, The Soul,
   p. 99. "It may be collected from the principles of Natural Religion,
   that God, on the sincere repentance of offenders, will receive them
   again into favour, and render them capable of those rewards naturally
   attendant on right behaviour."--Warburton, Divine Legation, b. ix., ch.
   2. Compare, on the other side, Magee on the Atonement, notes iv. and

   "The Absolute is that which is free from all necessary relation, that
   is, which is free from every relation as a condition of existence; but
   it may exist in relation, provided that relation be not a necessary
   condition of its existence; that is, provided that relation may be
   removed without affecting its existence." . . . "The Infinite expresses
   the entire absence of all limitation, and is applicable to the one
   Infinite Being in all his attributes."--Calderwood, Philosophy of the
   Infinite, pp. 36, 37. The definitions may be accepted, though they lead
   to conclusions the very opposite of those which the ingenious author
   has attempted to establish. The Absolute, as above defined, is taken in
   the first of the two senses distinguished by Sir W. Hamilton,
   Discussions, p. 14; and in this sense it is the necessary complement of
   the idea of the Infinite. The other sense, in which the Absolute is
   contradictory of the Infinite, is irrelevant to the present argument.

   Note XV., p. 76.

   "The absolutely infinite is what contains everything, or every
   perfection, which can exist or be conceived; that you are wont to call
   infinite in perfection. Infinite, e. g. predicated of extension, means
   what embraces all existing or conceivable extension."--Werenfels,
   DeFinibus Mundi Dialogus (Dissertationes, 1716, vol. ii., p. 192). In
   the latter sense, Clarke speaks of the error of "imagining all
   Infinites to be equal, when in things disparate they manifestly are not
   so; an infinite Line being not only not equal to, but infinitely less
   than an infinite Surface, and an infinite Surface than Space infinite
   in all Dimensions." [134] This remark assumes that an infinite
   extension is a possible object of conception at all; whereas, in fact,
   the attempt to conceive it involves the same fundamental contradictions
   which accompany the notion of the Infinite in every other aspect. This
   is ingeniously shown by Werenfels, in the above Dialogue, p. 218. "D.
   But do you then think, that an infinite line cannot be conceived at all
   without contradiction? Ph. I do, indeed; and I cannot be drawn from
   this opinion, unless some one of you have a conclusive answer to this
   demonstration; but this, unless you lack the patience to listen, I will
   briefly propose anew. You see this line b___a___c. Let us suppose it to
   be infinite, and to be extended ad infinitum beyond the termini b and
   c. Let this line be divided at the point a. It is manifest that these
   parts are equal to one another, because each begins at the point a and
   is extended ad infinitum. Now, I ask you, Dædalus, are these two parts
   finite, or infinite? D. Finite. Ph. So an infinite would be composed of
   two finites; which is a contradiction. D. I confess my mistake. They
   are infinite, Ph. Now you fall into Scylla Thus parts would be equal to
   a whole; for infinite is equal to infinite. Besides, you see, that each
   part is terminated at the point a; it is, therefore, not without ends
   and bounds. What say you to this, Polymathes? Po. I have an answer.
   Each of these parts is on the one side finite,--namely, at the point
   a,--on the other, infinite, because it is extended beyond b and c ad
   infinitum. Ph. Ingeniously, acutely, nothing more so. But I ask you,
   whether there is on either section of the infinite line an infinite
   number of such parts as the line ab and the line ac? Po. Yes. Ph. But
   is that number infinite, to which an equal can be added, and the double
   of which is not only conceivable, but really existent? If you answer
   yes, then an infinite number does not contain all units, but there can
   besides be conceived and added to it, as many units as it may not have.
   But if this be not a contradiction, then what is there, that is a
   contradiction? Po. But, what if either section of the given line
   consist of a finite number of parts of such magnitude as the line ab?
   Ph. Then the given line is finite; because two finite numbers added
   together, make a finite number; which was the thing to be proved." The
   contradictions thus involved in the notion of infinite magnitudes in
   space, are not solved by maintaining, with Spinoza and Clarke, that
   infinite quantity is not composed of parts; [135] for space with no
   parts is as inconceivable as space composed of an infinite number of
   parts. These contradictions sufficiently show that relative infinity,
   no less than absolute, is not a positive object of thought at all; the
   so-called infinites and infinitesimals of the mathematicians being in
   fact only negative expressions, denoting magnitudes which bear no
   relation to any assignable quantity, however great or small. They are
   thus apprehended only by reference to their inconceivability; being
   merely the expression of our inability to represent in thought a first
   or last unit of space or time.--See Leibnitz, Théodicée Discours, § 70.
   "We are embarrassed in the series of numbers, progressing ad infinitum.
   We conceive of a last term, of an infinite or an infinitesimal; but
   these are only fictions. Every number is finite and assignable, and the
   infinites and the infinitesimals signify nothing but magnitudes, which
   we may take as large or as small as we please, etc."--Compare Pascal,
   Pensées, Partie I. Art. II. "In short, whatever be the motion, number,
   space, time, there is always a greater and a less; so that they all
   stand between nothing and infinity, being always infinitely removed
   from these extremes." Some ingenious reasoning on this question will be
   found in a Note by Mosheim on Cudworth's Intellectcual System, b I. ch.
   V., translated in Harrison's edition of Cudworth, vol. II. p. 541;
   though the entire discussion is by no means satisfactory.

   Note XVI., p. 76.

   "By the Deity I understand a Being absolutely infinite, i. e., a
   substance consisting of infinite attributes, each one of which
   expresses an eternal and infinite essence. I say infinite absolutely,
   but not in its kind, for whatever is infinite in its kind only, of that
   we cannot affirm infinite attributes; but to the essence of that which
   is absolutely infinite, there pertains whatever expresses essence and
   involves no negation."--Spinoza, Ethica, P. I. Def. VI.

   assumption ultimately annihilates itself; for if any object of
   conception exhausts the universe of reality, it follows that the mind
   which conceives it has no existence. The older form of this
   representation is criticized by Hegel, Encyclopädie, § 36. His own
   conception of God, however, virtually amounts to the same thing. A
   similar view is implied in his criticism of Aristotle, whom he censures
   for regarding God as one object out of many. See Geschichte der

   actually does all that he can do; and, consequently, that there is no
   possibility of free action in any finite being, can only bhe avoided by
   the admission, which is ultimately forced upon us, that our human
   conception of the infinite is not the true one. Müller (Christliclhe
   Lehre von der Sünde, II. p. 251, third edit. ) endeavors to meet this
   conclusion by a counter-argument. Hr shows that it is equally a
   limitation of the divine Nature to suppose that God is compelled of
   necessity to realize in act everything which he has the power to
   accomplish. This argument completes the dilemma, and brings into full
   view the counter-impotences of human thought in relation to the
   infinite. We cannot conceive an Infinite Being as capable of becoming
   that which he is not; nor, on the other hand, can we conceive him as
   actually being all that he can be.

   "Now it is sufficiently manifest, that a thing existing absolutely (i.
   e. not under relation), and a thing existing absolutely as a cause, are
   contrydictory. The former is the absolute negation of all relation; the
   latter is the absolute affirmation of a particular relation. A cause is
   a relative, and what exists absolutely as a cause, exists absolutely
   under relation.--"Sir W. Hamilton, Discussions, p. 34.

   Note XXIII., p. 77.

   That a belief in creation is incompatible with a philosophy of the
   Absolute, was clearly seen by Fichte, who consistently denounces it, as
   a Jewish and Heathenish notion and the fundamental error of all false
   Metaphysics. He even goes so far as to maintain that St. John, the only
   teacher of true Christianity, did not believe in the Creation, and that
   the beginning of his Gospel was designed to contradict the Mosaic
   narrative. See his Anweisung zum seligen Leben (Werke, v. p. 479).
   Compare Schelling, Bruno, p. 60, who regards the finite as necessarily
   coeternal with the infinite. So also Rothe, Theologische Ethik, § 40,
   asserts that the doctrine of a creation in time is inconsistent with
   the essential nature of God, as unchangeable and necessarily creative.
   Spinoza's attempted demonstration that one substance cannot be produced
   from another, [138] though in itself a mere juggle of equivocal terms,
   yet testifies in like manner to his conviction, that to deny the
   possibility of creation is an indispensable step to a philosophy of the
   Absolute. Cognate to these theories are the speculations of Hermogenes,
   mentioned by Tertullian, Adv. Herm. c. 2; and of Origen, De Princ. I.
   2. 10. Of the latter, Neander well observes: "Here, therefore, there
   occurred to him those reasons against a beginning of creation
   generally, which must ever suggest themselves to the reflecting mind,
   which cannot rest satisfied with simple faith in that which to itself
   is incomprehensible. Supposing that to create is agreeable to the
   divine essence, how is it conceivable that what is thus conformable to
   God's nature should at any time have been wanting? Why should not those
   attributes which belong to the very essence of the Deity, His almighty
   power and goodness, be always active? A transition from the state of
   not-creating to the act of creation is inconceivable without a change,
   which is incompatible with the being of God." [139]

   Note XXIV., p. 78.

   Arist. Metaph. XIV. 9. [Ed. Gul. Duval, Paris, 1629.] "If it have aught
   as the object of intelligence, and something other than itself be thus
   superior to it, it will not be the Best (for then it will be
   intelligence only potentially, not essentially); since it is in the act
   of intelligence that the excellence lies. . . . . Itself, therefore, it
   has as the object of intelligence, if indeed it is the Supreme; and the
   intelligence is intelligence of intelligence." Plotinus, on the other
   hand, shows that even self-consciousness, as involving a logical
   distinction between the subject and object, is incompatible with the
   notion of the Absolute. See Enn. V. 1. VI. c. 2.

   Note XXV., p. 78.

   Plotinns, Enn., III. 1. IX. c. 3. "The Intelligence is now twofold, and
   objectifies itself; and it is wanting in somewhat because it has the
   Well' (to eu) in the act of intelligence, not in the substance." Enn.
   V. 1. VI. c. 2. "Being a duality it will not be the first, . . . . . in
   itself it will properly be neither the intelligent nor the
   intelligible; for what is intelligible is so relatively to another."
   Enn. V. 1. VI. c. 6. "Therefore there will again be a duality in the
   conscious intelligence; but that (the first or the Absolute) is nowise
   a duality." Cf. Porphyr. Sent. XV. "But if there be plurality in the
   intelligible, since there is a plurality, not unity, in the objects of
   the conscious intelligence, then of necessity there must be plurality
   in the essence of the intelligence. But unity (the One) is prior to
   plurality, so that of necessity it is prior to the intelligence." "The
   Absolute, as absolutely universal, is absolutely one; absolute unity is
   convertible with the absolute negation of plurality and difference; the
   Absolute, and the Knowledge of the Absolute, are therefore identical.
   But knowledge, or intelligence, supposes a plurality of terms--the
   plurality of subject and object. Intelligence, whose essence is
   plurality, cannot therefore be identified with the Absolute, whose
   essence is unity; and if known, the Absolute, as known, must be
   different from the Absolute, as existing; that is, there must be two
   Absolutes--an Absolute in knowledge and an Absolute in existence: which
   is contradictory."--Sir W. Hamilton, Discussions, p. 32.

   Note XXVI., p. 78.

   Clem. Alex. Strom. V. 12. p. 587. "Nor, indeed, would any one rightly
   call it a whole, for the whole is predicated of magnitude . . . . . nor
   can it be said to have parts, for the One is indivisible." Plotinus,
   Enn. V. 1. VI. c. 5. "For of a thing that is absolutely one, how can
   you predicate the coming to itself, or the want of consciousness?" On
   this point, the earlier and later forms of Pantheism are divided
   against each other. Spinoza (Eth. P. I. Def. 6) defines the Deity as
   composed of an infinite number of attributes. "By the Deity I
   understand a Being absolutely infinite, i. e., a substance consisting
   of infinite attributes, every one of which expresses eternal and
   infinite essence." Hegel, on the contrary, in his Lectures on the
   proofs of the existence of God, regards a plurality of attributes as
   incompatible with the idea of the Infinite. "Here (i. e. in the
   absolute unity of God) the plurality of predicates--which only
   subjectively are bound in unity, but in themselves would be
   distinguished, and so would come into opposition and into
   contradiction--shows itself as something false, and the plurality of
   determinations (in the notion of God) as an impertinent category."
   [140] The lesson to be learnt from both is the same. No human form of
   thought can represent the Infinite:--a truth which Spinoza attempts to
   evade by multiplying such forms to infinity, and Hegel by renouncing
   human thought altogether.

   Note XXVII., p. 78.

   That the Absolute cannot be conceived as composed of a plurality of
   attributes, but only as the one substance conceived apart from all
   plurality, is shown by Plotinus, Enn. V. 1. VI., c. 3. "If it be said
   that nothing hinders this same (i. e. the First) being the Many, the
   answer must be, that these Many have an underlying One (One Subject,
   hupokeimenon); for the Many cannot exist, except there exist the One
   from which the Many must be derived, and in which the Many must exist .
   . . . . . and this One must be taken as in itself the only One.". . . .
   Compare Proclus, Inst. Theol. c. 1. "All plurality in some way partakes
   of Unity (or the One), for if not, then neither will the whole be One,
   nor each one of the many which make up the plurality; but of certain
   entities each will be a plurality, and this on to an infinite, and of
   these infinites each again will be an infinite plurality." To the same
   effect is the reasoning of Augustine, De Trinitate, vi. c. 6. 7. "In
   every body magnitude is one thing, color another, figure another. For
   the magnitude diminished, the color may remain the same, and the figure
   the same; and the figure changed, the body may be just as large and of
   just the same color; and whatever other things are predicated of the
   body, may exist together, and may be changed without change on the part
   of the rest. And thus the nature of the body is proved to be manifold,
   but in nowise simple. . . . . . But also in the soul since it is one
   thing to be ingenious, another to be dull, another to be acute, another
   to have a good memory; since desire is one thing, fear another, joy
   another, sorrow another; and since there can be found in the nature of
   the soul some things without others, and some more, and some less, and
   these to a number beyond all computation;--it is manifest that the
   nature of the soul is not simple but manifold, for nothing simple is
   changeable; but every created being is changeable. But God indeed is
   said to be in various ways great, good, wise, happy, true, and whatever
   else is not unworthily predicable of Him; but his greatness is the same
   as his wisdom; for he is great, not in quantity, but in quality; and
   his goodness is the same as his wisdom and greatness, and his truth the
   same as all these; and with Him the being happy is not different from
   being great, or wise, or true, or good, or from being Himself." See

   "Hence, therefore, it is evident, that nothing is called one or unique,
   except after some other has been conceived, which agrees with it. But
   since the existence of God belongs to his own essence, and of his
   essence we cannot form a universal idea, it is certain that he who
   calls God one or unique, can have no idea of God, or speaks improperly
   of Him."--Spinoza, Epist. L. Compare Schleiermacher, Christliche

   "For the expression, if it be possible,' referred not merely to the
   power of God, but also to his justice; for, as to the power of God, all
   things are possible, whether just or unjust; but as to his justice, He
   being not only powerful, but just, not all things are possible, but
   only those which are just."--Origen in St. Matt. xxvi. 42; compare c.
   Celsum, Ill. 70. Origen speaks still more strongly in a remarkable
   fragment of the De Principiis, which has been preserved in the
   original: "In that beginning (i. e., at the creation) God determined
   (to create) as great a number of intelligent beings as might be
   sufficient; for we must say that the divine power was limited, nor
   under pretence of praise take away all limitation of it; for if the
   divine power were unlimited, then, necessarily, it did not have a
   consciousness of itself." The language of Hooker (E. P. b. I. ch. 2. §
   3) is more cautious and reverent, but contains the same acknowledgment
   of what, from a human point of view, is limitation. "If, therefore, it
   be demanded why, God having power and ability infinite, the effects
   notwithstanding of that power are all so limited as we see they are;
   the reason hereof is the end which he hath proposed, and the law
   whereby his wisdom hath stinted the effects of his power in such sort,
   that it doth not work infinitely, but correspondently unto that end for
   which it worketh." Some excellent remarks on the limitation of man's
   faculties with regard to the Divine Attributes, will be found in Mr.
   Meyrick's sermon, God's Revelation and Man's Moral Sense considered in
   reference to the Sacrifice of the Cross, p. 14. See the Collection of
   Sermons on Christian Faith and the Atonement, Oxford, 1856.

   Note XXXI., p. 80.

   Thus Spinoza (Ethica, P. I. Prop. 26) says, "A thing which was
   determined to the doing of somewhat, was necessarily so determined by
   God;" and, carrying the same theory to its inevitable consequence, he
   consistently maintains (P. IV. Prop. 61) that the notion of evil only
   exists in consequence of the inadequacy of our ideas. Hegel in like
   manner (Encykl. § 35) reduces evil to a mere negation, which may be
   identified with good in the absolute. See also above, [279]Note 18, p.
   231.

   Note XXXII., p. 80.

   Plato, Rep. II. p. 381. "Does He, then, change Himself into something
   better and nobler, or into something worse and baser than Himself?
   Necessarily, said he, into something better, for we cannot say that God
   is wanting in any good or noble quality. Exactly so; and that being the
   case, does it seem to you, that any one, whether God or man, would
   voluntarily make himself worse in any respect?" Compare Augustine, In
   Joannis Evangelium, Tract. XXIII. 9. "You do not find in God any
   changeableness, anything which is different now, from what it was a
   little while ago. For where you find difference, there has taken place
   a kind of death; for that is death, the not being what (one) was.
   Whatever therefore, undergoes this sort of death, whether from the
   better to the worse, or from the worse to the better,--that is not
   God." And so Jacobi (Von den göttlichen Dingen, Werke, III. p. 391)
   says of the system of Schelling: "Consider that the one only living and
   true God (Nature) cannot become greater or less, higher or lower; but
   that this God, equivalent to Nature or the Universe, remains, from
   eternity to eternity, ever one and the same, in quality and in
   quantity. It would, therefore, be absolutely impossible for Him to
   bring about any change in Himself, without being changeableness,
   temporalness, change itself. This changeableness, however, is, we are
   told, in its root, an Unchangeable, namely, the holy, ever-creating
   original force of the world; in its fruit, on the contrary, in the real
   world, an absolutely changeable, so that in each single determined
   momentum the All of beings is nothing. Accordingly, the creative word
   of the naturalistic God is incontestibly, Let there be Nothing! He
   calls forth Not-Being from Being; as the God of theism calls forth
   Being from Not-Being." Compare Sir W. Hamilton's criticism of Cousin,
   Discussions, p. 36; and see also above, Note 23, p. 233.

   Note XXXIII., p. 81.

   "What," says Sir W. Hamilton, "is our thought of creation? It is not a
   thought of the mere springing of nothing into something. On the
   contrary, creation is conceived, and is by us conceivable, only as the
   evolution of existence from possibility into actuality, by the fiat of
   the Deity. . . . . And what is true of our concept of creation, holds
   of our concept of annihilation. We can think no real annihilation,--no
   absolute sinking of something into nothing. But as creation is
   cogitable by us, only as a putting forth of Divine power, so is
   annihilation by us only conceivable, as a withdrawal of that same
   power. All that is now actually existent in the universe, this we think
   and must think, as having, prior to creation, virtually existed in the
   Creator; and in imagining the universe to be annihilated, we can only
   conceive this, as the retractation by the Deity of an overt energy into
   latent power. In short, it is impossible for the human mind to think
   what it thinks existent, lapsing into absolute non-existence, either in
   time past or in time future." [141] With all deference to this great
   philosopher, I cannot help thinking that a different representation
   would have been more in harmony with the main principles of his own
   system. We cannot conceive creation at all, neither as a springing of
   nothing into something, nor as an evolution of the relative from the
   absolute; for the simple reason that the first terms of both
   hypotheses, nothing and the absolute, are equally beyond the reach of
   human conception. But while creation, as a process in the act of being
   accomplished, is equally inconceivable on every hypothesis, creation,
   as a result already completed, presents no insurmountable difficulty to
   human thought if we consent to abandon the attempt to apprehend the
   absolute. There is no difficulty in conceiving that the amount of
   existence in the universe may at one time be represented by A, and at
   another by A + B: though we are equally unable to conceive how B can
   come out of nothing, and how A, or any part of A, can become B while A
   remains undiminished. But the result, no less than the process, becomes
   self-contradictory, when we attempt to conceive A as absolute and
   infinite; for in that case A + B must be something greater than
   infinity.

   Note XXXIV., p. 83.

   "Pantheism teaches that all is good, for all is only one; and that
   every appearance of what we call wrong is only an empty delusion. Hence
   its disturbing influence upon the life; for here,--turn about language
   as we may, and attach ourselves as we will to the faith that everywhere
   comes forth through the voice of conscience,--yet at bottom, if we
   remain true to the destructive principle of the pantheistic doctrine,
   we must do away with and declare null and void, the eternal distinction
   between good and evil, between right and wrong."--F. Schlegel, Ueber
   die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier, b. III. c. 2. (Werke, VIII. p.
   324). "If it is God who thinks in me, my thought is absolute; not only
   am I unable to think otherwise than I do think, . . . but I can make no
   choice in my conceptions, approve or search after some, reject and shun
   others, all being necessary and perfect, all being divine; in fine, I
   become a machine for thinking, an intelligent machine, but
   irresponsiblle."--Bartholmèss, Histoire des doctrines religieuses de la
   philosophie moderne, Introduction, p. xxxvii. These necessary
   consequences of Pantheism are fully exhibited by Spinoza, Ethica, P. I.
   Prop. 26; P. II. Props. 32, 33, 34, 35; P. IV. Prop. 64. Hegel (Werke,
   XI. pp. 95, 208, 390) endeavors, not very successfully, to defend his
   own philosophy from the charge of Pantheism and its consequences. His
   defence amounts to no more than the assertion that God cannot be
   identified with the universe of finite objects, in a system in which
   finite objects have no real existence. Thus explained, the system is
   identical with Pantheism in the strictest sense of the term. All that
   is proved is, that it cannot with equal propriety be called
   Pantatheism.

   Note XXXV., p. 83.

   "The dialectic intellect, by the exertion of its own powers
   exclusively, can lead us to a general affirmation of the supreme
   reality of an absolute being. But here it stops. It is utterly
   incapable of communicating insight or conviction concerning the
   existence or possibility of the world, as different from Deity. It
   finds itself constrained to identify, more truly to confound, the
   Creator with the aggregate of his creatures, and, cutting the knot
   which it cannot untwist, to deny altogether the reality of all finite
   existence, and then to shelter itself from its own dissatisfaction, its
   own importunate queries, in the wretched evasion that of nothings no
   solution can be required: till pain haply, and anguish, and remorse,
   with bitter scoff and moody laughter inquire,--Are we then indeed
   nothings?--till through every organ of sense nature herself asks,--How
   and whence did this sterile and pertinacious nothing acquire its plural
   number?--Unde, quæso, hæc nihili in nihila tam portentosa
   transnihilatio?--and lastly:--What is that inward mirror, in and for
   which these nothings have at least relative existence? "--Coleridge,
   The Friend, vol. III. p. 213.

   Note XXXVI., p. 83.

   The limitation, speculative Atheism, is necessary; for the denial of
   the Infinite does not in every case constitute practical Atheisin. For
   it is not under the form of the Infinite that the idea of God is
   distinctly presented in worship; and it is possible to adore a superior
   Being, without positively asking how far that superiority extends. It
   is only when we are able to investigate the problem of the relation
   between the infinite and the finite, and to perceive that the latter
   cannot be regarded as expressing the true idea of the Deity, that the
   denial of the infinite becomes atheism in speculation. On the
   alternative between Christianity and Atheism, some excellent remarks
   will be found in the Restoration of Belief, p. 248.

   Note XXXVII., p. 84.

   "Much stress is wont to be laid upon the limits of thought, and it is
   asserted that the limit cannot be transcended. In this assertion lies
   the unconsciousness, that even in fixing somewhat as limit, it has
   already been transcended. For a determination, a bound, is determined
   as limit, only in opposition to its Other (alterum), its Unlimited; the
   Other (the correlate), of a limit is something beyond it."--Hegel,
   Logik (Werke, III. p. 136). Compare Encyklopädie, § 60 (Werke, VI., p.
   121). In maintaining that a limit as such always implies something
   beyond, and, consequently, that the notion of a limited universe is
   self-contradictory, Hegel is unquestionably right; but he is wrong in
   attempting to infer from thence the non-limitation of thought. For that
   which is limited is not necessarily limited by something of the same
   kind;--nay, the very conception of kinds is itself a limitation. Hence
   the consciousness that thought is limited by something beyond itself,
   by no means implies that thought itself transcends that limit. A
   prisoner chained up feels that his motion is limited, by his inability
   to move into the space which he sees or imagines beyond the length of
   his chain. On Hegel's principles, he ought to know his inability by
   actually moving into it.

   Note XXXVIII., p. 84.

   These opposite limitations fall under the general law of the
   Conditioned enunciated by Sir W. Hamilton. "The mind is astricted to
   think in certain forms; and, under these, thought is possible only in
   the conditioned interval between two unconditioned contradictory
   extremes or poles, each of which is altogether inconceivable, but of
   which, on the principle of Excluded Middle, the one or the other is
   necessarily true." [142] The lamented author has left us only a few
   fragmentary specimens of the application of this canon to the vexed
   questions of metaphysical speculation, and the principal one of these,
   in some of its details, may be open to objections; but the truth of the
   principle itself is unquestionable; and its value, rightly applied, in
   confining the inquiries of philosophy within their legitimate
   boundaries, can hardly be estimated too highly.

   Paulus, in the preface to his Leben Jesu, expressly adopts, though
   without naming the author, Kant's theory, that miracles are indifferent
   to religion, and that the whole essence of Christianity consists in
   morality. Consistently with these principles, he maintains (§ 2) that
   the historical inquirer can admit no event as credible which cannot be
   explained by natural causes. The entire details of the evangelical
   narrative are explained by this method. The miracles of healing were
   performed by medical skill, which Christ imparted to his disciples, and
   thus was enabled to heal, not by a word, but by deputy. Thus he coolly
   translates the words of the centurion, Matt. viii. 8, "If He would only
   give an order to one of His (disciples), to provide in His name for the
   healing." The feeding of the five thousand consisted merely in
   persuading the richer travellers to share their provisions with the
   poorer. The stilling of the tempest was effected by steering round a
   point which cut off the wind. Lazarus, and the widow's son of Nain,
   were both cases of premature interment. Our Lord's own death was merely
   a swoon, from which he was restored by the warmth of the sepulchre and
   the stimulating effect of the spices. Such are a few specimens of
   historical inquiry. The various explanations of Paulus are examined in
   detail, and completely refuted by Strauss. The natural hypothesis had
   to be annihilated, to make way for the mythical.

   Note XLII., p. 87.

   Wegscheider, though he expressly rejects Kant's allegorizing
   interpretations of Scripture (see Institutiones Theologiæ, § 25),
   agrees with him in maintaining the supreme authority of reason in all
   religious questions, and in accommodating all religious doctrines to
   Ethical precepts (Præf. p. viii. ix.). Accordingly, in the place of the
   allegory, he adopts the convenient theory of adaptation to the
   prejudices of the age; by which a critic is enabled at once to set
   aside all doctrines which do not harmonize with his theory. Among the
   doctrines thus rejected, as powerless for the true end of religion, and
   useless or even prejudicial to piety, are those of the Trinity, the
   Atonement, the Corruption of human nature, Justification, and the
   Resurrection of the body. See § 51.

   Note XLIII., p. 87.

   See his Grund-und-Glaubens-Sätze der Evangelisch-Protestantischen
   Kirche, p. 70 (2nd edition). This work of Röhr was principally directed
   against the Lutheran Symbolical books; but the Catholic Creeds are also
   included in his sweeping condemnations. Of the Apostles' Creed he
   observes: "Our age needs a more logically correct, and a more
   comprehensive survey of the pure evangelical faith than is afforded by
   the so-called Apostles' Creed, which is good for its immediate and
   ordinary purpose, but too short, too aphoristic, and too historical for
   that which is here proposed." (p. 49.) Of the Nicene and Athanasian
   Creeds he remarks in a note: "The Niceno-Constantinopolitan and the
   pseudo-Athanasian Creeds, with their decidedly anti-scriptural dogmas,
   are here altogether out of the question, however much they were
   admitted by the reformers, in all honesty and faith, as truly
   scriptural." Röhr agrees with Kant in separating the historical facts
   of Christianity from the religion itself (p. 157), and in maintaining
   that morality is the only mode of honoring God (p. 56). His proposed
   creed, from which everything "historical" is studiously excluded, runs
   as follows:

   "There is one true God, proclaimed to us by his only-begotten Son,
   Jesus Christ. To this God, as the most perfect of all Beings, as the
   Creator, Sustainer, and Governor of the world, and as the Father and
   Instructor of men and of all rational spirits, the deepest veneration
   is due. This veneration is best rendered by active striving after
   virtue and righteousness, by zealous control of the inclinations and
   passions of our sensual and evilly-disposed nature, and by honest,
   entire fulfilment of our duty, according to the exalted example of
   Jesus, whereby we may assure ourselves of the aid of his divine Spirit.
   In the consciousness of the filial relation into which we thereby enter
   with him, we may, in earthly need, reckon with confidence on his
   fatherly help, in the feeling of our moral weakness and unworthiness,
   upon his grace and mercy assured to us through Christ, and in the
   moment of death be assured that we shall continue to exist immortally,
   and receive a recompense in a better life."

   The celebrated Briefe über den Rationalismus, by the same author, have
   at least the merit of being an honest and logical exposition of
   Rationalist principles and their consequences, without disguise or
   compromise. The commendation, however, to which in this respect the
   work is partly entitled, cannot be extended to the concluding letter,
   in which the author endeavors to establish, for himself and his fellow
   rationalists, the right to discharge the spiritual functions, and
   subscribe to the confessions, of a church whose doctrines they
   disbelieve; and even to make use of their position to unsettle the
   faith of the young committed to their instruction.

   Note XLIV., p. 87.

   The character of Hegel's philosophy in this respect is sufficiently
   shown by Strauss, Streitschriften, Heft III. p. 57, sqq.

   Note XLV., p. 87.

   Vatke's Religion des Alten Testamentes, forms the first part of his
   Biblische Theologie wissenschaftlich dargestellt; Berlin, 1835. In the
   Introduction (§ 7, 12, 13) the author lays down a law of the
   development of religion as a process of the infinite spirit in
   self-revelation, according to the principles of the Hegelian
   philosophy. As a consequence of this law he maintains that it is
   impossible for an individual to raise himself, even by the aid of
   divine revelation, above the spiritual position of his age, or for a
   nation to rise or fall from its normal stage of religious cultivation
   (pp. 87, 181). By this canon the entire narrative of Scripture is made
   to stand or fall. The account of a primitive revelation and subsequent
   alienation from God, must be rejected, because the human consciousness
   must attain to perfection through a succession of progressive stages
   (p. 102). The book of Genesis has no historical value; and we cannot
   decide whether the patriarchs before Moses had any knowledge of the one
   true God (pp. 180, 181). Moses himself, as represented in the
   scriptural account, is altogether inconceivable; for he appears at a
   period when, according to the laws of historical development, the time
   was not yet ripe for him (p. 183). Much of the history of Moses must be
   regarded as a mythus, invented by the priests at a later period (p.
   186). The political institutions attributed to him could not possibly
   have been founded by him (p. 211). The ceremonial laws are such as
   could neither have been discovered by an individual nor made known by
   divine revelation (p. 218). The Passover was originally a feast of the
   sun, in celebration of his entering into the sign Aries; which fully
   accounts for the offering of a male lamb (p. 492). As regards the
   decalogue, the second commandment must be considered as an
   interpolation of a later date; for it implies a hither degree of
   abstraction than could have been reached in the Mosaic age (p. 234).
   The lapses into idolatry recorded in the book of Judges, are highly
   improbable; for a whole people cannot fall back from a higher to a
   lower state of religious culture (p. 181). The books of Samuel betray
   their legendary origin by the occurrence of round numbers, and by the
   significant names of the first three kings (p. 289). The wisdom
   attributed to Solomon is irreconcilable with his subsequent idolatry;
   and the account must therefore be regarded as legendary (p. 309). Such
   are a few of the results of the so-called philosophy of history,
   exercised on the narrative of Scripture. The book is valuable in one
   respect, and in one only. It shows the reckless manner in which
   rationalism finds it necessary to deal with the sacred text, before it
   can be accommodated to the antisupernatural hypothesis. To those who
   believe that a record of facts as they are is more trustworthy than a
   theory of facts as they ought to be on philosophical principles, the
   very features which the critic is compelled to reject, become
   additional evidence of the truth of the scripture narrative.

   Note XLVI., p. 87.

   The Hegelian element of Strauss's Leben Jesu is briefly exhibited at
   the end of the book (§ 150). The body of the work is mainly occupied
   with various cavils, some of them of the very minutest philosophy,
   designed to invalidate the historical character of the Gospel
   narratives. Among these precious morsels of criticism, we meet with
   such objections as the following. That the name of the angel Gabriel is
   of Hebrew origin (§ 17). That the angel, instead of inflicting dumbness
   on Zacharias, ought to have merely reprimanded him (ibid.). That a real
   angel would not have proclaimed the advent of the Messiah in language
   so strictly Jewish (§ 25). That the appearance of the star to the magi
   would have strengthened the popular belief in the false science of
   astrology (§ 34). That John the Baptist, being an ascetic, and
   therefore necessarily prejudiced and narrow-minded, could not have
   considered himself inferior to one who did not practise similar
   mortifications (§ 36). That Jesus could not have submitted to the rite
   of baptism, because that rite symbolized a future Messiah (§ 49). That
   if there is a personal devil, he cannot take a visible form (§ 54).
   That it is improbable that Jesus, when he read in the synagogue, should
   have lighted on an apposite passage of the prophet Isaiah (§ 58). That
   Jesus could not have known that the woman of Samaria had had five
   husbands, because it is not probable that each of them had left a
   distinct image in her mind, and because a minute knowledge of the
   history of individuals is degrading to the prophetic dignity (§ 60).
   That it is impossible to understand "how he, whose vocation had
   reference to the depths of the human heart, should be tempted to occupy
   himself with the fish-frequented depths of the waters" (§ 71). That
   Jesus could not have ridden into Jerusalem on an ass whereon never man
   sat, because unbroken asses are difficult to manage (§ 110). That the
   resurrection of the dead is impossible, because the inferior
   principles, whose work is corruption, will not be inclined to surrender
   back the dominion of the body to its former master, the soul (§ 140).
   That the ascension of Christ is impossible, because a body which has
   flesh and bones cannot be qualified for a heavenly abode; because it
   cannot liberate itself from the laws of gravity; and because it is
   childish to regard heaven as a definite locality (§ 142).--It is not
   creditable to the boasted enlightenment of the age, that a work which
   can seriously urge such petty quibbles as these should have obtained so
   much reputation and influence. In studying the philosophy which has
   given birth to such consequences, we see a new verification of the
   significant remark of Clemens Alexandrinus: "The philosophy, which is
   according to the divine tradition, establishes and confirms providence;
   take this away, and the Saviour's economy appears to be a myth." [143]
   "Strauss, the Hegelian theologian," says Sir W. Hamilton, "sees in
   Christianity only a mythus. Naturally: for his Hegelian Idea,' itself a
   myth, and confessedly finding itself in everything, of course finds in
   anything a myth." [144] As the labors of Strauss on the Gospel
   narratives have been sometimes compared to those of Niebuhr on the
   history of Rome, it may be instructive to peruse the opinion of the
   great historian on the cognate theories of a few years' earlier date.
   "In my opinion," writes Niebuhr in 1818, "he is not a Protestant
   Christian, who does not receive the historical facts of Christ's
   earthly life, in their literal acceptation, with all their miracles, as
   equally authentic with any event recorded in history, and whose belief
   in them is not as firm and tranquil as his belief in the latter; who
   has not the utmost faith in the articles of the Apostles' Creed, taken
   in their grammatical sense; who does not consider every doctrine and
   every precept of the New Testament as undoubted divine revelation, in
   the sense of the Christians of the first century, who knew nothing of a
   Theopneustia. Moreover, a Christianity after the fashion of the modern
   philosophers and pantheists, without a personal God, without
   immortality, without human individuality, without historical faith, is
   no Christianity at all to me; though it may be very intellectual, very
   ingenious philosophy. I have often said that I do not know what to do
   with a metaphysical God, and that I will have none but the God of the
   Bible, who is heart to heart with us." [145]

   Niebuhr did not live to witness the publication of the Leben Jesu; but
   the above passage is as appropriate as if it had been part of an actual
   review of that work.

   Note XLVII., p. 87.

   With Feuerbach's Wesen des Christenthums I am only acquainted through
   the French translation by M. Ewerbeck, which forms the principal
   portion of the volume entitled Qu'est-ce que la Religion d'après la
   nouvelle Philosophie Allemande. The following extracts will
   sufficiently show the character of the work. "The grand mystery, or
   rather the grand secret of religion, is here: man objectifies his
   being, and after having objectified it, he makes himself the object of
   this new subject." (p. 129.) "God is the notion, the personified idea
   of personality. He is the apotheosis of the human person, the I without
   the Thou, the subjectivity separate from the universe; the
   self-sufficient egoity." (p. 219.) "God is the notion of kind, but the
   notion personified and individualized in its turn; He is the notion of
   kind or its essence, and this essence as universal entity, as
   comprising all possible perfections, as possessing all human qualities
   cleared of their limitations." (p. 271.) "Where religion expresses the
   relation between man and the human essence, it is good and humanitary.
   Where it expresses the relation between man and the human essence
   changed to a supernatural being, it is illogical, false, and carries in
   it the germ of all those horrors which have been desolating society for
   sixty centuries." (p. 340.) "Atheism is the fruit of the contradiction
   in the existence of God . . . . . . we are told that God exists really
   and not really at the same time, we have then a perfect right to cut
   the matter short with such an absurd existence, and to say: there is no
   God." (p. 350.) "From the preceding we infer, that the divine
   personality, of which man avails himself to attribute his own ideas and
   his own qualities to a superhuman being, is nothing but the human
   personality externalized to the I. It is this psychological act which
   has become the basis of the speculative doctrine of Hegel, which
   teaches, that the consciousness that man has of God is the
   consciousness that God has of man." (p. 390.) The occasional notes
   which the translator has added to this work are, if possible, still
   more detestable than the text. So much disregard of truth and decency
   as is shown in some of his remarks on Christianity has probably seldom
   been compressed into the same compass.

   Note XLVIII., p. 89.

   "Christ, who taught his disciples, and us in them, how to pray,
   propounded not the knowledge of God, though without that he could not
   hear us; neither represented he his power, though without that he
   cannot help us; but comprehended all in this relation, When ye pray,
   say, Our Father."--Pearson on the Creed, article I.

LECTURE III.

   Note I., p. 93.

   "Whatever is for us something is so only so far as it is not something
   else; all position is possible only by negation; as indeed the word
   itself define means nothing else but limit."--Fichte, Gerichtliche
   Verantwortung (Werke, V. p. 265). "The Finite exists in relation to its
   Other (the other of it, alterum), which is its negation, and puts
   itself there as its limit." "Hegel, Encykl. § 28 (Werke, VI. p. 63).
   Compare Plotinus, Enn. V. 1. III. c. 12. "But that is the One itself,
   without the Something (i. e. not some one thing); for if it were the
   some one thing, then it would not be the One itself; for the One itself
   is prior to the Something."--Enn. VI. 1. VII. c. 39. "For the
   Intelligence, if it is to exercise intelligence, must always apprehend
   difference and identity." . . . . . .--Spinoza, Epist. 50. "This
   determination, therefore, does not belong to the (or a) thing In its
   own esse, but, on the contrary, belongs to its non-esse." The canon,
   undeniable from a human point of view, that all consciousness is
   limitation, seems to have had some influence on modern philosophical
   theories concerning the Divine Nature. Thus Hegel maintains that God
   must become limited to be conscious of himself, [146] and defines
   Religion as the Divine Spirit's knowledge of himself, by means of the
   finite Spirit. [147]

   Note II., p. 94.

   "For being limited (finite) ourselves, it would be absurd for us to
   make some determination of the infinite, and thus endeavor to limit it,
   as it were, and comprehend it."--Descartes, Principia, I. 26. "The
   second reason of our short and imperfect notions of the Deity is, the
   Infinity of it. For this we must observe, That we can perfectly know
   and comprehend nothing, but as it is represented to us under some
   certain Bounds and Limitations. . . . Upon which account, what a loss
   must we needs be at, in understanding or knowing the Divine Nature,
   when the very way of our knowing seems to carry in it something
   opposite to the thing known. For the way of knowing is by defining,
   limiting, and determining; and the thing known is that of which there
   neither are, nor can be, any Bounds, Limits, Definitions, or
   Determinations."--South, Animadvrersions upon Sherlock, ch. II. p. 55.
   ed. 1693. "All our thinking is a limiting; and exactly in this respect
   is it called apprehending; i. e., comprehending something from out of a
   mass of determinable; so that there always may remain something outside
   the boundary-line, which has not been included (imprehended) within
   it,--and so does not belong to that which has been
   apprehended."--Fichte, Gerichtliche Verantwortung (Werke, V. p. 265).
   "What I apprehend (or have an idea of) becomes finite by my mere
   apprehending, and this, even by endless ascending, never comes to the
   infinite."--Fichte, Bestimmung des Menschen (Werke, II. p. 304). "The
   subject without predicate is, what in the appearance the thing is
   without attributes, what the thing is in itself, an empty, undetermined
   ground; it is the notion in itself, which only in the predicate gets a
   distinction and definiteness."--Hegel, Logik, Th. II. (Werke, V. p.
   70). Compare Philosophie der Religion (Werke, XI. p. 30). Encykopädie §
   28, 29 (Werke, VI. p. 65).

   Note III., p. 94.

   The opposite sides of this contradiction are indicated in the following
   passages. Aristotle, Phys. III. 6, [10,] 13: "The Infinite . . . . is
   the whole potentially, but not actually." . . . . Compare Metaph. viii.
   [ix. Ed. Gul. Duval, Paris, 1629] 8, 16: "That, therefore, which is
   capable of being, may both be and not be; the same thing, therefore, is
   capable both of being and of not being. But that, which is capable of
   not being, may not be; and that, which may not be, is corruptible. . .
   . . Nothing, therefore, of things simply incorruptible, is potentially
   simply being." For a full discussion of the distinction between
   potentiality and actuality (the dunamis and entelecheia or energeia of
   Aristotle), see Trendelenburg on Arist. De Anima, p. 295. Compare
   Arist. Metaph. viii. [ix. Ed. Gul. Duval.] 6, 2: "It is actuality when
   a thing is really so, not as when we say potentially. For we say
   potentially as (of) the Hermes in the wood, and the half in the whole,
   because it might be taken out; and so, too, a learned man, of one who
   is not really versed in learning, if he have the capacity for
   learning.". . . . This distinction plays a part in the controversy
   between Bramhall and Hobbes, the former of whom says, "The nearer that
   anything comes to the essence of God, the more remote it is from our
   apprehension. But shall we, therefore, make potentialities and
   successive duration, and former and latter, or a part without a part
   (as they say), to be in God? Because we are not able to understand
   clearly the Divine perfection, we must not therefore attribute any
   imperfection to Him." [148] To this Hobbes replies, "Nor do I
   understand what derogation it can be to the divine perfection, to
   attribute to it potentiality, that is, in English, power." [149] "By
   potentiality," retorts Bramhall, "he understandeth power' or might;
   others understand possibility or indetermination. Is not he likely to
   confute the Schoolmen to good purpose?" [150] Hobbes concludes by
   saying, "There is no such word as potentiality in the Scriptures, nor
   in any author of the Latin tongue. It is found only in School divinity,
   as a word of art, or rather as a word of craft, to amaze and puzzle the
   laity." [151] This charge may be answered in the words of
   Trendelenburg. "In unfolding these notions, drawn forth from the very
   recess of philosophy, we are forced into such straits by the laxness
   and the poverty of the Latin tongue in matters pertaining to
   philosophy, that we must have recourse, for the sake of perspicuity, to
   scholastic terms." [152]

   But to go from the word to the thing. The contradiction thus involved
   in the notion of the Infinite has given rise to two opposite
   representations of it; the one, as the affirmation of all reality; the
   other, as the negation of all reality. The older metaphysicians
   endeavored to exhaust the infinite by an endless addition of
   predicates; hence arose the favorite representation of God, as the Ens
   perfectissimum, or sum of all realities, which prevailed in the Wolfian
   Philosophy, and was accepted by Kant. [153] On the other hand, the
   post-Kantian metaphysicians perceived clearly that all predication is
   necessarily limitation, and that to multiply attributes is merely to
   represent the infinite under a variety of finite determinations. The
   consummation of this point of view was attained in the principle of
   Hegel, that pure being is pure nothing, and that all determinate being
   (Daseyn) is necessarily limited. [154] Hence his constant assertion
   that God cannot be represented by predicates. [155] Both schools of
   philosophy are right in what they deny, and wrong in what they affirm.
   The earlier metaphysicians were right in assuming that thought is only
   possible by means of definite conceptions; but they were wrong in
   supposing that any multiplication of such conceptions can amount to a
   representation of the infinite. The later metaphysicians were right in
   opposing this error; but they fell into the opposite extreme of
   imagining that by the removal of determinations the act of thought and
   its object could become infinite. In truth, a thought about nothing is
   no thought at all; and the rejection of determinations is simply the
   refusal to think. The conclusion to be drawn from the entire
   controversy is, that the infinite, as such, is not an object of human
   thought.

   "The adding infinity to any idea or conception necessarily finite,
   makes up no other than a curious contradiction for a divine attribute.
   . . . You make up an attribute of knowledge or wisdom infinitely

   human body."--Bp. Browne, Divine Analogy, p. 77. "Discovering
   conditions of the Unconditioned, inventing a possibility for the

   (Werke, IV. Abth. II. p. 153). "Thou art different from the finite, not
   only in degree, but in kind. They only make Thee by that upward

   "For, if we should suppose a man to be made with clear eyes, and all
   the rest of his organs of sight well disposed, but endued with no other
   sense; and that he should look only upon one thing, which is always of
   the same color and figure, without the least appearance of variety, lie
   would seem to me, whatsoever others might say, to see, no more than I
   seem to myself to feel the bones of my own limbs by my organs of
   feeling; and yet those bones are always, and on all sides, touched by a
   most sensible membrane. I might perhaps say he were astonished, and
   looked upon it; but I should not say he saw it; it being almost all one
   for a man to be always sensible of one and the same thing, and not to
   be sensible at all." Hobbes, Elem. Phil. (Eng. Works), Sect. I. P. IV.

   Note VI., p. 95.

   The paradox of Hegel, if applied, where alone we have any data for
   applying( it, to the necessary limits of human thought, becomes no
   paradox at all, but an obvious truth, almost a truism. Our conceptions
   are limited to the finite and the determinate; and a thought which is
   not of any definite object, is but the negation of all thinking.
   Hegel's error consists in mistaking an impotence of thought for a
   condition of existence. That pure being is in itself pure nothing, is
   more than we can be warranted in assuming; for we have no conception of
   pure being at all, and no means of judging of the possibility of its
   existence. The absurdity becomes still more glaring, when this pure
   nothing is represented as containing in itself a process of
   self-development,--when being and non-being, which are absolutely one
   and the same, are regarded at the same time as two opposite elements,
   which, by their union, constitute becoming, and thus give rise to
   finite existence. But this absurdity is unavoidable in a system which
   starts with the assumption that thought and being are identical, and
   thus abolishes at the outset the possibility of distinguishing between
   the impotence of thought and its activity.

   Note VII., p. 96.

   Über den Grund unseres Glaubens an eine göttliche Weltregierung (Werke,
   V. p. 186). In a subsequent work written in defence of this opinion,
   Fichte explains himself as meaning that existence, as a conception of
   sensible origin, cannot be ascribed to God. [156] That the conception
   of existence is, like all other human representations, incompetent to
   express the nature of the Absolute, has been frequently admitted, by
   philosophers and theologians. Thus, Plato describes the supreme good
   "as not existence, but as above existence, and superior to it in
   dignity and power:" [157] and his language is borrowed by Justin Martyr
   and Athanasius, to express the absolute nature of God; [158] Plotinus
   in like manner says that "the One is above being;" [159] and Schelling,
   the Plotinus of Germany, asserts that the Absolute in its essence is
   neither ideal nor real, neither thought nor being. [160] This position
   is perfectly tenable so long as it is confessed that the Absolute is
   not the object of theological or philosophical speculation, and,
   consequently, that the provinces of thought and existence are not
   coextensive. But without this safeguard, there is no middle course
   between an illogical theology and an atheistical logic. The more pious
   minds will take refuge in mysticism, and seek to reach the absolute by
   a superhuman process: the more consistent reasoners will rush into the
   opposite extreme, and boldly conclude that that which is inconceivable
   is also non-existent.

   Note VIII., p. 96.

   Sextus Empiricus, Adv. Math. VII. 311. "If the subject that knows is
   the whole, then there will be no object that is known; and it belongs
   to the most irrational of things, that there be that which knows, and
   there be not, that which is known."--Plotinus, Enn. V. III. 10. "It
   must be, then, that that which has intelligence, be in duality when it
   exercises intelligence, and that either one of the two be outside it,
   or that both be in it, and that intelligence always have to do with
   alterity (difference)."--Compare Hegel, Philosophie der Religion
   (Werke, XI. p. 167). "In the consciousness, so far as I have knowledge
   of an object, I know it as my Other (or the Other of me), and hence
   myself limited by it and finite.--"Marheineke, Grundlehren, § 84. "But
   this comes to pass thus: in the absolute idea, in which science takes
   its stand-point, the subject is not different from the object, but just
   as it (i. e. the absolute idea) is the idea of the Absolute, as object,
   so also is the object in it, as the absolute idea, subject, and
   therefore the absolute idea is not different from God Himself."

   Note IX., p. 97.

   In exhibiting the two universal conditions of human consciousness, that
   of difference between objects, and that of relation between object and
   subject, I have considered each with reference to its more immediate
   and obvious application; the former being viewed in connection with the
   Infinite, and the latter with the Absolute. But at the same time it is
   obvious that the two conditions are so intimately connected together,
   and the ideas to which they relate so mutually involved in each other,
   that either argument might be employed with equal force in the other
   direction. For difference is a relation, as well as a limit; that which
   is one out of many being related to the objects from which it is
   distinguished. And the subject and object of consciousness, in like
   manner, are not only related to, but distinguished from, each other;
   and thus each is a limit to the other: while, if either of them could
   be destroyed, a conception of the infinite by the finite would be still
   impossible; for either there would be no infinite to be conceived, or
   there would be no finite to conceive it.

   The three Laws of Thought, commonly acknowledged by logicians, those of
   Identity, Contradiction, and Excluded Middle, are but the above two
   conditions viewed in relation to a given notion. For in the first
   place, every definite notion, as such, is discerned in the two
   relations of identity and difference, as being that which it is, and as
   distinguished from that which it is not. These two relations are
   expressed by the Laws of Identity and Contradiction. And in the second
   place, a notion is distinguished from all that it is not (A from
   not-A), by means of the mutual relation of both objects to a common
   subject, the universe of whose consciousness is constituted by this
   distinction. This mutual relation is expressed by the Law of Excluded
   Middle.

   Note X., p. 97.

   "Though we cannot fully comprehend the Deity, nor exhaust the
   infiniteness of its perfection, yet may we have an idea or conception
   of a Being absolutely perfect; such a one as is nostro modulo
   conformis, agreeable and proportionate to our measure and scantling;'
   as we may approach near to a mountain, and touch it with our hands,
   though we cannot encompass it all round, and enclasp it within our
   arms."--Cudworth, Intellectual System, ch. 5 (vol. II. p. 518, ed.
   Harrison). "We grant that the mind is limited, but does it thence
   follow that the object of thought must be limited? We think not. We
   grant that the mind cannot embrace the Infinite, but we nevertheless
   consider that the mind may have a notion of the Infinite. No more do we
   believe that the mind, as finite, can only recognize finite objects,
   than we believe that the eve, because limited in its power, can only
   recognize those objects whose entire extension comes within the range
   of vision. As well tell us that because a mountain is too large for the
   eye of a mole, therefore the mole can recognize no mountain: as well
   tell us that because the world is too large for the eye of a man,
   therefore man can recognize no world,--as tell us that because the
   Infinite cannot be embraced by the finite mind, therefore the mind can
   recognize no Infinite."--Calderwood, Philosophy of the Infinite, p. 12.
   The illustrations employed by both authors are unfortunate. The part of
   the mountain touched by the hand of the man, or seen by the eye of the
   mole, is, ex hypothesi, as a part of a larger object, imperfect,
   relative, and finite. And the world, which is confessedly too large for
   the eye of a man, must, in its unseen portion, be apprehended, not by
   sight, but by some other faculty. If, therefore, the Infinite is too
   large for the mind of man, it can only be recognized by some other
   mind, or by some faculty in man which is not mind. But no such faculty
   is or can be assumed. In admitting that we do not recognize the
   Infinite in its entire extension, it is admitted that we do not
   recognize it as infinite. The attempted distinction is sufficiently
   refuted in the words of Bishop Browne. "If it is said that we may then
   apprehend God directly, though not comprehend him; that we may have a
   direct and immediate knowledge partly, and in some degree; and though
   not of his Essence, yet of the Perfections flowing from it: I answer,
   That all the Attributes and Perfections of God are in their real Nature
   as infinite as his very Essence; so that there can be no such thing as
   having a direct view of him in part; for whatever is in God is equally
   Infinite. If God is to be apprehended at all by any direct and
   immediate idea, he must be apprehended as Infinite; and in that very
   act of the mind, he would be comprehended; and there is no medium
   between apprehending an Infinite Being directly and analogically."
   [161]

   Note XI., p. 100.

   The brevity with which this argument is necessarily expressed in the
   text, may render a few words of explanation desirable. Of course it is
   not meant that no period of time can be conceived, except in a time
   equally long; for this would make a thousand years as inconceivable as
   an eternity. But though there is nothing inconceivable in the notion of
   a thousand years or any other large amount of time, such a notion is
   conceivable only under the form of a portion of time, having other time
   before and after it. An infinite duration, on the other hand, can only
   be conceived as having no time before or after it, and hence as having
   no relation or resemblance to any amount of finite time, however great.
   The mere conception of an indefinite duration, bounding every
   conceivable portion of time, is thus wholly distinct from that of
   infinite duration; for infinity can neither bound nor be bounded by any
   duration beyond itself.

   This distinction has perhaps not been sufficiently observed by an able
   and excellent writer of the present day, in a work, the principal
   portions of which are worthy of the highest commendation. Dr. McCosh
   argues in behalf of a positive conception of infinity, in opposition to
   the theory of Sir W. Hamilton, in the following manner: "To whatever
   point we go out in imagination, we are sure that we are not at the
   limits of existence; nay, we believe that, to whatever farther point we
   might go, there would be something still farther on." "Such," he
   continues, "seems to us to be the true psychological nature of the
   mind's conviction in regard to the infinite. It is not a mere impotence
   to conceive that existence, that time or space, should cease, but a
   positive affirmation that they do not cease." [162] To this argument it
   may be objected, in the first place, that this "something still farther
   on" is not itself primarily an object of conception, but merely the
   boundary of conception. It is a condition unavoidable by all finite
   thought, that whatever we conceive must be related to something else
   which we do not conceive. I think of a thousand years as bounded by a
   further duration beyond it. But if, secondarily, we turn our attention
   to this boundary itself, it is not then actually conceived as either
   limited or unlimited on its remoter side; we do not positively think of
   it as having no boundary; we only refrain from thinking of it as having
   a boundary. It is thus presented to us as indefinite, but not as
   infinite. And the result will be the same, if to our conception of a
   thousand years we add cycle upon cycle, till we are wearied with the
   effort. An idea which we tend towards, but never reach, is indefinite,
   but not infinite; for, at whatever point we rest, there are conditions
   beyond, which remain unexhausted.

   In the second place, even if we could positively perceive this further
   duration as going on forever, we should still be far removed from the
   conception of infinity. For such a duration is given to us as bounding
   and bounded by our original conception of a thousand years; it is
   limited at its nearer extremity, though unlimited at the other. If this
   be regarded as infinite, we are reduced to the self-contradictory
   notion of infinity related to a time beyond itself. Is a thousand
   years, plus its infinite boundary, greater than that boundary alone, or
   not? If it is, we have the absurdity of a greater than the infinite. If
   it is not, the original conception of a thousand years, from relation
   to which that of infinity is supposed to arise, is itself reduced to a
   nonentity, and cannot be related to anything. This contradiction may be
   avoided, if we admit that Oour conception of time, as bounded, implies
   an apprehension of the indefinite, but not of the infinite.

   But possibly, after all, the difference between Dr. McCosh's view and
   that of Sir W. Hamilton, may be rather verbal than real. For the
   subsequent remarks of the former are such as might be fully accepted by
   the most uncompromising adherent of the latter. "The mind seeks in vain
   to embrace the infinite in a positive image, but is constrained to
   believe, when its efforts fail, that there is a something to which no
   limits can be put." All that need practically be contended for by the
   supporters of the negative theory is, first, that this inability to
   assign limits indicates directly only an indefiniteness in our manner
   of thinking, but not necessarily an infinity in the object about which
   we think; and, secondly, that our indirect belief in the infinite,
   whether referred to an impotence or to a power of mind, is not of such
   a character that we can deduce from it any logical consequences
   available in philosophy or in theology. The sober and reverent tone of
   religious thought which characterizes Dr. McCosh's writings, warrants
   the belief that he would not himself repudiate these conclusions.

   Note XII., p. 100.

   For the antagonist theories of a beginning of time itself, and of an
   eternal succession in them, see Plato, Timæus, p. 37, 38, and
   Aristotle, Phys. VIII. 1. The two theories are ably contrasted in Prof.
   Butler's Lectures on the History of Ancient Philosophy, vol. II. p. 185
   sqq. Plato does not appear to regard the beginning of time as the
   beginning of material existence, but only of the sensible phenomena of
   matter. The insensible substratum of the phenomena seems to have been
   regarded by him as coeternal with the Deity. [163] It has been
   conjectured, indeed, that to this matter was attributed a perpetual
   existence in successive duration, as distinguished from the existence
   of the Deity, in a manner devoid of all succession. [164] This
   hypothesis perhaps relieves the theory from the apparent paradox of an
   existence before time (before being itself a temporal relation), but it
   cannot be easily reconciled with the language of Plato; and moreover,
   it only avoids one paradox by the introduction of another,--that of a
   state of existence out of time contemporaneous with one in time.

   . . . . "Nor can eternity be defined by time, or have any relation to
   time."--Spinoza, Ethica, P. V. Prop. 23. "Eternity, in the pure sense
   of the word, can be explained by no duration of time, even supposing we
   take this as endless (indefinite). Duration is an undetermined
   continuation of existence, which in every moment bears with it a
   measure of transientness, of the future as of the past."--Herder, Gott
   (Werke, VIII. p. 140). "In so far as the I is eternal, it has no
   duration at all. For duration is thinkable only in relation to objects.
   We speak of an eternity [sempiternity] of duration (æviternitas) i. e.
   of an existence in all time, but eternity in the pure sense of the word
   (æternitas) is Being in no time." Schelling, Vom Ich, § 15. Cognate to,
   or rather identical with, these speculations, is the theory advocated
   by Mr. Maurice (Theological Essays, p. 422 sqq.), "that eternity is not
   a lengthening out or continuation of time; that they are generically
   different."

   Note XVII., p. 101.

   In the acute and decisive criticism of Schelling by Sir W. Hamilton,
   this objection is urged with great effect. "We cannot, at the same
   moment, be in the intellectual intuition and in common consciousness;
   we must therefore be able to connect them by an act of memory--of
   recollection. But how can there be a remembrance of the Absolute and
   its Intuition? As out of time, and space, and relation, and difference,
   it is admitted that the Absolute cannot be construed to the
   understanding. But as remembrance is only possible under the conditions
   of the understanding, it is consequently impossible to remember
   anything anterior to the moment when we awaken into consciousness; and
   the clairvoyance of the Absolute, even granting its reality, is thus,
   after the crisis, as if it had never been."--Discussions, p. 23.

   Note XVIII., p. 101.

   See Augustine, In Joann. Evang. Tract. XXXVIII. 10. "Think of God, you
   will find a present (an Is) in which the past and future cannot be. In
   order, therefore, that you also may be, transcend time. But who shall
   transcend time by his own powers? He will raise you to it, who said to
   the Father, "I will that they also be with me where I am." This precept
   has found great favor with mystical theologians. Thus Eckart, in a
   sermon published among those of Tauler, says, "Nothing hinders the soul
   so much in its knowledge of God as time and place. Time and place are
   parts, and God is one; therefore, if our soul is to know God, it must
   know him above time and place." [165] And the author of the Theologia
   Germanica, c. 7: "If the soul shall see with the right eye into
   eternity, then the left eye must close itself and refrain from working,
   and be as though it were dead. For if the left eye be fulfilling its
   office towards outward things; that is, holding converse with time and
   its creatures; then must the right eye be hindered in its working; that
   is, in its contemplation." [166] So too Swedenborg, in his Angelic
   Wisdom concerning Divine Providence, § 48: "What is infinite in itself
   and eternal in itself is divine, can be seen, and yet cannot be seen by
   men: it can be seen by those who think of infinite not from space, and
   of eternal not from time; but cannot be seen by those who think of
   infinite and eternal from space and time." [167] In the same spirit
   sings Angelus Silesius:

   "Mensch, wo du deinen Geist schwingst über Ort und Zeit,
   So kannst du jeden Blick sein in der Ewigkeit." [168]

   The modern German mysticism is in this respect nowise behind the
   earlier. Schelling says of his intuition of the Absolute, "The pure
   self-consciousness is an act which lies beyond all time, and posits all
   time." [169] And again, "But since in the Absolute thinking is entirely
   one with the intuition, so will all things not merely as endless, by
   their conceptions, but eternal by their ideas, and without any
   relation, even of opposition, to time, and with absolute unity of
   potentiality and actuality, be expressed in it, as the highest unity of
   thought and intuition." [170] Schleiermacher (Christliche Glaube, § 52)
   endeavors to find something analogous to the Divine Eternity, in the
   timeless existence of the personal self, as the permanent subject of
   successive modes of consciousness. The analogy, however, fails in two
   respects; first, because the permanent self cannot be contemplated
   apart from its successive modes, but is discerned only in relation to
   them; and, secondly, because, though not itself subject to the
   condition of succession, it is still in time under that of duration.
   Kant truly remarks on all such mystical efforts to transcend time: "All
   solely on this account, that men may at last rejoice over an eternal
   rest, which makes out their imagined happy end of all things; properly
   an idea, along with which their understanding is gone, and all thinking
   itself comes to an end." [171]

   Note XIX., p. 101.

   This is directly admitted by Fichte, who says, in his earliest work,
   "How the infinite Mind may contemplate its existence and its
   attributes, we cannot know, without being the infinite Mind ourselves."
   [172] But of the two alternatives which this important admission
   offers, Fichte himself, in his subsequent writings, as well as his
   successors in philosophy, chose the wrong one. See above, [280]Lecture
   I. Note 29.

   "Look into the dictionaries for the usage of the words Person,

   something peculiar or special under a certain appearance; a subordinate
   idea, which does not belong to the Infinite.". . . . Herder, Gott
   (Werke, VIII. p. 199). "What then do you call personality and
   consciousness? that certainly which you have found in yourselves, which
   you have become acquainted with in yourselves, and have designated with
   this name. But the least attention to your construction of this notion
   can teach you, that you absolutely do not and cannot have this thought
   without limitation andl finiteness." Fichte, Ueber göttliche
   Weltregierung (Werke, V. p. 187). Schleiermacher, in like manner, in
   his second Discourse on Religion, offers a half apology for Pantheism,
   on the ground of the limitation implied in the notions of personality
   and consciousness. [173] And Strauss remarks: "As persons, we know
   ourselves only in distinction from other persons of the same kind, from
   whom we distinguish ourselves, and of course, too, as finite; it
   appears, consequently, that the notion of personality loses all
   significance beyond this province of the finite, and that a being, who
   has no other besides himself of his own kind, cannot be a person at
   all."--Christliche Glaubenslehre, I. p. 504.

   qualities of this substance; but not so is it in that ineffable and
   simple nature. For what there seems to be said of qualities must be
   understood of substance or essence. For God is far from being called
   Spirit as to substance, and good as to quality; but both of these as to
   substance . . . . although in God justice is one with goodness, with
   happiness, and the being Spirit is one with being just and good and
   happy."--lbid. VI. c. 4. Compare Aquinas, Summa, P. I. Qu. XL. Art. I:
   . . . . "Because the divine simplicity excludes the composition of form
   and matter, it follows, that in divine things, the abstract and the
   concrete is one with the Deity and God. And because the divine
   simplicity excludes the composition of subject and accident, it follows
   that the attributes of God are one with his essential being; and
   therefore wisdom and virtue are identical in God, because both are in
   the divine essence." See also above, [281]Lecture II. Note 27.

   One transcends goodness; . . . . nor intelligence . . nor motion, for
   it is prior to intelligence, to motion." . . . . Spinoza, Eth. P. I.
   Prop. 17. Schol. "If intelligence belongs to the divine nature, it
   cannot be, as our intelligence, posterior to or coëxistent with the
   objects of intelligence, since God is in causality prior to all things;
   but on the contrary reality and the formal essence of things is on that
   account such, because as such it exists objectively in the Divine Mind.
   . . . . Since, therefore, the Divine Intelligence is the one and the
   only cause of things, indeed (as we have shown) as much of their
   essence as of their existence, He Himself ought necessarily to differ
   from them as much in respect to essence as to existence. . . . . And
   yet the Intelligence of God is the cause both of the essence and of the
   existence of our intelligence; therefore the Intelligence of God, so
   far as it is conceived to constitute the divine essence, differs from
   our intelligence, in respect alike to essence and to existence." . . .

   same with that of Hegel himself. See above, Lecture I, [282]notes 29,

   Ansem, Monolog. c. 66. "Without doubt, in all investigations into the

   mind alone among all created things can rise to the investigation of
   this essential being, this alone can avail to the discovery of it."
   Compare Aquinas, Summa, P. I. Qu. XXIX. Art. 3. "Person signifies that
   which is most perfect in all nature, or a subsistence in a rational
   nature. Hence, since all which belongs to perfection, must be
   attributed to God because his essence contains in itself all
   perfection,--it is fitting that this name person, be used of God, yet
   not in the same way in which it is used of creatures, but in a more
   excellent way; just as other names are ascribed to God, which are put
   by us upon created beings." And Jacobi, at the conclusion of an
   eloquent denunciation of the Pantheism of his own day, truly observes,
   "A being without self-being is entirely and universally impossible. But
   a self-being without consciousness, and again a consciousness without
   self-consciousness, without substantiality and at least an implied
   personality, is just as impossible; the one as well as the other is but
   empty words. And so God is not in being, He is, in the highest sense,
   the Not-being, if He is not a Spirit; and He is not a Spirit, if he is
   wanting in the fundamental quality of Spirit, self-consciousness,
   substantiality and personality." [174] In the same spirit, and with a
   just recognition of the limits of human thought, M. Bartholmèss says,
   "He who refuses to take some traits of resemblance from the moral part
   of the world will be forced to take them from the physical part, the
   mathematical, the logical; he will make God after the image of the
   material world,--after the image of a geometrical magnitude or
   arithmetical,--after the image of a logical abstraction. Always, in
   lifting himself to the Creator, he will rest upon some part or other of
   the creation." [175] To the same effect, a distinguished living writer
   of our own country observes, "The worshipper carried through the long
   avenues of columns and statues, and the splendid halls of the ancient
   temple of Egyptian Thebes, was not conducted at last to a more
   miserable termination, when in the inner shrine he found one of the
   lower animals, than the follower of a modern philosopher, when
   conducted through processes, laws, and developments, to a divinity who
   has less of separate sensation, consciousness, and life, than the very
   brutes which Egypt declared to be its gods." [176]

   Pensées, P. I. Art. IV. § 6. In like manner, in another passage, Pascal
   says, "All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth, kingdoms,--are
   not equal to the most insignificant spirit; for such a spirit knows all
   these, and itself; but the body, nothing." [177]

   The following spirited translation of Jacobi [178] is from the pen of
   Sir W. Hamilton, and occurs in the second of his Lectures on
   Metaphysics, just published. The entire Lecture from which it is taken
   constitutes a forcible and admirably illustrated argument to the same
   effect. "Nature conceals God: for through her whole domain Nature
   reveals only fate, only an indissoluble chain of mere efficient causes
   without beginning and without end, excluding, with equal necessity,
   both providence and chance. An independent agency, a free original
   commencement, within her sphere and proceeding from her powers, is
   absolutely impossible. Working without will, she takes counsel neither
   of the good nor of the beautiful; creating nothing, she casts off from
   her dark abyss only eternal transformations of herself, unconsciously
   and without an end; furthering with the same ceaseless industry decline
   and increase, death and life,--never producing what alone is of God and
   what supposes liberty,--the virtuous, the immortal. Man reveals God:
   for Man by his intelligence rises above nature, and in virtue of this
   intelligence is conscious of himself, as a power not only independent
   of, but opposed to, nature, and capable of resisting, conquering, and
   controlling her. As man has a living faith in this power, superior to
   nature, which dwells in him, so has he a belief in God; a feeling, an
   experience of his existence. As he does not believe in this power, so
   does he not believe in God: he sees, he experiences naught in existence
   but nature,--necessity,--fate."--Hamilton's Lectures on Metaphysics,
   Am. Edition, p. 29.

   Note XXV., p. 105.

   Descartes, Discours de la Méthode, P. IV., Principia, P. I. § 7. That
   the Cartesian cogito, ergo sum, is not intended as a syllogism, in
   which thought and existence are two distinct attributes, but as a
   statement of the fact, that personal existence consists in
   consciousness, has been sufficiently shown by M. Cousin, in his Essay
   "Sur le vrai sens du cogito, ergo sum." The same view has been well
   stated by Mr. Veitch, in the introduction to his translation of the
   Discours de la Méthode, p. xxii. M. Bartholmèss (Histoire des doctrines
   religieuses, I. p. 23) happily renders ergo by c'est-à-dire. It must be
   remembered, however, that the cogito of Descartes is not designed to
   express the phenomena of reflection alone, but is coëxtensive with the
   entire consciousness. This is expressly affirmed in the Principia, P.
   I. § 9. "By the word cogitatio I understand all the objects of our
   consciousness. And so not only to understand, to will, to imagine, but
   also to perceive,--all are meant by cogitare." The dictum, thus
   extended, may perhaps be advantageously modified by disengaging the
   essential from the accidental features of consciousness; but its main
   principle remains unshaken; namely, that our conception of real
   existence, as distinguished from appearance, is derived from, and
   depends upon, the distinction between the one conscious subject and the
   several objects of which he is conscious. The rejection of
   consciousness, as the primary constituent of substantive existence,
   constitutes Spinoza's point of departure from the principles of
   Descartes, and, at the same time, the fundamental error of his system.
   Spinoza in fact transfers the notion of substance, which is originally
   derived from the consciousness of personality, and has no positive
   significance out of that consciousness, to the absolute, which exists
   and is conceived by itself,--an object to whose existence consciousness
   bears no direct testimony, and whose conception involves a
   self-contradiction.

   Note XXVI., p. 105.

   "I am, that I am. This decisive utterance establishes all. Its echo in
   the human soul is the revelation of God in it. What makes man man, i.
   e., makes him the image of God, is called Reason. This begins with
   the--I am. . . . . Reason without personality is non-entity, the like
   non-entity with that original cause,--which is All and not One, or One
   and None, the perfection of the imperfect, the absolutely
   Undetermined--called God by those who will have no knowledge of the
   true God, but yet shrink from denying Him--with the lips."--Jacobi, Von
   den göttlichen Dingen (Werke, III. p. 418).

   Note XXVII., p. 106.

   For notices of Schelling's philosophy in this respect, see Bartholmèss
   Histoire des doctrines religieuses, II. p. 116, and Willm, Histoire de
   la Philosophie Allemande, III. p. 318. "The school of Schelling," says
   M^me de Stael, "supposes that the individual perishes in us, but that
   the inward qualities, which we possess, reënter into the grand whole of
   the eternal creation. This immortality has a terrible resemblance to
   death." [179] Schelling's views on this point are more completely
   developed by his disciple Blasche, in his Philosophische
   Unsterblichkeitlehre, especially §§ 18, 55, 56, 72. The tendency of
   Hegel's teaching is in the same direction; the individual being with
   him only an imperfect and insignificant phase of the universal: [180]
   and a personal immortality, though not openly denied, seems excluded by
   inference; an inference which his successors have not hesitated to
   make. [181] Schleiermacher concludes his Second Discourse on Religion
   with these remarkable words: "The final aim of a religious life is not
   the immortality, which many wish for and believe in, or only pretend to
   believe in . . . . not that beyond time or rather after this time, but
   yet in time, but the immortality, which we can have immediate in this
   temporal life,--and which is a problem in the solution of which we are
   ever employed. In the midst of the finite to be one with the infinite,
   and be eternal in every instant,--that is the immortality of religion."
   And later, in his Christliche Glaube, § 158, while admitting that the
   belief in a personal immortality follows naturally from the doctrine of
   the twofold nature of Christ, he notwithstanding thinks it necessary to
   apologize for those who reject this belief on pantheistic principles:
   "For from this point of view, it may be alike maintained, on the one
   hand, that the consciousness of God makes up the essential nature of
   every life which in the higher sense is self-conscious or rational, on
   the other hand, however, that, while the Spirit in this productivity is
   essentially immortal, yet the individual soul is only a transient
   action of this productivity, and so is also essentially perishable. . .
   . . With such a renunciation of the continuation of personality, would
   a supremacy of the consciousness of God perfectly agree." Mr. Atkinson,
   from the side of materialism, arrives at a similar conclusion: "What
   more noble and glorious than a calm and joyful indifference about self
   and the future, in merging the individual in the general good,--the
   general good in universal nature." [182] And M. Comte comes forward
   with his substitute of "subjective immortality," i. e., being
   remembered by other people, as a far nobler and truer conception of a
   future life than that held by theologians. [183] But the most
   systematic and thoroughgoing exponent of this philosophy is
   Schopenhauer. With him, the species is the exhibition in time of the
   idea or real being, of which the individual is but the finite and
   transient expression. [184] In the same sense in which the individual
   was generated from nothing, he returns to nothing by death. [185] To
   desire a personal immortality is to desire to perpetuate an error to
   infinity; for individual existence is the error from which it should be
   the aim of life to extricate ourselves. [186] Judaism, which teaches a
   creation out of nothing, consistently asserts that death is
   annihilation; while Christianity has borrowed its belief in immortality
   from India, and inconsistently engrafted it on a Jewish stem. [187] The
   true doctrine however is not to be found in these, but in the Indian
   Vedas, whose superior wisdom can only be ascribed to the fact, that
   their authors, living nearer, in point of time, to the origin of the
   human race, comprehended more clearly and profoundly the true nature of
   things. [188] As a relief from this desolating pantheism, it is
   refreshing to turn to the opposite language of Neander. "Man could not
   become conscious of God as his God, if he were not a personal spirit,
   divinely allied, and destined for eternity, an eternal object (as an
   individual) of God; and thereby far above all natural and perishable
   beings, whose perpetuity is that of the species, not the individual.
   [189]

   Note XXVIII., p. 106.

   We have great reason to find fault with the strange manner of some men,
   who are ever vexing themselves with the discussion of ill-conceived
   matters. They seek for that which they know, and know not that for
   which they seek."--Leibnitz, Nouveaux Essais, L. II. Ch. 21. § 14.

   Note XXIX., p. 106.

   See the acute criticism of the Kantian distinction between things and
   phenomena, by M. Willm, in his Histoire de la Philosophie Allemande,
   Vol. I. p. 177. "It is not necessary to admit, that what interposes
   between the objects and the reason alters and falsifies, so to say, the
   view of the objects; and it may be that the laws of the mind are at the
   same time the laws of things as they are. Hegel has justly said, that
   it were quite possible, that after having penetrated behind the scene,
   which is open before us, we should find nothing there; we may add, that
   it is possible, that this veil--which seems to cover the picture, and
   which we are striving to lift--may be the picture itself." Kant
   unquestionably went too far, in asserting that things in themselves are
   not as they appear to our faculties: the utmost that his premises could
   warrant him in asserting is, that we cannot tell whether they are so or
   not. And even this degree of skepticism, though tenable as far as
   external objects are concerned, cannot legitimately be extended to the
   personal self. I exist as I am conscious of existing; and this
   conscious self is itself the Ding an sich, the standard by which all
   representations of personality must be judged, and from which our
   notion of reality, as distinguished from appearance, is originally
   derived. To this extent Jacobi's criticism of Kant is just and
   decisive. "All our philosophizing is a struggle to get behind the form
   of the thing; i. e., to get to the thing itself; but how is this
   possible, since then we must get behind ourselves, behind all
   nature,--things, behind their origin?" [190]

   Note XXX., p. 108.

   The Intellectual Intuition of Schelling has been noticed above. See
   notes 16, 17, 18, pp. 77 sqq. The method of Hegel, in its aim identical
   with that of Schelling, differs from it chiefly in making thought,
   instead of intuition, the instrument of reaching the Absolute. As
   Schelling assumes the possibility of an intuition superior to time and
   difference, so Hegel postulates the existence of a logical process
   emancipated from the laws of identity and contradiction. The
   Understanding and the Reason are placed in sharp antagonism to each
   other. The one is a faculty of finite thinking, subject to the ordinary
   laws of thought: the other is a faculty of infinite thinking, to which
   those laws are inapplicable. Hence the principles of Identity, of
   Contradiction, and of Excluded Middle are declared to be valid merely
   for the abstract understanding, from which reason is distinguished by
   the principle of the Identity of Contradictories. [191] But this
   assertion, indispensable as it is to Hegel's system, involves more
   consequences than the author himself would be willing to admit. The
   important admission, that an infinite object of thought can only be
   apprehended by an infinite act of thinking, involves the conclusion,
   that the understanding and the reason have no common ground on which
   either can make itself intelligible to the other; for the very
   principles which to the one are a criterion of truth, are to the other
   an evidence of falsehood. Moreover, the philosophy which regards the
   union of contradictories as essential to the conceptions of the reason,
   is bound in consistency to extend the same condition to its judgments
   and deductions; for whatever is one-sided and partial in the analysis
   of a notion, must be equally so in those more complex forms of thought
   into which notions enter. The logic of the understanding must be
   banished entirely, or not at all. Hence the philosopher may neither
   defend his own system, nor refute his adversary, by arguments reducible
   to the ordinary logical forms; for these forms rest on the very laws of
   thought which the higher philosophy is supposed to repudiate. Hegel's
   own polemic is thus self-condemned; and his attempted refutation of the
   older metaphysicians, is a virtual acknowledgment of the validity of
   their fundamental principles. If the so-called infinite thinking is a
   process of thought at all, it must be a process entirely sui generis,
   isolated and unapproachable, as incapable as the intuition of Schelling
   of being expressed in ordinary language, or compared, even in
   antagonism, with the processes of ordinary reasoning. The very attempt
   to expound it thus, necessarily postulates its own failure.

   But this great thinker has rendered one invaluable service to
   philosophy. He has shown clearly what are the only conditions under
   which a philosophy of the Absolute could be realized; and his attempt
   has done much to facilitate the conclusion, to which philosophy must
   finally come, that the Absolute is beyond the reach of human thought.
   If such a philosophy were possible at all, it would be in the form of
   the philosophy of Hegel. And Hegel's failure points to one inevitable
   moral. All the above inconsistency and division of the human mind
   against itself, might be avoided by acknowledging the supreme authority
   of the laws of thought over all human speculation; and by recognizing
   the consequent distinction between positive and negative
   thinking,--between the lawful exercise of the reason within its own
   province, and its abortive efforts to pass beyond it. But such an
   acknowledgment amounts to a confession that thought and being are not
   identical, and that reason itself requires us to believe in truths that
   are beyond reason. And to this conclusion speculative philosophy itself
   leads us, if in no other way, at least by the wholesome warning of its
   own pretensions and failures.

   writers on this question; his own commentary being not the least
   significant portion. "Thereby indeed," he says "the Ego makes known its
   will to carry on to all eternity (i. e. not to take a step out from its
   own finiteness) not only its subjectivity in general, but the
   particular relations of this subjectivity." And again: "Only the nature
   of the species is infinite and inexhaustible; that of the individual
   can be only finite." His inquiry concludes with the well-known words,
   "The other world is, in all forms, the one foe, but in its form as the
   world to come, the last foe, which speculative criticism has to combat
   and if possible to overcome." And Feuerbach, another "advanced"
   disciple of the Hegelian school, has written an essay on Death and
   Immortality, for the purpose of showing that a belief in personal
   annihilation is indispensable to sound morality and true religion; that
   the opposite belief is connected with all that is "satanic" and
   "bestial;" and that temporal death is but an image of God, the "great
   objective negation:" and has indicated significantly, in another work,
   the philosophical basis of his theory, by an aphorism the direct
   contradictory to that of Descartes, "Cogitans nemo sum. Cogito, ergo

LECTURE IV.

   Note I., p. 114.

   Thus Wegscheider, after expressly admitting (Instit. Theol. § 52) that
   the infinite cannot be comprehended by the finite, and that its idea
   can only be represented by analogy and symbol, proceeds to assert, with
   the utmost confidence, that the attributes of omnipotence and
   omniscience do not truly represent the internal nature of God (§ 69);
   that a plurality of persons in the Godhead is manifestly repugnant to
   reason, and that the infinite God cannot assume the nature of finite
   man (§ 92); that the fall of man is inconsistent with the divine
   attributes (§ 117); that repentance is the only mode of expiating sin
   reconcilable with the moral nature of God (§ 138); that the doctrine of
   Christ's intercession is repugnant to the divine nature (§ 143).

   By a somewhat similar inconsistency, Mr. Newman, while fully
   acknowledging that we cannot have any perfect knowledge of an infinite
   mind, and that infinity itself is but a negative idea, yet thinks it
   necessary to regard the soul as a separate organ of specific
   information, by which we are in contact with the infinite; and
   dogmatizes concerning the similarity of divine and human attributes, in
   a manner which nothing short of absolute knowledge can justify. (See
   The Soul, pp. 1, 3, 34, 54, 58.) He compares the infinite to the
   "illimitable haziness" which bounds the sphere of distinct vision. The
   analogy would be serviceable to his argument, if we possessed two sets
   of eyes, one for clearness and one for haziness; one to be limited, and
   the other to discern the limitation. The hypothesis of a separate
   faculty of consciousness, whether called soul, reason, or intellectual
   intuition, to take cognizance of the infinite, is only needed for those
   philosophers who undertake to develop a complete philosophy of the
   infinite as such. But the success of the various attempts in this
   province has not been such as to give any trustworthy evidence of the
   existence of such a faculty.

   See Kant, Kritik der reinen Vernunft, p. 497. ed. Rosenkranz. This
   admission, rightly understood, need not be considered as detracting
   from the value of the speculative arguments as auxiliaries. All that is
   contended for is, that the foundation must be laid elsewhere, before
   their assistance, valuable as it is, can be made available. Thus
   understood, this view coincides with that expressed by Sir W. Hamilton,
   in the second of the Lectures on Metaphysics, shortly to be published,
   "that the phenomena of matter, taken by themselves (you will observe
   the qualification, taken by themselves), so far from warranting any
   inference to the existence of a God, would, on the contrary, ground
   even an argument to his negation,--that the study of the external
   world, taken with and in subordination to that of the internal, not
   only loses its atheistic tendency, but, under such subservience, may be
   rendered conducive to the great conclusion, from which, if left to
   itself, it would dissuade us." The atheistic tendency is perhaps too
   strongly stated; as the same phenomena may be surveyed, by different
   individuals, in different spirits and with different results; but the
   main position, that the belief in God is primarily based on mental, and
   not on material phenomena, accords with the view taken in the text.

   urges is of no value, unless we admit that man possesses an adequate
   notion of the infinite, as such. Otherwise the notion of power
   indefinitely great, which the phenomena certainly suggest, is, both
   theoretically and practically, undistinguishable from the infinite
   itself. This has been well remarked by a recent writer. See Selections

   intelligent artist,' so certainly, if he came across the meanest or the
   highest of the works of nature, would he infer, this was not made by
   man, nor by any human art and skill.' He sees at first sight that the
   seaweed beneath his feet is something different in kind from the
   productions of man." [192] But surely the force of the teleological
   argument does not turn upon the similarity of the objects, but upon
   their analogy. The point of comparison is, that in the works of nature,
   as well as in those of art, there is an adaptation of means to ends,
   which indicates an intelligent author. And such an adaptation may exist
   in an organized body, no less than in a machine, notwithstanding
   numerous differences in the details of their structure. The evidence of
   this general analogy is in nowise weakened by Professor Jowett's
   special exceptions.

   Note VII., p. 116.

   "When the spiritual man (as such) cannot judge, the question is removed
   into a totally different court from that of the Soul, the court of the
   critical understanding.. The processes of thought have nothing to
   quicken the conscience or affect the soul." F. W. Newman, The Soul, p.
   245 (second edition).--Yet he allows in another place (not quite
   consistently) that "pure intellectual error, depending on causes wholly
   unmoral, may and does perpetuate moral illusions, which are of the
   deepest injury to spiritual life." p. 169. Similar in principle, though
   not pushed to the same extreme consequences, is the theory of Mr.
   Morell, who says, "Reason up to a God, and the best you can do is to
   hypostatize and deify the final product of your own faculties; but
   admit the reality of an intellectual intuition (as the mass of mankind
   virtually do), and the absolute stands before us in all its living
   reality." [193] This distinction he carries so far as to assert that
   "to speak of logic, as such, being inspired, is a sheer absurdity;"
   because "the process either of defining or of reasoning requires simply
   the employment of the formal laws of thought, the accuracy of which can
   be in no way affected by any amount of inspiration whatever:" [194] and
   in another passage he maintains, to the same effect, that "the
   essential elements of religion in general, as of Christianity in
   particular, appertain strictly to the intuitional portion of our
   nature, and may be realized in all their varied influence without the
   cooperation of any purely reflective processes." [195] Here he
   apparently overlooks the fact that the intuitive and reflective
   faculties invariably act in conjunction; that both are equally
   necessary to the existence of consciousness as such; and that logical
   forms are never called into operation, except in conjunction with the
   matter on which they are exercised.

   Note VIII., p. 119.

   In acknowledging Expiation as well as Prayer to be prompted by the
   natural feelings of men, I have no intention of controverting the
   opinion, so ably maintained by Archbishop Magee and Mr. Faber, of the
   divine origin of the actual rite of sacrifice. That the religious
   instincts of men should indicate the need of supplication and
   expiation, is perfectly consistent with the belief that the particular
   mode of both may have been first taught by a primitive revelation. That
   religion, in both its constituent elements, was communicated to the
   parents of the human race by positive revelation, seems the most
   natural inference from the Mosaic narrative. [196] Yet we may admit
   that the positive institution must from the first have been adapted to
   some corresponding instinct of human nature; without which it would be
   scarcely possible to account for its continuance and universal
   diffusion, as well as for its various corruptions. We may thus combine
   the view of Archbishop Magee with that exhibited by Dr. Thomson.

   That the mere feeling of dependence by itself is not necessarily
   religion, is shown by Hegel, Philosophie der Religion (Werke XII. p.
   173). Speaking of the Roman worship of evil influences, Angerona,
   Fames, Robigo, etc., he rightly remarks that in such representations
   all conception of Deity is lost, though the feeling of fear and
   dependence remains. To the same effect is his sarcastic remark that,
   according to Schleiermacher's theory, the dog is the best Christian.
   [197] Mr. Parker (Discourse of Religion, Ch. 1.) agrees with
   Schleiermacher in resolving the religious sentiment into a mere sense
   of dependence; though he admits that this sentiment does not, itself,
   disclose the character of the object on which it depends. Referred to
   this principle alone, it is impossible to regard religious worship as a
   moral duty.

   The theory which regards absolute morality as based on the immutable

   and others among the schoolmen, is severely criticized by Sir James
   Mackintosh, Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy, section
   III., and by Müller, Christliche Lehre von der Sünde, B. I. c. 3. The

   Morell, Philosophy of Religion, p. 75. Mr. Morell here goes beyond the
   theory of his master, Schleiermacher. The latter (Christliche Glaube, §
   4) admits that this supposed feeling of absolute dependence can never
   be completely attained in any single act of consciousness, but is
   generally suggested by the whole. Mr. Morell speaks as if we could be
   immediately conscious of our own annihilation, by a direct intuition of
   the infinite. Both theories are inadequate to prove the intended
   conclusion. That of Schleiermacher virtually amounts to a confession
   that the infinite is not a positive object of consciousness, but a mere
   negation suggested by the direct presence of the finite. That of Mr.
   Morell saves the intuition of the infinite, but annihilates itself; for
   if in any act of consciousness the subject becomes absolutely nothing,
   the consciousness must vanish with it; and if it stops at any point
   short of nothing, the object is not infinite.

   Note XV., p. 125.

   That this is the legitimate result of Schleiermacher's theory, may be
   gathered from a remarkable passage in the Christliche Glaube, § 8, in
   which the polytheistic and monotheistic feelings of piety are compared
   together. The former, he says, is always accompanied by a sensible
   representation of its object, in which there is contained a germ of
   multiplicity; but in the latter, the higher consciousness is so
   separated from the sensible, that the pious emotions admit of no
   greater difference than that of the elevating or depressing tone of the
   feeling. This seems to imply that, in Schleiermacher's opinion, to
   worship a God of many attributes, is equivalent to worshipping a
   plurality of Gods. And to those philosophers who make the Infinite in
   itself a direct object of religious worship, this identification is
   natural; for a God of many attributes cannot be conceived as infinite,
   and therefore in one sense partakes of the limited divinity of
   Polytheism. But, on the other hand, a God of no attributes is no God at
   all; and the so-called monotheistic piety is nothing but an abortive
   attempt at mystical self-annihilation. Some acute strictures on
   Schleiermacher's theory from this point of view will be found in
   Drobisch, Grundlehren der Religionsphilosophie, p. 84.

   Note XVI., p. 126.

   Schleiermacher himself admits (Christliche Glaube, § 33) that the
   theory of absolute dependence is incompatible with the belief that God
   can be moved by any human action. He endeavors, however, to reconcile
   this admission with the duty of prayer, by maintaining (§ 147) that the
   true Christian will pray for nothing but that which it comes within
   God's absolute purpose to grant. This implies something like
   omniscience in the true Christian, and something like hypocrisy in
   every act of prayer.

   Note XVII., p. 126.

   Schleiermacher (Chr. Glaube, § 49) attempts, not very successfully, to
   meet this objection, by maintaining that even our free acts are
   dependent upon the will of God. This is doubtless true; but it is true
   as an article of faith, not as a theory of philosophy: it may be
   believed, but cannot be conceived, nor represented in any act of human
   consciousness. The apparent contradiction implied in the coexistence of
   an infinite and a finite, will remain unsolved; and is most glaring in
   the theories of those philosophers, who, like Schleiermacher (§ 54),
   maintain that God actually does all that he can do. The only solution
   is to confess that we have no true conception of the infinite at all.
   Schleiermacher himself is unable to avoid the logical consequence of
   his position. He admits (§ 89) that God's omnipotence is limited if we
   do not allow him to be the author of sin; though he endeavors to soften
   this monstrous admission by taking it in conjunction with the fact that
   God is also the author of grace.

   so God cannot be seen by human and bodily eyes, but is discovered to
   human intelligence by His providence and His works." [198] And
   Athanasius, Contra Gentes, c. 35. "For often the workman is recognized
   in his works; as they say of the sculptor Phidias, that the symmetry
   and nice proportions of his works revealed him to the beholders, even
   when he was not present himself, so the order of the universe
   necessarily reveals the divine Creator, though He is invisible to
   mortal eyes." On the other hand, Hegel, Philosophie der Religion
   (Werke, XII. p. 395), insists on the necessity of knowing God as He is,
   as an indispensable condition of all Theology.

   no accurate knowledge of Him, for in things pertaining to God, it is
   great knowledge, to confess our ignorance."--Pascal, Pensées, Partie
   II. Art. II. § 5. "We know that there is an infinite, and we are
   ignorant of its nature. For example, we know that it is false, that
   numbers are finite; then it is true that there is an infinite in
   numbers. But we do not know what it is. It is false that it is even;
   equally so that it is uneven; for, in adding the unit, it does not
   change its nature; nevertheless it is a number. . . . . We may, then,
   well know that there is a God, without knowing, what He is." The
   distinction is strongly repudiated by Hegel, Werke, XII. p. 396. Cf.
   IX. p. 19. XIV. p. 219. In the last of these passages, he goes so far
   as to say, that to deny to man a knowledge of the infinite is the sin
   against the Holy Ghost. The ground of this awful charge is little more
   than the repetition of an observation in Aristotle's Metaphysics, that
   God is not envious, and therefore cannot withhold from us absolute
   knowledge.

   Note XXIV., p. 132.

   The distinction between speculative and regulative knowledge holds an
   important place in the philosophy of Kant; but his mode of applying it
   is the exact reverse of that adopted in the text. According to Kant,
   the idea of the absolute or unconditioned has a regulative, but not a
   speculative value: it cannot be positively apprehended by act of
   thought; but it serves to give unity and direction to the lower
   conceptions of the understanding; indicating the point to which they
   tend, though they never actually reach it. But the regulative character
   thus paradoxically assigned, not to thought, but to its negation, in
   truth belongs to the finite conceptions as actually apprehended, not to
   any unapprehended idea of the infinite beyond them. Every object of
   positive thought, being conceived as finite, is necessarily regarded as
   limited by something beyond itself; though this something is not itself
   actually conceived. The true purpose of this manifest incompleteness of
   all human thought, is to point out the limits which we cannot pass;
   not, as Kant maintains, to seduce us into vain attempts to pass them.
   If there is but one faculty of thought, that which Kant calls the
   Understanding, occupied with the finite only, there is an obvious end
   to be answered in making us aware of its limits, and warning us that
   the boundaries of thought are not those of existence. But if, with
   Kant, we distinguish the Understanding from the Reason, and attribute
   to the latter the delusions necessarily arising from the idea of the
   unconditioned, we must believe in the existence of a special faculty of
   lies, created for the express purpose of deceiving those who trust to
   it. In the philosophy of religion, the true regulative ideas, which are
   intended to guide our thoughts, are the finite forms under which alone
   we can think of the infinite God; though these, while we employ them,
   betray their own speculative insufficiency and the limited character of
   all human knowledge.

   Note XXV., p. 132.

   "The purport of these remarks is only this . . . . that, in the further
   progress of the investigations, the question cannot be, what and how
   God is constituted in Himself, but only how we have to think of Him in
   relation to ourselves and the whole morally-natural world. For by our
   faith it is not that the being of God is theoretically known, but only
   His existence, in the special relation to the moral design of the
   world, is revealed for us, as morally constituted beings; and this is
   in a double sense a purely relative knowledge, first by being limited
   to a determined nature of the subject that knows, and secondly by the
   determined relation of the object that is known. Hence it follows, that
   there is nothing to be said here of the knowledge of the essence, the
   quality of a Being, but only of a nearer determination of the idea of
   God, as we have to form it, from our point of view; in other words, we
   are to think of God only by means of relations." Drobisch, Grundlehren
   der Religionsphilosophie, p. 189.--"The Scripture intimates to us
   certain facts concerning the Divine Being: but conveying them to us by
   the medium of language, it only brings them before us darkly, under the
   signs appropriate to the thoughts of the human mind. And though this
   kind of knowledge is abundantly instructive to us in point of sentiment
   and action; teaches us, that is, both how to feel, and how to act,
   towards God;--for it is the language that we understand, the language
   formed by our own experience and practice;--it is altogether inadequate
   in point of Science." Hampden, Bampton Lectures, p. 54 (second
   edition).--"We should rather point out to objectors that what is
   revealed is practical, and not speculative;--that what the Scriptures
   are concerned with is, not the philosophy of the Human Mind in itself,
   nor yet the philosophy of the Divine Nature in itself, but (that which
   is properly Religion) the relation and connection of the two
   Beings;--what God is to us,--what He has done and will do for us,--and
   what we are to be and to do, in regard to Him." Whately, Sermons, p. 56

   act of explanation. Every object of thought, as being one object, and
   one out of many, all being related to a common consciousness, must
   contain in itself a common and a distinctive feature; and the relation
   between these two constitutes that very diversity in unity, without

   These two analogies between our natural and spiritual knowledge are
   adduced in a remarkable passage of Gregory of Nyssa, Contra Eunomium,

   "We live in ignorance of all things, of ourselves first of all, and
   then of all other things. For who is there, that has come to a
   comprehension of his own soul? Who has a knowledge of its essence?
   whether it is material or immaterial? Whether purely incorporeal, or
   whether there be something corporeal in it? how it comes into being,
   how it is regulated? whence it enters the body, how it departs?" etc.
   (Opera, Paris. 1615. Vol. II. p. 321.) Of body as distinguished from
   its attributes, he says: "For if any one were to analyze, into its
   component parts, what appears to the senses, and, having stripped the
   subject of all its attributes, should strive to get a knowledge of it,
   as it is in itself, I do not see what would be left for the mind to
   contemplate at all. For once take away color, figure, weight, size,
   motion, relativity, each one of which is not of itself the body, and
   yet all of them belong to the body,--what will be left to stand for the
   body? Whoever, therefore, is ignorant of himself, how is he to have
   knowledge of things above himself?" Ibid. p. 322.

   conceive how two invisibles touch each other; if everywhere, then they
   are only one thing, and consequently the two together are indivisible;

   Kant's theory, that we know phenomena only, not things in themselves,
   is severely criticized by Dr. McCosh, Method of the Divine Government,
   p. 536 (4th edition). I have before observed that Kant has, in two
   points at least, extended his doctrine beyond its legitimate place;
   first, in maintaining that our knowledge of the personal self is
   equally phenomenal with that of external objects; and secondly, in
   dogmatically asserting that the thing in itself does not resemble the
   phenomenon of which we are conscious, Against the first of these
   statements it may he fairly objected, that my personal existence is
   identical with my consciousness of that existence; and that any other
   aspect of my personality, if such exists in relation to any other
   intelligence, is in this case the phenomenon to which my personal
   consciousness furnishes the real counterpart. Against the second, it
   may be objected, that if, upon Kant's own hypothesis, we are never
   directly conscious of the thing in itself, we have no ground for saying
   that it is unlike, any more than that it is like, the object of which
   we are conscious; and that, in the absence of all other evidence, the
   probability is in favor of that aspect which is at least subjectively
   true. But when these deductions are made, the hypothesis of Kant, in
   its fundamental position, remains unshaken. It then amounts to no more
   than this; that we can see things only as our faculties present them to
   us; and that we can never be sure that the mode of operation of our
   faculties is identical with that of other intelligences, embodied or
   spiritual. Within these limits, the theory more nearly resembles a
   truism than a paradox, and contains nothing that can be regarded as
   formidable, either by the philosopher or by the theologian.

   In the same article, Dr. McCosh criticizes Sir William Hamilton's
   cognate theory of the relativity of all knowledge. With the highest
   respect for Dr. McCosh's philosophical ability, I cannot help thinking
   that he has mistaken the character of the theory which he censures, and
   that the objection which he urges is hardly applicable. He attempts to
   avail himself of Sir W. Hamilton's own theory of the veracity of
   consciousness. He asks, "Does not the mind in sense-perception hold the
   object to be a real object?" Undoubtedly; but reality in this sense is
   not identical with absolute. existence unmodified by the laws of the
   percipient mind. Man can conceive reality, as he conceives other
   objects, only as the laws of his faculties permit; and in
   distinguishing reality from appearance, he is not distinguishing the
   related from the unrelated. Both appearance and reality must be given
   in consciousness, to be apprehended at all; and the distinction is only
   between some modes of consciousness, such as those of a dream, which
   are regarded as delusive, and others, as in a waking state, which are
   regarded as veracious. But consciousness, whatever may be its veracity,
   can tell us nothing concerning the identity of its objects with those
   of which we are not conscious.

   Dr. McCosh, in the above criticism, also classes Professor Ferrier as a
   representative of the same school with Kant and Hamilton. This
   classification is, at least, questionable. Professor Ferrier's system
   more nearly approaches to the Philosophy of the Absolute than to that
   of the Relative. He himself distinctly announces that he undertakes "to
   lay down the laws, not only of our thinking and knowing, but of all
   possible thinking and knowing." [199] Such an undertaking, whether it
   be successful or not, is, in its conception, the very opposite of the
   system which maintains that our knowledge is relative to our faculties.

   "It is plain, that, in any communication from an Infinite Being to

   apprehension. . . . . If we turn to Scripture, however, we shall see
   how this matter is decided. In God's dealings with men we find wrath,'
   jealousy,' repentance,' and other affections, ascribed to the Divine
   Being. He is described as sitting on a throne;' His eyes' are said to
   behold the children of men;' not to mention other instances, which must
   suggest themselves to every one, in which God condescends to convey to
   us, not the very reality indeed, but something as near the reality as
   He sees it expedient for us to know." Professor Lee, The Inspiration of

   favorable and qualified sense and meaning; namely, that they are
   infinitely short of the real, true, internal Nature of God as He is in
   himself." Compare Divine Analogy, p. 57. "Though all the Revelations of
   God are true, as coming from Him who is Truth itself; yet the truth and
   substance of them doth not consist in this, that they give us any new
   set of ideas, and express them in a language altogether unknown before;
   or that both the conceptions and terms are so immediately and properly
   adapted to the true and real nature of the things revealed, that they
   could not without great impropriety and even profaneness be ever
   applied to the things of this world. But the truth of them consists in
   this; that whereas the terms and conceptions made use of in those
   Revelations are strictly proper to things worldly and obvious; they are
   from thence transferred analogically to the correspondent objects of
   another world with as much truth and reality, as when they are made use
   of in their first and most literal propriety; and this is a solid
   foundation both of a clear and certain knowledge, and of a firm and

   Schleiermacher substantially admits the same facts, though he attempts
   to connect them with a different theory. [200] He considers that there
   is a pantheistic and a personal element united in all religions: and
   this is perhaps true of heathen religious subjected to the
   philosophical analysis of a later age; though it may be doubted whether
   both elements are distinctly recognized by the worshipper himself. But
   even from this point of view, the Jewish religion stands in marked
   contrast to both Eastern and Western heathenism. In the latter forms of
   religion, the elements of personality and infinity, so far as they are
   manifested at all, are manifested in different beings: this is
   observable both in the subordinate emanations which give a kind of
   secondary personality to the Illndian Pantheism, and in the
   philosophical abstraction of a supreme principle of good, which
   connects a secondary notion of the infinite with the Grecian Mythology.
   The Jewish religion still remains distinct and unique, in so far as in
   it the attributes of personality and infinity are united in one and the
   same living and only God.

   "And the Father, who, indeed, in respect of us, is invisible and
   indeterminable, is known by His own Word; and being indeclarable, is
   declared to us by the Word Himself. Again, it is only the Father that
   knoweth His Word; and that both these things are so hath the Lord
   manifested. And on this account the Son revealeth the knowledge of the
   Father by His own manifestation. For the knowledge of the Father is the
   manifestation of the Son; for all things are manifested by the Word.
   That therefore we might know, that it is the Son himself who hath come,
   that maketh known the Father to them that believe on Him, he said to
   his disciples: No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth
   any man the Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will
   reveal Him.'" Irenæus, Contr. Hæres. IV. 6, 3. "Accordingly, therefore,
   the Word of God became incarnate, and lived in human form, that He
   might quicken the body, and that, as in the creation, He is known by
   His works, so also He might work in man, and manifest Himself
   everywhere, leaving nothing void of His divine nature and knowledge."

   incarnate . . . . in order that man might have a way to the God of man

   "We who believe that God lived upon the earth, and that He took upon
   Him the lowliness of human form for the sake of man's salvation, are
   far from the opinion of those who think that God has no care for
   anything." Tertullian, Adv. Marc. II. 16.

   Note XXII., p. 150.

   It is only a natural consequence of their own principles, when the
   advocates of a philosophy of the Absolute maintain that the Incarnation
   of Christ has no relation to time. Thus Schelling says: "The
   theologians also expound, in like empiric manner, the Incarnation of
   God in Christ,--that God took upon Him human nature in a definite
   momentum of time, a thing impossible of conception, as God is eternally
   out of all time. The Incarnation of God is therefore an incarnation
   from eternity (a becoming' manifest in the flesh' from all eternity) .
   . . ." [201] Hegel, in his Lectures on the Philosophy of History, [202]
   thus comments on the language of St. Paul: "When the fulness of time
   was come, God sent forth his Son; such is the language of the Bible.
   That means nothing else than this: the self-consciousness had risen up
   to those momenta, which belong to the conception of the Spirit, and to
   the necessity of apprehending these momenta after an absolute method."
   This marvellous elucidation of the sacred text may perhaps receive some
   further light, or darkness, from the obscure passages of the same
   author, quoted subsequently in the text of this Lecture: and such is
   the explanation of his theory given by Baur, Christliche Gnosis, p.
   715: "From the stand-point of speculative thought, the Incarnation is
   no single historical fact, once taken place, but an eternal
   determination of the essential nature of God, by virtue of which God
   only so far becomes man (in every individual man) as He is man from
   eternity. The sorrowful humiliation to which Christ made Himself
   subject as God-man, God bears at all times as man. The atonement
   achieved by Christ is not a fact which has come to pass in time, but an
   eternal reconciliation of God with Himself, and the resurrection and
   exaltation of Christ is only the regress of the Spirit to itself.
   Christ as man, as God-man, is man in his universality, not a particular
   individual, but the universal individual." It is no wonder that, to a
   philosophy of these lofty pretensions, the personal existence of Christ
   should be a question of perfect indifference. [203] From a similar
   point of view, Marheineke says: "The incarnation of God, apprehended in
   its possibility, is the real incarnation of divine truth, which is not
   only the thought of God, but also his very essence; and Divine and
   Human, though still different, are yet no longer separate." Grundlehren
   der Christlichen Dogmatik, § 312. It is difficult to see what
   distinction can be made, in these theories, between the Incarnation of
   Christ as Man, and His eternal Generation as the Son of God; and indeed
   these passages, and those subsequently quoted from Hegel, appear
   intentionally to identify the two.

   Encyklopädie, §§ 564, 566. For the benefit of any reader who may be
   disposed to play the part of OEdipus, I subjoin the entire passage in
   the original. The meaning may perhaps, as Professor Ferrier observes of
   Hegel's philosophy in general, be extracted by distillation, but
   certainly not by literal translation.

   "Was Gott als Geist ist,--Dies richtig und bestimmt im Gedanken zu
   fassen, dazu wird gründliche Speculation erfordert. Es sind zunächst
   die Sätze darin enthalten: Gott ist Gott nur in sofern er sich selber
   weiss; sein sich Sich-wissen ist ferner sein Selbstbewusstseyn im
   Menschen, und das Wissen des Menschen von Gott, das fortgeht zum
   Sich-wissen des Menschen in Gott.

   Der absolute Geist in der aufgehobenen Unmittelbarkeit und Sinnlichkeit
   der Gestalt und des Wissens, ist dem Inhalte nach der
   an-und-für-sich-seyende Geist der Natur und des Geistes, der Form nach
   ist er zunächst für das subjective Wissen der Vorstellung. Diese giebt
   den Momenten seines Inhalts einerscits Selbstständigkeit und macht sie
   gegen einander zu Voraussetzungen, and zu einander folgenden
   Erscheinungen und zu einem Zusammenhang des Geschehens nach endlichen
   Reflexionsbestimmungen; anderseits wird solche Form endlicher
   Vorstellungsweise in dem Glauben an den Einen Geist und in der Andacht
   des Cultus aufgchoben.

   In diesem Trennen scheidet sich die Form von dem Inhalte, und in jener
   die unterschiedenen Momente des Begriffs zu besondern Sphären oder
   Elementen ab, in deren jedem sich der absolute Inhalt darstellt,--a)
   als in seiner Manifestation bei sich selbst bleibender, Ewiger
   Inhalt;--b) als Unterscheidung des ewigen Wesens von seiner
   Manifestation, welche durch diesen Unterschied die Erscheinungswelt
   wird, in die der Inhalt tritt;--g) als unendliche Rückkehr und
   Versöhnung der entäusserten Welt mit denm ewigen Wesen, das Zurückgehen
   desselben aus der Erscheinung in die Einheit seiner Fülle."

   The passage which, though perhaps bearing more directly on my argument,
   I have not ventured to attempt to translate, [204] is the following, §
   568. "Im Momente der Besonderheit aber des Urtheils, ist dies concrete
   ewige Wesen das Vorausgesetzte, und seine Bewegung die Erschaffung der
   Erscheinung, das Zerfallen des ewigen Moments der Vermittlung, des
   einigen Sohnes, in den selbstständigen Gegensatz, einerseits des
   Himmels und der Erde, der elementarischen und concreten Natur,
   andererseits des Geistes als mit ihr im Verhältniss stehenden, somit
   endlichen Geistes, welcher als das Extrem der in sich seyenden
   Negativität sich zum Bösen verselbstständigt, solches Extrem durch
   seine Beziehung auf eine gegenüberstehende Natur und durch seine damit
   gesetzte eigene Natürlichkeit ist, in dieser als denkend zugrleich auf
   das Ewige gerichtet, aber damit in äusserlicher Beziehung, steht."

   Görres, in the preface to the second edition of his Athanasius, p. ix.,
   exhibits a specimen of a new Creed on Hegelian principles, to be drawn
   up by a general council composed of the more advanced theologians of
   the day. The qualifications for a seat in the council are humorously
   described, and the creed itself contains much just and pointed satire.
   It will hardly, however, bear quotation; for a caricature on such a
   subject, however well intended, almost unavoidably carries with it a
   painful air of irreverence.

   The indecision of Hegel upon this vital question is satisfactorily
   accounted for by his disciple, Strauss. To a philosophy which professes
   to exhibit the universal relations of necessary ideas, it is
   indifferent whether they have actually been realized in an individual
   case or not. This question is reserved for the Critic of History. See
   Streitschriften, Heft III. p. 68. Dorner too, while pointing out the
   merits of Hegel's Christology, admits that the belief in a historical
   Christ has no significance in his system; and that those disciples who
   reject it carry out that system most fully. See Lehre von der Person

   that is the necessary basis; man can know himself taken up into God, so
   far as God is not somewhat foreign to him, somewhat external,
   accidental, but when he, according to his essential being, his freedom
   and subjectivity, is taken up into God; but this is possible, only in
   so far as this subjectivity of human nature is in God Himself." Compare

   Christliche Lehre von der Sünde, II. p. 156, third edition, (English
   Translation, II. p. 126.) The doctrine that the Divine Essence is
   speculatively made known through Christ, is a common ground on which
   theologians of the most opposite schools have met, to diverge again
   into most adverse conclusions. It is substantially the opinion of
   Eunomius; [205] and it has been maintained in modern times by Hegel and
   his disciple Marheineke, in a sense very different from that which is
   adopted by Müller. See Hegel, Philosophie der Geschichte, Werke, IX. p.

   Seven different theories of the causal nexus, and of the mode of our
   apprehension of it, are enumerated and refuted by Sir W. Hamilton,
   Discussions, p. 611. His own, which is the eighth, can hardly be
   regarded as more satisfactory. For he resolves the causal judgment
   itself into the inability to conceive an absolute commencement of
   phenomena, and the consequent necessity of thinking that what appears
   to us under a new form had previously existed under others. But surely
   a cause is as much required to account for the change from an old form
   to a new, as to account for an absolute beginning. On the defects of
   this theory I have remarked elsewhere. See Encyclopædia Britannica,
   eighth edition, vol. XIV. p. 601. It has also been criticized by Dr.
   McCosh, Method of the Divine Government, p. 529, fourth edition; by
   Professor Fraser, Essays in Philosophy, p. 170 sqq.; and by Mr.
   Calderwood, Philosophy of the Infinite, p. 139 sqq.

   That Causation implies something more than invariable sequence, though
   what that something is we are unable to determine, is maintained, among
   others, by M. Cousin, in his eloquent Lectures on the Philosophy of
   Locke. "Solely because one phenomenon succeeds another, and succeeds it
   constantly,--is it the cause of it? Is this the whole idea, which you
   form to yourself, of cause? When you say, when you think that the fire
   is the cause of the fluid state of the wax, I ask you, if you do not
   believe, if the whole human race do not believe, that there is in the
   fire a certain something, an unknown property,--the determination of
   which is no point in question here,--to which you refer the production
   of the fluid state of the wax?" Histoire de la Philosophie au XVIII^e.
   siècle, Leçon xix. Engel speaks to the same effect in almost the same
   words. "In what we call, for example, force of attraction, of affinity,
   or of impulsion, the only thing known (that is to say, represented to
   the imagination and the senses) is the effect produced, namely, the
   bringing together of the two bodies attracted and attracting. No
   language has a word to express that certain something, (effort,
   conatius, nisus) which remains absolutely concealed, but which all
   minds necessarily conceive of as added to the phenomenal
   representation." [206] Dr. McCosh (Method of the Divine Government, p.
   525,) professes to discover this certain something, in a substance
   acting according to its powers or properties. But, apart from the
   conscious exercise of free will, we know nothing of power, or property,
   save as manifested in its effects. Compare Berkeley, Minute
   Philosopher, Dial. VII. § 9. Herder, Gott, Werke, VIII. p. 224.

   Note VI., p. 163.

   That the first idea of Causation is derived from the consciousness of
   the exercise of power in our own volitions, is established, after a
   hint from Locke, [207] by Maine de Biran, and accepted by M. Cousin.
   [208] To explain the manner in which we transcend our own personal
   consciousness, and attribute a cause to all changes in the material
   world, the latter philosopher has recourse to the hypothesis of a
   necessary law of the reason, by virtue of which it disengages, in the
   fact of consciousness, the necessary element of causal relation from
   the contingent element of our personal production of this or that
   particular movement. This Law, the Principle of Causality, compels the
   reason to suppose a cause, whenever the senses present a new
   phenomenon. But this Principle of Causality, even granting it to be
   true as far as it goes, does not explain what the idea of a Cause, thus
   extended, contains as its constituent feature: it merely transcends
   personal causation, and substitutes an unknown something in its room.
   We do not attribute to the fire a consciousness of its power to melt
   the wax: and in denying consciousness, we deny the only positive
   conception of power which can be added to the mere juxtaposition of
   phenomena. The cause, in all sensible changes, thus remains a certain
   something. On this subject I have treated more at length in another
   place. See Prolegomena Logica, pp. 135, 309.

   And even within the sphere of our own volitions, though we are
   immediately conscious of the exercise of power, yet the analysis of the
   conception thus presented to us, carries us at once into the region of
   the incomprehensible. The finite power of man, as an originating cause
   within his own sphere, seems to come into collision with the infinite
   power of God, as the originating Cause of all things. Finite power is
   itself created by and dependent upon God; yet, at the same time, it
   seems to be manifested as originating and independent. Power itself
   acts only on the solicitation of motives; and this raises the question,
   which is prior? does the motive bring about the state of the will which
   inclines to it; or does the state of the will convert the coincident
   circumstances into motives? Am I moved to will, or do I will to be
   moved? Here we are involved in the mystery of endless succession. On
   this mystery there are some able remarks in Mr. Mozley's Augustinian
   theory of Predestination, p. 2, and in Professor Fraser's Essays in
   Philosophy, p. 275.

   two. For the One and the Three, or the One and the Two are opposed to
   each other. So that if God be three or two, he cannot be
   one."--Priestley, Tracts in Controversy with Bishop Horsley, p. 78.
   "They are therefore both one and many in the same respect, viz., in
   each being perfect God. This is certainly as much a contradiction as to
   say that Peter, James, and John, having each of them every thing that
   is requisite to constitute a complete man, are yet, all together, not
   three men, but only one man."--F. W. Newman, Phases of Faith, p. 48.
   "If any one speaks of three men, all that he means is, three objects of
   thought, of whom each separately may be called man.' So also, all that
   could possibly be meant by three Gods, is three objects of thought, of
   whom each separately may be called God.' To avow the last statement, as
   the Creed does, and yet repudiate Three Gods, is to object to the
   phrase, yet confess to the only meaning which the phrase can convey."

   Schleiermacher (Christliche Glaube, § 171), has some objections against
   the Catholic Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, conceived in the thorough
   spirit of Rationalism. In the same spirit Strauss observes
   (Glaubenslehre, I. p. 460), "Whoever has sworn to the Symbolum
   Quicunque has forsworn the laws of human thought." The sarcasm comes
   inconsistently enough from a disciple of Hegel, whose entire philosophy
   is based on an abjuration of the laws of thought. In one respect,
   indeed, Hegel is right; namely, in maintaining that the laws of thought
   are not applicable to the Infinite. But the true conclusion from this
   concession is not, as the Hegelians maintain, that a philosophy can be
   constructed independently of those laws; but that the Infinite is not
   an object of human philosophy at all.

   and let him not compare the nature of God, which is above all things,
   free from all condition of place and time and composition of parts,
   with things, which are confined to place and time, or composed of
   parts; but let him believe that there is something, in that nature,
   which cannot be in those things, and let him acquiesce in christian
   authority, and not dispute against it."

   Note XIII., p. 166.

   See the objections raised against this doctrine by Mr. F. W. Newman,
   Phases of Faith, p. 84. "The very form of our past participle
   (begotten)," he tells us, "is invented to indicate an event in the past
   time." The true difficulty is not grammatical, but metaphysical. If
   ordinary language is primarily accommodated to the ordinary laws of
   thought, it is a mere verbal quibble to press its literal application
   to the Infinite, which is above thought.

   On this ground is established a profound and decisive criticism of
   Hegel's System, by Trendelenburg, Logische Untersuchungen, c. 2. "Pure
   being," he says, "is quiescence; so also is the Nothing (das Nichts);
   how is the active Becoming (active reality) the result of the union of
   two quiescent conceptions?" M. Bartholmèss in like manner remarks, "In
   turning thus the abstraction to reality, this system tacitly ascribes
   to abstract being virtues and qualities which belong only to a concrete
   and individual being; that is, to a simple being capable of spontaneous
   and deliberate action, of intelligence and of will. It accords all this
   to it, at the same time that it represents it, and with reason, as an
   impersonal being. This abstract being produces concrete beings, this
   impersonal being produces persons; it produces the one and the other,
   because thus the system directs!" Histoire des Doctrines Religieuses,
   II p. 277.

   Schelling, Bruno, p. 168. "In the Absolute, all is absolute; if,
   therefore, the perfection of His Nature appears in the real as infinite
   Being, and in the ideal as infinite Knowing, the Being in the absolute
   is, even as the Knowing, absolute; and each, being absolute, has not,
   out of itself, an opposite in the other, but the absolute Knowing is
   the absolute Nature, and the absolute Nature the absolute Knowing."

   Note XVII., p. 167.

   Aquinas, Summa, P. I. Qu. XXXII. Art. 1. "It is impossible, by means of
   natural reason, to reach the knowledge of the Trinity of the Divine
   Persons. For it has been shown above, that a man can, by natural
   reason, arrive at the knowledge of God, only from what is created. . .
   . . But the creative power of God is common to the whole Trinity;
   whence it pertains to the unity of the essence, not to the distinction
   of the Persons. By natural reason, therefore, only those things can be
   known concerning God, which belong to the Unity of the Divine essence,
   not to the distinction of the Divine Persons." This wise and sound
   limitation should be borne in mind, as a testimony against that
   neoplatonizing spirit of modern times, which seeks to strengthen the
   evidence of the Christian Doctrine of the Trinity, by distorting it
   into conformity with the speculations of Heathen Philosophy. The
   Hegelian Theory of the Trinity is a remarkable instance of this kind.
   Indeed, Hegel himself expressly regards coincidence with neoplatonism
   as an evidence in favor of an idealist interpretation of Christian
   doctrines. [209] A similar spirit occasionally appears in influential
   writers among ourselves.

   Note XVIII., p. 168.

   For the objection, see Catech. Racov. De Persona Christi, Cap. 1. (Ed.
   1609. p. 43.) "It is repugnant to sound reason. In the first place,
   because two substances, opposite in their properties, cannot unite so
   as to form one person; . . . . then, too, because two natures, each
   constituting a person, cannot come together so as to constitute one
   person."--Spinoza, Epist. XXI. "As to the additional view, given by
   some churches, that God assumed human nature, I have expressly
   declared, that I know not what they say; nay, to confess the truth,
   they seem to me to talk no less absurdly than if any one should say
   that a circle has assumed the nature of a square." Similar objections
   are urged by F. W. Newman, The Soul, p. 116, and by Theodore Parker,
   Critical and Miscellaneous Writings, p. 320, Discourse of Matters
   pertaining to Religion, p. 234.

   One half of this dilemma has been exhibited by Sir W. Hamilton,
   Discussions, p. 609. sqq. It is strange however that this great thinker
   should not have seen that the second alternative is equally
   inconceivable; that it is as impossible to conceive the creation as a
   process of evolution from the being of the Creator, as it is to
   conceive it as a production out of nothing. This double impossibility
   is much more in harmony with the philosophy of the conditioned, than
   the hypothesis which Sir W. Hamilton adopts. Indeed, his admirable
   criticism of Cousin's theory (Discussions, p. 36,) contains in
   substance the same dilemma as that exhibited in the text. For some

   "For since in general it is one thing to understand the impossibility
   of a thing, and a far different thing not to understand its
   possibility; so especially in those matters of which we are utterly
   ignorant, such as those which are not exposed to sense, the things are
   by no means forthwith impossible, the possibility of which we do not
   thoroughly understand. Therefore it does not become the philosopher to
   deny universally Divine efficiency in the created world, or to maintain
   as certain, that God Himself contributes nothing (immediately) either
   to the consecutive order of natural things,--as for instance the
   keeping up of each part or species, embraced in a genus of animals or
   of plants,--or to moral changes,--as for instance, the improvement of
   the human soul,--or to assert that it is altogether impossible for a
   revelation or any other extraordinary event to be brought about by
   Divine agency." Storr, Annotationes quædam Theologicæ, p. 5.

   Note XXIV., p. 173.

   "For since the force and power of nature, is the very force and power
   of God, and its laws and rules are the very decrees of God, it is in
   general a thing to be believed, that the power of nature is infinite,
   and that its laws are so made, as to extend to all things which are
   conceived by the Divine mind. For, otherwise, what else is determined,
   than that God made nature so impotent, and appointed for it laws and
   rules so unproductive, that he is often to come anew to its aid, if He
   will have it so preserved that things may succeed according to wish; a
   thing which I conceive to be indeed most foreign to reason." Spinoza,
   Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, cap. VI.--"The latter, indeed
   (Supernaturalists), assume that God governs human affairs in general by
   a natural order, and that when this natural order can no longer satisfy
   His will, He comes in with remedial aid by the working of miracles; the
   former (Rationalists) decide that God, from eternity, so wisely
   arranged that all things should follow in a continuous series, that the
   things which occurred many ages ago, prepared and brought about what is
   occurring now, and that there should be no need of certain miracles, as
   a kind of intercalations." Wegscheider, Instit. Theol. § 12. From an
   opposite point of view to that of Spinoza, Herbart arrives at a similar
   conclusion. "Religion requires the view, that He who, as Father, has
   made provision for men, now in deepest silence leaves the race to
   itself, as having no part in it; without trace of any such feeling itas
   might be likened to human sympathy, and indeed to egotism." [210] The
   simile of the calculating engine, acting by its own laws, is adduced by
   Mr. Babbage (Ninth Bridgewater Treatise, ch. 2), "to illustrate the
   distinction between a system to which the restoring hand of its
   contriver is applied, either frequently or at distant intervals, and
   one which had received at its first formation the impress of the will
   of its author, foreseeing the varied but yet necessary laws of its
   action throughout the whole of its existence; "and to show" that that
   for which, after its original adjustment, no superintendence is
   acquired, displays far greater ingenuity than that which demands, at
   every change in its law, the direct intervention of its contriver." Mr.
   Jowett, though rejecting the analogy of the machine, uses similar
   language: "The directing power that is able to foresee all things, and
   provide against them by simple and general rules, is a worthier image
   of the Divine intelligence than the handicraftsman putting his hand to
   the hammer,' detaching and isolating portions of matter from the laws
   by which he has himself put them together." [211]

   Note XXV., p. 174.

   "The reason why, among men, an artificer is justly esteemed so much the
   more skilful, as the machine of his composing will continue longer to
   move regularly without any further interposition of the workman, is
   because the skill of all human artificers consists only in composing,
   adjusting, or putting together certain movements, the principles of
   whose motion are altogether independent upon the artificer. . . . . But
   with regard to God, the case is quite different; because He not only
   composes or puts things together, but is himself the Author and
   continual Preserver of their original forces or moving powers. And
   consequently it is not a diminution, but the true glory of his
   workmanship, that nothing is done without his continual government and
   inspection." Clarke, First Reply to Leibnitz, p. 15.

   Note XXVI., p. 174.

   "'I do not believe," says Theodore Parlker, "there ever was a miracle,
   or ever will be; every where I find law,--the constant mode of
   operation of the infinite God."--Some account of my Ministry, appended

   work, pp. 113, 188; and Atkinson, Man's Nature and Development, p. 241.
   The statement is not at present true, even as regards the material
   world: it is false as regards the world of mind- and were it true in
   both, it would prove nothing regarding the "infinite God." For the
   conception of law is, to say the least, quite as finite as that of
   miraculous interposition. Professor Powell, in his latest work, though
   not absolutely rejecting miracles, yet adopts a tone which, compared
   with such passages as the above, is at least painfully suggestive. "It
   is now perceived by all inquiring minds, that the advance of true
   scientific principles, and the grand inductive conclusions of universal
   and eternal law and order, are at once the basis of all rational
   theology, and give the death-blow to superstition." Christianity

   highest scientific authorities as to the facts stated. The religious
   application of these facts is Dr. McCosh's own, and constitutes one of
   the most instructive portions of his valuable work. The fact itself has
   been noticed and commented on with his usual sagacity by Bishop Butler,
   Analogy, Part II. c. 3. "Would it not have been thought highly
   improbable, that men should' have been so much more capable of
   discovering, even to certainty, the general laws of matter, and the
   magnitudes, paths, and revolutions of the heavenly bodies, than the
   occasions and cures of distempers, and many other things, in which
   human life seems so much more nearly concerned, than in astronomy?"

   Note XXIX., p. 176.

   "There are domains of nature in which man's foresight is considerably
   extended and accurate, and other domains in which it is very limited,
   or very dim and confused. Again, there are departments of nature in
   which man's influence is considerable, and others which lie altogether
   beyond his control, directly or indirectly. Now, on comparing these
   classes of objects, we find them to have a cross or converse relation
   to one another. Where man's foreknowledge is extensive, either he has
   no power, or his power is limited; and where his power might be
   exerted, his foresight is contracted. . . . . . He can tell in what
   position a satellite of Saturn will be a hundred years after this
   present time, but he cannot say in what state his bodily health may be
   an hour hence. . . . . We are now in circumstances to discover the
   advantages arising from the mixture of uniformity and uncertainty in
   the operations of nature. Both serve most important ends in the
   government of God. The one renders nature steady and stable, the other
   active and accommodating. Without the certainty, man would waver as in
   a dream, and wander as in a trackless desert; without the unexpected
   changes, he would make his rounds like the gin-horse in its circuit, or
   the prisoner on his wheel. Were nature altogether capricious, man would
   likewise become altogether capricious, for he could have no motive to
   steadfast action: again, were nature altogether fixed, it would make
   man's character as cold and formal as itself." McCosh, Method of the
   Divine Government, pp. 172, 174 (fourth edition).

   Note XXX., p. 177.

   The solution usually given by Christian writers of the difficulty of
   reconciling the efficacy of prayer with the infinite power and wisdom
   of God, I cannot help regarding, while thoroughly sympathizing with the
   purpose of its advocates, as unsatisfactory. That solution may be given
   in the language of Euler. "When a christian addresses to God, at this
   present moment, a prayer worthy of being granted, we must not imagine
   that this prayer reaches now, for the first time, the knowledge of God.
   He has already heard that prayer from all eternity; and since this
   compassionate Father has judged it worthy of being granted, He has
   arranged the world expressly in favor of this prayer in such manner,
   that its accomplishment may be a consequence of the natural course of
   events." [212] In other words, the prayer is foreseen and foreordained,
   as well as the answer. This solution appears to assume that the
   conception of law and necessity adequately represents the absolute
   nature of God, while that of contingence and special interposition is
   to be subordinated to it. The arrangements of God in the government of
   the world are fixed from all eternity, and if the prayer is part of
   those arrangements, it becomes a necessary act likewise. It is surely a
   more reverent, and probably a truer solution, to say that the
   conception of general law and that of special interposition are equally
   human. Neither probably represents, as a speculative truth, the
   absolute manner in which God works in His Providence; both are equally
   necessary, as regulative truths, to govern man's conduct in this life.
   In neither aspect are we warranted in making the one conception
   subordinate to the other. A similar objection may be urged against the
   theory which represents a miracle as the possible manifestation of a
   higher and unknown law. There is nothing in the conception of law which
   entitles it to this preeminence over other human modes of
   representation.

   Note XXXI., p. 177.

   Kant, though he attaches no value to miracles as evidences of a moral
   religion, yet distinctly allows that there is no sufficient reason for
   denying their possibility as facts or their utility at certain periods
   of the history of religion. [213] This moderation is not imitated by
   his disciple, Wegscheider, who says: "The belief in a supernatural and
   miraculous, and that too, an immediate revelation of God seems not well
   reconcilable with the ideas of a God eternal, always constant to
   Himself, omnipotent, omniscient and most wise." [214] Strauss, in like
   manner, assumes that the absolute cause never disturbs the chain of
   secondary causes by arbitrary acts of interposition; and therefore lays
   it down as a canon, that whatever is miraculous is unhistorical. [215]

   regards the limitations within which the idea of law should be applied
   to the course of God's Providence, see McCosh, Method of Divine
   Government, p. 155. Kant, Religion innerhalb, u. s. w. p. 102,

LECTURE VII.

   Note I., p. 182.

   THE Moral and Religious Philosophy of Kant, which is here referred to,
   is chiefly contained in his Metaphysik der Sitten, first published in
   1785, his Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, in 1788, and his Religion
   innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, in 1793. For Kant's
   influence on the rationalist theology of Germany, see Rosenkranz,

   A similar view of the superiority of the moral consciousness over other
   phenomena of the human mind, as regards absolute certainty, seems to be
   held by Mr. Jowett. In reference to certain doubts connected with the
   Doctrine of the Atonement, he observes, "It is not the pride of human
   reason which suggests these questions, but the moral sense which He
   himself has implanted in the breast of each one of us." [216] It is
   difficult to see the force of the antithesis here suggested. The "moral
   sense" is not more the gift of God than the "human reason;" and the
   decisions of the former, to be represented in consciousness at all,
   require the cooperation of the latter. Even as regards our own personal
   acts, the intellectual conception must be united with the moral sense
   in passing judgment; and in all general theories concerning the moral
   nature of God or of man, the rational faculty will necessarily have the
   larger share.

   so certainly do I know there is a higher Being, and in Him I have my
   origin . . . . . I acknowledge, then, that I do not know the Good in
   itself, the True in itself, also that I have only a remote foreboding
   of it." That the moral providence of God cannot be judged by the same
   standard as the actions of men, see Leibnitz, Théodicée, De la
   Conformité, etc. § 32 (Opera, ed. Erdmann, p. 489).

   imbecility, that we might the more infallibly understand what is good
   and what evil. The first principles of the Law of Nature are easy; hard
   it were to find men ignorant of them. But concerning the duty which
   Nature's law doth require at the hands of men, in a number of things
   particular, so far hath the natural understanding even of sundry whole
   nations been darkened, that they have not discerned, no not gross
   iniquity to be sin.--Hooker, E. P., I. xii. 2.

   Note XII., p. 187.

   This corresponds to the distinction drawn by Leibnitz, between eternal
   and positive truths of the reason. See Théodicée, Discours de la
   Conformité, etc. § 2 (Opera, Erdmann, p. 480). The latter class of
   truths, he allows, may be subservient to Faith, and even opposed by it,
   but not the former.

   Note XIII., p. 189.

   That it is impossible to conceive the Divine Will as absolutely
   indifferent, is shown by Müller, Christliche Lehre von der Sünde, I. p.
   128. But on the other hand, we are equally unable to conceive it as
   necessarily determined by the laws of the Divine Nature. We cannot
   therefore conceive absolute morality either as dependent on, or as
   independent of, the Will of God. In other words, we are unable to
   conceive absolute morality at all.

   "Sin contains its own retributive penalty, as surely and as naturally
   as the acorn contains the oak. . . . . It is ordained to follow guilt
   by God--not as a Judge, but as the Creator and Legislator of the
   universe. . . . We can be redeemed from the punishment of sin only by
   being redeemed from its commission. Neither can there be any such thing
   as vicarious atonement or punishment. . . . If the foregoing
   reflections are sound, the awful, yet wholesome conviction presses on
   our minds, that there can be no forgiveness of sins."- Greg, Creed of
   Christendom, p. 265. "I believe God is a just God, rewarding and
   punishing us exactly as we act well or ill. I believe that such reward
   and punishment follow necessarily from His will as revealed in natural
   law, as well as in the Bible. I believe that as the highest justice is
   the highest mercy, so He is a merciful God. That the guilty should
   suffer the measure of penalty which their guilt has incurred, is
   justice."--Froude, Nemesis of Faith, p. 69.

   Mr. Rigg justly observes of the theory of immediate forgiveness, as
   substituted for the Christian Atonement, "Let all men be told that God
   cannot be angry with any,' and that whatever may have been a man's
   sins, if he will but repent, there is no hindrance to God's freely
   forgiving him all, without the infliction of any punishment whatever,
   and without the need of any atonement or intercession. What would be
   the effect of such a proclamation? Would it make sin appear exceeding
   sinful?' Would it enhance our idea of the holiness of God? Would it not
   make sin appear a light and trivial thing, tolerated too easily by a
   good-natured' God, to be held as of much account by man?" [217]
   Wegscheider indeed actually urges this argument against the Christian
   doctrine, which it suits his purpose to represent as a scheme of
   unconditional forgiveness. "Experience teaches, that the belief, that
   even the most wicked man can easily obtain absolute remission of sins,
   has always done the greatest detriment to true virtue and
   integrity."--Instit. Theol. § 140.

   Note XX., p. 191.

   Such is, in fact, the theory of Kant. See Religion innerhalb der
   Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, p. 84. He does not, however, carry his
   principle consistently out, but admits a kind of vicarious suffering in
   a symbolical sense; the penitent being morally a different individual
   from the sinner. Even this metaphorical conceit is utterly out of place
   according to the main principles of his system.

   Note XXI., p. 192.

   Some excellent remarks on this point will be found in McCosh's Method
   of the Divine Government, p. 475 (4th edition).

   Note XXII., p. 192.

   "This natural indignation is generally moderate and low enough in
   mankind, in each particular man, when the injury which excites it doth
   not affect himself, or one whom he considers as himself. Therefore the
   precepts to forgive and to love our enemies, do not relate to that
   general indignation against injury and the authors of it, but to this
   feeling, or resentment, when raised by private or personal
   injury."--Butler, Sermon IX, On Forgiveness of Injuries.

   Note XXIII., p. 193.

   Thus Mr. Froude exclaims, "He! to have created mankind liable to
   fail--to have laid them in the way of a temptation under which He knew
   they would fall, and then curse them and all who were to come of them,
   and all the world for their sakes! "--Nemesis of Faith, p. 11. This
   author omits the whole doctrine of the redemption, and treats the fall
   and the curse as if they were the sole manner of God's dealing with
   sinners. His objection, stripped of its violent language, is but one
   form of the universal riddle--the existence of Evil. A similar
   objection is urged by Mr. Parker, Theism, Atheism, and the Popular
   Theology, p. 64: and by Mr. Atkinson, Letters on the Laws of Man's
   Nature and Development, pp. 173, 174.

   Note XXIV., p. 193.

   Aristotle Eth. Nic. V. 10. "For of a thing, which is not limited, the
   rule is also unlimited, like the plumb-rule of Lesbian house-building,
   changing according to the form of the stone, and not remaining the same
   rule."

   Note XXV., p. 193.

   On this spirit of universal criticism, Augustine remarks: "But they are
   foolish, who say, 'Could not the wisdom of God otherwise deliver men,
   than by assuming human nature, and being born of a woman, and suffering
   all those things from sinners?' To whom, we say He could, but if He
   were to do otherwise, He would in like manner be displeasing to your
   folly."--De Agone Christiano, c. 11.

   The following passage from the Eclipse of Faith, p. 125, is an
   excellent statement of the versatility of the "moral reason," or
   "spiritual insight," when set up as a criterion of religious truth.
   "Even as to that fundamental position,--the existence of a Being of
   unlimited power and wisdom (as to his unlimited goodness, I believe
   that nothing but an external revelation can absolutely certify us), I
   feel that I am much more indebted to those inferences from design,
   which these writers make so light of, than to any clearness in the
   imperfect intuition; for if I found--and surely this is the true
   test--the traces of design less conspicuous in the external world,
   confusion there as in the moral, and in both greater than is now found
   in either, I extremely doubt whether the faintest surmise of such a
   Being would have suggested itself to me. But be that as it may; as to
   their other cardinal sentiments,--the nature of my relations to this
   Being--his placability if offended,--the terms of forgiveness, if
   any,--whether, as these gentlemen affirm, he is accessible to all,
   without any atonement or mediator:--as to all this, I solemnly declare,
   that apart from external instruction, I cannot by interrogating my
   racked spirit, catch even a murmur. That it must be faint indeed, in
   other men--so faint as to render the pretensions of the certitude of
   the internal revelation, and its independence of all external
   revelation, perfectly preposterous--I infer from this,--that they have,
   for the most part, arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions from
   those of these interpreters of the spiritual revelation. As to the
   articles, indeed, of man's immortality and a future state, it would be
   truly difficult for my spiritual insight' to verify theirs; for,
   according to Mr. Parker, his insight' affirms that man is immortal, and
   Mr. Newman's insight' declares nothing about the matter! Nor is my
   consciousness, so far as I can trace it, mine only. This painful
   uncertainty has been the confession of multitudes of far greater minds;
   they have been so far from contending that we have naturally a clear
   utterance on these great questions, that they have acknowledged the
   necessity of an external revelation; and mankind in general, so far
   from thinking or feeling such light superfluous, have been constantly
   gaping after it, and adopted almost any thing that but bore the name.

   What, then, am I to think of this all-sufficient revelation from
   within?"

   Note XXVI., p. 193.

   For the Socinian theory of a limited foreknowledge in God, see Müller,
   Christliche Lehre con der Sünde, II. pp. 276, 288; Davison, Discourses
   on Prophecy, pp. 360, 367. A similar view is held by Rothe, Theol.
   Ethik, Vol. I. p. 118; and by Drobisch, Grundlehren der
   Religionsphilosophie, p. 209. For the opposite necessitarian theory,
   see Calvin, Inst. L. II. ch. 4. § 6; Edwards, On the Freedom of the
   Will, Part II. Sect. xii. quoted above, Lect. II. Note 7; and in the
   authorities cited by Wegscheider, Inst. Theol., § 65.

   Note XXVII., p. 193.

   That God's knowledge is not properly foreknowledge, as not being
   subject to the law of time, is maintained by Augustine, De Civ. Dei,
   XI. 21, De Div. Quæst ad Simpl. 4. If. Qu. 2. § 2, and by Boethius, De
   Consol. Phil. L. V. Pr. 3-6. A similar view is taken by Wegscheider,
   Inst. Theol. § 65. As a speculative theory, this view is as untenable
   as the opposite hypothesis of an absolute foreknowledge and
   predestination. We can only say that we do not know that the Divine
   Consciousness is subject to the law of succession; not that we know
   that it is not. As a means of saving the infinity of God's knowledge,
   consistently with the free agency of man, the hypothesis becomes
   unnecessary, the instant we admit that the infinite is not an object of
   human conception at all. If this is once conceded, we need no
   hypothesis to reconcile truths which we cannot certainly know to be in
   antagonism to each other. We cannot assume the simultaneity of the
   divine consciousness; for we know nothing of the infinite, either in
   itself or in its relation to time. Nor, on the other hand, could we
   deduce the necessity of human actions from the fact of God's
   foreknowledge, even if the latter could be assumed as absolutely true;
   for we know not whether the conception of necessity itself implies a
   divine reality, or merely a human mode of representation.

   Note XXVIII., p. 194.

   Wegscheider (Inst. Theol. § 50) denies the possibility of prophecy, on
   the ground that a prediction of human events is destructive of freedom.
   In this he follows Kant, Anthropologie, § 35.

   Note XXIX., p. 194.

   "As it is certain that prescience does not destroy the liberty of man's
   will, or impose any necessity upon it, men's actions being not
   therefore future, because they are foreknown, but therefore foreknown,
   because future; and were a thing never so contingent, yet upon
   supposition that it will be done, it must needs have been future from
   all eternity: so is it extreme arrogance for men, because themselves
   can naturally foreknow nothing but by some causes antecedent, as an
   eclipse of the sun or moon, therefore to presume to measure the
   knowledge of God Almighty according to the same scantling, and to deny
   him the prescience of human actions, not considering that, as his
   nature is incomprehensible, so his knowledge may be well looked upon by
   us as such too; that which is past our finding out, and too wonderful
   for us."--Cudworth, Intellectual System, ch. V. (Vol. III. p. 19. ed.
   Harrison). "We may be unable to conceive how a thing not necessary in
   its nature can be foreknown--for our foreknowledge is in general
   limited by that circumstance, and is more or less perfect in proportion
   to the fixed or necessary nature of the things we contemplate: . . .
   but to subject the knowledge of God to any such limitation is surely
   absurd and unphilosophical, as well as impious."--Copleston, Enquiry
   into the Doctrines of Necessity and Predestination, p. 46.

   Note XXX., p. 194.

   Origen. apud Euseb. Præp. Evang. VI. 11. 36. And if we must say, that
   foreknowledge is not the cause of events, we will say what, though more
   paradoxical, is yet true, that the fact that the thing is to be, is the
   cause of its foreknowledge."--Leibnitz, Théodicée, § 37. "It is very
   easy to decide, that foreknowledge in itself adds nothing to the
   determination of the reality of future events, except that this
   determination is known; a thing which does not at all increase the
   determination, or the futurition (as it is called) of these
   events."--Clarke, Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, p.
   96. "The certainty of Foreknowledge does not cause the certainty of
   things, but is itself founded on the reality of their existence.
   Whatever now is, it is certain that it is; and it was yesterday and
   from eternity as certainly true, that the thing would be to-day, as
   'tis now certain that it is. This certainty of events is equally the
   same, whether it is supposed that the thing could be foreknown or not."

   "Sins are finite; between the finite and the infinite there is no
   proportion; therefore punishments also ought to be finite."--Sonerus
   apud Leibnitz. Præf. [218] The same argument is used by Blasche,
   Philosophische Unsterblichkeitlehre, § 4; as well as by Mr. Newman,
   Phases of Faith, p. 78, and by Mr. Froude, Nemesis of Faith, p. 17. The
   latter however entirely misrepresents Leibnitz's reply to the
   objection.

   Note XXXIV., p. 197.

   Thus Leibnitz replies to the objection of Sonerus: "Even, therefore, if
   we should concede that no sin is of itself infinite, yet it can with
   truth be said, that the sins of the damned are infinite in number; for
   they persist in sinning, through all eternity." The same argument is
   repeated in the Theodicée, §§ 74, 133, 266. The reply which Mr. Froude
   attributes to Leibnitz, namely, that sin against an Infinite Being
   contracts a character of infinity, is merely noticed by him as "la
   raison vulgaire," urged, among others, by Ursinus. With Leibnitz's
   language may be compared that of Müller; "And since experience shows,
   that men really resist the holiest work of divine love, why should it
   be thought impossible, that this resistance against God may also, on
   the other side this earthly life, be ever again renewed, and thus
   carried forward into endless periods?"--Christliche Lehre von der
   Sünde, II. p. 601.

   Note XXXV., p. 197.

   Thus Mr. Newman says, "I saw that the current orthodoxy made Satan
   eternal conqueror over Christ. In vain does the Son of God come from
   heaven and take human flesh and die on the cross. In spite of him the
   devil carries off to hell the vast majority of mankind, in whom not
   misery only, but Sin, is triumphant for ever and ever." [219] And Mr.
   Parker, to the same effect, remarks, "I can never believe that Evil is
   a finality with God." [220] The remarks of Müller, in answer to similar
   theories, are worthy of consideration. "It seems incredible, according
   to what we have said, that the idea of the world is to reach its
   complete development with an unsettled discord, that opposition to the
   Divine will is to maintain itself in the will of any creature
   whatsoever. This difficulty, however, is solved by a correct conception
   of punishment. The opposition to the Divine will does not hold its
   ground, but is absolutely overcome, when the entire condition of the
   beings, in whom it is, is a penal condition; so that evil, being in
   restraint, is no longer able to disturb the pure harmony of the world
   glorified and transformed to the kingdom of God." [221]

   Note XXXVI., p. 197.

   See a short treatise by Kant, Ueber das Misslingen aller
   Philosophischen Versuche in der Theodicée (Werke, VII. p. 385). For a
   more detailed account of various theories, see Müller, Christliche
   Lehre von der Sünde, B. II. An able review of the difficulties of the
   question will be found in Mr. Mozley's Augustinian Doctrine of
   Predestination, p. 262 seq.

   Note XXXVII., p. 197.

   The theory which represents evil as a privation or a negation--a theory
   adopted by theologians and philosophers of almost every shade of
   opinion, in order to reconcile the goodness of God with the apparent
   permission of sin, can only be classed among the numerous necessarily
   fruitless attempts of metaphysicians to explain the primary facts of
   consciousness, by the arbitrary assumption of a principle of which we
   are not and cannot be conscious, and of whose truth or falsehood we
   have therefore no possible guarantee. Moral evil, in the only form in
   which we are conscious of it, appears as the direct transgression of a
   law whose obligation we feel within us; and thus manifested, it is an
   act as real and as positive as any performed in the most rigid
   compliance with that law. And this is the utmost point to which human
   research can penetrate. Whether, in some absolute mode of existence,
   out of all relation to human consciousness, the phenomenon of moral
   evil is ultimately dependent on the addition or the subtraction of some
   causative principle, is a question the solution of which is beyond
   consciousness, and therefore beyond philosophy. To us, as moral agents,
   capable of right and wrong acts, evil is a reality, and its
   consequences are a reality. What may be the nature of the cause which
   produces this unquestionably real fact of human consciousness, is a
   mystery which God has not revealed, and which man cannot discover.

   Note XXXVIII., p. 199.

   Analogy, Part II. ch. 5. In another significant passage (Part I. ch.
   2), Butler exhibits the argument from analogy as bearing on the final
   character of punishment. "Though after men have been guilty of folly
   and extravagance up to a certain degree, it is often in their power,
   for instance, to retrieve their affairs, to recover their health and
   character; at least in good measure; yet real reformation is, in many
   cases, of no avail at all towards preventing the miseries, poverty,
   sickness, infamy, naturally annexed to folly and extravagance exceeding
   that degree. . . . So that many natural punishments are final to him
   who incurs them, if considered only in his temporal capacity."--Compare
   Bishop Browne, Procedure of the Understanding, p. 351. "The difficulty
   in that question, What proportion endless torments can bear to
   momentary sins? is quite removed, by considering that the punishments
   denounced and threatened are not in themselves sanctions entirely
   arbitrary, as it is in punishments annexed to human laws; but they are
   withal so many previous warnings or declarations of the inevitable
   consequence and natural tendency of Sin in itself, to render us
   miserable in another world."

   Note XXXIX., p. 200.

   Kant (Religion, u. s. w., Werke, X. p. 45) objects to the doctrine of
   inherited corruption, on the ground that a man cannot be responsible
   for any but his own acts. The objection is carried out more fully by
   Wegscheider, who says, "Neither can the goodness of God allow, that by
   one man's sin, universal human nature be corrupted and depraved; nor
   can His wisdom suffer, that God's work, furnished from the beginning
   with surpassing endowments, be transformed in a little while, for the
   slightest cause, to quite another and a worse condition."--Inst. Theol.
   § 117. The learned critic does not seem to be aware that the principle
   of one of these arguments exactly annihilates that of the other; for if
   we concede to the first, that every man is born in the state of
   pristine innocence, we must admit, in opposition to the second, that
   God's work is destroyed by slight causes, not once only, but millions
   of times, in every man that sins. The only other supposition possible
   is, that sin itself is part of God's purpose--in which case we naced
   not trouble ourselves to establish any argument on the hypothesis of
   the divine wisdom or benevolence.

   Note XL., p. 200.

   Aristotle, Eth. Nic. VII. 2. "But one may be at a loss to understand
   how a person, who takes a right estimate of things, can live without
   moral self-control. Some, therefore, say that a person, who had
   knowledge, could not live in such manner; for (as Socrates thought), if
   knowledge were within him, he could not be controlled by something
   else, and dragged about by it, like a slave."

   Note XLI., p. 200.

   For sundry rationalist objections to the doctrine of Justification by
   Faith, see Wegscheider, § 154, 155. He declares the whole doctrine to
   be the result of the anthropopathic notions of a rude age.

   Note XLII., p. 201.

   "Or notion of freedom does not, it is true, exclude motives of
   conscious action; but motives are not compulsory, but are always
   effectual only through the will; motives for the human will can
   therefore proceed from God, without man's being thereby forced, without
   his losing his freedom, and becoming a blind instrument of the higher
   power."--Drobisch, Grundlehren der Religionsphilosophie, p. 272. In
   like manner, Mr. Mozley, in his learned and philosophical work on the
   Augustinian Doctrine of Predestination, truly says, "What we have to
   consider in this question, is not what is the abstract idea of
   freewill, but what is the freewill which we really and actually have.
   This actual freewill, we find, is not a simple but a complex thing;
   exhibiting oppositions and inconsistencies; appearing on the one side
   to be a power of doing anything to which there is no physical
   hindrance, on the other side to be a restricted faculty" (p. 102).
   Neither the Pelagian theory on the one side, nor the Augustinian on the
   other, took sufficient account of the actual condition of the human
   will in relation to external influences. The question was argued as if
   the relation of divine grace to human volition must consist wholly in
   activity on the one side and passivity on the other;--in the will of
   its own motion accepting the grace, or the grace by its irresistible
   force overpowering the will. The controversy thus becomes precisely
   analogous to the philosophical dispute between the advocates of
   freewill and determinism; the one proceeding an the assumption of an
   absolute indifference of the will; the other maintaining its necessary
   determination by motives.

   Mr. Mozley has thrown considerable light on the true bearings of the
   predestinarian controversy; and his work is especially valuable as
   vindicating the supreme right of Scripture to be accepted in all its
   statements, instead of being mutilated to suit the demands of human
   logic. But it cannot be denied that his own theory, however
   satisfactory in this respect, leaves a painful void on the
   philosophical side, and apparently vindicates the authority of
   revelation by the sacrifice of the laws of human thought. He maintains
   that where our conception of an object is indistinct, contradictory
   propositions may be accepted as both equally true; and lie carries this
   theory so far as to assert of the rival doctrines of Pelagius and
   Augustine, "Both these positions are true, if held together, and both
   false, if held apart." [222]

   Should we not rather say that the very indistinctness of conception
   prevents the existence of any contradiction at all? I can only know two
   ideas to be contradictory by the distinct conception of both; and,
   where such a conception is impossible, there is no evidence of
   contradiction. The actual declarations of Scripture, so far as they
   deal with matters above human comprehension, are not in themselves
   contradictory to the facts of consciousness; they are only made so by
   arbitrary interpretation. It is nowhere said in Scripture that God so
   predestines man as to take from him all power of acting by his own
   will:--this is an inference from the supposed nature of predestination;
   an inference which, if our conception of predestination is indistinct,
   we have no right to make. Man cannot foreknow unless the event is
   certain; nor predestine without coercing the result. Here there is a
   contradiction between freewill and predestination. But we cannot
   transfer the same contradiction to Theology, without assuming that
   God's knowledge and acts are subject to the same conditions as man's.

   The contradictory propositions which Mr. Mozley exhibits, as equally
   guaranteed by consciousness, are in reality by no means homogeneous. In
   each pair of contradictories, we have a limited and individual fact of
   immediate perception,--such as the power of originating an
   action,--opposed to a universal maxim, not perceived immediately, but
   based on some process of general thought,--such as that every event
   must have a cause. To establish these two as contradictory of each
   other, it should be shown that in every single act we have a direct
   consciousness of being coerced, as well as of being free; and that we
   can gather from each fact a clear and distinct conception. But this is
   by no means the case. The principle of causality, whatever may be its
   true import and extent, is not derived from the immediate consciousness
   of our volition being determined by antecedent causes; and therefore it
   may not be applied to human actions, until, from an analysis of the
   mode in which this maxim is gained, it can be distinctly shown that
   these are included under it. [223]

   By applying to Mr. Mozley's theory the principles advanced in the
   preceding Lectures, it may, I believe, be shown that, in every case,
   the contradiction is not real, but apparent; and that it arises front a
   vain attempt to transcend the limits of human thought.

   that we have a sufficient conception of the nature of Divine Power and
   of the action of a First Cause; an assumption which the author himself
   in another passage repudiates, acknowledging that "As an unknown
   premiss, the Divine Power is no contradiction to the fact of evil; for
   we must know what a truth is before we see a contradiction in it to
   another truth" (p. 276). This latter admission, consistently carried

   proposition which Paul believed and taught. Propose them to the faith
   of others, to be tested by inward and spiritual evidence only; and you

   "This question of miracles, whether true or false, is of no religious
   significance. When Mr. Locke said the doctrine proved the miracles, not
   the miracles the doctrine, he admitted their worthlessness. They can be
   useful only to such as deny our internal power of discerning truth."--
   Parker, Discourse of matters pertaining to Religion, p. 170. Pascal,
   with far sounder judgment, says, on the other hand, "we must judge of
   the doctrine by the miracles, we must judge of miracles by the
   doctrine. The doctrine shows what the miracles are, and the miracles
   show what the doctrine is. All this is true, and not contradictory. . .
   . . . Jesus Christ cured the man who was born blind, and did many other
   miracles on the sabbath day; whereby he blinded the Pharisees, who
   said, that it was necessary to judge of miracles by the doctrine. . . .
   . . The Pharisees said: This man is not of God, because he keepeth not
   the sabbath day. The others said: How can a man that is a sinner, do
   such miracles? Which is the clearer?" [224] In like manner Clarke
   observes, "'Tis indeed the miracles only, that prove the doctrine; and
   not the doctrine that proves the miracles. But then in order to this
   end, that the miracles may prove the doctrine, tis always necessary to
   be first supposed that the doctrine be such as is in its nature capable
   of being proved by miracles. The doctrine must be in itself possible
   and capable to be proved, and then miracles will prove it to be
   actually and certainly true. [225] The judicious remarks of Dean Trench
   are to the same effect, "When we object to the use often made of these
   works, it is only because they have been forcibly severed from the
   whole complex of Christ's life and doctrine, and presented to the
   contemplation of men apart from these; it is only because, when on his
   head are many crowns,' one only has been singled out in proof that He
   is King of kings, and Lord of lords. The miracles have been spoken of
   as though they borrowed nothing from the truths which they confirmed,
   but those truths everything from the miracles by which they were
   confirmed; when, indeed, the true relation is one of mutual
   interdependence, the miracles proving the doctrines, and the doctrines
   approving the miracles, and both held together for us in a blessed
   unity, in the person of Him who spake the words and did the works, and
   through the impress of highest holiness and of absolute truth and
   goodness, which that person leaves stamped on our souls;--so that it
   may be more truly said that we believe the miracles for Christ's sake,
   than Christ for the miracles' sake." [226]

   Foxton, Popular Christianity, p. 105. On the other hand, the profound
   author of the Restoration of Belief, with a far juster estimate of the
   value of evidence, observes, "Remove the supernatural from the Gospels,
   or, in other words, reduce the evangelical histories, by aid of some
   unintelligible hypothesis (German-born), to the level of an inane
   jumble of credulity, extravagance, and myth-power (whatever this may
   be), and then Christianity will go to its place, as to any effective
   value, in relation to humanizing and benevolent influences and
   enterprises;--a place, say, a few degrees above the level of some
   passages in Epictetus and M. Aurelius. . . . The Gospel is a Force in
   the world, it is a force available for the good of man, not because it
   is Wisdom, but because it is Power. . . . . But the momentum supplied
   by the Gospel is a force which disappears--which is utterly gone, gone
   for ever, when Belief in its authority, as attested by miracles, is
   destroyed."--Pp. 290, 291, 29!). To the same effect are the excellent
   remarks with which Neander concludes his Life of Jesus Christ. "The end
   of Christ's appearance on earth corresponds to its beginning. No link
   in its chain of supernatural facts can be lost, without taking away its
   significance as a whole. Christianity rests upon these facts; stands or
   falls with them. By faith in them has the Divine life been generated
   from the beginning; by faith in them has that life in all ages
   regenerated mankind, raised them above the limits of earthly life,
   changed them from glebæ adscripti to citizens of heaven, and formed the
   stage of transition from an existence chained to nature, to a free,
   celestial life, far raised above it. Were this faith gone, there might,
   indeed, remain many of the effects of what Christianity has been; but
   as for Christianity in the true sense, as for a Christian Church, there
   could be none."--(English Translation, p. 487).

   of an effect which could be realized only by God conformably to such a
   conception. In the latter case, they would--to the exclusion of the
   causality of all other beings--justify the conclusion, that is
   revelation; but, as it is, only this conclusion is justified; that can

   circumstances of the Being in whom it was realized,--in connection with
   a life not only unprivileged, but offering numerous positive hindrances
   to the origination, the growth, and, most of all, the perfection of
   spiritual excellence. In a Jew of Nazareth--a young man--an uneducated
   mechanic--moral perfection was realized. Can this phenomenon be
   accounted for? There is here, without doubt, a manifestation of
   humanity; but the question is,--was this a manifestation of mere
   humanity and no more? "--ld. p. 251. [227]

   "Although some circumstances in the description of God's Firstborn and
   Elect, by whom this change is to be accomplished, may primarily apply
   to collective Israel [many others will admit of no such application.
   Israel surely was not the child whom a virgin was to bear; Israel did
   not make his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death;
   Israel scarcely reconciled that strangely blended variety of suffering
   and triumph, which was predicted of the Messiah]."--R. Williams,
   Rational Godliness, p. 56. In a Note to this passage, the author adds,
   "I no longer feel confident of the assertion in brackets; but now
   believe that all the prophecies have primarily an application nearly
   contemporaneous." As a specimen of this application, we may cite a
   subsequent passage from the same volume, p. 169. "The same Isaiah sees
   that Israel, whom God had called out of Egypt, and whom the Eternal had
   denominated his first-born, trampled, captive, and derided; he sees the
   beauty of the sanctuary defiled, and the anointed priests of the living
   God degraded from their office, led as sheep to the slaughter, insulted
   by their own countrymen, as men smitten of God, cast off by Jehovah.
   Ah! he says, it is through the wickedness of the nations that Israel is
   thus afflicted; it is through the apostasy of the people that the
   priesthood is thus smitten and reviled; they hide their faces from the
   Lord's servant; nevertheless, no weapon that is formed against him
   shall prosper. It is a little thing that He should merely recover
   Israel, He shall also be a light to the Gentiles, and a salvation to
   the ends of the earth."

   There are few unprejudiced readers who will not think the author's
   first thought on this subject preferable to his second. In the
   interpretation of any profane author, the perverse ingenuity which
   regards the Fifty-Third chapter of Isaiah (to say nothing of the other
   portions of the prophecy, which Dr. Williams has divorced from their
   context), as a description of the contemporaneous state of the Jewish
   people and priesthood, would be considered as too extravagant to need
   refutation. That such an interpretation should have found favor with
   thoroughgoing rationalists, determined at all hazards to expel the
   supernatural from Scripture, is only to be expected; and this may
   explain the adoption of this and similar views by a considerable school
   of expositors in Germany. But that it should have been received by
   those who, like Dr. Williams, hold fast the doctrine of the Incarnation
   of the Son of God, is less easily to be accounted for. If this greatest
   of all miracles be once conceded,--if it be allowed that "when the
   fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a
   woman;"--what marvel is it, that, while the time was still incomplete,
   a prophet should have been divinely inspired to proclaim the future
   redemption? Once concede the possibility of the supernatural at all,
   and the Messianic interpretation is the only one reconcilable with the
   facts of history and the plain meaning of words. The fiction of a
   contemporaneous sense, whether with or without a subsequent Messianic
   application, is only needed to get rid of direct inspiration; and
   nothing is gained by getting rid of inspiration, so long as a fragment
   of the supernatural is permitted to remain. It is only when we assume,
   a priori, that the supernatural is impossible, that anything is gained
   by forcing the prophetic language into a different meaning.

   Note XII., p. 215.

   Of this Eclectic Christianity, of which Schleiermacher may be
   considered as the chief modern representative, a late gifted and
   lamented writer has truly observed: "He could not effect the rescue of
   Christianity on these principles without serious loss to the object of
   his care. His efforts resemble the benevolent intervention of the
   deities of the classic legends, who, to save the nymph from her
   pursuer, changed her into a river or a tree. It may be that the stream
   and the foliage have their music and their beauty, that we may think we
   hear a living voice still in the whispers of the one and the murmurs of
   the other, yet the beauty of divine Truth, our heavenly visitant,
   cannot but be grievously obscured by the change, for the glory of the
   celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.' Such
   ecclesiastical doctrines as contain what he regards as the essence of
   Christianity are received. All others, as being feelings embodied in
   the concrete form of dogmas, as man's objective conceptions of the
   divine, he considers as open to criticism. . . . . . Schleiermacher
   accounts as thus indifferent the doctrine of the Trinity, the
   supernatural conception of the Saviour, many of his miracles, his
   ascension and several other truths of the same class. This one reply,
   That doctrine makes no necessary part of our Christian consciousness,'
   stands solitary, like a Cocles at the bridge, and keeps always at bay
   the whole army of advancing queries. But surely it does constitute an
   essential part of our Christian consciousness, whether we regard the
   New Testament writers as trustworthy or otherwise. If certain parts of
   their account are myths, and others the expression of Jewish prejudice,
   and we are bidden dismiss them accordingly from our faith, how are we
   sure that in what is left these historians were faithful, or these
   expositors true representatives of the mind of Christ? Our Christian
   consciousness is likely to become a consciousness of little else than
   doubt, if we give credit to the assertion--Your sole informants on
   matters of eternal moment, were, every here and there, misled by
   prejudice and imposed upon by fable." [228]

   Note XIII., p. 216.

   For the objections of modern Pantheism against the immortality of the
   soul, See [300]Lecture III., Note 27. Of the resurrection of the body
   in particular, Wegscheider observes: "The resurrection of the body is
   so far from being reconcilable with the precepts of sound reason, that
   it is embarrassed with very many and the gravest difficulties. For, in
   the first place, it cannot be doubted that this opinion derived its
   origin from the lame and imperfect conceptions of men of defective
   culture; for such persons, being destitute of a just idea of the Divine
   being, are wont to imagine to themselves a life after death, solely
   after the nature of the earthly life. Hence it comes to pass, that,
   among barbarous nations, and also in the system of Zoroaster, from
   which the Jews themselves seem to have drawn, that same doctrine is
   discovered. Then, too, the resurrection of the body, taught in the
   books of the New Testament, which, even from the apostolic age, was
   condemned by not a few, is seen to be so closely connected with the
   mythical opinions of the Messiah, and the story of Jesus restored to
   life, that it cannot be judged of and explained by any other method
   than those myths themselves. . . . . . Moreover, the idea is manifestly
   not in agreement with a God most holy and good, that man, who cannot
   pass a real life without the body, is to have this body restored to him
   after many thousands of years. . . . . Induced by these reasons, and
   others of scarcely less weight, we think that Jesus, wherever he is
   said to have taught the resurrection of the body, humored the opinions
   of his countrymen; or, rather, the disciples of Jesus . . . . falsely
   ascribed to Him an opinion of their own." [229] Concerning angels and
   spirits, one of the most significant specimens of modern Sadducceism
   may be found in Dr. Donaldson's "Christian Orthodoxy Reconciled with
   the Conclusions of Modern Biblical Learning," p. 317, sqq. Ile holds,
   with regard to intermediate Intelligences, the same view which
   Wegscheider suggests with regard to the Resurrection, namely, "that our
   Lord, in his dealings with the Jews, rather acquiesced in the
   established phraseology than sanctioned the prevalent superstition."
   [230] He adds that, "in many respects, our Lord seems to have approved
   and recommended" the views of the Sadducces; though "he could not
   openly adopt a speculative truth, which was saddled with an application
   diametrically opposed to the cardinal verity of his religion." [231] It
   is obvious that, by this method of exposition, "Christian Orthodoxy"
   may mean anything or nothing. Any doctrine which this or that expositor
   finds it convenient to reject, may be set aside as a concession to
   popular phraseology; and thus the teaching of Christ may be stripped of
   its most essential doctrines by men who profess all the while to
   believe in His immanent Divinity and Omniscience. Strauss arrives at a
   similar conclusion, though, of course, without troubling himself about
   Scriptural premises. "It is, therefore, not enough to leave undecided,
   with Schleiermacher, the possibility of such beings as angels, and only
   to fix so much as this, that we have neither to take account of them in
   our conduct, nor to expect further revelations of their nature; rather
   is it the case, chat, if the modern idea of God and the world is
   correct, there cannot be any such beings any where at all." [232] In
   the same spirit Mr. Parker openly maintains that "Jesus shared the
   erroneous notions of the times respecting devils, possessions, and
   demonology in general;" [233] --a conclusion which is at least more
   logical and consistent than that of those who acknowledge the divine
   authority of the Teacher, yet claim a right to reject as much as they
   please of his teaching.

   The theory which represents the human race as in a constant state of
   religious progress, and the various religions of antiquity as
   successive steps in the education of mankind, has been a favorite with
   various schools of modern philosophy. Hegel, as might naturally be
   expected, propounds a theory of the necessary development of religious
   ideas, as determined by the movements of the universal Spirit. [234] It
   is true that he is compelled by the stern necessities of chronology to
   represent the polytheism of Greece and Rome as an advance on the
   monotheism of Judea; [235] and perhaps, if we regard the Hegelian
   philosophy as the final consummation of all religious truth, this
   retrograde progress may be supported by some plausible arguments. [236]
   Another form of the same theory is that of Comte, who traces the
   progress of humanity through Fetichism, Polytheism, and Monotheism, to
   culminate at last in the Positive Religion, which worships the idea of
   humanity, including therein the auxiliary animals. [237] In theories of
   this kind, the distinction between progress and mere fluctuation
   depends upon the previous question, Whence, and Whither? What was the
   original state of religious knowledge in mankind, and what is the end
   to which it is advancing? If Pantheism or Atheism is the highest form
   of religious truth, every step in that direction is unquestionably
   progressive; if otherwise, it is not progress, but corruption.

   The previous question is clearly stated by Theodore Parker. "From what
   point did the human race set out,--from civilization and the true
   worship of one God, or from cannibalism and the deification of nature?
   Has the human race fallen or risen? The question is purely historical,
   and to be answered by historical witnesses. But in the presence, and
   still more in the absence, of such witnesses, the a priori doctrines of
   the man's philosophy affect his decision. Reasoning with no facts is as
   easy as all motion in cacao. The analogy of the geological formation of
   the earth--its gradual preparation, so to say, for the reception of
   plants and animals, the ruder first, and then the more complex and
   beautiful, till at last she opens her bosom to man,--this, in
   connection with many similar analogies, would tend to show that a
   similar order was to be expected in the affairs of men--development
   from the lower to the higher, and not the reverse. In strict accordance
   with this analogy, some have taught that man was created in the lowest
   stage of savage life; his Religion the rudest worship of nature; his
   Morality that of the cannibal; that all of the civilized races have
   risen from this point, and gradually passed through Fetichism and
   Polytheism, before they reached refinement and true Religion. The
   spiritual man is the gradual development of germs latent in the natural
   man." [238]

   It is to be regretted that Professor Jowett has partially given the
   sanction of his authority to a theory which it is to be presumed he
   would not advocate to the full extent of the above statement. "The
   theory of a primitive religion common to all mankind," he tells us,
   "has only to be placed distinctly before the mind, to make us aware
   that it is the baseless fabric of a vision; there is one stream of
   revelation only--the Jewish. But even if it were conceivable, it would
   be inconsistent with facts. The earliest history tells nothing of a
   general religion, but of particular beliefs about stocks and stones,
   about places and persons, about animal life, about the sun, moon, and
   stars, about the divine essence permeating the world, about gods in the
   likeness of men appearin- in battles and directing the course of
   states, about the world below, about sacrifices, purifications,
   initiations, magic, mysteries. These were the true religions of nature,
   varying with different degrees of mental culture or civilization."
   [239] And in an earlier part of the same Essay, he says, "No one who
   looks at the religions of the world, stretching from east to west,
   through so many cycles of human history, can avoid seeing in them a
   sort of order and design. They are like so many steps in the education
   of mankind. Those countless myriads of human beings who know no other
   truth than that of religious coëval with the days of the Apostle, or
   even of Moses, are not wholly uncared for in the sight of God." [240]

   It would be unfair to press these words to a meaning which they do not
   necessarily bear. We will assume that by the "earliest history,"
   profane history alone is meant, in opposition to the Jewish Revelation;
   and that the author does not intend, as some of his critics have
   supposed, to deny the historical character of the Book of Genesis, and
   the existence of a primitive revelation coeval with the creation of
   man. Even with this limitation, the evidence is stated far too
   absolutely. But the words last quoted are, to say the least,
   incautious, and suggest coincidence in a favorite theory of modern
   philosophy, equally repugnant to Scripture and to natural religion. Two
   very opposite views may be taken of the false religions of antiquity.
   The Scriptures invariably speak of them as corruptions of man's natural
   reason, and abominations in the sight of God. Some modern writers
   delight to represent them as instruments of God's Providence, and steps
   in the education of mankind. This view naturally belongs to that
   pantheistic philosophy which recognizes no Deity beyond the actual
   constitution of the world, which acknowledges all that exists as
   equally divine, or, which is the same thing, equally godless; but it is
   irreconcilable with the belief in a personal God, and in a distinction
   between the good which He approves and the evil which He condemns. But
   men will concede much to philosophy who will concede nothing to
   Scripture. The sickly and sentimental morality which talks of the
   "ferocious" God of the popular theology, [241] which is indignant at
   the faith of Abraham, [242] which shudders over the destruction of the
   Canaanites, [243] which prides itself in discovering imperfections in
   the law of Moses, [244] is content to believe that the God who could
   not sanction these things, could yet create man with the morality of a
   cannibal, and the religion of a fetish-worshipper, and ordain for him a
   law of development through the purifying stages which marked the
   civilization of Egypt and Babylon and Imperial Rome. Verily this
   unbelieving Reason makes heavy demands on the faith of its disciples.
   It will not tolerate the slightest apparent anomaly in the moral
   government of God; but it is ready, when its theories require, to
   propound a scheme of deified iniquity, which it is hardly exaggeration
   to designate as the moral government of Satan.

   We must believe, indeed, that in the darkest ages of idolatry, God
   "left not himself without witness;" we must believe that the false
   religions of the world, like its other evils, are overruled by God to
   the purposes of His good Providence. But this does not make them the
   less evils and abominations in the sight of God. Those who speak of the
   human race as under a law of vegetable development, forget that man
   has, what vegetables have not, a moral sense and a free will. It is
   indeed impossible, in our present state of knowledge, to draw exactly
   the line between the sins and the misfortunes of individuals, to decide
   how much of each man's history is due to his own will, and how much to
   the circumstances in which he is placed. But though Scripture, like
   philosophy, offers no complete solution of the problem of the existence
   of evil, it at least distinctly points out what the true solution is
   not. So long as it represents the sin of man as a fall from the state
   in which God originally placed him, and as a rebellion against a divine
   command; so long as it represents idolatry as hateful to God, and false
   religion as a declension towards evil, not as a progress towards
   good;--so long it emphatically records its protest against both the
   self-delusion which denies that evil exists at all, and the blasphemy
   which asserts that it exists by the appointment of God.

   Note XVI., p. 219.

   "It is an obvious snare, that many, out of such abundance of knowledge,
   should be tempted to forget at times this grand and simple point that
   all vital truth is to be sought from Scripture alone. Hence that they
   should be tempted rather to combine systems for themselves according,
   to some proportion and fancy of their own, than be content neither to
   add nor diminish anything from that which Christ and his Apostles have
   enjoined; to make up, as it were, a cento of doctrines and of precepts;
   to take from Christ what pleases them, and from other stores what
   pleases them (of course the best from each, as it appears to their
   judgment, so as to exhibit the most perfect whole); taking e. g. the
   blessed hope of everlasting life from Jesus Christ, but rejecting his
   atonement; or honoring highly his example of humanity, but disrobing
   Him of his divinity; or accepting all the comfortable things of the
   dispensation of the Spirit, but refusing its strictness and
   self-denials; or forming any other combination whatsoever, to the
   exclusion of the entire Gospel: thus inviting Christian hearers, not to
   the supper of the king's son, but to a sort of miscellaneous banquet of
   their own; using their liberty,' in short, as an occasion' to that
   natural disposition, which Christ came to correct and to repair.

   "Now that by such methods, enforced by education and strengthened by
   the best of secondary motives, men may attain to an excellent
   proficiency in morals, I am neither prepared nor disposed to dispute. I
   am not desirous of disputing that they may possess therein an excellent
   religion, as opposed to Mahometanism or Paganism. But that they possess
   the true account to be given of their stewardship of that one talent,
   the Gospel itself, I do doubt in sorrow and fear. I do doubt whether
   they live the life that now is,' as St. Paul lived it, by the faith of
   the Son of God;' by true apprehension of the things that He suffered
   for us, and of the right which He has purchased to command us in all
   excellent qualities and actions; and further, of the invisible but real
   assistance which he gives us towards the performance of them." Müller,
   Bampton Lectures. p. 169 (third edition).

   "Thus in the great variety of religious situations in which men are
   placed, what constitutes, what chiefly and peculiarly constitutes, the
   probation, in all senses, of some persons, may be the difficulties in
   which the evidence of religion is involved: and their principal and
   distinguished trial may be, how they will behave under and with respect
   to these difficulties." Butler, Analogy, Part II. ch. 6.

   Note XVIII., p. 221.

   I do not mean by these remarks to deny the possibility of any progress
   whatever in Christian Theology, such for instance, as may result from
   the better interpretation of Holy Writ, or the refutation of
   unauthorized inferences therefrom. But all such developments of
   doctrine are admissible only when confined within the limits so
   carefully laid down in the sixth Article of our Church. "Holy Scripture
   containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not
   read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any
   man, that it should be believed as an Article of the Faith, or be
   thought requisite or necessary to salvation." Within these limits, the
   most judicious theologians have not hesitated to allow the possibility
   of progress, as regards at least the definite statement of Christian
   doctrine. Thus Bishop Butler remarks: "As it is owned the whole scheme
   of Scripture is not yet understood; so, if it ever comes to be
   understood, before the restitution of all things, and without
   miraculous interpositions, it must be in the same way as natural
   knowledge is come at: by the continuance and progress of learning and
   liberty; and by particular persons attending to, comparing, and
   pursuing intimations scattered up and down it, which are overlooked and
   disregarded by the generality of the world." [245] And a worthy
   successor to the name has pointed out the distinction between true and
   false developments of doctrine, in language based upon the same
   principle: "Are there admissible developments of doctrine in
   Christianity? Unquestionably there are. But let the term be understood
   in its legitimate sense or senses to warrant that answer; and let it be
   carefully observed how much, and how little, the admission really
   involves. All varieties of real development, so far as this argument is
   concerned, may probably be reduced to two general heads, intellectual
   developments, and practical developments, of Christian doctrine. By
   intellectual developments,' I understand logical inferences (and that
   whether for belief or practical discipline), from doctrines, or from
   the comparison of doctrines; which, in virtue of the great dialectical
   maxim, must be true, if legitimately deduced from what is true.
   Practical developments' are the living, actual, historical results of
   those true doctrines (original or inferential), when considered as
   influential on all the infinite varieties of human kind; the doctrines
   embodied in action; the doctrines modifying human nature in ways
   infinitely various, correspondently to the infinite variety of subjects
   on whom they operate, though ever strictly preserving, amid all their
   operations for effectually transforming and renewing mankind, their own
   unchanged identity. . . . In the former case, revealed doctrines may be
   compared with one another, or with the doctrines of natural religion;'
   or the consequences of revealed doctrines may be compared with other
   doctrines, or with their consequences, and so on in great variety: the
   combined result being what is called a System of Theology. What the
   first principles of Christian truth really are, or how obtained, is not
   now the question. But in all cases equally, no doctrine has any claim
   whatever to be received as obligatory on belief, unless it be either
   itself some duly authorized principle, or a logical deduction, through
   whatever number of stages, from some such principle of religion. Such
   only are legitimate developments of doctrine for the belief of man; and
   such alone can the Church of Christ-the Witness and Conservator of His
   Truth--justly commend to the consciences of her members. . . . But in
   truth, as our own liability to error is extreme, especially when
   immersed in the holy obscurity ("the cloud on the mercy-seat") of such
   mysteries as these, we have reason to thank God that there appear to be
   few doctrinal developments of any importance which are not from the
   first drawn out and delivered on divine authority to our acceptance."
   [246]

   It is impossible not to regret deeply the very different language, on
   this point, of a writer in many respects worthy of better things; but
   who, while retaining the essential doctrines of Christianity, has, it
   is to be feared, done much to unsettle the authority on which they
   rest. "If the destined course of the world," says Dr. Williams, "be
   really one of providential progress, if there has been such a thing as
   a childhood of humanity, and if God has been educating either a nation
   or a Church to understand their duty to Himself and to mankind; it must
   follow, that when the fulness of light is come, there will be childish
   things to put away. . . . Hence, if the religious records represent
   faithfully the inner life of each generation, whether a people or a
   priesthood, they will be, in St. Paul's phrase, divinely animated, or
   with a divine life running through them; and every writing, divinely
   animated, will be useful; yet they may, or rather, they must be cast in
   the mould of the generation in which they are written; their words, if
   they are true words, will express the customs of their country, the
   conceptions of their times, the feelings or aspirations of their
   writers; and the measure of knowledge or of faith to which every one,
   in his degree, had attained. And the limitation, thus asserted, of
   their range of knowledge, will be equally true, whether we suppose the
   shortcoming to be, on an idea of special Providence, from a particular
   dictation of sentiment in each case; or whether, on the more reasonable
   view of a general Providence, we consider such things permitted rather
   than directed; the natural result of a grand scheme, rather than a
   minute arrangement of thoughts and words for each individual man. It
   may be, that the Lord writes the Bible, on the same principle as the
   Lord builds the city; or that He teaches the Psalmist to sing, in the
   same sense as He teaches his fingers to fight; thus that the
   composition of Scripture is attributed to the Almighty, just as sowing
   and threshing are said to be taught by Him; for every part played by
   man comes from the Divine Disposer of the scene." [247]

   It is the misfortune of this sort of language, that it suggests far
   more than it directly asserts, and probably more than the author
   intends to convey. Dr. Williams probably does not mean to imply that we
   are no more bound by the authority of Scripture in matters of religion
   than by the primitive practice in sowing and threshing, or that we are
   as much at liberty to invent new theological doctrines as new
   implements of husbandry. But if he does not mean this, it is to be
   regretted that he has not clearly pointed out the respects in which his
   comparison does not hold good.

   See Archbishop King's Discourse on Predestination, edited by Archbishop
   Whately, p. 10. A different, and surely a more judicious view, is taken
   by a contemporary Prelate of the Irish Church, whose earlier exposition
   of the same theory [248] probably furnished the foundation of the
   Archbishop's discourse. "Though," says Bishop Browne, "there are
   literally speaking no such passions in God as Love or Hatred, Joy or
   Anger, or Pity; yet there may be Inconceivable Perfections in Him some
   way answerable to what those passions are in us, under a due regulation
   and subjection to reason. It is sure that in God those perfections are
   not attended with any degree of natural disturbance or moral
   irregularity, as the passions are in us. Nay, Fear and Hope, which
   imply something future for their objects, may have nothing answerable
   to them in the divine Nature to which everything is present. But since
   our reasonable affections are real dispositions of the Soul, which is
   composed of Spirit as well as Matter; we must conclude something in God
   analogous to them, as well as to our Knowledge or Power. For it cannot
   be a thought unworthy of being transferred to him, that he really loves
   a virtuous and hates a vicious agent; that he is angry at sinners;
   pities their moral infirmities; is pleased with their innocence or
   repentance, and displeased with their transgressions; though all these
   Perfections are in Him accompanied with the utmost serenity, and
   never-failing tranquillity." [249] With this may be compared the
   language of Tertullian (Adv. Marc. II. 16), "All which He suffers after
   His own manner, even as man after his."

   Note XXI., p. 223.

   Compare the remarks of Hooker, E. P. I. 3. 2. "Moses, in describing the
   work of creation, attributeth speech unto God. . . . Was this only the
   intent of Moses, to signify the infinite greatness of God's power by
   the easiness of his accomplishing such effects, without travail, pain,
   or labor? Surely it seemeth that Moses had herein besides this a
   further purpose, namely, first to teach that God did not work as a
   necessary but a voluntary agent, intending beforehand and decreeing
   with himself that which did outwardly proceed from him. Secondly, to
   shew that God did then institute a law natural to be observed by
   creatures, and therefore according to the manner of laws, the
   institution thereof is described, as being established by solemn
   injunction."

   Note XXII., p. 224.

   "But they urge, there can be no proportion or similitude between Finite
   and Infinite, and consequently there can be no analogy. That there can
   be no such proportion or similitude as there is between finite created
   beings is granted; or as there is between any material substance and
   its resemblance in the glass; and therefore wherein the real ground of
   this analogy consists, and what the degrees of it are, is as
   incomprehensible as the real Nature of God. But it is such an analogy
   as he himself hath adapted to our intellect, and made use of in his
   Revelations; and therefore we are sure it hath such a foundation in the
   nature both of God and man, as renders our moral reasonings concerning
   him and his attributes, solid, and just, and true."--Bp. Browne,
   Procedure of the Understanding, p. 31. The practical result of this
   remark is, that we must rest satisfied with a belief in the analogical
   representation itself, without seeking to rise above it by substituting
   an explanation of its ulterior significance or real ground.

   Note XXIII., p. 224.

   I am glad to take this opportunity of expressing, in the above words,
   my belief in the purpose and authority of Holy Scripture; inasmuch as
   it enables me to correct a serious misunderstanding into which a
   distinguished writer has fallen in a criticism of my supposed views--a
   criticism to which the celebrity of the author will probably give a far
   wider circulation than is ever likely to fall to the lot of the small
   pamphlet which called it forth. Mr. Maurice, in the preface to the
   second edition of his "Patriarchs and Lawgivers of the Old Testament,"
   comments upon the distinction (maintained in the present Lectures and
   in a small previous publication), between speculative and regulative
   truths, in the following terms. "The notion of a revelation that tells
   us things which are not in themselves true, but which it is right for
   us to believe and to act upon as if they were true, has, I fear,
   penetrated very deeply into the heart of our English schools, and of
   our English world. It may be traced among persons who are apparently
   most unlike each other, who live to oppose and confute each other. . .
   . But their differences are not in the least likely to be adjusted by
   the discovery of this common ground. How the atmosphere is to be
   regulated by the regulative Revelation; at what degree of heat or cold
   this constitution or that can endure it; who must fix--since the
   language of the Revelation is assumed not to be exact, not to express
   the very lesson which we are to derive from it--what it does mean; by
   what contrivances its phrases are to be adapted to various places and
   times: these are questions which must, of course, give rise to infinite
   disputations; ever new schools and sects must be called into existence
   to settle them; there is scope for permissions, prohibitions,
   compromises, persecutions, to any extent. The despair which these must
   cause will probably drive numbers to ask for an infallible human voice,
   which shall regulate for each period that which the Revelation has so
   utterly failed to regulate."

   Now I certainly believed, and believe still, that God is infinite, and
   that no human mode of thought, nor even a Revelation, if it is to be
   intelligible by the human mind, can represent the infinite, save under
   finite forms. And it is a legitimate inference from this position, that
   no human representation, whether derived from without or from within,
   from Revelation or from natural Religion, can adequately exhibit the
   absolute nature of God. But I cannot admit, as a further legitimate
   inference, that therefore "the language of the Revelation does not
   express the very lesson which we are to derive from it;" that it needs
   any regulation to adjust it to "this constitution or that;" that it
   requires "to be adapted to various places and times." For surely, if
   all men are subject to the same limitations of thought, the adaptation
   to their constitutions must be made already, before human
   interpretation can deal with the Revelation at all. It is not to the
   peculiarities which distinguish "this" constitution from "that," that
   the Revelation has to be adapted by man; but, as it is given by God, it
   is adapted already to the general conditions which are common to all
   human constitutions alike, which are equally binding in all places and
   at all times. I have said nothing of a revelation adapted to one man
   more than to another; nothing of limitations which any amount of
   intellect or learning can enable a man to overcome. I have not said
   that the Bible is the teacher of the peasant rather than of the
   philosopher; of the Asiatic rather than of the European; of the first
   century rather than of the nineteenth. I have said only that it is the
   teacher of man as man; and that this is compatible with the possible
   existence of a more absolute truth in relation to beings of a higher
   intelligence. We must at any rate admit that man does not know God as
   God knows Himself; and hence that he does not know Him in the fulness
   of His Absolute Nature. But surely this admission is so far from
   implying that Revelation does not teach the very lesson which we are to
   derive from it, that it makes that lesson the more universal and the
   more authoritative. For Revelation is subject to no other limitations
   than those which encompass all human thought. Man gains nothing by
   rejecting or perverting its testimony; for the mystery of Revelation is
   the mystery of Reason also.

   I do not wish to extend this controversy further; for I am willing to
   believe that, on this question at least, my own opinion is
   substantially one with that of my antagonist. At any rate, I approve as
   little as he does of allegorical, or metaphysical, or mythical
   interpretations of Scripture: I believe that he is generally right in
   maintaining that "the most literal meaning of Scripture is the most
   spiritual meaning." And if there are points in the details of his
   teaching with which I am unable to agree, I believe that they are not
   such as legitimately arise from the consistent application of this
   canon.

   "There seems no possible reason to be given, why we may not be in a
   state of moral probation, with regard to the exercise of our
   understanding upon the subject of religion, as we are with regard to
   our behaviour in common affairs. . . . Thus, that religion is not
   intuitively true, but a matter of deduction and inference; that a
   conviction of its truth is not forced upon every one, but left to be,
   by some, collected with heedful attention to premises; this as much
   constitutes religious probation, as much affords sphere, scope,
   opportunity, for right and wrong behaviour, as anything whatever
   does."--Butler, Analogy, Part II. ch. 6.

   unobserved, in any meanness; for petty littleness is every way most
   contrary to a soul that is ever stretching forward in desire to the
   whole and the all, "to divine and to human."--Cicero, De Off. I. 2:
   "Nor is philosophy anything else, if you will define it, than the study
   of wisdom. But wisdom (as defined by ancient philosophers) is the
   knowledge of things human and divine, and of the causes in which these
   are contained."

   Vorbericht, p. xlii.: "Know thyself is, according to the Delphian god
   and Socrates, the highest command, and, so soon as it becomes
   practical, man is made aware of this truth: without the Divine Thou,
   there is no human I, and without the human I, there is no Divine Thou."

   "It is plain that there is a capacity in the nature of man, which
   neither riches, nor honors, nor sensual gratifications, nor anything in
   this world, can perfectly fill up or satisfy: there is a deeper and
   more essential want, than any of these things can be the supply of. Yet
   surely there is a possibility of somewhat, which may fill up all our
   capacities of happiness; somewhat, in which our souls may find rest;
   somewhat, which may be to us that satisfactory good we are inquiring
   after. But it cannot be anything which is valuable only as it tends to
   some further end. . . . As our understanding can contemplate itself,
   and our affections be exercised upon themselves by reflection, so may
   each be employed in the same manner upon any other mind. And since the
   Supreme Mind, the Author and Cause of all things, is the highest
   possible object to himself, he may be an adequate supply to all the
   faculties of our souls; a subject to our understanding, and an object
   to our affections."--Butler, Sermon XIV.

   Note XXIX., p. 227.

   "Christianity is not a religion for the religious, but a religion for
   man. I do not accept it because my temperament so disposes me, and
   because it meets my individual mood of mind, or my tastes. I accept it
   as it is suited to that moral condition in respect of which there is no
   difference of importance between me and the man I may next encounter on
   my path." The Restoration of Belief, p. 325.

   Note XXX., p. 227.

   "The Scripture-arguments are arguments of inducement, addressed to the
   whole nature of man--not merely to intellectual man, but to thinking
   and feeling man, living among his fellow men;--and to be apprehended
   therefore in their effect on our whole nature."-- Hampden, Bampton
   Lectures, p. 92.--"There are persons who complain of the Word, because
   it is not addressed to some one department of the human soul, on which
   they set a high value. The systematic divine wonders that it is not a
   mere scheme of dogmatic theology, forgetting that in such a case it
   would address itself exclusively to the understanding. The German
   speculatists, on the other hand, complain that it is not a mere
   exhibition of the true and the good, forgetting that in such a case it
   would have little or no influence on the more practical faculties.
   Others seem to regret that it is not a mere code of morality, while a
   fourth class would wish it to be altogether an appeal to the feelings.
   But the Word is inspired by the same God who formed man at first, and
   who knows what is in man; and he would rectify not merely the
   understanding or intuitions, not merely the conscience or affections,
   but the whole man after the image of God." McCosh, Method of the Divine
   Government, p. 509.

   of the evidence in behalf of the particular miracle on the occasion of
   which these remarks were written, the article itself is worthy of the

   miracles, supposing their actual occurrence to be proved by sufficient

   [227] The able and impressive argument of this little work is well
   worthy of the perusal of those who would see what is the real force of
   the Christian evidences, even upon the lowest ground to which
   skepticism can attempt to reduce them. Though far from representing the
   whole strength of the case, it is most valuable as showing what may be
   effected in behalf of Christianity, on the principles of its opponents.

   [230] P. 363. That is to say, it is boldly maintained that our Lord, in
   order to humor the prejudices of the Jews of that day, consented to
   lend his authority to the dissemination of a religious falsehood for
   the deception of posterity. This monstrous assertion is stated more
   plainly by Spinoza, Tractatus Theologico-Polit. c 2. "Indeed He
   accommodated His forms of thought to every one's principles and
   opinions. For instance, when He said to the Pharisees, And if Satan
   cast out Satan, he is divided against himself, how then can his kingdom
   stand? he meant only to convict the Pharisees on their own principles,
   not to teach the doctrine of demons." In like manner, Schleiermacher
   (Christliche Glaube, § 42) asserts that Christ and his Apostles
   possibly adopted the popular representations, as we speak of fairies
   and ghosts. On the other side, it is justly urged by Storr (Doctrina
   Ciristiana, § 52), that our Lord employed the same language privately
   with his disciples. as well as publicly with the people; e. g. Matt.
   xiii. 39, xxv. 41; Mark iv. 15; Luke xxii. 31. See also Mosheim's note,

   The superiority of the Greek religion appears to consist in its greater
   acknowledgment of human freedom, and perhaps in being a step in the
   direction of Pantheism. See Werke, XlI 92, 125. Of the Roman religion,
   he says that it contained in itself all the elements of Christianity,
   and was a necessary step to the latter. Its evils sprang from the depth
   of its spirit (XII pp. 181, 184). The best commentary on this assertion
   may be found in Augustine, De Civ. Dei, Lib. VI.

   [236] Among the imperfections of Judaism, Hegel includes the fact that
   "it did not make men conscious of the identity of the human soul with
   the Absolute and its absorption therein (die Anschauung und das
   Bewusstseyn von der Einlheit der Seele mit dem Absoluten, oder von der
   Aufnahme der Seele in den Schooss des Absoluten ist noch nicht erwacht,
   Werke, Xl. p. 86). In another place (p. 161) he speaks of it as the
   religion of obstinate, dead understanding. Vatke (Biblische Theologie,
   p. 115) carries the absurdity of theory to its climax, by boldly
   maintaining that the later Judaism had been elevated by its conflict
   with the religions of Greece and Rome, and thus prepared to become the
   precursor of Christianity. The Hegelian theory is also adopted by Baur,
   as representing the law of development of Christian doctrines. The
   historical aspects of the doctrine are to be regarded as phases of a
   process, in which the several forms are determined one by another, and
   all are united together in the totality of the idea. See especially his
