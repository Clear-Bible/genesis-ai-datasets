  NOTE

   IN this new edition the wording has been revised and condensed, chiefly
   with a view to rendering the translation more pregnant. Only one
   passage (VI. Mansion, ch. v. r 3) has been substantially changed, in
   conformity with an explanation received from a high authority. It is
   admittedly a very difficult passage which appears to have been
   misunderstood by nearly all translators; but it is gratifying to notice
   that the new French translation by the Carmelite nuns of Anderlecht
   agrees with our interpretation. The editor is under an obligation to
   that translation for several interesting facts embodied in the
   Introduction and in the notes to the text.

        THE

                                INTERIOR CASTLE

        OR

THE MANSIONS


   The Benedictines of Stanbrook desire to express their gratitude to the
   very Rev. Benedict Zimmerman for having kindly revised the translation
   of the Interior Castle' and also for the Introduction, Notes, and Index
   which he has added to the book.

                                  INTRODUCTION

   SAINT TERESA began to write the Interior Castle on June 2, 1577,
   Trinity Sunday, and completed it on the eve of St. Andrew, November 29,
   of the same year. But there was a long interruption of five months, [1]
     so that the actual time spent in the composition of this work was
   reduced to about four weeks--a fortnight for the first, and another
   fortnight for the second half of the book. The rapidity with which it
   was written is easily explained by the fact that the Saint had
   conceived its plan some time previously. On January 17, 1577, she had
   written to her brother, Don Lorenzo de Cepeda, at Avila: I have asked
   the bishop--Don Alvaro Mendoza--for my book (the Life) because I shall
   perhaps complete it by adding those new favours our Lord has lately
   granted me. With these one may even compose a new work of considerable
   size, provided God grants me the grace of explaining myself; otherwise
   the loss will be of small account.' [2]   She never asked for
   permission to write anything, but waited until she received a command
   from her superiors, which, in this case, came from Father Jerome
   Gracian, superior of the Discalced J. Carmelites of the Provinces of
   Andalusia and Castille, and from Don Alonso Velasquez, canon of Toledo,
   afterwards bishop of Osma. [3]   The Saint was not in good health at
   the time; she repeatedly complains of noises in the head and other
   infirmities, but, worst of all, she was weighed down by troubles and
   anxieties resulting from the action of the superiors of the Order and
   of the Papal Nuncio against the nuns and friars of the Reform. Matters
   became even more serious when, in October, the nuns of the Incarnation
   of Avila proceeded to the election of a new prioress. Notwithstanding
   the prohibition of the provincial, fifty-five electors recorded their
   votes in favour of the Saint and were immediately declared
   excommunicated. The whole work of the Reform seemed on the brink of
   ruin, the Saint, as well as all her friends, was in disgrace, subject
   to obloquy and ill-treatment.

   No trace of these trials is to be found in the Interior Castle. Saint
   Teresa possessed the power of concentration of thought in a marvellous
   degree. The early mornings and late evenings were devoted to the
   composition of the book, while the rest of the day was taken up by the
   affairs of the Order. Mother Mary of the Nativity, a member of the
   community of Toledo, where the book was begun, declared afterwards, [4]
     that she often saw her writing, generally after Holy Communion, her
   face resplendent, with such rapidity and so absorbed in her occupation
   that she seemed undisturbed by, and in fact quite unconscious of, any
   noise that was made. Mother Mariana of the Angels [5]   reports having
   heard from the same witness, that entering her cell one day to deliver
   a message, the holy Mother was just beginning a new sheet of her book.
   While taking off her spectacles to listen to the message she was seized
   by a trance in which she remained for several hours. The nun, terrified
   at this, did not stir, but kept her eyes steadily on the Saint. When
   she came to, it was seen that the paper, previously blank, was covered
   with writing. Noticing that her visitor had discovered it, Saint Teresa
   put the paper quietly in the box. Another nun, Mary of St. Francis,
   left the following declaration: I know that our holy Mother wrote four
   books, the Life, the Way of Perfection, the Foundations, and the
   Mansions, which I have seen her writing. Once, while she was composing
   the last-named work, I entered to deliver a message, and found her so
   absorbed that she did not notice me; her face seemed quite illuminated
   and most beautiful. After having listened to me she said: "Sit down, my
   child, and let me write what our Lord has told me ere I forget it," and
   she went on writing with great rapidity and without stopping.' [6]

   Mary of St. Joseph says she heard from Mary of the Nativity that Father
   Jerome Gracian commanded the Saint to write the Mansions; she, however,
   begged to be excused, because so many books having been written by holy
   and learned men, there remained nothing for a woman to write. At length
   she yielded under obedience. This nun (Mary of the Nativity) was
   frequently in the Saint's cell while she was writing and she noticed
   her resplendent face and the almost preternatural velocity with which
   her hand travelled over the paper. [7]

   Writing to Mother Mary of St. Joseph, Prioress of Seville, November 8,
   1581, St. Teresa gives her a message for Father Rodrigo Alvarez, S. J.:
   Our Father (Jerome Gracian, then provincial) tells me that he has
   handed you a book written by me, which perhaps you do not feel inclined
   to read yourself. Kindly read to Father Rodrigo Alvarez, at his next
   visit, the last Mansion, but under the seal of confession, as he asks
   this in his superior wisdom. This is only for you two. Tell him that
   the person he knows has arrived at this Mansion and enjoys the peace
   there described; that she is entirely at rest, and that some grave
   theologians have assured her that she is on a safe road. In case you
   could not read these pages to him do not send him the book, for it
   might lead to unpleasantness. Until I have his answer on this matter I
   will not write to him. Give him my compliments.'

   At the end of the original manuscript, before the epilogue (marked with
   Ihs.) there is a notice in Father Alvarez' hand-writing to this effect:
   The Mother Prioress of the convent of Seville has read to me this
   seventh Mansion, whither a soul may arrive in the present life. Let all
   the saints praise the infinite goodness of God, Who communicates
   Himself to His creatures so that they truly seek His glory and the
   salvation of their neighbour. What I feel and judge of this matter is,
   that everything that has been read to me is conformable to Catholic
   truth and in accordance with Holy Scripture and the teaching of the
   Saints. Whosoever has read the doctrine of the Saints, such as the
   books of St. Gertrude, St. Catharine of Siena, or St. Bridget of
   Sweden, and other saints and spiritual writers, will clearly understand
   that the spirit of Mother Tireza (sic) of Jesus is true, since it leads
   to the same effects as are to be found in the saints; and because this
   is in truth my judgment and opinion, I have hereunto set my name, this,
   the 22nd day of February, 1582. P. Rodrigo Alvarez.' [8]

   The work was copied, probably under the supervision of the Saint, who
   introduced many changes; when completed the original was handed to
   Father Jerome Gracian and to the Dominican, Fray Diego de Yanguas, for
   approval. Both, particularly the former, made numerous corrections,
   which Fuente, not without reason, calls impertinent, scratching out
   whole sentences and adding others. The book thus revised must have
   enjoyed a certain celebrity, though not to the same extent as the Life,
   to which St. Teresa herself preferred it. Scarcely a week after its
   completion she wrote to Father Salazar, S.J.: If Señor Carillo [Salazar
   himself] came, the person in question [the Saint] thinks he would find
   another jewel which in her opinion is superior to the former [the
   Life]. This one reflects nothing foreign to itself, but is resplendent
   in its own beauty. It is enriched with more delicate enamels than the
   former, the workmanship, too, is more perfect. For, as the person in
   question says, the jeweller was less experienced when he fashioned the
   previous one. Moreover, the gold of the new one is of better quality
   than that of the former, though the precious stones are not so well
   set. It has been done, as might be expected, according to the designs
   of the Jeweller Himself.' [9]   Later on she wrote to Father Jerome
   Gracian: The book I have written since seems to me superior [to the
   Life]; at least I had more experience when I wrote it.' [10]

   One day, speaking with Mother Mary of Jesus on spiritual matters, she
   said that our Lord had communicated so much to her since she had
   reached what she described in the seventh Mansion,--the spiritual
   Marriage,--that she did not consider it possible to advance further in
   this life, in the way of prayer, nor even to wish to do so. [11]

   The book was eagerly read by those who were able to obtain copies. At
   the archiepiscopal Seminary at Salamanca it was read publicly after
   dinner; the students, contrary to custom, sacrificing the recreation
   rather than miss so edifying an instruction. The result was that
   several entered the religious life, one becoming a Franciscan, two
   others, who had already taken their degrees, joining the Discalced
   Carmelites. [12]   We also know of a lady who became a Poor Clare
   through reading the Interior Castle. [13]   The process of
   Beatification contains the following evidence of Don Francisco de Mora,
   architect to Philip III: The same prioress (of aconvent of Dominican
   nuns) being concerned about my salvation gave me a book in manuscript,
   called The Mansions, by Mother Teresa, hoping I should derive some
   benefit from it. I fear this was not the case, but it made me
   acquainted with Teresa of Jesus, the foundress of the Discalced
   Carmelite nuns, of whom I had not yet heard, but for whom I now felt
   devotion.' [14]

   In August 1586 it was decided to print Saint Teresa's works, the
   Augustinian Fray Luis de Leon being selected as editor, as he was
   unconcerned in the quarrels raging round the Reform. Accordingly, the
   manuscript of the Interior Castle was handed to him. On the first leaf
   he wrote the following note:

   'Many passages of this book written by the holy Mother have been scored
   through, other words being substituted or notes being added in the
   margin. Most of these corrections are badly done, the original text
   being much better. It will be noticed that the holy Mother's sentences
   are superior and agree with the context, which is not the case with the
   corrections. These improvements and glosses may therefore be dispensed
   with. Having myself read and considered everything with great care, it
   appears to me that the reader, too, should have before him the words of
   the author who knew best what to say; for this reason I have left out
   the additions, and have restored what has been changed, excepting only
   a few corrections made by the writer herself. I beg of the reader that
   he would in charity reverence the words and even the letters traced by
   so holy a hand, and strive to understand what has been written. He will
   then see that there was no need for corrections; should he fail to
   understand her, let him believe that the writer knew what she said, and
   that her words cannot be tampered with if they are not to lose their
   meaning; otherwise what was to the point will seem out of place. This
   is how books become corrupted, useless, and are finally lost.' [15]

   When Luis de Leon undertook the editing of St. Teresa's writings he
   received a long letter from Don Diego de Yepes, afterwards Bishop of
   Tarazona, a former friend and confessor of the Saint, in which he
   records his personal recollections. I shall only insert here what he
   says about the Interior Castle:

   'This holy Mother desired to see the beauty of a soul in the state of
   grace, a thing greatly to be coveted both for the sake of seeing and of
   possessing it. While this desire lasted, she was commanded to write a
   treatise on prayer, of which she had much personal experience. On the
   eve of the Blessed Trinity, while considering what subject to choose
   for this treatise, God, Who disposes everything in due season,
   fulfilled her wish and furnished a suitable subject. He showed her a
   most beautiful globe of crystal, in the shape of a castle, with seven
   rooms, the seventh, situated in the centre, being occupied by the King
   of glory, resplendent with the most exquisite brilliancy, which shone
   through and adorned the remaining rooms. The nearer these lay to the
   centre, the more did they partake of that wondrous light. It did not,
   however, penetrate beyond the crystal, for everything round about was a
   mass of darkness and impurity, full of toads and vipers and other
   venomous animals.

   She was still admiring this beauty which, by the grace of God dwells in
   the soul, when, to! the light suddenly disappeared, and the crystal,
   wherein the King of glory was still residing, became opaque and as dark
   as coal, emitting an intolerable odour; the venomous animals, formerly
   held in check outside, obtained admittance into the castle. The holy
   Mother wished that every one should behold this vision, for she thought
   that no one having seen the beauty and splendour of grace, which is
   forfeited by sin and replaced by such repulsive misery, would ever dare
   to offend God.

   'She told me this vision on the same day, for in this as well as in
   other things she was so communicative that on the following morning she
   said to me: "How I forgot myself yesterday! I cannot think how it could
   have happened. Those high aspirations of mine, and the affection I have
   for you must have caused me to go beyond all reasonable limits. God
   grant I may have derived some profit therefrom." I promised her to say
   nothing about it during her lifetime, but since her death I should like
   to make it known to all men. From this vision she learnt four important
   matters.

   'First, she came to understand this axiom, which in this form she had
   never heard of in her life, [16]   that God is present in all things by
   His essence, presence, and power. As she was deeply humble and
   submissive and obedient to the doctrine of the Church and the teaching
   of the learned ministers of God, she never rested until her revelations
   had been approved of by her superiors and by theologians, and were
   shown to be conformable to Holy Scripture. She went so far as to say
   that if all the angels of heaven said one thing, and her superiors
   another, though she could not doubt that the former were true angels,
   yet she would hold what was told her by her superiors, because faith
   comes through these and there remains no room for deceit, whereas
   revelations coming from angels might be illusionary.

   'With such regard for obedience, she asked me one day at
   Toledo--probably at the time when she saw the vision of the
   Castle--whether it was true that God was in all things by His power,
   presence, and essence, to which I replied in the affirmative,
   explaining it as best I could on the authority of St. Paul,
   particularly where he says "the sufferings of this time are not worthy
   to be compared with the glory to come that shall be revealed in us,"
   [17]   Laying stress on these words, "shall be revealed in us," she was
   so overjoyed that I was quite astonished. Though in a way it seemed to
   me a kind of curiosity, I could not help thinking there was some
   mystery about it, for she said: "This is the very thing."

   'Secondly, she was greatly surprised at the malice of sin, since,
   notwithstanding the presence of God in these various ways, it prevents
   the soul from partaking of that powerful light.

   'Thirdly, she derived such humility and self-knowledge from this
   vision, that from that moment she never thought of herself in all the
   good she was doing; for she learnt that all the beauty of the soul
   emanates from that resplendent light, and that the powers of the soul
   and of the body are enlivened and strengthened by the Power established
   in the centre, whence comes all our good, so that we have but a small
   share in our good works. All the good she did, she from this moment
   referred to God as its principal author.

   'Fourthly, she derived from it the subject of the book she was ordered
   to write on prayer, comparing the seven rooms of the Castle with as
   many degrees of prayer, whereby we enter within ourselves and draw
   nearer to God. So that, penetrating to the depths of our soul and
   gaining perfect self-knowledge, we reach the seventh room where God
   Himself dwells, with Whom we become united by as perfect a union as is
   possible in the present life, being made partakers of His light and
   love.

   'I will say no more of this vision and the Mansions, because your
   Reverence must by now have seen this admirable book, and must know with
   what accuracy, with what majestic doctrine, with what lucid examples
   she describes the progress of the soul from the gate to the very
   centre. It is clearly seen in this treatise how she communicated with
   our Lord, and how His Majesty vouchsafed to place her in the centre and
   to unite her with Himself, as she puts it, by the bonds of marriage and
   an inseparable union.' [18]

   After the publication of the Interior Castle, in 1588 at Salamanca, it
   became not only more widely known, but also more and more appreciated.
   Francis Suarez, the great theologian of the Society of Jesus, says in
   his deposition in the process of Beatification that he had read some of
   St. Teresa's works, particularly the Mansions, which contain an
   absolutely safe doctrine and give proof of a wonderful spirit of prayer
   and contemplation. [19]

   Thomas Hurtado, professor of theology at Seville, speaks as follows:

     As often as I read the books of the holy Mother, I admire the
     wonderful manner in which God instructed her in mystical theology
     for the sake of souls giving themselves truly to familiar
     intercourse with His divine Majesty. But where I most regret my
     inability of expressing in fitting terms my sentiments towards this
     excellent teacher is when I look at, and refresh myself in that
     Castle with its seven rooms; for there is seen the effect of infused
     knowledge such as St. Denis received from St. Hierotheus [20]   and
     both from St. Paul, and which has been committed to writing in the
     famous book of Mystical Theology. Hence comes, as from a
     fountain-head, notwithstanding the obscurity (to our manner of
     thinking) of its language, the doctrine of the great masters of the
     spiritual life such as Hugh of St. Victor, St. Bernard, Ruysbroek,
     Tauler, Gerson, and many others whom I pass by.

     'Nevertheless, I will boldly say that no one has given us water more
     limpid from that Apostolical and Areopagitical well than the holy
     Mother Teresa, who, in her books, but chiefly in the Mansions, has
     cleared up in simple language the most difficult questions of this
     divine theology, and has brought forth light from darkness, as it is
     written: (He) commanded light to shine out of darkness.' [21]   Who
     has ever been able to show as clearly as our Saint how God takes
     possession of the soul, how He unites Himself with its substance,
     whence comes to the intellect the light of faith, to the will the
     ardour of love, and to the senses the jubilation over His works? No
     one has ever turned theory into practice in a more convincing or
     more catholic manner. The most profound secrets of this supernatural
     wisdom are here treated with such ease, so amiably, so delightfully,
     they are illustrated by such nice and homely examples, that instead
     of awe-inspiring obscurity, we find lovely flowers and the sweetness
     of love, through which, as through an avenue, the soul passes
     onwards. When God made known His exalted doctrine to St. Dionysius
     and other mystical writers, He made use of their own language and
     pen. But St. Teresa in the Mansions is like the light of dawn whose
     rays are not intercepted by the clouds of this world; like a soft
     rain from above, whereby the soul grows and profits by its
     communications with God. Until the teaching of this great door
     became known it seemed as though God were inaccessible, being
     surrounded by darkness, through which Moses and some other persons
     had to pass when approaching Him; [22]   but they neither explained
     the manner nor showed the way whereby they came to the enjoyment of
     the sweetness of the Spouse. Now, however, this way is clear and
     patent to all, having been pointed out in the Mansions, in language
     so straight and so methodical, and no longer such as could not be
     understood, or required further explanation. In my opinion this holy
     writer derived not only the substance of her teaching from infused
     knowledge, but even the words with which she explains it.' [23]

   Likewise Don Alvaro de Villegas, canon of Toledo, expressed his opinion
   that the Way of Perfection and the Interior Castle contain heavenly
   doctrine.' The weight of the subject-matter, the propriety of the
   comparisons, the force of the expressions, the consistency of the
   teaching, the sweetness of her well-chosen, vivid words, the clearness
   of the arguments, all this proves that she was guided by her heavenly
   Spouse, in Whom are hidden the treasures of the wisdom of God; and that
   the Holy Ghost, Who more than once was seen resting on her head like a
   dove, was dilating these works. Villegas does not believe that any one
   could read them, as such books ought to be read, without becoming
   himself a master of the spiritual life. For they are like heavenly dew,
   rendering the soul fruitful in the matter of prayer. [24]

   It would be a mistake to consider the Interior Castle a complete
   treatise of mystical theology. Like St. Teresa's other works, it is
   intensely personal: she describes the road by which she has been led,
   being well aware that others may be led in a different way. In the
   heavenly Father's house there are many mansions, not only seven, and
   many paths lead to them. What gives the work such high value is, that
   it is the result of a most searching inquiry into the various phases
   whereby a soul is gradually transformed into the likeness of God
   Himself. Here St. Teresa is always at her best. She takes nothing for
   granted, even her own personal experiences are admitted only after
   having been fully investigated and found to be consistent one with the
   other, and conformable to the teaching of the Church and the words of
   Holy Scripture.

   Mystical theology is generally divided into three parts, respectively
   called the purgative, the illuminative, and the unitive life. In the
   first, man is cleansed from sin and habitual imperfection by the use of
   the sacraments and by voluntary mortification of the passions. The mind
   is purified by sedulous meditation on the last end and on the Life and
   Passion of Christ, which must ever be the great model of the Christian.
   This first portion of the way to heaven can be covered by the help of
   the ordinary means of grace, without any direct and extraordinary
   intervention of divine power. The second part differs in many ways from
   the first. It comprises the passive purification of the soul and the
   passive enlightenment of the mind. By sending it keen interior and
   exterior trials and sufferings, God completes the cleansing of the soul
   in a manner far surpassing any voluntary effort of man. By raising it
   to the stage of contemplation He gives it fresh light on the mysteries
   of our Redemption. The mind is then no longer compelled to strain the
   memory, the reason, and the will, in order to dwell upon the great
   truths of religion and to derive some personal benefit therefrom, for
   these truths are now more or less permanently before it and fill it
   with holy thoughts, sometimes giving it consolation in trouble, at
   other times striking a warning note against imperfection. Again, the
   subtraction of sensible consolation, and the interior aridity arising
   therefrom, leave a terrible blank in the soul, showing it that, without
   God's help, it is mere nothingness. This apparent estrangement from God
   is the keenest trial that can befall a soul, but also the most powerful
   means of cleansing it from the least, the most subtle imperfections.

   Emerging from this state of probation, the soul enters upon the third
   stage, in which, though perhaps in the midst of severe suffering and
   sharp persecution, it knows itself to be a chosen child of God, to Whom
   it is united by perfect conformity of the will. Such phenomena as
   revelations, visions, locutions, and even more wonderful
   manifestations, like the wound of love, spiritual betrothal and
   nuptials, are incidental rather than essential to the second and third
   stages. Some great contemplatives have never experienced anything of
   the kind, while, on the other hand, some of these occurrences may
   sometimes have been merely the work of an exuberant imagination, or
   even the result of diabolical illusion. They should therefore never be
   wished for, or cherished, but rather shunned and ignored, in as far as
   that is possible. If they are real and come from God, they will do
   their work without the co-operation of the soul. The danger of
   self-deception is so great that a person labouring under such phenomena
   should offer every resistance, and the spiritual director should
   exercise the utmost vigilance. St. Teresa is very eloquent on this
   point, and undeceived many would-be contemplatives, while her disciple,
   St. John of the Cross, is even more thorough-going in the deprecation
   of spiritual favours. Among the numerous marks whereby the trained
   theologian may discriminate between real and imaginary phenomena, there
   is one about which Saint Teresa speaks with wonderful clearness. If
   they proceed from hysteria the imagination alone is active and the
   higher powers of the soul are torpid; if, however, they come from God,
   the intellect and the will are so intensely active, that the lower
   powers and even the body lose all strength for the time being.

   It will be noticed that the first two Mansions belong to the purgative
   life, the third and fourth to the illuminative, and the remaining three
   to the unitive life. Compared with similar works, the treatment of the
   first stage must be called meagre. True, in her Life and in the Way of
   Perfection St. Teresa has dealt with this subject somewhat more fully.
   Indeed, the last-named work was designed as a treatise on Christian
   Ascetics, dealing with the purgation of the soul by mortification and
   the enlightenment of the mind by meditation. There, too, appears the
   first idea of the Mansions, [25]   and Fuente remarks that the passage
   in question may be taken for the parting of the ways between the two
   works. However, this is not the only, nor, indeed, the chief reason why
   St. Teresa is so reticent about the preliminary stage of the
   contemplative life. The fact is that she herself did not pass through
   these experiences. By God's grace she was preserved from childhood from
   grievous sin and gross imperfection. Though she never grows tired of
   bewailing her faults and unfaithfulness, these avowals must be taken
   cum grano salis. While yet a child, she sometimes gave way to vanity in
   dress and wasted her time in reading romances. As a young religious,
   she was sought after by friends and relatives who took pleasure in her
   attractive conversation. This proved further loss of time and caused
   distractions. Owing to acute suffering, she for some years left off the
   practice of mental prayer, though she faithfully performed all her
   religious obligations, as far as her weak state of health allowed. This
   is all. The war of the flesh against the spirit, the insubordination of
   the lower parts of nature, the fickleness of the will, which so often
   thwart the most noble aspirations of a soul, were unknown to her. Under
   these circumstances, we cannot be surprised to find her entering upon
   the journey towards God at a point which in many cases marks but the
   closing stage.

   As to the remaining parts of this book, it will be seen from the
   parallel passages that they cover much the same ground as her Life and
   the Relations. With her singular gift of introspection and analysis,
   the Saint studied her own case from every point of view, so as to make
   sure that her extraordinary experiences were due to no illusion, and
   offered no obstacle to the safety of her soul. Although the Interior
   Castle contains little that we do not already know from her other
   works, it is superior to them by reason of its logical order and the
   masterly treatment of the most recondite matters of mystical theology.
   While ostensibly dealing with general facts, St. Teresa in reality
   records her personal experiences. How definite these were, how little
   room there remained for the freaks of the imagination, will appear from
   the fact that she nearly always repeats the very words she had used in
   her Life and in the other reports of her interior progress, although
   she did not have these writings before her eyes, nor had she ever seen
   them since they first left her hands. Every one of her experiences must
   have produced a profound impression to be remembered so minutely after
   an interval of years.

   There is that in the Interior Castle which reminds one of Dante's
   Paradiso. In the one and the other, the soul, purified from earthly
   dross, is gradually being invested with new and glorious qualities, and
   is being led through regions unknown until it arrives at the very
   threshold of the throne of God. Not even the boldest imagination could
   have designed so wonderful a picture of a soul adorned with graces at
   once so varied and so true. In one case we know, the poet has drawn
   abundantly from the treasury of the Angelical Doctor, putting in verse
   the conclusions of the scholastic theologian. In the other case we can
   follow, chapter by chapter, the influence of the teaching of St. Thomas
   Aquinas. St. Teresa had never studied it herself, but her directors and
   confessors were deeply versed in it and solved her doubts and
   perplexities on the lines of the greatest of the school men. The
   Interior Castle might almost be considered a practical illustration of
   certain parts of the Summa theologica, [26] as it describes the
   progress of the soul through every stage of perfection. When we have
   reached the second chapter of the seventh Mansion, there remains but
   one thing: the Beatific Vision, and this is reserved for the next life.

   After the publication of the Interior Castle by Luis de Leon, the
   manuscript came into the possession of Father Jerome Gracian, who,
   after having made a copy of it which is still extant, presented the
   original, on the occasion of a visit to the convent of Seville, to Don
   Pedro Cereso Pardo, a great friend of the Saint, and a benefactor to
   the convent. When his only daughter took the habit there, the precious
   manuscript was part of her dowry. Doña Juana de Mendoza, Duchess of
   Beguiar, a novice in the same convent, had it bound in silver and
   precious stones. It is still there, [27]   and the present writer had
   the privilege of seeing it. It comprises a hundred and thirteen leaves
   in folio, but originally there must have been some more leaves which at
   a later period were torn out. These, it is presumed, contained the
   headings of the chapters. Unlike the Life and the Foundations, the text
   of the Castle is divided only by figures, without indication of the
   contents of each chapter, but the arguments which have come down to us
   are so entirely similar to those of the two works named, that it is
   impossible to consider them otherwise than the genuine work of the
   author. In the present translation they have been inserted in their
   proper places.

   On the occasion of the ter-centenary of Saint Teresa's death, a
   photo-lithographic edition of the original was published under the
   direction of Cardinal Lluch, Carmelite of the old observance,
   Archbishop of Seville:


   El Castillo Ynterior ó Tratado de las Moradas,

   escrito por Sta. Teresa de Jesús.

   Litografia de Juan Moyano (Seville) 1882.

   The present translation, the third in English, [28]   has been made
   directly from this autograph edition. It has been thought advisable
   that, as far as the genius of the language allows it, the wording of
   the author should be strictly adhered to, and that not even a shade of
   her expression should be sacrificed. For Teresa is not only a saint
   whose every word is telling, but she is a classic in her own language
   who knows how to give expression to her deepest thoughts. Having
   compared word for word the translation with the original, I am in a
   position to affirm that this programme has been faithfully carried out.
   For the foot-notes--with few exceptions--as well as for the Index, I am
   responsible. It seemed to me important to point out all the parallel
   passages from the various works of the Saint. Only by this means can it
   be seen how consistent Saint Teresa is in all her writings. [29]   It
   would have been easy to multiply quotations from the works of other
   writers on mystical theology. Thus, the influence of the Imitation of
   Christ and of the Life of our Lord by Ludolphus the Carthusian can be
   distinctly traced in the Interior Castle. Both these works, as well as
   some Spanish books, were held in such esteem by St. Teresa, that she
   ordered the prioress of each convent to keep them at the disposal of
   the nuns. As there is a limit to footnotes, I have contented myself
   with such references as seemed to me conducive to the elucidation of
   the doctrine laid down in this treatise.

   In conclusion I venture to express the hope that this new translation
   will be found helpful by those who feel called to a higher life.

   earlier period, but there is no evidence that St. Teresa visited this
   place in the course of the six months during which she composed this

   Toledo, continued at Segovia and completed at Avila (n. 1541), but
   their sole authority for including Segovia is the passage in question,
   which, however, must refer to some other work of the Saint. The sister,
   passing St. Teresa's door, saw her writing, her face being lit up as by
   a bright light. She wrote very fast without making any corrections.
   After an hour, it being about midnight, she ceased and the light
   disappeared. The Saint then knelt down and remained in prayer for three
   hours, after which she went to sleep.

THE INTERIOR CASTLE

OR THE MANSIONS

BY ST. TERESA

IHS

   THIS TREATISE, STYLED THE INTERIOR CASTLE, WAS WRITTEN BY TERESA OF
   JESUS, NUN OF OUR LADY OF CARMEL, FOR HER SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS, THE
   DISCALCED CARMELITE NUNS.

   RARELY has obedience laid upon me so difficult a task as this of
   writing about prayer; for one reason, because I do not feel that God
   has given me either the power or the desire for it, besides which,
   during the last three months I have suffered from noises and a great
   weakness in my head that have made it painful for me to write even on
   necessary business. [30]

   However, as I know the power obedience has of making things easy which
   seem impossible, my will submits with a good grace, although nature
   seems greatly distressed, for God has not given me such strength as to
   bear, without repugnance, the constant struggle against illness while
   performing many different duties. May He, Who has helped me in other
   more difficult matters, aid me with His grace in this, for I trust in
   His mercy. I think I have but little to say that has not already been
   put forth in my other works written under obedience; in fact, I fear
   this will be but repetition of them. I am like a parrot which has
   learnt to talk; only knowing what it has been taught or has heard, it
   repeats the same thing over and over again. If God wishes me to write
   anything new, He will teach it me, or bring back to my memory what I
   have said elsewhere. I should be content even with this, for as I am
   very forgetful, I should be glad to be able to recall some of the
   matters about which people say I have spoken well, lest they should be
   altogether lost. If our Lord will not even grant me this, still, if I
   weary my brains and increase my headache by striving to obey, I shall
   gain in merit, though my words should be useless to any one. So I begin
   this work on the Feast of the Blessed Trinity in the year 1577, in the
   Convent of St. Joseph of Carmel at Toledo, where I am living, and I
   submit all my writings to the judgment of those learned men by whose
   commands I undertake them. That it will be the fault of ignorance, not
   malice, if I say anything contrary to the doctrine of the Holy Roman
   Catholic Church, may be held as certain. By God's goodness I am, and
   always shall be, faithful to the Church, as I have been in the past.
   May He be for ever blessed and glorified. Amen.

   He who bids me write this, tells me that the nuns of these convents of
   our Lady of Carmel need some one to solve their difficulties about
   prayer: he thinks that women understand one another's language best and
   that my sisters' affection for me would make them pay special attention
   to my words, therefore it is important for me to explain the subject
   clearly to them. Thus I am writing only to my sisters; the idea that
   any one else could benefit by what I say would be absurd. Our Lord will
   be doing me a great favour if He enables me to help but one of the nuns
   to praise Him a little better; His Majesty knows well that I have no
   other aim. If anything is to the point, they will understand that it
   does not originate from me and there is no reason to attribute it to
   me, as with my scant understanding and skill I could write nothing of
   the sort, unless God, in His mercy, enabled me to do so.

  CHAPTER I.

   THIS CHAPTER TREATS OF THE BEAUTY AND DIGNITY OF OUR SOULS AND MAKES A
   COMPARISON TO EXPLAIN THIS. THE ADVANTAGE OF KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING
   THIS AND THE FAVOURS GOD GRANTS TO US IS SHOWN, AND HOW PRAYER IS THE
   GATE OF THE SPIRITUAL CASTLE.

   1. Plan of this book. 2. The Interior Castle. 3. Our curable self
   ignorance. 4. God dwells in the centre of the soul. 5. Why all souls do
   not receive certain favours. 6. Reasons for speaking of these favours.
   7. The entrance of the Castle. 8. Entering into oneself. 9. Prayer. 10.
   Those who dwell in the first mansion. 11. Entering. 12. Difficulties of
   the subject.

   1. WHILE I was begging our Lord to-day to speak for me, since I knew
   not what to say nor how to commence this work which obedience has laid
   upon me, an idea occurred to me which I will explain, and which will
   serve as a foundation for that I am about to write.

   2. I thought of the soul as resembling a castle, [31]   formed of a
   single diamond or a very transparent crystal, [32]   and containing
   many rooms, just as in heaven there are many mansions. [33]   If we
   reflect, sisters, we shall see that the soul of the just man is but a
   paradise, in which, God tells us, He takes His delight. [34]   What, do
   you imagine, must that dwelling be in which a King so mighty, so wise,
   and so pure, containing in Himself all good, can delight to rest?
   Nothing can be compared to the great beauty and capabilities of a soul;
   however keen our intellects may be, they are as unable to comprehend
   them as to comprehend God, for, as He has told us, He created us in His
   own image and likeness. [35]

   3. As this is so, we need not tire ourselves by trying to realize all
   the beauty of this castle, although, being His creature, there is all
   the difference between the soul and God that there is between the
   creature and the Creator; the fact that it is made in God's image
   teaches us how great are its dignity and loveliness. It is no small
   misfortune and disgrace that, through our own fault, we neither
   understand our nature nor our origin. Would it not be gross ignorance,
   my daughters, if, when a man was questioned about his name, or country,
   or parents, he could not answer? Stupid as this would be, it is
   unspeakably more foolish to care to learn nothing of our nature except
   that we possess bodies, and only to realize vaguely that we have souls,
   because people say so and it is a doctrine of faith. Rarely do we
   reflect upon what gifts our souls may possess, Who dwells within them,
   or how extremely precious they are. Therefore we do little to preserve
   their beauty; all our care is concentrated on our bodies, which are but
   the coarse setting of the diamond, or the outer walls of the castle.
   [36]

   4. Let us imagine, as I said, that there are many rooms in this castle,
   of which some are above, some below, others at the side; in the centre,
   in the very midst of them all, is the principal chamber in which God
   and the soul hold their most secret intercourse. [37]   Think over this
   comparison very carefully; God grant it may enlighten you about the
   different kinds of graces He is pleased to bestow upon the soul. No one
   can know all about them, much less a person so ignorant as I am. The
   knowledge that such things are possible will console you greatly should
   our Lord ever grant you any of these favours; people themselves
   deprived of them can then at least praise Him for His great goodness in
   bestowing them on others. The thought of heaven and the happiness of
   the saints does us no harm, but cheers and urges us to win this joy for
   ourselves, nor will it injure us to know that during this exile God can
   communicate Himself to us loathsome worms; it will rather make us love
   Him for such immense goodness and infinite mercy.

   5. I feel sure that vexation at thinking that during our life on earth
   God can bestow these graces on the souls of others shows a want of
   humility and charity for one's neighbour, for why should we not feel
   glad at a brother's receiving divine favours which do not deprive us of
   our own share? Should we not rather rejoice at His Majesty's thus
   manifesting His greatness wherever He chooses? [38]   Sometimes our
   Lord acts thus solely for the sake of showing His power, as He declared
   when the Apostles questioned whether the blind man whom He cured had
   been suffering for his own or his parents' sins. [39]   God does not
   bestow these favours on certain souls because they are more holy than
   others who do not receive them, but to manifest His greatness, as in
   the case of St. Paul and St. Mary Magdalen, and that we may glorify Him
   in His creatures.

   6. People may say such things appear impossible and it is best not to
   scandalize the weak in faith by speaking about them. But it is better
   that the latter should disbelieve us, than that we should desist from
   enlightening souls which receive these graces, that they may rejoice
   and may endeavour to love God better for His favours, seeing He is so
   mighty and so great. There is no danger here of shocking those for whom
   I write by treating of such matters, for they know and believe that God
   gives even greater proofs of His love. I am certain that if any one of
   you doubts the truth of this, God will never allow her to learn it by
   experience, for He desires that no limits should be set to His work:
   therefore, never discredit them because you are not thus led
   yourselves.

   7. Now let us return to our beautiful and charming castle and discover
   how to enter it. This appears incongruous: if this castle is the soul,
   clearly no one can have to enter it, for it is the person himself: one
   might as well tell some one to go into a room he is already in! There
   are, however, very different ways of being in this castle; many souls
   live in the courtyard of the building where the sentinels stand,
   neither caring to enter farther, nor to know who dwells in that most
   delightful place, what is in it and what rooms it contains.

   8. Certain books on prayer that you have read advise the soul to enter
   into itself, [40]   and this is what I mean. I was recently told by a
   great theologian that souls without prayer are like bodies, palsied and
   lame, having hands and feet they cannot use.  Just so, there are souls
   so infirm and accustomed to think of nothing but earthly matters, that
   there seems no cure for them. It appears impossible for them to retire
   into their own hearts; accustomed as they are to be with the reptiles
   and other creatures which live outside the castle, they have come at
   last to imitate their habits. Though these souls are by their nature so
   richly endowed, capable of communion even with God Himself, yet their
   case seems hopeless. Unless they endeavour to understand and remedy
   their most miserable plight, their minds will become, as it were,
   bereft of movement, just as Lot's wife became a pillar of salt for
   looking backwards in disobedience to God's command. [41]

   9. As far as I can understand, the gate by which to enter this castle
   is prayer and meditation. I do not allude more to mental than to vocal
   prayer, for if it is prayer at all, the mind must take part in it. If a
   person neither considers to Whom he is addressing himself, what he
   asks, nor what he is who ventures to speak to God, although his lips
   may utter many words, I do not call it prayer. [42]   Sometimes,
   indeed, one may pray devoutly without making all these considerations
   through having practised them at other times. The custom of speaking to
   God Almighty as freely as with a slave--caring nothing whether the
   words are suitable or not, but simply saying the first thing that comes
   to mind from being learnt by rote by frequent repetition--cannot be
   called prayer: God grant that no Christian may address Him in this
   manner. I trust His Majesty will prevent any of you, sisters, from
   doing so. Our habit in this Order of conversing about spiritual matters
   is a good preservative against such evil ways.

   10. Let us speak no more of these crippled souls, who are in a most
   miserable and dangerous state, unless our Lord bid them rise, as He did
   the palsied man who had waited more than thirty years at the pool of
   Bethsaida. [43]   We will now think of the others who at last enter the
   precincts of the castle; they are still very worldly, yet have some
   desire to do right, and at times, though rarely, commend themselves to
   God's care. They think about their souls every now and then; although
   very busy, they pray a few times a month, with minds generally filled
   with a thousand other matters, for where their treasure is, there is
   their heart also. [44]   Still, occasionally they cast aside these
   cares; it is a great boon for them to realize to some extent the state
   of their souls, and to see that they will never reach the gate by the
   road they are following.

   11. At length they enter the first rooms in the basement of the castle,
   accompanied by numerous reptiles [45]   which disturb their peace, and
   prevent their seeing the beauty of the building; still, it is a great
   gain that these persons should have found their way in at all.

   12. You may think, my daughters, that all this does not concern you,
   because, by God's grace, you are farther advanced; still, you must be
   patient with me, for I can explain myself on some spiritual matters
   concerning prayer in no other way. May our Lord enable me to speak to
   the point; the subject is most difficult to understand without personal
   experience of such graces. Any one who has received them will know how
   impossible it is to avoid touching on subjects which, by the mercy of
   God, will never apply to us.

   [31] Way of Perfection, ch. xxviii, 9.

   [32] In her Life St. Teresa likened God to a diamond (ch. xl, 14); and
   elsewhere (ch. xi, 10) the soul to a garden wherein our Lord takes His
   delight.

   [33] St. John xiv. 2: In domo Patris mei mansiones multæ sunt.' St.
   John of the Cross uses the same comparison: If the soul shall overcome
   the devil in the first combat, it shall then pass on to the second; and
   if it shall be victorious there also, it shall then pass on to the
   third; and then through the seven mansions, the seven degrees of love,
   until the Bridegroom shall bring it to the "cellar of wine" of perfect
   charity.' (Ascent of Mount Carmel, bk. ii. ch. xi. 7.)

   [36] Way of Perf. ch. xxviii.

   [37] St. John of the Cross on the words of his stanza: In the inner
   cellar of my Beloved have I drunk.' Here the soul speaks of that
   sovereign grace of God in taking it into the house of His love, which
   is the union or transformation of love in God . . . The cellar is the
   highest degree of love to which the soul can attain in this life, and
   is therefore said to be the inner. It follows from this that there are
   other cellars not so interior; that is, the degrees of love by which
   souls reach to this, the last. These cellars are seven in number, and
   the soul has entered them all when it has in perfection the seven gifts
   of the Holy Ghost, so far as it is possible for it. . . . Many souls
   reach and enter the first cellar, each according to the perfection of
   its love, but the last and inmost cellar is entered by few in this
   world, because therein is wrought the perfect union with God, the union
   of the spiritual marriage.' A Spiritual Canticle, stanza xxvi. 1-3.

   Constitutions, (§ 7) every prioress was bound to provide for her
   convent.

   [45] Many an ancient castle was provided with a bear-garden where rare
   animals were kept for the amusement of the inhabitants. This may have
   supplied the material for St. Teresa's comparison.

   beginners. 14. Our strength must come from God. 15. Sin blinds the

   the devil. 19. Examples of the devil's arts. 20. Perfection consists in

   1. BEFORE going farther, I wish you to consider the state to which
   mortal sin [46]   brings this magnificent and beautiful castle, this
   pearl of the East, this tree of life, planted beside the living waters
   of life [47] which symbolize God Himself. No night can be so dark, no
   gloom nor blackness can compare to its obscurity. Suffice it to say
   that the sun in the centre of the soul, which gave it such splendour
   and beauty, is totally eclipsed, though the spirit is as fitted to
   enjoy God's presence as is the crystal to reflect the sun. [48]

   2. While the soul is in mortal sin nothing can profit it; none of its
   good works merit an eternal reward, since they do not proceed from God
   as their first principle, and by Him alone is our virtue real virtue.
   The soul separated from Him is no longer pleasing in His eyes, because
   by committing a mortal sin, instead of seeking to please God, it
   prefers to gratify the devil, the prince of darkness, and so comes to
   share his blackness. I knew a person to whom our Lord revealed the
   result of a mortal sin [49]   and who said she thought no one who
   realized its effects could ever commit it, but would suffer
   unimaginable torments to avoid it. This vision made her very desirous
   for all to grasp this truth, therefore I beg you, my daughters, to pray
   fervently to God for sinners, who live in blindness and do deeds of
   darkness.

   3. In a state of grace the soul is like a well of limpid water, from
   which flow only streams of clearest crystal. Its works are pleasing
   both to God and man, rising from the River of Life, beside which it is
   rooted like a tree. Otherwise it would produce neither leaves nor
   fruit, for the waters of grace nourish it, keep it from withering from
   drought, and cause it to bring forth good fruit. But the soul by
   sinning withdraws from this stream of life, and growing beside a black
   and fetid pool, can produce nothing but disgusting and unwholesome
   fruit.

   Notice that it is not the fountain and the brilliant sun which lose
   their splendour and beauty, for they are placed in the very centre of
   the soul and cannot be deprived of their lustre. The soul is like a
   crystal in the sunshine over which a thick black cloth has been thrown,
   so that however brightly the sun may shine the crystal can never
   reflect it.

   4. O souls, redeemed by the Blood of Jesus Christ, take these things to
   heart; have mercy on yourselves! If you realize your pitiable
   condition, how can you refrain from trying to remove the darkness from
   the crystal of your souls? Remember, if death should take you now, you
   would never again enjoy the light of this Sun. O Jesus! how sad a sight
   must be a soul deprived of light! What a terrible state the chambers of
   this castle are in! How disorderly must be the senses--the inhabitants
   of the castle--the powers of the soul its magistrates, governors, and
   stewards--blind and uncontrolled as they are! In short, as the soil in
   which the tree is now planted is in the devil's domain, how can its
   fruit be anything but evil? A man of great spiritual insight once told
   me he was not so much surprised at such a soul's wicked deeds as
   astonished that it did not commit even worse sins. May God in His mercy
   keep us from such great evil, for nothing in this life merits the name
   of evil in comparison with this, which delivers us over to evil which
   is eternal.

   5. This is what we must dread and pray God to deliver us from, for we
   are weakness itself, and unless He guards the city, in vain shall we
   labour to defend it. [50]   The person of whom I spoke [51]   said that
   she had learnt two things from the vision granted her. The first was, a
   great fear of offending God; seeing how terrible were the consequences,
   she constantly begged Him to preserve her from falling into sin.
   Secondly, it was a mirror to teach her humility, for she saw that
   nothing good in us springs from ourselves but comes from the waters of
   grace near which the soul remains like a tree planted beside a river,
   and from that Sun which gives life to our works. She realized this so
   vividly that on seeing any good deed performed by herself or by other
   people she at once turned to God as to its fountain head--without whose
   help she knew well we can do nothing--and broke out into songs of
   praise to Him. Generally she forgot all about herself and only thought
   of God when she did any meritorious action.

   6. The time which has been spent in reading or writing on this subject
   will not have been lost if it has taught us these two truths; for
   though learned, clever men know them perfectly, women's wits are dull
   and need help in every way. Perhaps this is why our Lord has suggested
   these comparisons to me; may He give us grace to profit by them!

   7. So obscure are these spiritual matters that to explain them an
   ignorant person like myself must say much that is superfluous, and even
   alien to the subject, before coming to the point. My readers must be
   patient with me, as I am with myself while writing what I do not
   understand; indeed, I often take up the paper like a dunce, not knowing
   what to say, nor how to begin. Doubtless there is need for me to do my
   best to explain these spiritual subjects to you, for we often hear how
   beneficial prayer is for our souls; our Constitutions oblige us to pray
   so many hours a day, yet tell us nothing of what part we ourselves can
   take in it and very little of the work God does in the soul by its
   means. [52]   It will be helpful, in setting it before you in various
   ways, to consider this heavenly edifice within us, so little understood
   by men, near as they often come to it. Our Lord gave me grace to
   understand something of such matters when I wrote on them before, yet I
   think I have more light now, especially on the more difficult
   questions. Unfortunately I am too ignorant to treat of such subjects
   without saying much that is already well known.

   8. Now let us turn at last to our castle with its many mansions. You
   must not think of a suite of rooms placed in succession, but fix your
   eyes on the keep, the court inhabited by the King. [53]   Like the
   kernel of the palmito, [54]   from which several rinds must be removed
   before coming to the eatable part, this principal chamber is surrounded
   by many others. However large, magnificent, and spacious you imagine
   this castle to be, you cannot exaggerate it; the capacity of the soul
   is beyond all our understanding, and the Sun within this palace
   enlightens every part of it.

   9. A soul which gives itself to prayer, either much or little, should
   on no account be kept within narrow bounds. Since God has given it such
   great dignity, permit it to wander at will through the rooms of the
   castle, from the lowest to the highest. Let it not force itself to
   remain for very long in the same mansion, even that of self-knowledge.
   Mark well, however, that self-knowledge is indispensable, even for
   those whom God takes to dwell in the same mansion with Himself. Nothing
   else, however elevated, perfects the soul which must never seek to
   forget its own nothingness. Let humility be always at work, like the
   bee at the honeycomb, or all will be lost. But, remember, the bee
   leaves its hive to fly in search of flowers and the soul should
   sometimes cease thinking of itself to rise in meditation on the
   grandeur and majesty of its God. It will learn its own baseness better
   thus than by self-contemplation, and will be freer from the reptiles
   which enter the first room where self-knowledge is acquired. Although
   it is a great grace from God to practise self-examination, yet too much
   is as bad as too little,' as they say; believe me, by God's help, we
   shall advance more by contemplating the Divinity than by keeping our
   eyes fixed on ourselves, poor creatures of earth that we are.

   10. I do not know whether I have put this clearly; self-knowledge is of
   such consequence that I would not have you careless of it, though you
   may be lifted to heaven in prayer, because while on earth nothing is
   more needful than humility. Therefore, I repeat, not only a good way,
   but the best of all ways, is to endeavour to enter first by the room
   where humility is practised, which is far better than at once rushing
   on to the others. This is the right road;--if we know how easy and safe
   it is to walk by it, why ask for wings with which to fly? Let us rather
   try to learn how to advance quickly. I believe we shall never learn to
   know ourselves except by endeavouring to know God, for, beholding His
   greatness we are struck by our own baseness, His purity shows our
   foulness, and by meditating on His humility we find how very far we are
   from being humble.

   11. Two advantages are gained by this practice. First, it is clear that
   white looks far whiter when placed near something black, and on the
   contrary, black never looks so dark as when seen beside something
   white. Secondly, our understanding and will become more noble and
   capable of good in every way when we turn from ourselves to God: it is
   very injurious never to raise our minds above the mire of our own
   faults. I described how murky and fetid are the streams that spring
   from the source of a soul in mortal sin. [55]   Thus (although the case
   is not really the same, God forbid! this is only a comparison), while
   we are continually absorbed in contemplating the weakness of our
   earthly nature, the springs of our actions will never flow free from
   the mire of timid, weak, and cowardly thoughts, such as: I wonder
   whether people are noticing me or not! If I follow this course, will
   harm come to me? Dare I begin this work? Would it not be presumptuous?
   Is it right for any one as faulty as myself to speak on sublime
   spiritual subjects? [56]   Will not people think too well of me, if I
   make myself singular? Extremes are bad, even in virtue; sinful as I am
   I shall only fall the lower. Perhaps I shall fail and be a source of
   scandal to good people; such a person as I am has no need of
   peculiarities.'

   12. Alas, my daughters, what loss the devil must have caused to many a
   soul by such thoughts as these! It thinks such ideas and many others of
   the same sort I could mention arise from humility. This comes from not
   understanding our own nature; self-knowledge becomes so warped that,
   unless we take our thoughts off ourselves, I am not surprised that
   these and many worse fears should threaten us. Therefore I maintain, my
   daughters, that we should fix our eyes on Christ our only good, and on
   His saints; there we shall learn true humility, and our minds will be
   ennobled, so that self-knowledge will not make us base and cowardly.
   Although only the first, this mansion contains great riches and such
   treasures that if the soul only manages to elude the reptiles dwelling
   here, it cannot fail to advance farther. Terrible are the wiles and
   stratagems the devil uses to hinder people from realizing their
   weakness and detecting his snares.

   13. From personal experience I could give you much information as to
   what happens in these first mansions. I will only say that you must not
   imagine there are only a few, but a number of rooms, for souls enter
   them by many different ways, and always with a good intention. The
   devil is so angry at this that he keeps legions of evil spirits hidden
   in each room to stop the progress of Christians, whom, being ignorant
   of this, he entraps in a thousand ways. He cannot so easily deceive
   souls which dwell nearer to the King as he can beginners still absorbed
   in the world, immersed in its pleasures, and eager for its honours and
   distinctions. As the vassals of their souls, the senses and powers
   bestowed on them by God, are weak, such people are easily vanquished,
   although desirous not to offend God.

   14. Those conscious of being in this state must as often as possible
   have recourse to His Majesty, taking His Blessed Mother and the saints
   for their advocates to do battle for them, because we creatures possess
   little strength for self-defence. Indeed in every state of life all our
   help must come from God; may He in His mercy grant it us, Amen! What a
   miserable life we lead! As I have spoken more fully in other writings
   [57]   on the ill that results from ignoring the need of humility and
   self-knowledge, I will treat no more about it here, my daughters,
   although it is of the first importance. God grant that what I have said
   may be useful to you.

   15 You must notice that the light which comes from the King's palace
   hardly shines at all in these first mansions; although not as gloomy
   and black as the soul in mortal sin, yet they are in semi-darkness, and
   their inhabitants see scarcely anything. I cannot explain myself; I do
   not mean that this is the fault of the mansions themselves, but that
   the number of snakes, vipers, and venomous reptiles from outside the
   castle prevent souls entering them from seeing the light. They resemble
   a person entering a chamber full of brilliant sunshine, with eyes
   clogged and half closed with dust. Though the room itself is light, he
   cannot see because of his self-imposed impediment. In the same way,
   these fierce and wild beasts blind the eyes of the beginner, so that he
   sees nothing but them.

   16. Such, it appears to me, is the soul which, though not in a state of
   mortal sin, is so worldly and preoccupied with earthly riches, honours,
   and affairs, that as I said, even if it sincerely wishes to enter into
   itself and enjoy the beauties of the castle, it is prevented by these
   distractions and seems unable to overcome so many obstacles. It is most
   important to withdraw from all unnecessary cares and business, as far
   as compatible with the duties of one's state of life, in order to enter
   the second mansion. This is so essential, that unless done immediately
   I think it impossible for any one ever to reach the principal room, or
   even to remain where he is without great risk of losing what is already
   gained; otherwise, although he is inside the castle, he will find it
   impossible to avoid being bitten some time or other by some of the very
   venomous creatures surrounding him.

   17. What then would become of a religious like ourselves, my daughters,
   if, after having escaped from all these impediments, and having entered
   much farther into the more secret mansion, she should, by her own
   fault, return to all this turmoil? Through her sins, many other people
   on whom God had bestowed great graces would culpably relapse into their
   wretched state. In our convents we are free from these exterior evils;
   please God our minds may be as free from them, and may He deliver us
   from such ills.

   18. Do not trouble yourselves, my daughters, with cares which do not
   concern you. You must notice that the struggle with the demons
   continues through nearly all the mansions of this castle. True, in some
   of them, the guards, which, as I explained, are the powers of the soul,
   have strength for the combat, but we must be keenly on the watch
   against the devils's arts, lest he deceive us in the form of an angel
   of light. He creeps in gradually, in numberless ways, and does us much
   harm, though we do not discover it until too late. [58]

   19. As I said elsewhere, [59]   he works like a file, secretly and
   silently wearing its way: I will give you some examples to show how he
   begins his wiles. For instance: a nun has such a longing for penance as
   to feel no peace unless she is tormenting herself in some way. [60]
   This is good in itself; but suppose that the Prioress has forbidden her
   to practise any mortifications without special leave, and the sister
   thinking that, in such a meritorious cause, she may venture to disobey,
   secretly leads such a life that she loses her health and cannot even
   fulfil the requirements of her rule--you see how this show of good
   ends. Another nun is very zealous about religious perfection; this is
   very right, but may cause her to think every small fault she sees in
   her sisters a serious crime, and to watch constantly whether they do
   anything wrong, that she may run to the Prioress to accuse them of it.
   At the same time, may be she never notices her own shortcomings because
   of her great zeal about other people's religious observance, while
   perhaps her sisters, not seeing her intention but only knowing of the
   watch she keeps on them, do not take her behaviour in good part.

   20. The devil's chief aim here is to cool the charity and lessen the
   mutual affection of the nuns, which would injure them seriously. Be
   sure, my daughters, that true perfection consists in the love of God
   and our neighbour, and the better we keep both these commandments, the
   more perfect we shall be. The sole object of our Rule and Constitutions
   is to help us to observe these two laws.

   21. Indiscreet zeal about others must not be indulged in; it may do us
   much harm; let each one look to herself. However, as I have spoken
   fully on this subject elsewhere, [61]   I will not enlarge on it here,
   and will only beg you to remember the necessity of this mutual
   affection. Our souls may lose their peace and even disturb other
   people's if we are always criticizing trivial actions which often are
   not real defects at all, but we construe them wrongly through ignorance
   of their motives. See how much it costs to attain perfection! Sometimes
   the devil tempts nuns in this way about the Prioress, which is still
   more dangerous. Great prudence is then required, for if she disobeys
   the Rule or Constitutions the matter must not always be overlooked, but
   should be mentioned to her; [62]   if, after this, she does not amend,
   the Superior of the Order should be informed of it. It is true charity
   to speak in this case, as it would be if we saw our sisters commit a
   grave fault; to keep silence for fear that speech would be a temptation
   against charity, would be that very temptation itself. [63]

   22. However, I must warn you seriously not to talk to each other about
   such things, lest the devil deceive you. He would gain greatly by your
   doing so, because it would lead to the habit of detraction; rather, as
   I said, state the matter to those whose duty it is to remedy it. Thank
   God our custom here of keeping almost perpetual silence gives little
   opportunity for such conversations, still, it is well to stand ever on
   our guard.

     __________________________________________________________________

  ONLY CHAPTER

   TREATS OF THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF PERSEVERANCE IN ORDER TO ENTER THE
   LAST MANSIONS, AND OF THE FIERCE WAR THE DEVIL WAGES AGAINST US. HOW
   ESSENTIAL IT IS TO TAKE THE RIGHT PATH FROM THE VERY COMMENCEMENT OF
   OUR JOURNEY. A METHOD OF ACTION WHICH HAS PROVED VERY EFFICACIOUS.

   1. Souls in the second mansions. 2. Their state. 3. Their sufferings.
   4. They cannot get rid of their imperfections. 5. How God calls these
   souls. 6. Perseverance is essential. 7. Temptations of the devil. 8.
   Delusion of earthly joys. 9. God alone to be loved. 10. Reasons for
   continuing the journey. 11. War fare of the devil. 12. Importance of
   choice of friends. 13. Valour required. 14. Presumption of expecting
   spiritual consolations at first. 15. In the Cross is strength. 16. Our
   falls should raise us higher. 17. Confidence and perseverance. 18.
   Recollection. 19. Why we must practise prayer. 20. Meditation kindles
   love.

   1. Now let us consider which are the souls that enter the second
   mansions, and what they do there: I do not wish to enlarge on this
   subject, having already treated it very fully elsewhere, [64]   for I
   could not avoid repeating myself, as my memory is very bad. If I could
   state my ideas in another form they would not weary you, for we never
   tire of reading books on this subject, numerous as they are. 2. In this
   part of the castle are found souls which have begun to practise prayer;
   they realize the importance of their not remaining in the first
   mansions, yet often lack determination to quit their present condition
   by avoiding occasions of sin, which is a very perilous state to be in.

   3. However, it is a great grace that they should sometimes make good
   their escape from the vipers and poisonous creatures around them and
   should understand the need of avoiding them. In some way these souls
   suffer a great deal more than those in the first mansions, although not
   in such danger, as they begin to understand their peril and there are
   great hopes of their entering farther into the castle. I say that they
   suffer a great deal more, for those in an earlier stage are like
   deaf-mutes and are not so distressed at being unable to speak, while
   the others, who can hear but cannot talk, find it much harder. At the
   same time, it is better not to be deaf, and a decided advantage to hear
   what is said to us.

   4. These souls hear our Lord calling them, for as they approach nearer
   to where His Majesty dwells He proves a loving Neighbour, though they
   may still be engaged in the amusements and business, the pleasures and
   vanities of this world. While in this state we continually fall into
   sin and rise again, for the creatures amongst whom we dwell are so
   venomous, so vicious, and so dangerous, that it is almost impossible to
   avoid being tripped up by them. Yet such are the pity and compassion of
   this Lord of ours, so desirous is He that we should seek Him and enjoy
   His company, that in one way or another He never ceases calling us to
   Him. So sweet is His voice, that the poor soul is disconsolate at being
   unable to follow His bidding at once, and therefore, as I said, suffers
   more than if it could not hear Him.

   5. I do not mean that divine communications and inspirations received
   in this mansion are the same as those I shall describe later on; God
   here speaks to souls through words uttered by pious people, by sermons
   or good books, and in many other such ways. Sometimes He calls souls by
   means of sickness or troubles, or by some truth He teaches them during
   prayer, for tepid as they may be in seeking Him, yet God holds them
   very dear.

   6. Do not think lightly, sisters, of this first grace, nor be downcast
   if you have not responded immediately to Our Lord's voice, for His
   Majesty is willing to wait for us many a day and even many a year,
   especially when He sees perseverance and good desires in our hearts.
   Perseverance is the first essential; with this we are sure to profit
   greatly. However, the devils now fiercely assault the soul in a
   thousand different ways: it suffers more than ever, because formerly it
   was mute and deaf, or at least could hear very little, and offered but
   feeble resistance, like one who has almost lost all hope of victory.

   7. Here, however, the understanding being more vigilant and the powers
   more on the alert, we cannot avoid hearing the fighting and cannonading
   around us. For now the devils set on us the reptiles, that is to say,
   thoughts about the world and its joys which they picture as unending;
   they remind us of the high esteem men held us in, of our friends and
   relations; they tell us how the penances which souls in this mansion
   always begin to wish to perform would injure our health: in fine, the
   evil spirits place a thousand impediments in the way.

   8. O Jesus! What turmoil the devils cause in the poor soul! How unhappy
   it feels, not knowing whether to go forward or to return to the first
   mansion! On the other hand, reason shows it the delusion of overrating
   worldly things, while faith teaches what alone can satisfy its
   cravings. Memory reminds the soul how all earthly joys end, recalling
   the death of those who lived at ease; how some died suddenly and were
   soon forgotten, how others, once so prosperous, are now buried beneath
   the ground and men pass by the graves where they lie, the prey of
   worms, [65]   while the mind recalls many other such incidents.

   9. The will inclines to love Our Lord and longs to make some return to
   Him Who is so amiable, and Who has given so many proofs of His love,
   especially by His constant presence with the soul, which this faithful
   Lover never quits, ever accompanying it and giving it life and being.
   The understanding aids by showing that however many years life might
   last, no one could ever wish for a better friend than God; that the
   world is full of falsehood, and that the worldly pleasures pictured by
   the devil to the mind were but troubles and cares and annoyances in
   disguise.

   10. Reason convinces the soul that as outside its interior castle are
   found neither peace nor security, it should cease to seek another home
   abroad, its own being full of riches that it can enjoy at will.
   Besides, it is not every one who, like itself, possesses all he needs
   within his own dwelling, and above all, such a Host, Who will give it
   all it can desire, unless, like the prodigal son, it chooses to go
   astray and feed with the swine. [66]   Surely these arguments are
   strong enough to defeat the devil's wiles! But, O my God, how the force
   of worldly habits and the example of others who practise them ruin
   everything! Our faith is so dead that we trust less to its teaching
   than to what is visible, though, indeed, we see that worldly lives
   bring nothing but unhappiness. All this results from those venomous
   thoughts I described, which, unless we are very careful, will deform
   the soul as the sting of a viper poisons and swells the body.

   11. When this happens, great care is evidently needed to cure it, and
   only God's signal mercy prevents its resulting in death. Indeed, the
   soul passes through severe trials at this time, especially when the
   devil perceives from a person's character and behaviour that she is
   likely to make very great progress, for then all hell will league
   together to force her to turn back. O my Lord! what need there is here
   that, by Thy mercy, Thou shouldst prevent the soul from being deluded
   into forsaking the good begun! Enlighten it to see that its welfare
   consists in perseverance in the right way, and in the withdrawing from
   bad company.

   12. It is of the utmost importance for the beginner to associate with
   those who lead a spiritual life, [67]   and not only with those in the
   same mansion as herself, but with others who have travelled farther
   into the castle, who will aid her greatly and draw her to join them.
   The soul should firmly resolve never to submit to defeat, for if the
   devil sees it staunchly determined to lose life and comfort and all
   that he can offer, rather than return to the first mansion, he will the
   sooner leave it alone.

   13. Let the Christian be valiant; let him not be like those who lay
   down to drink from the brook when they went to battle (I do not
   remember when). [68]   Let him resolve to go forth to combat with the
   host of demons, and be convinced that there is no better weapon than
   the cross. I have already said, [69]   yet it is of such importance
   that I repeat it here: let no one think on starting of the reward to be
   reaped: this would be a very ignoble way of commencing such a large and
   stately building. If built on sand it would soon fall down. [70]
   Souls who acted thus would continually suffer from discouragement and
   temptations, for in these mansions no manna rains; [71]   farther on,
   the soul is pleased with all that comes, because it desires nothing but
   what God wills.

   14. What a farce it is! Here are we, with a thousand obstacles,
   drawbacks, and imperfections within ourselves, our virtues so newly
   born that they have scarcely the strength to act (and God grant that
   they exist at all!) yet we are not ashamed to expect sweetness in
   prayer and to complain of feeling dryness. [72]

   15. Do not act thus, sisters; embrace the cross your Spouse bore on His
   shoulders; know that your motto should be: Most happy she who suffers
   most if it be for Christ!' [73]   All else should be looked upon as
   secondary: if our Lord give it you, render Him grateful thanks. You may
   imagine you would be resolute in enduring external trials if God gave
   you interior consolations: His Majesty knows best what is good for us;
   it is not for us to advise Him how to treat us, for He has the right to
   tell us that we know not what we ask. [74]   Remember, it is of the
   greatest importance--the sole aim of one beginning to practise prayer
   should be to endure trials, and to resolve and strive to the utmost of
   her power to conform her own will to the will of God. [75]   Be certain
   that in this consists all the greatest perfection to be attained in the
   spiritual life, as I will explain later. She who practises this most
   perfectly will receive from God the highest reward and is the farthest
   advanced on the right road. Do not imagine that we have need of a
   cabalistic formula or any other occult or mysterious thing to attain it
   our whole welfare consists in doing the will of God. If we start with
   the false principle of wishing God to follow our will and to lead us in
   the way we think best, upon what firm foundation can this spiritual
   edifice rest?

   16. Let us endeavour to do our best: beware of the poisonous
   reptiles--that is to say, the bad thoughts and aridities which are
   often permitted by God to assail and torment us so that we cannot repel
   them. Indeed, perchance we feel their sting! He allows this to teach us
   to be more on our guard in the future and to see whether we grieve much
   at offending Him. Therefore if you occasionally lapse into sin, do not
   lose heart and cease trying to advance, for God will draw good even out
   of our falls, like the merchant who sells theriac, who first takes
   poison, then the theriac, to prove the power of his elixir. [76]   This
   combat would suffice to teach us to amend our habits if we realized our
   failings in no other way, and would show us the injury we receive from
   a life of dissipation. Can any evil be greater than that we find at
   home? What peace can we hope to find elsewhere, if we have none within
   us? What friends or kindred can be so close and intimate as the powers
   of our soul, which, whether we will or no, must ever bear us company?
   These seem to wage war on us as if they knew the harm our vices had
   wrought them. Peace, peace be unto you,' my sisters, as our Lord said,
   and many a time proclaimed to His Apostles. [77]   Believe me, if we
   neither possess nor strive to obtain this peace at home, we shall never
   find it abroad.

   17. By the blood which our Lord shed for us, I implore those who have
   not yet begun to enter into themselves, to stop this warfare: I beg
   those already started in the right path, not to let the combat turn
   them back from it. Let them reflect that a relapse is worse than a
   fall, and see what ruin it would bring. They should confide in God's
   mercy, trusting nothing in themselves; then they will see how His
   Majesty will lead them from one mansion to another, and will set them
   in a place where these wild beasts can no more touch or annoy them, but
   will be entirely at their mercy and merely objects of ridicule. Then,
   even in this life, they will enjoy a far greater happiness than they
   are able even to desire.

   18. As I said at the beginning of this work, I have explained elsewhere
   [78]   how you should behave when the devil thus disturbs you. I also
   told you that the habit of recollection is not to be gained by force of
   arms, but with calmness, which will enable you to practise it for a
   longer space of time. [79]   I will say no more now, except that I
   think it very helpful for those of you who are beginners to consult
   persons experienced in such matters, lest you imagine that you are
   injuring yourselves by leaving your prayer to perform any necessary
   duties. This is not the case; our Lord will direct such things to our
   profit, although we may have no one to counsel us. [80]   The only
   remedy for having given up a habit of recollection is to recommence it,
   otherwise the soul will continue to lose it more and more every day,
   and God grant it may realize its danger.

   19. You may think, that if it is so very injurious to desist, it would
   have been better never to have begun, and to have remained outside the
   castle. But, as I began by saying, and as God Himself declares: He that
   loves danger shall perish by it,' [81]   and the door by which we must
   enter this castle is prayer. Remember, we must get to heaven, and it
   would be madness to think we could do so without sometimes retiring
   into our souls so as to know ourselves, or thinking of our failings and
   of what we owe to God, or frequently imploring His mercy. Our Lord also
   says, No man cometh to the Father but by Me' [82]   (I am not sure
   whether this quotation is correct, but I think so), and, He that seeth
   Me seeth the Father also.' [83]

   20. If we never look up at Him and reflect on what we owe Him for
   having died for us, I do not understand how we can know Him, or perform
   good deeds in His service. What value is there in faith without works?
   and what are they worth if they are not united to the merits of Jesus
   Christ, our only good? What would incite us to love our Lord unless we
   thought of Him? May He give us grace to understand how much we cost
   Him; that the servant is not above his lord' [84] ; that we must toil
   for Him if we would enjoy His glory; and prayer is a necessity to
   prevent us from constantly falling into temptation. [85]

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   TREATS OF THE INSECURITY OF LIFE IN THIS EXILE, HOWEVER HIGH WE MAY BE
   RAISED, AND OF HOW WE MUST ALWAYS WALK IN FEAR. CONTAINS SOME GOOD
   POINTS.

   1. Souls in the Third Mansions. 2. Insecurity of this life. 3. Our
   danger of falling from grace. 4. The Saint bewails her past life. 5.
   Our Lady's patronage. 6. Fear necessary even for religious. 7. St.
   Teresa's contrition. 8. Characteristics of those in the Third Mansions.
   9. The rich young man in the Gospel. 10. Reason of aridities in prayer.
   11. Humility. 12. Tepidity. 13. We must give all to God. 14. Our debt.
   15. Consolations and aridities.

   1. As for those who, by the mercy of God, have vanquished in these
   combats and persevered until they reached the third mansions, what can
   we say to them but Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord'? [86]   It
   is no small favour from God that I should be able to translate this
   verse into Spanish so as to explain its meaning, considering how dense
   I usually am in such matters. We may well call these souls blessed,
   for, as far as we can tell, unless they turn back in their course they
   are on the safe road to salvation. Now, my sisters, you see how
   important it is for them to conquer in their former struggles, for I am
   convinced that our Lord will henceforth never cease to keep them in
   security of conscience, which is no small boon.

   2. I am wrong in saying security,' for there is no security in this
   life; understand that in such cases I always imply: If they do not
   cease to continue as they have begun.' What misery to live in this
   world! We are like men whose enemies are at the door, who must not lay
   aside their arms, even while sleeping or eating, and are always in
   dread lest the foe should enter the fortress by some breach in the
   walls. O my Lord and my all! How canst Thou wish us to prize such a
   wretched existence? We could not desist from longing and begging Thee
   to take us from it, were it not for the hope of losing it for Thy sake
   or devoting it entirely to Thy service--and above all because we know
   it is Thy will that we should live. Since it is so, Let us die with
   Thee!' [87]   as St. Thomas said, for to be away from Thee is but to
   die again and again, haunted as we are by the dread of losing Thee for
   ever!

   3. This is why I say, daughters, that we ought to ask our Lord as our
   boon to grant us one day to dwell in safety with the Saints, for with
   such fears, what pleasure can she enjoy whose only pleasure is to
   please God? Remember, many Saints have felt this as we do, and were
   even far more fervent, yet fell into grave sin, and we cannot be sure
   that God would stretch forth His hand to raise us from sin again to do
   such penance as they performed. This applies to extraordinary grace.
   [88]   Truly, my daughters, I feel such terror as I tell you this, that
   I know not how to write it, nor even how to go on living, when I
   reflect upon it as I very often do. Beg of His Majesty, my daughters,
   to abide within me, for otherwise, what security could I feel, after a
   life so badly spent as mine has been?

   4. Do not grieve at knowing this. I have often seen you troubled when I
   spoke about it, for you wish that my past had been a very holy one, in
   which you are right--indeed, I wish the same myself. But what can be
   done, now that I have wasted it entirely through my own fault? I have
   no right to complain that God withheld the aid I needed to fulfil your
   wishes. It is impossible for me to write this without tears and great
   shame, when I see that I am explaining these matters to those capable
   of teaching me. What a hard task has obedience laid, upon me! God grant
   that, as I do it for Him, it may be of some service to you; therefore
   beg Him to pardon me for my miserable presumption.

   5. His Majesty knows that I have nothing to rely upon but His mercy; as
   I cannot cancel the past, I have no other remedy but to flee to Him,
   and to confide in the merits of His Son and of His Virgin Mother, whose
   habit, unworthy as I am, I wear as you do also. Praise Him, then, my
   daughters, for making you truly daughters of our Lady, so that you need
   not blush for my wickedness as you have such a good Mother. Imitate
   her; think how great she must be and what a blessing it is for you to
   have her for a patroness, since my sins and evil character have brought
   no tarnish on the lustre of our holy Order.

   6. Still I must give you one warning: be not too confident because you
   are nuns and the daughters of such a Mother. David was very holy, yet
   you know what Solomon became. [89]   Therefore do not rely on your
   enclosure, on your penitential life, nor on your continual exercise of
   prayer and constant communion with God, nor trust in having left the
   world or in the idea that you hold its ways in horror. All this is
   good, but is not enough, as I have already said, to remove all fear;
   therefore meditate on this text and often recall it: 'Blessed is the
   man that feareth the Lord.' [90]

   7. I do not recollect what I was saying, and have digressed very much:
   for when I think of myself my mind cannot soar to higher things but is
   like a bird with broken wings; so I will leave this subject for the
   present.

   8. To return to what I began to explain about the souls which have
   entered the third mansions. God has shown them no small favour, but a
   very great one, in enabling them to pass through the first
   difficulties. Thanks to His mercy I believe there are many such people
   in the world: they are very desirous not to offend His Majesty even by
   venial sins, they love penance and spend hours in meditation, they
   employ their time well, exercise themselves in works of charity to
   their neighbours, are well-ordered in their conversation and dress, and
   those who own a household govern it well. This is certainly to be
   desired, and there appears no reason to forbid their entrance to the
   last mansions; nor will our Lord deny it them if they desire it, for
   this is the right disposition for receiving all His favours.

   9. O Jesus! can any one declare that he does not desire this great
   blessing, especially after he has passed through the chief
   difficulties? No; no one can! We all say we desire it, but there is
   need of more than that for the Lord to possess entire dominion over the
   soul. It is not enough to say so, any more than it was enough for the
   young man when our Lord told him what he must do if he desired to be
   perfect. [91]   Since I began to speak of these dwelling-rooms I have
   him constantly before my mind, for we are exactly like him; this very
   frequently produces the great dryness we feel in prayer, though
   sometimes it proceeds from other causes as well. I am not speaking of
   certain interior sufferings which give intolerable pain to many devout
   souls through no fault of their own; from these trials, however, our
   Lord always delivers them with much profit to themselves. I also except
   people who suffer from melancholy and other infirmities. But in these
   cases, as in all others, we must leave aside the judgments of God.

   10. I hold that these effects usually result from the first cause I
   mentioned; such souls know that nothing would induce them to commit a
   sin (many of them would not even commit a venial sin advertently), and
   that they employ their life and riches well. They cannot, therefore,
   patiently endure to be excluded from the presence of our King, Whose
   vassals they consider themselves, as indeed they are. An earthly king
   may have many subjects yet all do not enter his court. Enter then,
   enter, my daughters, into your interior; pass beyond the thought of
   your own petty works, which are no more, nor even as much, as
   Christians are bound to perform: let it suffice that you are God's
   servants, do not pursue so much as to catch nothing. [92]   Think of
   the saints, who have entered the Divine Presence, and you will see the
   difference between them and ourselves.

   11. Do not ask for what you do not deserve, nor should we ever think,
   however much we may have done for God, that we merit the reward of the
   saints, for we have offended Him. Oh, humility, humility! I know not
   why, but I am always tempted to think that persons who complain so much
   of aridities must be a little wanting in this virtue. However, I am not
   speaking of severe interior sufferings, which are far worse than a want
   of devotion.

   12. Let us try ourselves, my sisters, or let our Lord try us; He knows
   well how to do so (although we often pretend to misunderstand Him). We
   will now speak of these well-ordered souls. Let us consider what they
   do for God and we shall see at once what little right we have to murmur
   against His Majesty. If we turn our backs on Him and go away
   sorrowfully like the youth in the Gospel [93] when He tells us what to
   do to be perfect, what can God do? for He must proportion the reward to
   our love for Him. This love, my daughters, must not be the fabric of
   our imagination; we must prove it by our works. Yet do not suppose that
   our Lord has need of any works of ours; He only expels us to manifest
   our goodwill. [94]

   13. It seems to us we have done everything by taking the religious
   habit of our own will, and renouncing worldly things and all our
   possessions for God (although they may have been but the nets of St.
   Peter, [95]   yet they seemed much to us, for they were our all). This
   is an excellent disposition: if we continue in it and do not return,
   even in desire, to the company of the reptiles of the first rooms,
   doubtless, by persevering in this poverty and detachment of soul, we
   shall obtain all for which we strive. But, mark this--it must be on one
   condition--that we hold ourselves for unprofitable servants,' [96]   as
   we are told either by St. Paul or by Christ, and that we do not
   consider that our Lord is bound to grant us any favours, but that, as
   we have received more from Him, we are the deeper in His debt.

   14. How little is all we can do for so generous a God, Who died for us,
   Who created us, Who gives us being, that we should not think ourselves
   happy to be able to acquit ourselves of part of the debt we owe Him for
   having served us, without asking Him for fresh mercies and favours? I
   am loath to use this expression, yet so it is, for He did nothing else
   during the whole time He lived in this world but serve us.

   15. Think well my daughters, over some of the points I have treated,
   although confusedly, for I do not know how to explain them better. Our
   Lord will make you understand them, that you may reap humility from
   your dryness, instead of the disquietude the devil strives to cause by
   it. I believe that where true humility exists, although God should
   never bestow consolations, yet He gives a peace and resignation which
   make the soul happier than are others with sensible devotion. These
   consolations, as you have read, are often given by the Divine Majesty
   to the weakest souls who, I suppose would not exchange them for the
   fortitude of Christians serving God in aridities: we love consolations
   better than the cross! Do Thou, O Lord, Who knowest all truth, so prove
   us that we may know ourselves.

  CHAPTER II.

   CONTINUES THE SAME SUBJECT AND SPEAKS OF ARIDITIES IN PRAYER AND THEIR
   RESULTS: OF THE NECESSITY OF TRYING OURSELVES AND HOW OUR LORD PROVES
   THOSE WHO ARE IN THESE MANSIONS.

   1. Imperfections of dwellers in the first three mansions. 2. Our trials
   show us our weakness. 3. Humility learnt by our faults. 4. Love of
   money. 5. Liberty of spirit. 6. On bearing contempt. 7. Detachment
   proved by trials. 8. Virtue and humility are the essentials. 9.
   Perfection requires detachment. 10. We should try to make rapid
   progress. 11. Leave our cares in God's hands. 12. Humility more
   necessary than corporal penances. 13. Consolations rarely received
   until the fourth mansions. 14. Advantages of hearing of them. 15.
   Perfection consists in love, not in reward. 16. St. Teresa's joy at
   seeing other souls favoured. 17. These graces should be striven for.
   18. Obedience and direction, 19. Misguided zeal for others.

   1. I HAVE known some, in fact, I may say numerous souls, who have
   reached this state, and for many years lived, apparently, a regular and
   well-ordered life, both of body and mind. It would seem that they must
   have gained the mastery over this world, or at least be extremely
   detached from it, yet if His Majesty sends very moderate trials they
   become so disturbed and disheartened as not only to astonish but to
   make me anxious about them. Advice is useless; having practised virtue
   for so long they think themselves capable of teaching it, and believe
   that they have abundant reason to feel miserable.

   2. The only way to help them is to compassionate their troubles; [97]
   indeed, one cannot but feel sorry at seeing people in such an unhappy
   state. They must not be argued with, for they are convinced they suffer
   only for God's sake, and cannot be made to understand they are acting
   imperfectly, which is a further error in persons so far advanced. No
   wonder that they should feel these trials for a time, but I think they
   ought speedily to overcome their concern about such matters. God,
   wishing His elect to realize their own misery, often temporarily
   withdraws His favours: no more is needed to prove to us in a very short
   time what we really are. [98]

   3. Souls soon learn in this way; they perceive their faults very
   clearly, and sometimes the discovery of how quickly they are overcome
   by but slight earthly trials is more painful than the subtraction of
   God's sensible favours. I consider that God thus shows them great
   mercy, for though their behaviour may be faulty, yet they gain greatly
   in humility. Not so with the people of whom I first spoke; they believe
   their conduct is saintly, and wish others to agree with them. I will
   give you some examples which will help us to understand and to try
   ourselves, without waiting for God to try us, since it would be far
   better to have prepared and examined ourselves beforehand.

   4. A rich man, without son or heir, loses part of his property, [99]
   but still has more than enough to keep himself and his household. If
   this misfortune grieves and disquiets him as though he were left to beg
   his bread, how can our Lord ask him to give up all things for His sake?
   This man will tell you he regrets losing his money because he wished to
   bestow it on the poor.

   5. I believe His Majesty would prefer me to conform to His will, and
   keep peace of soul while attending to my interests, to such charity as
   this. If this person cannot resign himself because God has not raised
   him so high in virtue, well and good: let him know that he is wanting
   in liberty of spirit; let him beg our Lord to grant it him, and be
   rightly disposed to receive it. Another person has more than sufficient
   means to live on, when an opportunity occurs for acquiring more
   property: if it is offered him, by all means let him accept it; but if
   he must go out of his way to obtain it and then continues working to
   gain more and more--however good his intention may be (and it must be
   good, for I am speaking of people who lead prayerful and good lives),
   he cannot possibly enter the mansions near the King.

   6. Something of the same sort happens if such people meet with contempt
   or want of due respect. God often gives them grace to bear it well, as
   He loves to see virtue upheld in public, and will not have it condemned
   in those who practise it, or else because these persons have served Him
   faithfully, and He, our supreme Good, is exceedingly good to us all;
   nevertheless, these persons are disturbed, and cannot overcome or get
   rid of the feeling for some time. [100]   Alas! have they not long
   meditated on the pains our Lord endured and how well it is for us to
   suffer, and have even longed to do so? They wish every one were as
   virtuous as they are; and God grant they do not consider other people
   to blame for their troubles and attribute merit to themselves!

   7. You may think, my daughters, that I have wandered from the subject,
   for all this does not concern you: nothing of the sort occurs to us
   here, where we neither own nor wish for any property, nor endeavour to
   gain it, and no one does us any wrong. The instances I have mentioned
   do not coincide exactly, yet conclusions applicable to us may be drawn
   from them, which it would be neither well nor necessary to state. These
   will teach you whether you are really detached from all you have left;
   trifling occasions often occur, although perhaps not quite of the same
   kind, by which you can prove to yourselves whether you have obtained
   the mastery over your passions.

   8. Believe me, the question is not whether we wear the religious habit
   or not, but whether we practise the virtues and submit our will in all
   things to the will of God. The object of our life must be to do what He
   requires of us: let us not ask that our will may be done, but His. If
   we have not yet attained to this, let us be humble, as I said above.
   Humility is the ointment for our wounds; if we have it, although
   perhaps He may defer His coming for a time, God, Who is our Physician,
   will come and heal us. 9. The penances performed by the persons I spoke
   of are as well regulated as their life, which they value very highly
   because they wish to serve our Lord with it--in which there is nothing
   to blame--so they are very discreet in their mortifications lest they
   should injure their health. Never fear they will kill themselves: they
   are far too sensible! Their love is not strong enough to overcome their
   reason; I wish it were--that they might not be content to creep on
   their way to God: a pace that will never bring them to their journey's
   end!

   10. We seem to ourselves to be making progress, yet we become weary,
   for, believe me, we are walking through a mist; it will be fortunate if
   we do not lose ourselves. Do you think, my daughters, if we could
   travel from one country to another in eight days, that it would be well
   to spend a year on the journey, through wind, snow, and inundations and
   over bad roads? [101]   Would it not be better to get it over at once,
   for it is full of dangers and serpents? Oh, how many striking instances
   could I give you of this! God grant that I have passed beyond this
   state myself: often I think that I have not.

   11. All things obstruct us while prudence rules our actions; we are
   afraid of everything and therefore fear to make progress--as if we
   could reach the inner chambers while others make the journey for us! As
   this is impossible, sisters, for the love of God let us exert
   ourselves, and leave our reason and our fears in His hands, paying no
   attention to the weaknesses of nature which might retard us. Let our
   Superiors, to whom the charge belongs, look after our bodies; let our
   only care be to hasten to our Lord's presence--for though there are few
   or no indulgences to be obtained here, yet, regard for health might
   mislead us and it would be none the better for our care, as I know
   well.

   12. I know, too, that our bodies are not the chief factors in the work
   we have before us; they are accessory: extreme humility is the
   principal point. It is the want of this, I believe, that stops people's
   progress. It may seem that we have made but little way: we should
   believe that is the case, and that our sisters are advancing much more
   rapidly than we are. Not only should we wish others to consider us the
   worst of all; we should endeavour to make them think so. If we act in
   this manner, our soul will do well; otherwise we shall make no progress
   and shall always remain the prey to a thousand troubles and miseries.
   The way will be difficult and wearisome without self-renunciation,
   weighed down as we are by the burden and frailties of human nature,
   which are no longer felt in the more interior mansions.

   13. In these third mansions the Lord never fails to repay our services,
   both as a just and even as a merciful God, Who always bestows on us far
   more than we deserve, giving us greater happiness than could be
   obtained from any earthly pleasures and amusements. I think He grants
   few consolations here, except, perhaps, occasionally to entice us to
   prepare ourselves to enter the last mansions by showing us their
   contents. There may appear to you to be no difference except in name
   between sensible devotion, and consolations and you may ask why I
   distinguish them. I think there is a very great difference, but I may
   be mistaken.

   14. This will be best explained while writing of the fourth mansion,
   which comes next, when I must speak of the consolations received there
   from our Lord. The subject may appear futile, yet may prove useful by
   urging souls who know what each mansion contains to strive to enter the
   best. It will solace those whom God has advanced so far; others, who
   thought they had reached the summit, will be abashed, yet if they are
   humble they will be led to thank God.

   15. Those who do not receive these consolations may feel a despondency
   that is uncalled for, since perfection does not consist in consolation
   but in greater love; our reward will be in proportion to this, and to
   the justice and sincerity of our actions. Perhaps you wonder, then, why
   I treat of these interior favours and their nature. I do not know; ask
   him who bade me write this. I must obey Superiors, not argue with them,
   which I have no right to do.

   16. I assure you that when I had neither received these favours, [102]
     nor understood them by experience, or ever expected to (and rightly
   so, for I should have felt reassured if I had known or even conjectured
   that I was pleasing to God in any way), yet when I read of the mercies
   and consolations that our Lord grants to His servants, I was delighted
   and praised Him fervently. If such as myself acted thus, how much more
   would the humble and good glorify Him! I think it is worth while to
   explain these subjects and show what consolations and delights we lose
   through our own fault, if only for the sake of moving a single soul to
   praise God once.

   17. When these joys are from God they come laden with love and
   strength, which aid the soul on its way and increase its good works and
   virtues. Do not imagine that it is unimportant whether you try to
   obtain these graces or no; if you are not to blame, the Lord is just:
   what He refuses in one way, His Majesty will give you in another, as He
   knows how; His secret ways are very mysterious, and doubtless He will
   do what is best for you.

   18. Souls who by God's mercy are brought so far (which, as I said, is
   no small mercy, for they are likely to ascend still higher) will be
   greatly benefited by practising prompt obedience. Even if they are not
   in the religious state, it would be well if they, like certain other
   people, were to take a director, [103]   so as never to follow their
   own will, which is the cause of most of our ills. They should not
   choose one of their own turn of mind [104]   (as the saying goes), who
   is over prudent in his actions, but should select one thoroughly
   detached from worldly things; it is very helpful to consult a person
   who has learnt and can teach this. It is encouraging to see that trials
   which seemed to us impossible to submit to are possible to others, and
   that they bear them sweetly. Their flight makes us try to soar, like
   nestlings taught by the elder birds, who, though they cannot fly far at
   first, little by little imitate their parents: I know the great benefit
   of this. However determined such persons may be not to offend our Lord,
   they must not expose themselves to temptation: they are still near the
   first mansions to which they might easily return. Their strength is not
   yet established on a solid foundation like that of souls exercised in
   sufferings, who know how little cause there is to fear the tempests of
   this world and care nothing for its pleasures: beginners might succumb
   before any severe trial. Some great persecution, such as the devil
   knows how to raise to injure us, might make beginners turn back; while
   zealously trying to withdraw others from sin they might succumb to the
   attacks made upon them.

   19. Let us look at our own faults, and not at other persons'. People
   who are extremely correct themselves are often shocked at everything
   they see [105] ; however, we might often learn a great deal that is
   essential from the very persons whom we censure. Our exterior
   comportment and manners may be better--this is well enough, but not of
   the first importance. We ought not to insist on every one following in
   our footsteps, nor to take upon ourselves to give instructions in
   spirituality when, perhaps, we do not even know what it is. Zeal for
   the good of souls, though given us by God, may often lead us astray,
   sisters; it is best to keep our rule, which bids us ever to live in
   silence and in hope. [106]   Our Lord will care for the souls belonging
   to Him; and if we beg His Majesty to do so, by His grace we shall be
   able to aid them greatly. May He be for ever blessed!

                              THE FOURTH MANSIONS
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   HOW SWEETNESS AND TENDERNESS IN PRAYER DIFFER FROM CONSOLATIONS.
   EXPLAINS HOW ADVANTAGEOUS IT WAS FOR ST. TERESA TO COMPREHEND THAT THE
   IMAGINATION AND THE UNDERSTANDING ARE NOT THE SAME THING. THIS CHAPTER
   IS USEFUL FOR THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS WANDER MUCH DURING PRAYER.

   1. Graces received in this mansion. 2. Mystic favours. 3. Temptations
   bring humility and merit. 4. Sensible devotion and natural joys. 5.
   Sweetness in devotion. 6. St. Teresa's experience of it. 7. Love of
   God, and how to foster it. 8. Distractions. 9. They do not destroy
   divine union. 10. St. Teresa's physical distractions. 11. How to treat
   distractions. 12. They should be disregarded. 13. Self-knowledge
   necessary.

   1. Now that I commence writing about the fourth mansions, it is
   requisite, as I said, [107]   to commend myself to the Holy Ghost and
   to beg Him henceforth to speak for me, that I may be enabled to treat
   these matters intelligibly. Henceforth they begin to be supernatural
   and it will be most difficult to speak clearly about them, [108]
   unless His Majesty undertakes it for me, as He did when I explained the
   subject (as far as I understood it) somewhat about fourteen years ago.
   [109]   I believe I now possess more light about the favours God grants
   some souls, but that is different from being able to elucidate them.
   [110]   May His Majesty enable me to do so if it would be useful, but
   not otherwise.

   2. As these mansions are nearer the King's dwelling they are very
   beautiful, and so subtle are the things seen and heard in them, that,
   as those tell us who have tried to do so, the mind cannot give a lucid
   idea of them to those inexperienced in the matter. People who have
   enjoyed these favours, especially if it was to any great extent, will
   easily comprehend me.

   3. Apparently a person must have dwelt for a long time in the former
   mansions before entering these; although in ordinary cases the soul
   must have been in the last one spoken of, yet, as you must often have
   heard, there is no fixed rule, for God gives when, how, and to whom He
   wills [111] --the goods are His own, and His choice wrongs no one.
   [112]   The poisonous reptiles rarely come into these rooms, and, if
   they enter, do more good than harm. I think it is far better for them
   to get in and make war on the soul in this state of prayer; were it not
   tempted, the devil might sometimes deceive it about divine
   consolations, thus injuring it far more. Besides, the soul would
   benefit less, because all occasions of gaining merit would be
   withdrawn, were it left continually absorbed in God. I am not confident
   that this absorption is genuine when it always remains in the same
   state, nor does it appear to me possible for the Holy Ghost to dwell
   constantly within us, to the same extent, during our earthly exile.

   4. I will now describe, as I promised, the difference between sweetness
   in prayer and spiritual consolations. It appears to me that what we
   acquire for ourselves in meditation and petitions to our Lord may be
   termed sweetness in devotion.' [113]   It is natural, although
   ultimately aided by the grace of God. I must be understood to imply
   this in all I say, for we can do nothing without Him. This sweetness
   arises principally from the good work we perform, and appears to result
   from our labours: well may we feel happy at having thus spent our time.
   We shall find, on consideration, that many temporal matters give us the
   same pleasure--such as unexpectedly coming into a large fortune,
   suddenly meeting with a dearly-loved friend, or succeeding in any
   important or influential affair which makes a sensation in the world.
   Again, it would be felt by one who had been told her husband, brother,
   or son was dead, and who saw him return to her alive. I have seen
   people weep from such happiness, as I have done myself. I consider both
   these joys and those we feel in religious matters to be natural ones.
   Although there is nothing wrong about the former, yet those produced by
   devotion spring from a more noble source--in short, they begin in
   ourselves and end in God. Spiritual consolations, on the contrary,
   arise from God, and our nature feels them and rejoices as keenly in
   them, and indeed far more keenly, than in the others I described.

   5. O Jesus! how I wish I could elucidate this point! It seems to me
   that I can perfectly distinguish the difference between the two joys,
   yet I have not the skill to make myself understood; may God give it me!
   I remember a verse we say at Prime at the end of the final Psalm; the
   last words are: Cum dilatasti cor meum'--When Thou didst dilate my
   heart: [114]   To those with much experience, this suffices to show the
   difference between sweetness in prayer and spiritual consolations;
   other people will require more explanation. The sensible devotion I
   mentioned does not dilate the heart, but generally appears to narrow it
   slightly; although joyful at seeing herself work for God, yet such a
   person sheds tears of sorrow which seem partly produced by the
   passions. I know little about the passions of the soul, or I could
   write of them more clearly and could better define what comes from the
   sensitive disposition and what is natural, having passed through this
   state myself, but I am very stupid. Knowledge and learning are a great
   advantage to every one.

   6. My own experience of this delight and sweetness in meditation was
   that when I began to weep over the Passion I could not stop until I had
   a severe headache; [115]   the same thing occurred when I grieved over
   my sins: this was a great grace from our Lord. I do not intend to
   inquire now which of these states of prayer is the better, but I wish I
   knew how to explain the difference between the two. In that of which I
   speak, the tears and good desires are often partly caused by the
   natural disposition, but although this may be the case, yet, as I said,
   these feelings terminate in God. Sensible devotion is very desirable if
   the soul is humble enough to understand that it is not more holy on
   account of these sentiments, which cannot always with certainty be
   ascribed to charity, and even then are still the gift of God.

   7. These feelings of devotion are most common with souls in the first
   three mansions, who are nearly always using their understanding and
   reason in making meditations. This is good for them, for they have not
   been given grace for more; they should, however, try occasionally to
   elicit some acts such as praising God, rejoicing in His goodness and
   that He is what He is: let them desire that He may be honoured and
   glorified. They must do this as best they can, for it greatly inflames
   the will. Let them be very careful, when God gives these sentiments,
   not to set them aside in order to finish their accustomed meditation.
   But, having spoken fully on this subject elsewhere, [116]   I will say
   no more now. I only wish to warn you that to make rapid progress and to
   reach the mansions we wish to enter, it is not so essential to think
   much as to love much: therefore you must practise whatever most excites
   you to this. Perhaps we do not know what love is, nor does this greatly
   surprise me. Love does not consist in great sweetness of devotion, but
   in a fervent determination to strive to please God in all things, in
   avoiding, as far as possible, all that would offend Him, and in praying
   for the increase of the glory and honour of His Son and for the growth
   of the Catholic Church. These are the signs of love; do not imagine
   that it consists in never thinking of anything but God, and that if
   your thoughts wander a little all is lost. [117]

   8. I, myself, have sometimes been troubled by this turmoil of thoughts.
   I learnt by experience, but little more than four years ago, that our
   thoughts, or it is clearer to call it our imagination, are not the same
   thing as the understanding. I questioned a theologian on the subject;
   he told me it was the fact, which consoled me not a little. As the
   understanding is one of the powers of the soul, it puzzled me to see it
   so sluggish at times, while, as a rule, the imagination takes flight at
   once, so that God alone can control it by so uniting us to Himself
   [118]   that we seem, in a manner, detached from our bodies. It puzzled
   me to see that while to all appearance the powers of the soul were
   occupied with God and recollected in Him, the imagination was wandering
   elsewhere.

   9. Do Thou, O Lord, take into account all that we suffer in this way
   through our ignorance. We err in thinking that we need only know that
   we must keep our thoughts fixed on Thee. We do not understand that we
   should consult those better instructed than ourselves, nor are we aware
   that there is anything for us to learn. We pass through terrible
   trials, on account of not understanding our own nature and take what is
   not merely harmless, but good, for a grave fault. This causes the
   sufferings felt by many people, particularly by the unlearned, who
   practise prayer. They complain of interior trials, become melancholy,
   lose their health, and even give up prayer altogether for want of
   recognizing that we have within ourselves as it were, an interior
   world. We cannot stop the revolution of the heavens as they rush with
   velocity upon their course, neither can we control our imagination.
   When this wanders we at once imagine that all the powers of the soul
   follow it; we think everything is lost, and that the time spent in
   God's presence is wasted. Meanwhile, the soul is perhaps entirely
   united to Him in the innermost mansions, while the imagination is in
   the precincts of the castle, struggling with a thousand wild and
   venomous creatures and gaining merit by its warfare. Therefore we need
   not let ourselves be disturbed, nor give up prayer, as the devil is
   striving to persuade us. As a rule, all our anxieties and troubles come
   from misunderstanding our own nature.

   10. Whilst writing this I am thinking of the loud noise in my head
   which I mentioned in the Introduction, and which has made it almost
   impossible to obey the command given me to write this. It sounds as if
   there were a number of rushing waterfalls within my brain, while in
   other parts, drowned by the sound of the waters, are the voices of
   birds singing and whistling. This tumult is not in my ears, but in the
   upper part of my head, where, they say, is placed the superior part of
   the soul. I have long thought that this must be so because the flight
   of the spirit seems to take place from this part with great velocity.
   [119]   Please God I may recollect to explain the cause when writing of
   the latter mansions, this not being the proper place for it. It may be
   that God has sent this suffering in my head to help me to understand
   the matter, for all this tumult in my brain does not interfere with my
   prayer, nor with my speaking to you, but the great calm and love and
   desires in my soul remain undisturbed and my mind is clear.

   11. How, then, can the superior part of the soul remain undisturbed if
   it resides in the upper part of the brain? I cannot account for it, but
   am sure that I am speaking the truth. This noise disturbs my prayer
   when unaccompanied with ecstasy, but when it is ecstatic I do not feel
   any pain, however great. I should suffer keenly were I forced to cease
   praying on account of these infirmities. We should not be distressed by
   reason of our thoughts, nor allow ourselves to be worried by them: if
   they come from the devil, he will let us alone if we take no notice of
   them; and if they are, as often happens, one of the many frailties
   entailed by Adam's sin, let us be patient and suffer them for the love
   of God. Likewise, since we must eat and sleep without being able to
   avoid it, much to our grief, let us acknowledge that we are human, and
   long to be where no one may despise us. [120]   Sometimes I recall
   these words, spoken by the Spouse in the Canticle; [121]   truly never
   in our lives have we better reason to say them, for I think no earthly
   scorn or suffering can try us so severely as these struggles within our
   souls. All uneasiness or conflict can be borne while we have peace in
   ourselves, as I said; but if, while seeking for rest amidst the
   thousand trials of the world--knowing that God has prepared this rest
   for us--the obstacle is found in ourselves, the trial must prove
   painful and almost insufferable.

   12. Take us therefore, O Lord, to where these miseries can no longer
   cause us to be despised, for sometimes it seems as if they mocked our
   souls. Even in this life God delivers us from them when we reach the
   last mansion, as by His grace I will show you. Everybody is not so
   violently distressed and assaulted by these weaknesses as I have been
   for many years, [122]   on account of my wickedness, so that it seems
   as if I strove to take vengeance on myself. [123]   Since I suffer so
   much in this way, perhaps you may do the same, so I shall continue to
   explain the subject to you in different ways, in order to find some
   means of making it clear. The thing is inevitable, therefore do not let
   it disturb or grieve you, but let the mill clack on while we grind our
   wheat; that is, let us continue to work with our will and intellect.

   13. These troubles annoy us more or less according to the state of our
   health or in different circumstances. The poor soul suffers; although
   not now to blame, it has sinned at other times, and must be patient. We
   are so ignorant that what we have read and been told has not sufficed
   to teach us to disregard wandering thoughts, therefore I shall not be
   wasting time in instructing and consoling you about these trials.
   However, this will help you but little until God chooses to enlighten
   you, and additional measures are needed: His Majesty wishes us to learn
   by ordinary means to understand ourselves and to recognize the share
   taken in these troubles by our wandering imagination, our nature, and
   the devil's temptations, instead of laying all the blame on our souls.

   [107] First Mansions, ch. i. 1.

   [108] There are two kinds of contemplation: acquired or natural, and
   infused or supernatural. In their widest sense, including many
   remarkable phenomena of Natural religion, and, of course, the most
   wonderful manifestations recorded in the Old Testament, they form the
   system called Mysticism and are the proper object of Mystical theology.
   Natural or acquired contemplation is based upon an idealistic turn of
   mind which enables the soul to gaze upon the Godhead (simple gaze, as
   St. Teresa calls it) without approaching Him by the laborious process
   of reasoning, and in so doing embraces Him with its affective powers;
   like a person who, devoid of technical skill, takes in and is enamoured
   by, the beauty of a painting. Infused contemplation is the highest act
   of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost of Knowledge and Wisdom. It is often
   impossible, nor is it always essential, to determine where acquired
   contemplation ends and infused contemplation begins. But it should be
   borne in mind that both the one and the other are operations and not
   merely a passive state or mere fruition. Even the highest form of
   contemplation, the Beatific Vision, is a supernatural act of the soul,
   an operation of unending duration. A ship moved by a gentle breeze is
   rightly said to be actually sailing though the rowers are at rest.

  CHAPTER II.

   CONTINUES THE SAME SUBJECT, EXPLAINING BY A COMPARISON IN WHAT DIVINE
   CONSOLATIONS CONSIST: AND HOW WE OUGHT TO TRY TO PREPARE OURSELVES TO
   RECEIVE THEM, WITHOUT ENDEAVOURING TO OBTAIN THEM.

   1. Physical results of sensible devotion. 2. Effects of divine
   consolations. 3. The two fountains. 4. They symbolize two kinds of
   prayer. 5. Divine consolations shared by body and soul. 6. The incense
   within the soul. 7. Graces received in this prayer. 8. Such favours not
   to be sought after.

   1. GOD help me! how I have wandered from my subject! I forget what I
   was speaking about, for my occupations and ill-health often force me to
   cease writing until some more suitable time. The sense will be very
   disconnected; as my memory is extremely bad and I have no time to read
   over what is written, even what I really understand is expressed very
   vaguely, at least so I fear. I think I said that spiritual consolations
   are occasionally connected with the passions. These feelings of
   devotion produce fits of sobbing; I have even heard that sometimes they
   cause a compression of the chest, and uncontrollable exterior motions
   violent enough to cause bleeding at the nose and other painful effects.
   [124]

   2. I can say nothing about this, never having experienced anything of
   the kind myself; but there appears some cause for comfort in it,
   because, as I said, all ends in the desire to please God and to enjoy
   His presence. What I call divine consolations, or have termed elsewhere
   the 'prayer of quiet,' is a very different thing, as those will
   understand who, by the mercy of God, have experienced them.

   3. To make the matter clearer, let us imagine we see two fountains with
   basins which fill with water. I can find no simile more appropriate
   than water by which to explain spiritual things, as I am very ignorant
   and have poor wits to help me. [125]   Besides, I love this element so
   much that I have studied it more attentively than other things. God,
   Who is so great, so wise, has doubtless hidden secrets in all things He
   created, which we should greatly benefit by knowing, as those say who
   understand such matters. Indeed, I believe that in each smallest
   creature He has made, though it be but a tiny ant, there are more
   wonders than can be comprehended. These two basins are filled in
   different ways; the one with water from a distance flowing into it
   through many pipes and waterworks, while the other basin is built near
   the source of the spring itself and fills quite noiselessly. If the
   fountain is plentiful, like the one we speak of, after the basin is
   full the water overflows in a great stream which flows continually. No
   machinery is needed here, nor does the water run through aqueducts.

   4. Such is the difference between the two kinds of prayer. The water
   running through the aqueducts resembles sensible devotion, which is
   obtained by meditation. We gain it by our thoughts, by meditating on
   created things, and by the labour of our minds; in short, it is the
   result of our endeavours, and so makes the commotion I spoke of, while
   profiting the soul. [126]   The other fountain, like divine
   consolations, receives the water from the source itself, which
   signifies God: as usual, when His Majesty wills to bestow on us any
   supernatural favours, we experience the greatest peace, calm, and
   sweetness in the inmost depths of our being; I know neither where nor
   how.

   5. This joy is not, like earthly happiness, at once felt by the heart;
   after gradually filling it to the brim, the delight overflows
   throughout all the mansions and faculties, until at last it reaches the
   body. Therefore, I say it arises from God and ends in ourselves, for
   whoever experiences it will find that the whole physical part of our
   nature shares in this delight and sweetness. While writing this I have
   been thinking that the verse Dilatasti cor meum,' Thou hast dilated my
   heart,' [127]   declares that the heart is dilated. This joy does not
   appear to me to originate in the heart, but in some more interior part
   and, as it were, in the depths of our being. I think this must be the
   centre of the soul, as I have since learnt and will explain later on. I
   discover secrets within us which often fill me with astonishment: how
   many more must there be unknown to me! O my Lord and my God! how
   stupendous is Thy grandeur! We are like so many foolish peasant lads:
   we think we know something of Thee, yet it must be comparatively
   nothing, for there are profound secrets even in ourselves of which we
   know naught. I say comparatively nothing' in proportion with all the
   secrets hidden within Thee, yet how great are Thy mysteries that we are
   acquainted with and can learn even by the study of such of Thy works as
   we see! [128]

   6. To return to the verse I quoted, which may help to explain the
   dilation begun by the celestial waters in the depths of our being. They
   appear to dilate and enlarge us internally, and benefit us in an
   inexplicable manner, nor does even the soul itself understand what it
   receives. It is conscious of what may be described as a certain
   fragrance, as if within its inmost depths were a brazier sprinkled with
   sweet perfumes. Although the spirit neither sees the flame nor knows
   where it is, yet it is penetrated by the warmth, and scented fumes,
   which are even sometimes perceived by the body. Understand me, the soul
   does not feel any real heat or scent, but something far more subtle,
   which I use this metaphor to explain. Let those who have never
   experienced it believe that it really occurs to others: the soul is
   conscious of it and feels it more distinctly than can be expressed. It
   is not a thing we can fancy or gain by anything we can do; clearly it
   does not arise from the base coin of human nature, but from the most
   pure gold of Divine Wisdom. I believe that in this case the powers of
   the soul are not united to God, but are absorbed and astounded at the
   marvel before them. I may possibly be contradicting what I wrote
   elsewhere; [129]   nor would this be surprising, for it was done about
   fifteen years ago, and perhaps God has given me since then a clearer
   insight into the matter. I may be entirely mistaken on the subject,
   both then and now, but never do I wilfully say what is untrue. No; by
   the mercy of God, I would rather die a thousand times than tell a
   falsehood: I speak of the matter as I understand it. I believe that in
   this case the will must in some way be united with that of God. The
   after effects on the soul, and the subsequent behaviour of the person,
   show whether this prayer was genuine or no: this is the best crucible
   by which to test it.

   7. Our Lord bestows a signal grace on the soul if it realizes how great
   is this favour, and another greater still if it does not turn back on
   the right road. You are longing, my daughters, to enter into this state
   of prayer at once, and you are right, for, as I said, the soul cannot
   understand the value of the graces there bestowed by God upon it, nor
   the love which draws Him ever closer to it: we should certainly desire
   to learn how to obtain this favour. I will tell you what I know about
   it, setting aside certain cases in which God bestows these graces for
   no other reason than His own choice, into which we have no right to
   enquire.

   8. Practise what I advised in the preceding mansions, then--humility,
   humility! for God lets Himself be vanquished by this and grants us all
   we ask. [130] The first proof [131]   that you possess humility is that
   you neither think you now deserve these graces and consolations from
   God, nor that you ever will as long as you live. You ask me: How shall
   we receive them, if we do not try to gain them?' I answer, that there
   is no surer way to obtain them than the one I have told you, therefore
   make no efforts to acquire them, for the following reasons. The first
   is, that the chief means of obtaining them is to love God without
   self-interest. The second, that it is a slight lack of humility to
   think that our wretched services can win so great a reward. The third,
   that the real preparation for them is to desire to suffer and imitate
   our Lord, rather than to receive consolations, for indeed we have all
   offended Him. The fourth reason is, that His Majesty has not promised
   to give us these favours in the same way as He has bound Himself to
   bestow eternal glory on us if we keep His commandments. We can be saved
   without these special graces; He sees better than we do what is best
   for us and which of us love Him sincerely. I know for a certain truth,
   being acquainted with some who walk by the way of love (and therefore
   only seek to serve Jesus Christ crucified), that not only they neither
   ask for nor desire consolation, but they even beg Him not to give it
   them during this life: this is a fact. Fifthly, we should but labour in
   vain: this water does not flow through aqueducts, like that we first
   spoke of, and if the spring does not afford it, in vain shall we toil
   to obtain it. I mean, that though we may meditate and try our hardest,
   and though we shed tears to gain it, we cannot make this water flow.
   God alone gives it to whom He chooses, and often when the soul is least
   thinking of it. We are His, sisters, let Him do what He will with us,
   and lead us where He will. If we are really humble and annihilate
   ourselves, not only in our imagination (which often deceives us), but
   if we truly detach ourselves from all things, our Lord will not only
   grant us these favours but many others that we do not know even how to
   desire. May He be for ever praised and blessed! Amen.

  CHAPTER III.

   OF THE PRAYER OF RECOLLECTION WHICH GOD GENERALLY GIVES THE SOUL BEFORE
   GRANTING IT THAT LAST DESCRIBED. ITS EFFECTS: ALSO THOSE OF THE PRAYER
   OF DIVINE CONSOLATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE LAST CHAPTER.

   1. The Prayer of recollection compared to the inhabitants of the
   castle. 2. The Shepherd recalls His flock into the castle. 3. This
   recollection supernatural. 4. It prepares us for higher favours. 5. The
   mind must act until God calls it to recollection by love. 6. The soul
   should here abandon itself into God's hands. 7. The prayer of
   recollection, and distractions in Prayer. 8. Liberty of spirit gained
   by consolations. 9. The soul must be watchful. 10. The devil specially
   tempts such souls. 11. False trances and raptures. 12. How to treat
   those deluded in this way. 13. Risks of delusion in this mansion.

   1. THE effects of divine consolations are very numerous: before
   describing them, I will speak of another kind of prayer which usually
   precedes them. I need not say much on this subject, having written
   about it elsewhere. [132]   This is a kind of recollection which, I
   believe, is supernatural. There is no occasion to retire nor to shut
   the eyes, nor does it depend on anything exterior; involuntarily the
   eyes suddenly close and solitude is found. Without any labour of one's
   own, the temple of which I spoke is reared for the soul in which to
   pray: the senses and exterior surroundings appear to lose their hold,
   while the spirit gradually regains its lost sovereignty. Some say the
   soul enters into itself; others, that it rises above itself. [133]   I
   can say nothing about these terms, but had better speak of the subject
   as I understand it. You will probably grasp my meaning, although,
   perhaps, I may be the only person who understands it. Let us imagine
   that the senses and powers of the soul (which I compared in my allegory
   to the inhabitants of the castle) have fled and joined the enemy
   outside. After long days and years of absence, perceiving how great has
   been their loss, they return to the neighbourhood of the castle, but
   cannot manage to re-enter it, for their evil habits are hard to break
   off; still, they are no longer traitors, and they wander about outside.

   2. The King, Who holds His court within it, sees their good will, and
   out of His great mercy desires them to return to Him. Like a good
   Shepherd, He plays so sweetly on His pipe, that although scarcely
   hearing it they recognize His call and no longer wander, but return,
   like lost sheep, to the mansions. So strong is this Pastor's power over
   His flock, that they abandon the worldly cares which misled them and
   re-enter the castle.

   3. I think I never put this matter so clearly before. To seek God
   within ourselves avails us far more than to look for Him amongst
   creatures; Saint Augustine tells us how he found the Almighty within
   his own soul, after having long sought for Him elsewhere. [134]   This
   recollection helps us greatly when God bestows it upon us. But do not
   fancy you can gain it by thinking of God dwelling within you, or by
   imagining Him as present in your soul: this is a good practice and an
   excellent kind of meditation, for it is founded on the fact that God
   resides within us; [135]   it is not, however, the prayer of
   recollection, for by the divine assistance every one can practise it,
   but what I mean is quite a different thing. Sometimes, before they have
   begun to think of God, the powers of the soul find themselves within
   the castle. I know not by what means they entered, nor how they heard
   the Shepherd's pipe; the ears perceived no sound but the soul is keenly
   conscious of a delicious sense of recollection experienced by those who
   enjoy this favour, which I cannot describe more clearly.

   4. I think I read somewhere [136]   that the soul is then like a
   tortoise or sea-urchin, which retreats into itself. Those who said this
   no doubt understood what they were talking about; but these creatures
   can withdraw into themselves at will, while here it is not in our power
   to retire into ourselves, unless God gives us the grace. In my opinion,
   His Majesty only bestows this favour on those who have renounced the
   world, in desire at least, if their state of life does not permit their
   doing so in fact. He thus specially calls them to devote themselves to
   spiritual things; if they allow Him power to at freely He will bestow
   still greater graces on those whom He thus begins calling to a higher
   life. Those who enjoy this recollection should thank God fervently: it
   is of the highest importance for them to realize the value of this
   favour, gratitude for which would prepare them to receive still more
   signal graces. Some books advise that as a preparation for hearing what
   our Lord may say to us we should keep our minds at rest, waiting to see
   what He will work in our souls. [137]   But unless His Majesty has
   begun to suspend our faculties, I cannot understand how we are to stop
   thinking, without doing ourselves more harm than good. This point has
   been much debated by those learned in spiritual matters; I confess my
   want of humility in having been unable to yield to their opinion. [138]

   5. Some one told me of a certain book written on the subject by the
   saintly Friar Peter of Alcantara (as I think I may justly call him); I
   should have submitted to his decision, knowing that he was competent to
   judge, but on reading it I found he agreed with me that the mind must
   act until called to recollection by love, although he stated it in
   other words. [139]   Possibly I may be mistaken, but I rely on these
   reasons. Firstly, he who reasons less and tries to do least, does most
   in spiritual matters. We should make our petitions like beggars before
   a powerful and rich Emperor; then, with downcast eyes, humbly wait.
   When He secretly shows us He hears our prayers, it is well to be
   silent, as He has drawn us into His presence; there would then be no
   harm in trying to keep our minds at rest (that is to say, if we can).
   If, however, the King makes no sign of listening or of seeing us, there
   is no need to stand inert, like a dolt, which the soul would resemble
   if it continued inactive. In this case its dryness would greatly
   increase, and the imagination would be made more restless than before
   by its very effort to think of nothing. Our Lord wishes us at such a
   time to offer Him our petitions and to place ourselves in His presence;
   He knows what is best for us.

   6. I believe that human efforts avail nothing in these matters, which
   His Majesty appears to reserve to Himself, setting this limit to our
   powers. In many other things, such as penances, good works, and
   prayers, with His aid we can help ourselves as far as human weakness
   will allow. The second reason is, that these interior operations being
   sweet and peaceful, [140]   any painful effort does us more harm than
   good. By painful effort' I mean any forcible restraint we place on
   ourselves, such as holding our breath. [141]   We should rather abandon
   our souls into the hands of God, leaving Him to do as He chooses with
   us, as far as possible forgetting all self-interest and resigning
   ourselves entirely to His will. The third reason is, that the very
   effort to think of nothing excites our imagination the more. The fourth
   is, because we render God the most true and acceptable service by
   caring only for His honour and glory and forgetting ourselves, our
   advantages, comfort and happiness. How can we be self-oblivious, while
   keeping ourselves under such strict control that we are afraid to move,
   or even to think, or to leave our minds enough liberty to desire God's
   greater glory and to rejoice in the glory which He possesses? When His
   Majesty wishes the mind to rest from working He employs it in another
   manner, giving it a light and knowledge far above any obtainable by its
   own efforts and absorbing it entirely into Himself. Then, though it
   knows not how, it is filled with wisdom such as it could never gain for
   itself by striving to suspend the thoughts. God gave us faculties for
   our use; each of them will receive its proper reward. Then do not let
   us try to charm them to sleep, but permit them to do their work until
   divinely called to something higher. [142]

   7. In my opinion, when God chooses to place the soul in this mansion it
   is best for it to do as I advised, and then endeavour, without force or
   disturbance, to keep free from wandering thoughts. No effort, however,
   should be made to suspend the imagination entirely from arming, for it
   is well to remember God's presence and to consider Who He is. If
   transported out of itself by its feelings, well and good; but let it
   not try to understand what is passing within it, for this favour is
   bestowed on the will which should be left to enjoy it in peace, only
   making loving aspirations occasionally. Although, in this kind of
   prayer, the soul makes no effort towards it, yet often, for a very
   short time, the mind ceases to think at all. I explained elsewhere why
   this occurs during this spiritual state. [143]   On first speaking of
   the fourth mansions, I told you I had mentioned divine consolations
   before the prayer of recollection. The latter should have come first,
   as it is far inferior to consolations, of which it is the commencement.
   Recollection does not require us to give up meditation, nor to cease
   using our intellect. In the prayer of quiet, when the water flows from
   the spring itself and not through conduits, the mind ceases to act; it
   is forced to do so, although it does not understand what is happening,
   and so wanders hither and thither in bewilderment, finding no place for
   rest. Meanwhile the will, entirely united to. God, is much disturbed by
   the tumult of the thoughts: no notice, however, should be taken of
   them, or they would cause the loss of a great part of the favour the
   soul is enjoying. Let the spirit ignore these distractions and abandon
   itself in the arms of divine love: His Majesty will teach it how best
   to act, which chiefly consists in its recognizing its unworthiness of
   so great a good and occupying itself in thanking Him for it.

   8. In order to treat of the prayer of recollection, I passed over in
   silence the effects and symptoms to be found in souls thus favoured by
   God. Divine consolations evidently cause a dilation or enlargement of
   the soul that may be compared to water flowing from a spring into a
   basin which has no outlet, but is so constructed as to increase in size
   and proportion to the quantity poured into it. God seems to work the
   same effect by this prayer, besides giving many other marvellous
   graces, so preparing and disposing the soul to contain all He intends
   to give it. After interior sweetness and dilation the soul is not so
   restrained as formerly in God's service, but possesses much more
   liberty of spirit. It is no longer distressed by the terror of hell,
   for though more anxious than ever not to offend God, it has lost
   servile fear and feels sure that one day it will possess its Lord. It
   does not dread the loss of health by austerities; [144]   believing
   that there is nothing it could not do by His grace, it is more desirous
   than before of doing penance. Greater indifference is felt for
   sufferings because faith being stronger, it trusts that if borne for
   God He will give the grace to endure them patiently. Indeed, such a one
   at times even longs for trials, having a most ardent desire to do
   something for His sake. As the soul better understands the Divine
   Majesty, it realizes more vividly its own baseness. Divine consolation
   shows it how vile are earthly pleasures; by gradually withdrawing from
   them, it gains greater self-mastery. In short, its virtues are
   increased and it will not cease to advance in perfection, unless it
   turns back and offends God. Should it act thus, it would lose
   everything, however high the state it may have reached.

   9. It is not to be supposed that all these effects are produced merely
   by God's having shown these favours once or twice. They must be
   received continually, for it is on their frequent reception that the
   whole welfare of the soul depends. I strongly urge those who have
   reached this state to avoid most carefully all occasions of offending
   God. [145]   The soul is not yet fully established in virtue, but is
   like a new-born babe first feeding at its mother's breast: [146]   if
   it leaves her, what can it do but die? I greatly fear that when a soul
   to whom God has granted this favour discontinues prayer, except under
   urgent necessity, it will, unless it returns to the practice at once,
   go from bad to worse.

   10. I realize the danger of such a case, having had the grief of
   witnessing the fall of persons I knew through their withdrawal from Him
   Who sought, with so much love, to make Himself their friend, as He
   proved by His treatment of them. I urgently warn such persons not to
   run the risk of sinning, for the devil would rather gain one of these
   souls than many to whom our Lord does not grant such graces, [147]   as
   the former may cause him severe loss by leading others to follow their
   example, and may even render great service to the Church of God. Were
   there no other reason except that he saw the special love His Majesty
   bears these people, it would suffice to make Satan frantic to destroy
   God's work in them, so that they might be lost eternally. Therefore
   they suffer grievous temptations, and if they fall, they fall lower
   than others.

   11. You, my sisters, are free from such dangers, as far as we can tell:
   God keep you from pride and vainglory! The devil sometimes offers
   counterfeits of the graces I have mentioned: this can easily be
   detected--the effects being exactly contrary to those of the genuine
   ones. [148]   Although I have spoken of it elsewhere, [149]   I wish to
   warn you here of a special danger to which those who practise prayer
   are subject, particularly women, whose weakness of constitution makes
   them more liable to such mistakes. On account of their penances,
   prayers, and vigils, or even merely because of debility of health, some
   persons cannot receive spiritual consolation without being overcome by
   it. On feeling any interior joy, their bodies being languid and weak,
   they fall into a slumber--they call it spiritual sleep--which is a more
   advanced stage of what I have described; they think the soul shares in
   it as well as the body, and abandon themselves to a sort of
   intoxication. The more they lose self-control, the more do their
   feelings get possession of them, because the frame becomes more feeble.
   They fancy this is a trance and call it one, but I call it nonsense; it
   does nothing but waste their time and injure their health.

   12. This state lasted with a certain person for eight hours, during
   which time she was neither insensible, nor had she any thought of God.
   [150]   She was cured by being made to eat and sleep well and to leave
   off some of her penances. Her recovery was owing to some one who
   understood her case; hitherto she had unintentionally deceived both her
   confessor and other people, as well as herself. I feel quite sure the
   devil had been at work here to serve his own ends and he was beginning
   to gain a great deal from it. It should be known that when God bestows
   such favours on the soul, although there may be languor both of mind
   and body, it is not shared by the soul, which feels great delight at
   seeing itself so near God, nor does this state ever continue for more
   than a very short time. [151]   Although the soul may become absorbed
   again, yet, as I said, unless already feeble, the body suffers neither
   exhaustion nor pain. I advise any of you who experience the latter to
   tell the Prioress, and to divert your thoughts as much as possible from
   such matters. The Superior should prevent such a nun from spending more
   than a very few hours in prayer, and should make her eat and sleep well
   until her usual strength is restored, if she has lost it in this way.
   [152]   If the nun's constitution is so delicate that this does not
   suffice, let her believe me when I tell her that God only calls her to
   the active life. There must be such people in monasteries: employ her
   in the various offices and be careful that she is never left very long
   alone, otherwise she will entirely lose her health. This treatment will
   be a great mortification to her: our Lord tests her love for Him by the
   way in which she bears His absence. He may be pleased, after a time, to
   restore her strength; if not, she will make as much progress, and earn
   as great a reward by vocal prayer and obedience as she would have done
   by contemplation, and perhaps more.

   13. There are people, some of whom I have known, whose minds and
   imaginations are so active as to fancy they see whatever they think
   about, which is very dangerous. [153]   Perhaps I may treat of this
   later on, but cannot do so now. I have dwelt at length on this mansion,
   as I believe it to be the one most souls enter. As the natural is
   combined with the supernatural, the devil can do more harm here than
   later on, when God does not leave him so many opportunities. May God be
   for ever praised! Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [132] Life, ch. xiv. 2. The Saint says in the second chapter of this
   mansion, § 5, and also in letters dated Dec. 7, 1577 (Vol. II) and Jan.
   14, 1580, that when writing the Interior Castle she had more experience
   in spiritual things than when she composed her former works. This is
   fully borne out by the present chapter. In the corresponding part of
   her Life she practically confounded the prayer of recollection with the
   prayer of quiet (the second state of the soul). Likewise, in the Way of
   Perfection, ch. xxviii., she speaks of but one kind of prayer of
   recollection and then passes on to the prayer of quiet. Here, however,
   she mentions a second form of the prayer of recollection. See Philippus
   a SS. Trinitate, pars iii. tract. i, disc. iii. art. 1, De oratione
   recollectionis' (page 81 of the third vol. of the edition of 1874); de
   secundo modo recollectionis' (ibid. p. 82.); and art. 2: De oratione
   quietis' (ibid. p. 84.) Antonius a Spiritu Sancto, Direct. Mystic.
   tract. iv. n. 78: Duo sunt hujus recollectionis modi, primus quidem
   activus [reference to the Way of Perfection, l.c.], secundus autem
   passivus, [reference to this chapter of the Fourth Mansion].' The
   former is not supernatural, in the sense that with special grace from
   above it can be acquired; the second is altogether supernatural and
   more like gratuitous grace (ibid. no. 80 and 81). On the meaning of
   Solitude,' Silence,' etc., see Anton. a Sp. S. l.c., tract. i, n.
   78-82.

   [133] The edition of Burgos (vol. iv, P. 59) refers appropriately to
   the following passage in the Tercer Abecedario (See Life, ch. iv, 8) by
   the Franciscan friar Francisco de Osuna, a work which exercised a
   profound influence on St. Teresa: 'Entering within oneself; and rising
   above oneself, are the two principal points in this exercise, those
   which, above all others, one ought to strive after, and which give the
   highest satisfaction to the soul. There is less labour in entering
   within oneself than in rising above oneself and therefore it appears to
   me that when the soul is ready and fit for either, you ought to do the
   former, because the other will follow without any effort, and will be
   all the more pure and spiritual; however, follow what course your soul
   prefers as this will bring you more grace and benefit,' (Tr. ix, ch,
   viii).

   [134] Some editors of the Interior Castle think that St. Teresa refers
   to the following passage taken from the Confessions of St. Augustine:
   Too late have I loved Thee, O Beauty, ever ancient yet ever new! too
   late have I loved Thee! And behold, Thou wert within me and I abroad,
   and there I searched for Thee, and, deformed as I was, I pursued the
   beauties that Thou hast made. Thou wert with me, but I was not with
   Thee. Those things kept me far from Thee, which, unless they were in
   Thee, could have had no being' (St. Augustine's Confessions, bk. x, ch.
   xxvii.). The Confessions of St. Augustine were first translated into
   Spanish by Sebastian Toscano, a Portuguese Augustinian. This edition,
   which was published at Salamanca in 1554, was the one used by St.
   Teresa. However, it is more probable that here and elsewhere (Life, ch.
   xli. 10; Way of Perf. ch. xxviii. 2) St. Teresa quotes a passage which
   occurs in a pious book entitled Soliloquia, and erroneously attributed
   to St. Augustine: I have gone about the streets and the broad ways of
   the city of this world seeking Thee, but have not found Thee for I was
   wrong in seeking without for what was within.' (ch. xxxi.) This
   treatise which is also quoted by St. John of the Cross, Spiritual
   Canticle, stanza i. 7, Ascent of Mount Carmel, bk. i. ch. v. 1,
   appeared in a Spanish translation at Valladolid in 1515, at Medina del
   Campo in 1553, and at Toledo in 1565.

   [135] Life, ch. xiv. 7, 8; 20.

   [136] St. Teresa read this in the Tercer Abecedario of Francisco de
   Osuna (tr. vi, ch, iv): This exercise concentrates the senses of man in
   the interior of the heart where dwells the daughter of the king'; that
   is, the Catholic soul; thus recollected, man may well be compared to
   the tortoise or sea-urchin which rolls itself up and withdraws within
   itself, disregarding everything outside.'

   [139] A Golden Treatise of Mental Prayer by St. Peter of Alcantara,
   translated by Rev. G. F. Bullock M.A. and edited by Rev. George Seymour
   Hollings S.S.J.E. London, Mowbray, 1905, p. 117. Eighth Counsel. Let
   the last and chiefest counsel be that in this holy exercise we should
   endeavour to unite Meditation with Contemplation making of the one a
   ladder for attaining to the other. For this we must know that (p. 118)
   the very office of Meditation is to consider Divine things with
   studiousness and attention passing from one to another, to move our
   hearts to some affection and deep feeling for them, which is as though
   one should strike a flint to draw from it the spark. For Contemplation
   is to have drawn forth this spark: I mean to have now found this
   affection and feeling which were sought for, and to be in peace and
   silence enjoying them; not with many discursive and intellectual
   speculations but with simple gaze upon the truth. Wherefore, says a
   holy teacher, Meditation goes its way and brings forth fruit, with
   labour, but Contemplation bears fruit without labour. The one seeketh,
   the other findeth; the one consumeth the food, the other enjoys it; the
   one discourseth, and maketh reflections, the other is contented with a
   simple gaze upon the things, for it hath in possession their love and
   joy. Lastly, the one is as the means, the other as the end; the one as
   the road and journeying along it, the other as the end of the road and
   of the journeying. From this is to be inferred a very common thing,
   which all masters of the spiritual life teach, although it is little
   (p. 119) understood of those who learn it; which is this, that, as the
   means cease when the end has been attained, as the voyaging is over
   when the port has been touched, so when, through the working out of our
   Meditation, we have come to the repose and sweet savour of
   Contemplation, we ought then to cease from that pious and laborious
   searching; and being satisfied with the simple gaze upon, and thought
   of, God--as though we had Him there present before us--we should rest
   in the enjoyment of that affection then given, whether it be of love,
   or of admiration, or joy, or other like sentiment. The reason why this
   counsel is given is this, that as the aim of this devotion is love and
   the affections of the will rather than the speculations of the
   understanding, when the will has been caught and taken by this
   affection, we should put away all those discursive and intellectual
   speculations, so far as we can, in order that our soul with all its
   forces may be fastened upon this affection without being diverted by
   the action of other influences. A learned teacher, therefore, counsels
   us that as soon as anyone feels himself fired by the love of God, he
   should first put aside (p. 120.) all these considerations and
   thoughts--however exalted they may seem--not because they are really
   not good in themselves, but because they are then hindrances to what is
   better. and more important. For this is nothing else than that, having
   come to the end and purpose of our work, we should stay therein, and
   leave Meditation for the love of Contemplation. This may especially be
   done at the end of any exercise, that is, after the petition for the
   Divine love of which we have spoken, for one reason, because then it is
   supposed that the labour of the exercise we have just gone through has
   produced some divine devotion and feeling, since, saith the wise man,
   Better is the end of prayer than the beginning': and for another
   reason, that, after the work of Prayer and Meditation, it is well that
   one should give his mind a little rest, and allow it to repose in the
   arms of Contemplation. At this point, then, we should put away all
   other thoughts that may present themselves, and, quieting the mind and
   stilling the memory, fix all upon our Lord; and remembering that we are
   then in His presence, no longer dwell upon the details of divine
   things. Ibidem p. 121. And not only at the end of the exercise but in
   the midst of it, and at whatever part of it, this spiritual swoon
   should come upon us, when the intellect is laid to sleep, we should
   make this pause, and enjoy the blessing bestowed; and then, when we
   have finished the digestion of it, turn to the matter we have in hand,
   as the gardener does, when he waters his garden-bed; who, after giving
   it (p. 122) a sufficiency of water, holds back the stream, and lets it
   soak and spread itself through the depths of the earth; and then when
   this hath somewhat dried up, he turns down upon it again the flow of
   water that it may receive still more, and be well irrigated.'

   [142] 'The whole of the time in which our Lord communicates the simple,
   loving general attention of which I made mention before, or when the
   soul, assisted by grace, is established in that state, we must contrive
   to keep the understanding in repose, undisturbed by the intrusion of
   forms, figures, or particular knowledge, unless it were slightly and
   for an instant, and that with sweetness of love, to enkindle our souls
   the more. At other times, however, in all our acts of devotion and good
   works, we must make use of good recollections and meditations, so that
   we may feel an increase of profit and devotion; most especially
   applying ourselves to the life, passion, and death of Jesus Christ, our
   Lord, that our life and conduct may be an imitation of His.' (St. John

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   BEGINS TO TREAT OF THE UNION OF THE SOUL WITH GOD IN PRAYER. HOW TO BE
   SURE THAT WE ARE NOT DECEIVED IN THIS MATTER.

   1. Graces of the fifth mansions. 2. Contemplation to be striven for. 3.
   Physical effects of the Prayer of union. 4. Amazement of the intellect.
   5. The Prayer of union and of quiet contrasted. 6. Divine and earthly
   union. 7. Competent directors in these matters. 8. Proof of union. 9.
   Assurance left in the soul. 10. Divine union beyond our Power to
   obtain.

   1. OH, my sisters, how shall I describe the riches, treasures, and joys
   contained in the fifth mansions! Would it not be better to say nothing
   about them? They are impossible to depict, nor can the mind conceive,
   nor any comparisons portray them, all earthly things being too vile to
   serve the purpose. Send me, O my Lord, light from heaven that I may
   give some to these Thy servants, some of whom by Thy good will often
   enjoy these delights, lest the devil in the guise of an angel of light
   should deceive those whose only desire is to please Thee.

   2. I said some,' but in reality there are very few [154]   who never
   enter this mansion: some more and some less, but most of them may be
   said at least to gain admittance into these rooms. I think that certain
   graces I am about to describe are bestowed on only a few of the nuns,
   but if the rest only arrive at the portal they receive a great boon
   from God, for many are called, but few are chosen.' [155]   All we who
   wear the holy habit of the Carmelites are called to prayer and
   contemplation. This was the object of our Order, [156]   to this
   lineage we belong. Our holy Fathers of Mount Carmel sought in perfect
   solitude and utter contempt of the world for this treasure, this
   precious pearl, [157]   of which we speak, and we are their
   descendants. How little do most of us care to prepare our souls, that
   our Lord may reveal this jewel to us! Outwardly we may appear to
   practise the requisite virtues, but we have far more to do than this
   before it is possible to attain to contemplation, to gain which we
   should neglect no means, either small or great. Rouse yourselves, my
   sisters, and since some foretaste of heaven may be had on earth, beg
   our Lord to give us grace not to miss it through our own fault. Ask Him
   to show us where to find it--ask Him to give us strength of soul to dig
   until we find this hidden treasure, which lies buried within our
   hearts, as I wish to show you if it please God to enable me. I said
   strength of soul,' that you might understand that strength of body is
   not indispensable when our Lord God chooses to withhold it. He makes it
   impossible for no one to gain these riches, but is content that each
   should do his best. Blessed be so just a God!

   3. But, daughters, if you would purchase this treasure of which we are
   speaking, God would have you keep back nothing from Him, little or
   great. He will have it all; [158]   in proportion to what you know you
   have given will your reward be great or small. There is no more certain
   sign whether or not we have reached the prayer of union. Do not imagine
   that this state of prayer is, like the one preceding it, a sort of
   drowsiness (I call it 'drowsiness' because the soul seems to slumber,
   being neither quite asleep nor wholly awake). In the prayer of union
   the soul is asleep, fast asleep, as regards the world and itself: in
   fact, during the short time this state lasts it is deprived of all
   feeling whatever, being unable to think on any subject, even if it
   wished. No effort is needed here to suspend the thoughts: if the soul
   can love it knows not how, nor whom it loves, nor what it desires. In
   fact, it has died entirely to this world, to live more truly than ever
   in God. This is a delicious death, for the soul is deprived of the
   faculties it exercised while in the body: [159]   delicious because,
   (although not really the case), it seems to have left its mortal
   covering to abide more entirely in God. So completely does this take
   place, that I know not whether the body retains sufficient life to
   continue breathing; on consideration, I believe it does not; at any
   rate, if it still breathes, it does so unconsciously.

   4. The mind entirely concentrates itself on trying to understand what
   is happening, which is beyond its power; it is so astounded that, if
   consciousness is not completely lost, at least no movement is possible:
   the person may be compared to one who falls into a dead faint with
   dismay. [160]

   5. Oh, mighty secrets of God! Never should I weary of trying to explain
   them if I thought it possible to succeed! I would write a thousand
   foolish things that one might be to the point, if only it might make us
   praise God more. I said this prayer produced no drowsiness in the mind;
   on the other hand, in the prayer (of quiet) described in the last
   mansion, until the soul has gained much experience it doubts what
   really happened to it. Was it nothing but fancy, or was it a sleep? Did
   it come from God or from the devil, disguised as an angel of light?'
   The mind feels a thousand misgivings, and well for it that it should,
   because, at I said, nature may sometimes deceive us in this case.
   Although there is little chance of the poisonous reptiles entering
   here, yet agile little lizards will try to slip in, though they can do
   no harm, especially if they remain unnoticed. These, as I said, are
   trivial fancies of the imagination, which are often very troublesome.
   However active these small lizards may be, they cannot enter the fifth
   mansion, for neither the imagination, the understanding, nor the memory
   has power to hinder the graces bestowed on it. 6. I dare venture to
   assert that, if this is genuine union with God, the devil cannot
   interfere nor do any harm, for His Majesty is so joined and united with
   the essence of the soul, that the evil one dare not approach, nor can
   he even understand this mystery. This is certain, for it is said that
   the devil does not know our thoughts, much less can he penetrate a
   secret so profound that God does not reveal it even to us. [161]   Oh,
   blessed state, in which this cursed one cannot injure us! What riches
   we receive while God so works in us that neither we ourselves nor any
   one else can impede Him! What will He not bestow, Who is so eager to
   give, and Who can give us all He desires! You may perhaps have been
   puzzled at my saying if this is genuine union with God,' as if there
   might be other unions. There are indeed--not with God, but with
   vanities--when the devil transports the soul passionately addicted to
   them, but the union differs from that which is divine and the mind
   misses the delight and satisfaction, peace and happiness of divine
   union. These heavenly consolations are above all earthly joys,
   pleasure, and satisfaction. As great a difference exists between their
   origin and that of worldly pleasures as between their opposite effects,
   as you know by experience.

   7. I said somewhere [162]   that the one seems only to touch the
   surface of the body, while the other penetrates to the very marrow: I
   believe this is correct, and I cannot express myself better. I fancy
   that you are not yet satisfied on this question, but are afraid of
   deception, for spiritual matters are very hard to explain. Enough,
   however, has been said for those who have received this grace, as the
   difference between divine union and any other is very striking.
   However, I will give you a clear proof which cannot mislead you, nor
   leave any doubt whether the favour comes from God or no. His Majesty
   brought it back to my memory this very day; it appears to me to be an
   unmistakable sign. In difficult questions, although I think I
   understand them and am speaking the truth, I always say it appears to
   me'; for, in case my opinion is wrong, I am most willing to submit to
   the judgment of theologians. Although they may not have had personal
   experience in such matters, yet in some way I do not understand, God
   Who sets them to give light to His Church enables them to recognize the
   truth when it is put before them. If they are not thoughtless and
   indevout, but servants of God, they are never dismayed at His mighty
   works, knowing perfectly well that it is in His power to perform far
   greater wonders. If some of the marvels told are new to them, yet they
   have read of others of the same kind, showing the former to be
   possible. I have had great experience as to this and have also met with
   timid, half-instructed people whose ignorance has cost me very dear.
   [163]   I am convinced that those who refuse to believe that God can do
   far more than this, and that He is pleased now, as in the past, to
   communicate Himself to His creatures, shut fast their hearts against
   receiving such favours themselves. Do not imitate them, sisters: be
   convinced that it is possible for God to perform still greater wonders.
   Do not concern yourselves as to whether those who receive these graces
   are good or wicked; as I said, He knows best and it is no business of
   yours: you should serve Him with a single heart and with humility, and
   should praise Him for His works and wonders. [164]

   8. Let us now speak of the sign which proves the prayer of union to
   have been genuine. As you have seen, God then deprives the soul of all
   its senses that He may the better imprint in it true wisdom: it neither
   sees, hears, nor understands anything while this state lasts, which is
   never more than a very brief time; [165]   it appears to the soul to be
   much shorter than it really is. God visits the soul in a manner which
   prevents its doubting, on returning to itself, that it dwelt in Him and
   that He was within it, and so firmly is it convinced of this truth
   that, although years may pass before this favour recurs, the soul can
   never forget it nor doubt the fact, [166]   setting aside the effects
   left by this prayer, to which I will refer later on. The conviction
   felt by the soul is the main point.

   9. But, you may ask, how can a person who is incapable of sight and
   hearing see [167] or know these things? I do not say that she saw it at
   the time, but that she perceives it clearly afterwards, not by any
   vision but by a certitude which remains in the heart which God alone
   could give. I know of some one who was unaware of God's being in all
   things by presence, power and essence, yet was firmly convinced of it
   by a divine favour of this sort. [168] She asked an ill-instructed
   priest of the kind I mentioned to tell her in what way God dwelt within
   us: he was as ignorant on the subject as she had been before our Lord
   revealed to her the truth, and answered that the Almighty was only
   present in us by grace. [169]   Yet so strong was her conviction of the
   truth learnt during her prayer that she did not believe him and
   questioned other spiritual persons on the subject, who confirmed her in
   the true doctrine, much to her joy. Do not mistake and imagine that
   this certainty of God's having visited the soul concerns any corporal
   presence such as that of our Lord Jesus Christ Who dwells in the
   Blessed Sacrament, although we do not see Him: it relates solely to the
   Divinity. If we did not see it, how can we feel so sure of it? That I
   do not know: it is the work of the Almighty and I am certain that what
   I say is the fact. I maintain that a soul which does not feel this
   assurance has not been united to God entirely, but only by one of its
   powers, or has received one of the many other favours God is accustomed
   to bestow on men. In all such matters we must not seek to know how
   things happened: our understanding could not grasp them, therefore why
   trouble ourselves on the subject? It is enough to know that it is He,
   the all-powerful God, Who has performed the work. We can do nothing on
   our own part to gain this favour; it comes from God alone; therefore
   let us not strive to understand it.

   10. Concerning my words: We can do nothing on our own part,' I was
   struck by the words of the Bride in the Canticles, which you will
   remember to have heard: 'The King brought me into the cellar of wine,'
   [170]   (or placed me' I think she says): she does not say she went of
   her own accord, although telling us how she wandered up and down
   seeking her Beloved. [171]   I think the prayer of union is the cellar'
   in which our Lord places us when and how He chooses, but we cannot
   enter it through any effort of our own. His Majesty alone can bring us
   there and come into the centre of our souls. In order to declare His
   wondrous works more clearly, He will leave us no share in them except
   complete conformity of our wills to His and abandonment of all things:
   He does not require the faculties or senses to open the door to Him;
   they are all asleep. He enters the innermost depths of our souls
   without a door, as He entered the room where the disciples sat, saying
   Pax vobis,' [172]   and as He emerged from the sepulchre without
   removing the stone that closed the entrance. You will see farther on,
   in the seventh mansion, far better than here, how God makes the soul
   enjoy His presence in its very centre. O daughters, what wonders shall
   we see, if we keep ever before our eyes our own baseness and frailty
   and recognize how unworthy we are to be the handmaids of so great a
   Lord, Whose marvels are beyond our comprehension! May He be for ever
   praised! Amen.

   [168] 'There are three ways in which God is present in the soul. The

   wretched and sinful souls as well, and also in all created things; for
   it is by this presence that He gives life and being, and were it
   withdrawn at once all things would return to nothing. This presence
   never fails in the soul. The second is His presence by grace, whereby
   He dwells in the soul, pleased and satisfied with it. This presence is
   not in all souls; for those who fall into mortal sin lose it, and no
   soul can know in a natural way whether it has it or not. The third is
   His presence by spiritual affection. God is wont to show His presence
   in many devout souls in divers ways, in refreshment, joy and gladness.'
   (St. John of the Cross, Spiritual Canticle, stanza xi. 2.) 'In every
   soul, even that of the greatest sinner in the world, God dwells and is
   substantially present. This way of union or presence of God, in the
   order of nature, subsists between Him and all His creatures; by this He
   preserves them in being, and if He withdraws it they immediately perish
   and cease to be. And so, when I speak of the union of the soul with
   God, I do not mean this substantial presence which is in every
   creature, but that union and transformation of the soul in God by love
   which is only then accomplished when there subsists the likeness which
   love begets.' (St. John of the Cross, Ascent, bk. ii. ch. v. 3.) Fr.

  CHAPTER II.

   CONTINUES THE SAME SUBJECT: EXPLAINS THE PRAYER OF UNION BY A DELICATE
   COMPARISON AND SPEAKS OF THE EFFECTS IT LEAVES UPON THE SOUL. THIS
   CHAPTER SHOULD RECEIVE GREAT ATTENTION.

   1. The soul compared to a butterfly. 2. The grandeurs of creation. 3.
   Symbol of the soul and the silkworm. 4. Preparation of the soul for
   God's indwelling. 5. Mystic death of the silkworm. 6. Effects of divine
   union. 7. Increase of fervour and detachment. 8. Trials succeeding the
   prayer of union. 9. Longing for death and zeal for God's honour. 10.
   This zeal supernatural. 11. God alone works this grace. 12. The same
   zeal as that felt by our Lord on earth. 13. Christ's keenest suffering.

   1. You may imagine that there is no more left to be described of the
   contents of this mansion, but a great deal remains to be told, for as I
   said, it contains favours of various degrees. I think there is nothing
   to add about the prayer of union, but when the soul on which God
   bestows this grace disposes itself for their reception, I could tell
   you much about the marvels our Lord works in it. I will describe some
   of them in my own way, also the state in which they leave the soul, and
   will use a suitable comparison to elucidate the matter, explaining that
   though we can take no active part in this work of God within us, [173]
     yet we may do much to prepare ourselves to receive this grace. You
   have heard how wonderfully silk is made--in a way such as God alone
   could plan--how it all comes from an egg resembling a tiny pepper-corn.
   Not having seen it myself, I only know of it by hearsay, so if the
   facts are inaccurate the fault will not be mine. When, in the warm
   weather, the mulberry trees come into leaf, the little egg which was
   lifeless before its food was ready, begins to live. The caterpillar
   nourishes itself upon the mulberry leaves until, when it has grown
   large, people place near it small twigs upon which, of its own accord,
   it spins silk from its tiny mouth until it has made a narrow little
   cocoon in which it buries itself. Then this large and ugly worm leaves
   the cocoon as a lovely little white butterfly.

   2. If we had not seen this but had only heard of it as an old legend,
   who could believe it? Could we persuade ourselves that insects so
   utterly without the use of reason as a silkworm or a bee would work
   with such industry and skill in our service that the poor little
   silkworm loses its life over the task? This would suffice for a short
   meditation, sisters, without my adding more, for you may learn from it
   the wonders and the wisdom of God. How if we knew the properties of all
   things? It is most profitable to ponder over the grandeurs of creation
   and to exult in being the brides of such a wise and mighty King.

   3. Let us return to our subject. The silkworm symbolizes the soul which
   begins to live when, kindled by the Holy Spirit, it commences using the
   ordinary aids given by God to all, and applies the remedies left by Him
   in His Church, such as regular confession, religious hooks, and
   sermons; these are the cure for a soul dead in its negligence and sins
   and liable to fall into temptation. Then it comes to life and continues
   nourishing itself on this food and on devout meditation until it has
   attained full vigour, which is the essential point, for I attach no
   importance to the rest. When the silkworm is full-grown as I told you
   in the first part of this chapter, it begins to spin silk and to build
   the house wherein it must die. By this house, when speaking of the
   soul, I mean Christ. I think I read or heard somewhere, either that our
   life is hid in Christ, or in God (which means the same thing) or that
   Christ is our life. [174]   It makes little difference to my meaning
   which of these quotations is correct.

   4. This shows, my daughters, how much, by God's grace, we can do, by
   preparing this home for ourselves, towards making Him our
   dwelling-place as He is in the prayer of union. You will suppose that I
   mean we can take away from or add something to God when I say that He
   is our home, and that we can make this home and dwell in it by our own
   power. Indeed we can: though we can neither deprive God of anything nor
   add aught to Him, yet we can take away from and add to ourselves, like
   the silkworms. The little we can do will hardly have been accomplished
   when this insignificant work of ours, which amounts to nothing at all,
   will be united by God to His greatness and thus enhanced with such
   immense value that our Lord Himself will be the reward of our toil.
   Although He has had the greatest share in it, He will join our trifling
   pains to the bitter sufferings He endured for us and make them one.

   5. Forward then, my daughters! hasten over your work and build the
   little cocoon. Let us renounce self-love and self-will, [175]   care
   for nothing earthly, do penance, pray, mortify ourselves, be obedient,
   and perform all the other good works of which you know. Act up to your
   light; you have been taught your duties. Die! die as the silkworm does
   when it has fulfilled the office of its creation, and you will see God
   and be immersed in His greatness, as the little silkworm is enveloped
   in its cocoon. Understand that when I say you will see God,' I mean in
   the manner described, in which He manifests Himself in this kind of
   union.

   6. Now let us see what becomes of the silkworm,' for all I have been
   saying leads to this. As soon as, by means of this prayer, the soul has
   become entirely dead to the world, it comes forth like a lovely little
   white butterfly! [176]   Oh, how great God is! How beautiful is the
   soul after having been immersed in God's grandeur and united closely to
   Him for but a short time! Indeed, I do not think it is ever as long as
   half an hour. [177]   Truly, the spirit does not recognize itself,
   being as different from what it was as is the white butterfly from the
   repulsive caterpillar. It does not know how it can have merited so
   great a good, or rather, whence this grace came [178]   which it well
   knows it merits not. The soul desires to praise our Lord God and longs
   to sacrifice itself and die a thousand deaths for Him. It feels an
   unconquerable desire for great crosses and would like to perform the
   most severe penances; it sighs for solitude and would have all men know
   God, while it is bitterly grieved at seeing them offend Him. These
   matters will be described more fully in the next mansion; there they
   are of the same nature, yet in a more advanced state the effects are
   far stronger, because, as I told you, if; after the soul has received
   these favours, it strives to make still farther progress, it will
   experience great things. Oh, to see the restlessness of this charming
   little butterfly, although never in its life has it been more tranquil
   and at peace! May God be praised! It knows not where to stay nor take
   its rest; everything on earth disgusts it after what it has
   experienced, particularly when God has often given it this wine which
   leaves fresh graces behind it at every draught.

   7. It despises the work it did while yet a caterpillar--the slow
   weaving of its cocoon thread by thread--its wings have grown and it can
   fly; could it be content to crawl? All that it can do for God seems
   nothing to the soul compared with its desire. It no longer wonders at
   what the saints bore for Him, knowing by experience how our Lord aids
   and transforms the soul until it no longer seems the same in character
   and appearance. Formerly it feared penance, now it is strong: it wanted
   courage to forsake relations, friends, or possessions: neither its
   actions, its resolutions, nor separation from those it loved could
   detach the soul, but rather seemed to increase its fondness. Now it
   finds even their rightful claims a burden, [179]   fearing contact with
   them lest it should offend God. It wearies of everything, realizing
   that no true rest can be found in creatures.

   8. I seem to have enlarged on this subject, yet far more might be said
   about it; those who have received this favour will think I have treated
   it too briefly. No wonder this pretty butterfly, estranged from earthly
   things, seeks repose elsewhere. Where can the poor little creature go?
   It cannot return to whence it came, for as I told you, that is not in
   the soul's power, do what it will, but depends upon God's pleasure.
   Alas, what fresh trials begin to afflict the mind! Who would expect
   this after such a sublime grace? [180]   In fact in one way or another
   we must carry the cross all our lives. If people told me that ever
   since attaining to the prayer of union they had enjoyed constant peace
   and consolation, I should reply that they could never have reached that
   state, but that, at the most, if they had arrived as far as the last
   mansion, their emotion must have been some spiritual satisfaction
   joined to physical debility. It might even have been a false sweetness
   caused by the devil, who gives peace for a time only to wage far
   fiercer war later on. I do not mean that those who reach this stage
   possess no peace; they do so in a very high degree, for their sorrows,
   though extremely severe, are so beneficial and proceed from so good a
   source as to procure both peace and happiness.

   9. Discontent with this world gives such a painful longing to quit it
   that, if the heart finds comfort, it is solely from the thought that
   God wishes it to remain here in banishment. Even this is not enough to
   reconcile it to fate, for after all the gifts received, it is not yet
   so entirely surrendered to the will of God as it afterwards becomes.
   Here, although conformed to His will, the soul feels an unconquerable
   reluctance to submit, for our Lord has not given it higher grace.
   During prayer this grief breaks forth in floods of tears, probably from
   the great pain felt at seeing God offended and at thinking how many
   souls, both heretics and heathens, are lost eternally, and keenest
   grief of all, Christians also! The soul realizes the greatness of God's
   mercy and knows that however wicked men are, they may still repent and
   be saved; yet it fears that many precipitate themselves into hell.

   10. Oh, infinite greatness of God! A few years ago--indeed, perhaps but
   a few days--this soul thought of nothing but itself. Who has made it
   feel such tormenting cares? If we tried for many years to obtain such
   sorrow by means of meditation, we could not succeed.

   11. God help me! If for long days and years I considered how great a
   wrong it is that God should be offended, and that lost souls are His
   children and my brethren; if I pondered over the dangers of this world
   and how blessed it would be to leave this wretched life, would not that
   suffice? No, daughters, the pain would not be the same. for this, by
   the help of God, we can obtain by such meditation; but it does not seem
   to penetrate the very depths of our being like the other which appears
   to cut the soul to pieces and grind it to powder through no
   action--even sometimes with no wish--of its own. What is this sorrow,
   then? Whence does it come? I will tell you. Have you not heard (I
   quoted the words to you just now, but did not apply to them this
   meaning) [181]   how the Bride says that God brought her into the
   cellar of wine and set in order charity in her'? [182]   This is what
   happens here. The soul has so entirely yielded itself into His hands
   and is so subdued by love for Him that it knows or cares for nothing
   but that God should dispose of it according to His will. I believe that
   He only bestows this grace on those He takes entirely for His own. He
   desires that, without knowing how, the spirit should come forth stamped
   with His seal for indeed it does no more than does the wax when
   impressed with the signet. It does not mould itself but need only be in
   a fit condition--soft and pliable; even then it does not soften itself
   but must merely remain still and submit to the impression.

   12. How good Thou art, O God! All is done for us by Thee, Who dost but
   ask us to give our wills to Thee that we may be plastic as wax in Thy
   hands. You see, sisters, what God does to this soul so that it may know
   that it is His. He gives it something of His own--that which His Son
   possessed when living on earth--He could bestow on greater gift on us.
   Who could ever have longed more eagerly to leave this life than did
   Christ? As He said at the Last Supper: With desire have I desired'
   [183]   this. O Lord! does not that bitter death Thou art to undergo
   present itself before Thine eyes in all its pain and horror? 'No, for
   My ardent love and My desire to save souls are immeasurably stronger
   than the torments. This deeper sorrow I have suffered and still suffer
   while living here on earth, makes other pain seem as nothing in
   comparison.'

   13. I have often meditated on this and I know that the torture a friend
   of mine [184]   has felt, and still feels, at seeing our Lord sinned
   against is so unbearable that she would far rather die than continue in
   such anguish. Then I thought that if a soul whose charity is so weak
   compared to that of Christ--indeed, in comparison with His this charity
   might be said not to exist--experiences this insufferable grief, what
   must have been the feelings of our Lord Jesus Christ and what must His
   life have been? for all things were present before His eyes and He was
   the constant witness of the great offences committed against His
   Father. I believe without doubt that this pained Him far more than His
   most sacred Passion. There, at least, He found the end of all His
   trials, while His agony was allayed by the consolation of gaining our
   salvation through His death and of proving how He loved His Father by
   suffering for Him. Thus, people who, urged by fervent love, perform
   great penances hardly feel them but want to do still more and count
   even that as little. What, then, must His Majesty have felt at thus
   publicly manifesting His perfect obedience to His Father and His love
   for His brethren? What joy to suffer in doing God's will! Yet I think
   the constant sight of the many sins committed against God and of the
   numberless souls on their way to hell must have caused Him such anguish
   that, had He not been more than man, one day of such torment would have
   destroyed not only His life but many more lives, had they been His.

  CHAPTER III.

   THIS CHAPTER CONTINUES THE SAME SUBJECT AND SPEAKS OF ANOTHER KIND OF
   UNION WHICH THE SOUL CAN OBTAIN WITH THE HELP OF GOD. THE IMPORTANCE OF
   LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR IN THIS MATTER. THIS IS VERY USEFUL TO READ.

   1. Zeal for souls left by divine union. 2. The soul may fall from such
   a state. 3. How divine union may always be obtained. 4. Union with the
   will of God the basis of all supernatural union. 5. Advantage of union
   gained by self-mortification. 6. Defects which hinder this union. 7.
   Divine union obtained by perfect love of God and our neighbour. 8. Love
   for God and our neighbour are proportionate. 9. Real and imaginary
   virtues. 10. Illusionary good resolutions. 11. Works, not feelings,
   procure union. 12. Fraternal charity will certainly gain this union.

   1. LET us now return to our little dove and see what graces God gives
   it in this state. This implies that the soul endeavours to advance in
   the service of our Lord and in self-knowledge. If it receives the grace
   of union and then does no more, thinking itself safe, and so leads a
   careless life, wandering off the road to heaven (that is, the keeping
   of the commandments) it will share the fate of the butterfly that comes
   from the silkworm, which lays some eggs that produce more of its kind
   and then dies for ever. I say it leaves some eggs, for I believe God
   will not allow so great a favour to be lost but that if the recipient
   does not profit by it, others will. For while it keeps to the right
   path, this soul, with its ardent desires and great virtues, helps
   others and kindles their fervour with its own. Yet even after having
   lost this it may still long to benefit others and delight to make known
   the mercies shown by God to those who love and serve Him. [185]

   2. I knew a person to whom this happened. Although greatly erring, she
   longed that others should profit by the favours God had bestowed on her
   and taught the way of prayer to people ignorant of it, thus helping
   them immensely. God afterwards bestowed fresh light upon her; indeed
   the prayer of union had not hitherto produced the above effects in her.
   How many people there must be to whom our Lord communicates Himself,
   who, like Judas, are called to the Apostleship and made kings by Him,
   as was Saul, yet who afterwards lose everything by their own fault! We
   should learn from this, sisters, that if we would merit fresh favours
   and avoid losing those we already possess, our only safety lies in
   obedience and in following the law of God. This I say, both to those
   who have received these graces and to those who have not. [186]

   3. In spite of all I have written, there still seems some difficulty in
   understanding this mansion. The advantage of entering is so great, that
   it is well that none should despair of doing so because God does not
   give them the supernatural gifts described above. With the help of
   divine grace true union can always be attained by forcing ourselves to
   renounce our own will and by following the will of God in all things.
   [187]

   4. Oh, how many of us affirm that we do this, and believe we seek
   nothing else--indeed we would die for the truth of what we say! If this
   be the case I can only declare, as I fancy I did before, and I shall
   again and again, that we have already obtained this grace from God.
   Therefore we need not wish for that other delightful union described
   above, for its chief value lies in the resignation of our will to that
   of God without which it could not be reached. [188]   Oh, how desirable
   is this union! The happy soul which has attained it will live in this
   world and in the next without care of any sort. No earthly events can
   trouble it, unless it should see itself in danger of losing God or
   should witness any offence offered Him. Neither sickness, poverty, nor
   the loss of any one by death affect it, except that of persons useful
   to the Church of God, for the soul realizes thoroughly that God's
   disposal is wiser than its own desires.

   5. You must know that there are different kinds of sorrow: there are
   both griefs and joys rising from an impulse of nature or from a charity
   which makes us pity our neighbour, like that felt by our Saviour when
   He raised Lazarus from the dead. [189]   These feelings do not destroy
   union with the will of God nor do they disturb the soul by a restless,
   turbulent, and lasting passion. They soon pass away, for as I said of
   sweetness in prayer, [190]   they do not affect the depths of the soul
   but only its senses and faculties. They are found in the former
   mansions, but do not enter the last of all. Is it necessary, in order
   to attain to this kind of divine union, for the powers of the soul to
   be suspended? No; God has many ways of enriching the soul and bringing
   it to these mansions besides what might be called a short cut.' But, be
   sure of this, my daughters: in any case the silkworm must die and it
   will cost you more in this way. In the former manner this death is
   facilitated by finding ourselves introduced into a new life; here, on
   the contrary, we must give ourselves the death-blow. I own that the
   work will be much harder, but then it will be of higher value so that
   your reward will be greater if you come forth victorious; [191]   yet
   there is no doubt it is possible for you to attain this true union with
   the will of God.

   6. This is the union I have longed for all my life and that I beg our
   Lord to grant me; it is the most certain and the safest. But alas, how
   few of us ever obtain it! Those who are careful not to offend God, and
   who enter the religious state, think there is nothing more to do. How
   many maggots remain in hiding until, like the worm which gnawed at
   Jonas's ivy, [192]   they have destroyed our virtues. These pests are
   such evils as self-love, self-esteem, rash judgment of others even in
   small matters, and a want of charity in not loving our neighbour quite
   as much as ourselves. Although perforce we satisfy our obligations
   sufficiently to avoid sin, yet we fall far short of what must be done
   in order to obtain perfect union with the will of God.

   7. What do you think, daughters, is His will? That we may become quite
   perfect and so be made one with Him and with His Father as He prayed we
   might be. [193]   Observe, then, what is wanting in us to obtain this.
   I assure you it is most painful for me to write on this subject, for I
   see how far I am, through my own fault, from having attained
   perfection. There is no need for us to receive special consolations
   from God in order to arrive at conformity with His will; He has done
   enough in giving us His Son to teach the way. This does not mean that
   we must so submit to the will of God as not to sorrow at such troubles
   as the death of a father or brother, or that we must bear crosses and
   sickness with joy. [194]   This is well, but it sometimes comes from
   common sense which, as we cannot help ourselves, makes a virtue of
   necessity. How often the great wisdom of the heathen philosophers led
   them to act thus in trials of this kind! Our Lord asks but two things
   of us: love, for Him and for our neighbour: these are what we must
   strive to obtain. If we practise both these virtues perfectly we shall
   be doing His will and so shall be united to Him. But, as I said, we are
   very far from obeying and serving our great Master perfectly in these
   two matters: may His Majesty give us the grace to merit union with Him;
   it is in our power to gain it if we will.

   8. I think the most certain sign that we keep these two commandments is
   that we have a genuine love for others. We cannot know whether we love
   God although there may be strong reasons for thinking so, but there can
   be no doubt about whether we love our neighbour or no. [195]   Be sure
   that in proportion as you advance in fraternal charity, you are
   increasing in your love of God, [196]   for His Majesty bears so tender
   an affection for us that I cannot doubt He will repay our love for
   others by augmenting, in a thousand different ways, that which we bear
   for Him. We should watch most carefully over ourselves in this matter,
   for if we are faultless on this point we have done all. I believe human
   nature is so evil that we could not feel a perfect charity for our
   neighbour unless it were rooted in the love of God.

   9. In this most important matter, sisters, we should be most vigilant
   in little things, taking no notice of the great works we plan during
   prayer which we imagine that we would perform for other people, even
   perhaps for the sake of saving a single soul. If our actions afterwards
   belie these grand schemes, there is no reason to imagine that we should
   do anything of the sort. I say the same of humility and the other
   virtues. The devil's wiles are many; he would turn hell upside down a
   thousand times to make us think ourselves better than we are. He has
   good reason for it, for such fancies are most injurious; sham virtues
   springing from this root are always accompanied by a vainglory never
   found in those of divine origin, which are free from pride.

   10. It is amusing to see souls who, while they are at prayer, fancy
   they are willing to be despised and publicly insulted for the love of
   God, yet afterwards do all they can to hide their small defects; if any
   one unjustly accuses them of a fault, God deliver us from their
   outcries! Let those who cannot bear such things take no notice of the
   splendid plans they made when alone, which could have been no genuine
   determination of the will but only some trick of the imagination, or
   the results would have been very different. The devil assaults and
   deceives people in this way, often doing great harm to women and others
   too ignorant to understand the difference between the powers of the
   soul and the imagination, and a thousand other matters of the sort. O
   sisters! how easy it is to know which of you have attained to a sincere
   love of your neighbour, and which of you are far from it. If you knew
   the importance of this virtue, your only care would be to gain it.

   11. When I see people very anxious to know what sort of prayer they
   practise, covering their faces and afraid to move or think lest they
   should lose any slight tenderness and devotion they feel, I know how
   little they understand how to attain union with God since they think it
   consists in such things as these. No, sisters, no; our Lord expects
   works from us. If you see a sick sister whom you can relieve, [197]
   never fear losing your devotion; compassionate her; if she is in pain,
   feel for it as if it were your own and, when there is need, fast so
   that she may eat, not so much for her sake as because you know your
   Lord asks it of you. This is the true union of our will with the will
   of God. If some one else is well spoken of, be more pleased than if it
   were yourself; this is easy enough, for if you were really humble it
   would vex you to be praised. It is a great good to rejoice at your
   sister's virtues being known and to feel as sorry for the fault you see
   in her as if it were yours, hiding it from the sight of others.

   12. I have often spoken on this subject elsewhere, [198]   because, my
   sisters, if we fail in this I know that all is lost: please God this
   may never be our case. If you possess fraternal charity, I assure you
   that you will certainly obtain the union I have described. If you are
   conscious that you are wanting in this charity, although you may feel
   devotion and sweetness and a short absorption in the prayer of quiet
   (which makes you think you have attained to union with God), believe me
   you have not yet reached it. Beg our Lord to grant you perfect love for
   your neighbour, and leave the rest to Him. He will give you more than
   you know how to desire if you constrain yourselves and strive with all
   your power to gain it, forcing your will as far as possible to comply
   in all things with your sisters' wishes although you may sometimes
   forfeit your own rights by so doing. Forget your self-interests for
   theirs, how ever much nature may rebel; when opportunity occurs take
   some burden upon yourself to ease your neighbour of it. Do not fancy it
   will cost you nothing and that you will find it all done for you: think
   what the love He bore for us cost our Spouse, Who to free us from
   death, Himself suffered the most painful death of all--the death of the
   Cross.

  CHAPTER IV.

   FURTHER EXPLANATION OF THE SAME SUBJECT; EXPLAINS THIS PRAYER. THE
   IMPORTANCE OF BEING ON ONE'S GUARD, AS THE DEVIL EAGERLY DESIRES TO
   TURN SOULS BACK FROM THE RIGHT PATH.

   1. The spiritual espousals. 2. The prayer of union resembles a
   betrothal. 3. Before the spiritual nuptials temptations are dangerous.
   4. The great good done by souls faithful to these graces. 5. Religious
   subject to the devil's deceptions. 6. Satan's strata-gems. 7. Why they
   are permitted. 8. Prayer and watchfulness our safeguards. 9. God's
   watchfulness over such souls. 10. Progress in virtue. 11.
   Insignificance of our actions compared with their reward. 12. St.
   Teresa's motives for writing on prayer.

   1. You appear anxious to know what has become of the little dove and
   where she obtains rest, since obviously she can find it neither in
   spiritual consolations nor in earthly pleasures but takes a higher
   flight. I cannot tell you until we come to the last mansion: God grant
   I may remember or have leisure to write it. It is nearly five months
   since I began this work, and as my head is too weak to read it again,
   no doubt it will be very disconnected and full of repetitions: however,
   as it is only for my sisters, that will matter little. Yet I should
   like to express myself more fully about the prayer of union and will
   make use, to the best of my scanty wits, of a comparison. Later on we
   will speak of the little butterfly, which is never still, for it can
   find no true repose, yet always fertile, doing good both to itself and
   others. [199]   You have often heard that God spiritually espouses
   souls: may He be praised for His mercy in thus humbling Himself so
   utterly. Though but a homely comparison, yet I can find nothing better
   to express my meaning than the Sacrament of Matrimony although the two
   things are very different. In divine union everything is spiritual and
   far removed from anything corporal, all the joys our Lord gives and the
   mutual delight felt in it being celestial and very unlike human
   marriage, which it excels a thousand times. Here all is love united to
   love; its operations are more pure, refined, and sweet than can be
   described, though our Lord knows how to make the soul sensible of them.

   2. I think this union does not attain as far as the spiritual espousals
   but resembles the preliminaries that take place when two people are
   contemplating a betrothal. Their suitability and willingness for the
   alliance are first discussed; then they may be allowed to see one
   another sometimes so as to come to a decision. Thus it is in the
   spiritual espousals: when the preliminary agreement has been made and
   the soul thoroughly understands what great advantages she will gain,
   having resolved to fulfil the will of her Spouse in all things and to
   do all she can to please Him, His Majesty Who knows well whether this
   is so in reality, wishes in return to gratify His bride. He therefore
   bestows this favour upon her, visits her and draws her into His
   presence, as He wishes her to know Him better. We might compare the
   prayer of union to a visit, for it lasts but a very little while. [200]
     There is no longer any question of deliberation, but the soul in a
   secret manner sees to what a Bridegroom it is betrothed; the senses and
   faculties could not, in a thousand years, gain the knowledge thus
   imparted in a very short time. The Spouse, being Who He is, leaves the
   soul far more deserving of completing the espousals, as we may call
   them; the enamoured soul in its love for Him makes every effort to
   prevent their being frustrated. Should it grow neglectful and set its
   affections on anything except our Lord, it will forfeit everything:
   this loss is as great as are the favours the soul has continually
   received, which are precious beyond description. [201]

   3. O Christian souls! you whom God has brought thus far! I implore you
   for His dear sake not to grow careless, but to avoid all occasions of
   sin; you are not strong enough yet to undergo temptation, as you will
   be after the espousals which take place in the next mansion. Here the
   betrothed are, as they say, only acquainted by sight, [202]   and the
   devil will spare no pains to oppose and prevent their nuptials.
   Afterwards, when he sees the Bride is wholly given to her Bridegroom,
   he is afraid to interfere, having learnt by experience that if he
   molests her, while he loses much, she will gain greatly in merit.

   4. I can assure you, my daughters, [203]   that I have known people far
   advanced in the spiritual life who had reached this state of prayer yet
   whom the devil reclaimed by his subtlety and wiles: as I have often
   said, all hell leagues together against such souls because the loss of
   one of them entails the perdition of many more, as Satan is well aware.
   If we considered how many men God draws to Himself by means of one, we
   should praise Him fervently. Think of the multitudes converted by the
   martyrs or by one young maiden like St. Ursula! Again, of how many
   victims the evil one was deprived by St. Dominic, St. Francis, and
   other founders of religious orders. How many more he loses, even now,
   through Father Ignatius [Loyola], who founded the Company [of Jesus]!
   As we read their lives, we learn that they received such graces from
   God. How was this great good done except by their efforts not to
   forfeit, through any fault of theirs, these divine espousals? Oh, my
   daughters, how willing our Lord is to grant us the same graces! In
   fact, there is even more urgent need now for persons to prepare for
   such favours, since there are fewer who care for His honour. We love
   ourselves too much and are too prudent to give up any of our rights.
   What a deception! May God in His mercy give us light, lest we sink into
   such darkness.

   5. You may question or be in doubt on two points. Firstly: if the soul
   is entirely united with the will of God, as I have stated, how can it
   be deceived, since it ever seeks to follow His pleasure? Secondly, how
   can the devil enter and work such havoc as to destroy your soul while
   you are so utterly withdrawn from the world and constantly frequent the
   Sacraments? [204]   At the same time you enjoy the society of angels
   (as we might call them) and by the mercy of God you desire nothing but
   to serve and please Him in all things? [205]   It is not surprising
   that people in the world should run such risks. I admit you have the
   right to say this, for God has shown us signal mercy; but, as I said
   above, knowing as I do that Judas was amongst the Apostles and that he
   held constant intercourse with God Himself, to Whose words he listened,
   I learn that the state of religion does not make us safe.

   6. To your first question I reply that doubtless if such a soul is
   always faithful to the will of God, it cannot be lost; the evil one,
   however, comes with his keen subtlety and, under the pretext of good,
   leads it astray in some trivial matter and causes it to commit small
   defects which he makes it believe are harmless. Thus, little by little,
   the reason is obscured and the will is weakened while the devil fosters
   his victim's self-love, until, by degrees, he succeeds in withdrawing
   it from union with the will of God and makes it follow its own will.

   7. The answer to your first inquiry will serve for the second. No
   enclosure can be too strict for Satan to enter nor any desert too
   remote for him to visit. Besides, God may permit him to tempt the soul
   to prove its virtue; for as He intends it to enlighten others, it is
   better for it to fail in the beginning than when it might do them great
   harm.

   8. We must beg God constantly in our prayers to uphold us by His hand;
   we should keep ever in our minds the truth that if He leaves us, most
   certainly we shall fall at once into the abyss, for we must never be so
   foolish as to trust in ourselves. After this I think the greatest
   safeguard is to be very careful and to watch how we advance in virtue;
   we must notice whether we are making progress or falling back in it,
   especially as regards the love of our neighbour, the desire to be
   thought the least of all and how we perform our ordinary, everyday
   duties. If we attend to this and beg Our Lord to enlighten us, we shall
   at once perceive our gain or loss.

   9. Do not suppose that after advancing the soul to such a state God
   abandons it so easily that it is light work for the devil to regain it.
   When His Majesty sees it leaving Him, He feels the loss so keenly that
   He gives it in many a way a thousand secret warnings which reveal to it
   the hidden danger. [206]

   10. In conclusion, let us strive to make constant progress: we ought to
   feel great alarm if we do not find ourselves advancing, for without
   doubt the evil one must be planning to injure us in some way; it is
   impossible for a soul that has come to this state not to go still
   farther, for love is never idle. Therefore it is a very bad sign when
   one comes to a stand-still in virtue. She who aspires to become the
   spouse of God Himself, and has treated with His Majesty and come to
   such an understanding with Him, must not leave off and go to sleep.
   [207]

   11. To show you, my daughters, how Christ treats the souls He takes for
   His brides, I will now speak of the sixth mansions. You will then see
   how little in comparison is all that we can do or suffer in His service
   to prepare ourselves for the reception of such immense favours. Perhaps
   our Lord decreed that I should write this in order that the knowledge
   of the great reward to come, and of His infinite mercy in seeking to
   give and to manifest Himself to such worms as we are, might make us
   forget our wretched, petty, earthly pleasures and run on our way with
   eyes fixed on His grandeur, inflamed with love for Him.

   12. May He enable me to explain some of these difficult matters; if our
   Lord and the Holy Ghost do not guide my pen, I know the task will prove
   impossible. 1 beg Him to prevent my saying anything unless it will
   profit you. His Majesty knows that, as far as I can judge, I have no
   other wish but that His Name may be glorified and that we may strive to
   serve a Lord Who thus recompenses our efforts even in this world. What,
   then, will be our joy in heaven where it will be continuous, without
   the interruptions, labours, and dangers of this tempestuous sea of
   life? Were it not for the fear of losing or offending Him, we should
   wish to live until the end of the world [208]   in order to work for so
   great a God--our Lord and our Spouse. May His Majesty enable us to
   render Him some service free from the many faults we always commit,
   even in good works! Amen.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   THIS CHAPTER SHOWS HOW, WHEN GOD BESTOWS GREATER FAVOURS ON THE SOUL,
   IT SUFFERS MORE SEVERE AFFLICTIONS. SOME OF THE LATTER ARE DESCRIBED
   AND DIRECTIONS HOW TO BEAR THEM GIVEN TO THE DWELLERS IN THIS MANSION.
   THIS CHAPTER IS USEFUL FOR THOSE SUFFERING INTERIOR TRIALS.

   1. Love kindled by divine favours. 2. Our Lord excites the soul's
   longings. 3. Courage needed to reach the last mansions. 4. Trials
   accompanying divine favours. 5. Outcry raised against souls striving
   for perfection. 6. St. Teresa's personal experience of this. 7. Praise
   distasteful to an enlightened soul. 8. This changes to indifference. 9.
   Humility of such souls. 10. Their zeal for God's glory. 11. Perfect and
   final indifference to praise or blame. 12. Love of enemies. 13. Bodily
   sufferings. 14. St. Teresa's physical ills. 15. A timorous confessor.
   16. Anxiety on account of past sins. 17. Fears and aridity. 18.
   Scruples and fears raised by the devil. 19. Bewilderment of the soul.
   20. God alone relieves these troubles. 21. Human weakness. 22. Earthly
   consolations are of no avail. 23. Prayer gives no comfort at such a
   time. 24. Remedies for these interior trials. 25. Trials caused by the
   devil. 26. Other afflictions. 27. Preparatory to entering the seventh
   mansions.

   1. BY the aid of the Holy Ghost I am now about to treat of the sixth
   mansions, where the soul, wounded with love for its Spouse, sighs more
   than ever for solitude, withdrawing as far as the duties of its state
   permit from all that can interrupt it, The sight it has enjoyed of Him
   is so deeply imprinted on the spirit that its only desire is to behold
   Him again. I have already said that, [209]   even by the imagination,
   nothing is seen in this prayer that can be called sight. I speak of it
   as sight' because of the comparison I used.

   2. The soul is now determined to take no other Bridegroom than our
   Lord, but He disregards its desires for its speedy espousals, wishing
   that these longings should become still more vehement and that this
   good, which far excels all other benefits, should be purchased at some
   cost to itself. And although for so great a gain all that we must
   endure is but a poor price to pay, I assure you, daughters, that this
   pledge of what is in store for us is needed to inspire us with courage
   to bear our crosses.

   3. O My God, how many troubles both interior and exterior must one
   suffer before entering the seventh mansions! Sometimes, while pondering
   over this I fear that, were they known beforehand, human infirmity
   could scarcely bear the thought nor resolve to encounter them, however
   great might appear the gain. If, however, the soul has already reached
   the seventh mansions, it fears nothing: boldly undertaking to suffer
   all things for God, [210]   it gathers strength from its almost
   uninterrupted union with Him.

   4. I think it would be well to tell you of some of the trials certain
   to occur in this state. Possibly all souls may not be led in this way,
   but I think that those who sometimes enjoy such truly heavenly favours
   cannot be altogether free from some sort of earthly troubles.
   Therefore, although at first I did not intend to speak on this subject,
   yet afterwards I thought that it might greatly comfort a soul in this
   condition if it knew what usually happens to those on whom God bestows
   graces of this kind, for at the time they really seem to have lost
   everything.

   5. I shall not enumerate these trials in their proper order, but will
   describe them as they come to my memory, beginning with the least
   severe. This is an outcry raised against such a person by those amongst
   whom she lives, and even from others she has nothing to do with but who
   fancy that at some time in her life they recollect having seen her.
   They say she wants to pass for a saint, that she goes to extremes in
   piety to deceive the world and to depreciate people who are better
   Christians than herself without making such a parade of it. But notice
   that she does nothing except endeavour to carry out the duties of her
   state more perfectly. Persons she thought were her friends desert her,
   making the most bitter remarks of all. They take it much to heart that
   her soul is ruined--she is manifestly deluded--it is all the devil's
   work--she will share the fate of so-and-so who was lost through him,
   and she is leading virtue astray. They cry out that she is deceiving
   her confessors, and tell them so, citing examples of others who came to
   ruin in the same way and make a thousand scoffing remarks of the same
   sort. [211] 6. I know some one who feared she would be unable to find
   any priest who would hear her confession, to such a pass did things
   come; but as it is a long story, I will not stop to tell it now. The
   worst of it is, these troubles do not blow over but last all her life,
   for one person warns the other to have nothing to do with people of her
   kind. You will say that, on the other hand, some speak in her favour. O
   my daughters, how few think well of her in comparison with the many who
   hate her!

   7. Besides this, praise pains such a soul more than blame because it
   recognizes clearly that any good it possesses is the gift of God and in
   no wise its own, seeing that but a short time ago it was weak in virtue
   and involved in grave sins. [212]   Therefore commendation causes it
   intolerable suffering, at least at first, although later on, for many
   reasons, the soul is comparatively indifferent to either.

   8. The first is that experience has shown the mind that men are as
   ready to speak well as ill of others, so it attaches no more importance
   to the one than to the other. Secondly, our Lord having granted it
   greater light, it perceives that no good thing in it is its own but is
   His gift, and becomes oblivious of self, praising God for His graces as
   if they were found in a third person.

   9. The third reason is that, realizing the benefit reaped by others
   from witnessing graces given it by God, such a one thinks that it is
   for their profit He causes them to discover in her virtues that do not
   exist. 10. Fourthly, souls seeking God's honour and glory more than
   their own are cured of the temptation (which usually besets beginners)
   of thinking that human praise will cause them the injury they have seen
   it do to others. Nor do these souls care much for men's contempt if
   only, by their means, any one should praise God at least once--come
   what may afterwards.

   11. These and other reasons to a certain extent allay the great
   distress formerly given by human praise which, however, still causes
   some discomfort unless the soul has become utterly regardless of men's
   tongues. It is infinitely more grieved at being undeservedly esteemed
   by the world than by any calumny; and when at last it becomes almost
   indifferent to praise, it cares still less for censure, which even
   pleases it and sounds like harmonious music to the ears.

   12. This is perfectly true; the soul is rather strengthened than
   depressed by its trials, experience having taught it the great
   advantages derived from them. It does not think men offend God by
   persecuting it, but that He permits them to do so for its greater gain.
   [213]   So strong is this belief that such a person bears a special
   affection for these people, holding them as truer friends and greater
   benefactors than those who speak well of her. [214]

   13. Our Lord now usually sends severe bodily infirmity. This is a far
   heavier cross, especially if acute pain is felt: if this is violent, I
   think it is the hardest of earthly trials. I speak of exterior trials;
   but corporal pains of the worst kind enter the interior of our being
   also, affecting both spirit and body, so that the soul in its anguish
   knows not what to do with itself and would far rather meet death at
   once by some quick martyrdom than suffer thus. However, these paroxysms
   do not last long, for God never sends us more than we can bear and
   always gives us patience first.

   14. Now to speak of other trials and illnesses of many kinds which
   generally occur to people in this state. I knew some one who, from the
   time when, forty years ago, [215]   our Lord began to bestow on her the
   favour described, could not affirm with any truth that she had been a
   single day without pain and other kinds of suffering: I am speaking of
   physical infirmities besides heavy crosses sent her. [216]   True, she
   had led a wicked life and therefore held these troubles very light in
   comparison with the hell she had deserved. [217]   Our Lord leads those
   who have offended Him less by some other way, but I should always
   choose the way of suffering, if only for the sake of imitating our Lord
   Jesus Christ; though, in fact, it profits us in many other manners.
   Yet, oh! the rest would seem trifling in comparison could I relate the
   interior torments met with here, but they are impossible to describe.

   15. Let us first speak of the trial of meeting with so timorous and
   inexperienced a confessor that nothing seems safe to him; he dreads and
   suspects everything but the commonplace, especially in a soul in which
   he deters any imperfection, for he thinks people on whom God bestows
   such favours must be angels, which is impossible while we live in our
   bodies. [218]   He at once ascribes everything to the devil or
   melancholy. As to the latter, I am not surprised; there is so much of
   it in the world and the evil one works such harm in this way that
   confessors have the strongest reasons for anxiety and watchfulness
   about it.

   16. The poor soul, beset by the same fears, seeks its confessor as
   judge, and feels a torture and dismay at his condemnation that can only
   be realized by those who have experienced it themselves. [219]   For
   one of the severe trials of these souls, especially if they have lived
   wicked lives, is their belief that God permits them to be deceived in
   punishment for their sins. While actually receiving these graces they
   feel secure and cannot but suppose that these favours proceed from the
   Spirit of God; but this state lasts a very short time, while the
   remembrance of their misdeeds is ever before them, so that when, as is
   sure to happen, they discover any faults in themselves, these torturing
   thoughts return. [220]

   17. The soul is quieted for a time when the confessor reassures it
   although it returns later on to its former apprehensions, but when he
   augments its fears they become almost unbearable. Especially is this
   the case when such spiritual dryness ensues that the mind feels as if
   it never had thought of God nor ever will be able to do so. When men
   speak of Him, they seem to be talking of some person heard of long ago.

   18. All this is nothing without the further pain of thinking we cannot
   make our confessors understand the case and are deceiving them. [221]
   Although such a person may examine her conscience with the greatest
   care, and may know that she reveals even the first movement of her mind
   to her director, it does not help her. Her understanding being too
   obscure to discern the truth, she believes all that the imagination,
   which now has the upper hand, puts before her mind, besides crediting
   the falsehoods suggested to her by the devil, whom doubtless our Lord
   gives leave to tempt her. The evil spirit even tries to make her think
   God has rejected her. Many are the trials which assault this soul,
   causing an internal anguish so painful and so intolerable that I can
   compare it to nothing save that suffered by the lost in hell, for no
   comfort can be found in this tempest of trouble. [222]

   19. If the soul seeks for consolation from its confessor, all the
   demons appear to help him to torment it more. A confessor who dealt
   with a person suffering in this manner thought that her state must be
   very dangerous as so many things were troubling her; therefore, after
   she had recovered from her trials, he bade her tell him whenever they
   recurred: however, he found this made matters worse than ever. She lost
   all control over herself: although she had learnt to read, yet she
   could no more understand a book in the vulgar tongue than if she had
   not known the alphabet, for her mind was incapable of acting. [223]

   20. In short, there is no other remedy in such a tempest except to wait
   for the mercy of God Who, unexpectedly, by some casual word or
   unforeseen circumstance, suddenly dispels all these sorrows; then every
   cloud of trouble disappears and the mind is left full of light and far
   happier than before. [224]   It praises our Lord God like one who has
   come out victorious from a dangerous battle, for it was He Who won the
   victory. The soul is fully conscious that the conquest was not its own
   as all weapons of self-defence appeared to be in the enemies' hands.
   Thus it realizes its weakness and how little man can help himself if
   God forsake him.

   21. This truth now needs no demonstration, for past experience has
   taught the soul its utter incapacity; it realizes the nothingness of
   human nature and what miserable creatures we are. Although in a state
   of grace from which it has not fallen--for, in spite of these torments,
   it has not offended God, nor would it do so for any earthly thing [225]
   --yet so hidden is this grace, that the sufferer believes that neither
   now, nor in the past, has she ever possessed the faintest spark of love
   for God. [226]   If at any time she has done good, or if His Majesty
   ever bestowed any favours on her, they seem to have been but a dream or
   a fancy, while her sins stand clearly before her.

   22. O Jesus! how sad it is to see a soul thus forsaken, and how little,
   as I said, can any earthly comfort avail! Do not imagine, sisters, if
   you are ever brought to such a state, that rich and independent people
   have more resources than yourselves in these troubles. No, no! to offer
   such consolations would be like setting all the joys of the world
   before people condemned to death: far from mitigating, it would
   increase their torture. So with the souls I spoke of: their comfort
   must come from above--nothing earthly can help them. This great God
   wishes us to acknowledge His sovereignty and our own misery--an
   important point for those who are to advance still farther.

   23. What can the poor soul do if such a trial lasts for many days?
   Prayer makes no difference as far as comforting the heart, which no
   consolation can enter, nor can the mind even grasp the meaning of the
   words of vocal prayer: mental prayer is out of the question at such a
   time, since the faculties are unequal to it. Solitude harms the soul,
   yet society or conversation is a fresh torment. Strive as the sufferer
   may to hide it, she is so wearied and out of sorts with all around that
   she cannot but manifest her condition.

   24. How can the soul possibly tell what ails it? Its pains are
   indescribable; it is wrung with nameless anguish and spiritual
   suffering. The best remedy for these crosses (I do not mean for gaining
   deliverance from them, for I know of nothing that will do that, but for
   enabling one to bear them) is to perform external works of charity and
   to trust in the mercy of God, which never fails those who hope in Him.
   [227]   May He be for ever blessed! Amen

   25. The devils also bring about exterior trials which being more
   unusual need not be mentioned. They are far less painful, for whatever
   the demons may do, I believe they never succeed in paralysing the
   faculties or disturbing the soul in the former manner. In fact, the
   reason is able to discern that the evil spirits can do no more harm
   than God permits; and while the mind has not lost its powers, all
   sufferings are comparatively insignificant.

   26. I shall treat of other internal afflictions met with in this
   mansion when describing the different kinds of prayer and favours
   bestowed here by our Lord. Although some of these latter pains are
   harder to endure, as appears by their bodily effects, yet they do not
   deserve the name of crosses, nor have we the right to call them so.
   Indeed, they are great graces from God as the soul recognizes amidst
   its pangs, realizing how far it is from meriting such graces.

   27. This severe torture felt by souls just at the entrance of the
   seventh mansion is accompanied by many other sufferings, some of which
   I will mention: to speak of them all would be impossible, nor could I
   portray them because they come from another and far higher source than
   the rest. If I have succeeded so ill in writing of trials of a lower
   kind, much less could I treat of the others. May God assist me in all
   things, through the merits of His Son! Amen.

  CHAPTER II.

   TREATS OF SEVERAL WAYS WHEREBY OUR LORD QUICKENS THE SOUL; THERE
   APPEARS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM IN THEM ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SIGNAL FAVOURS OF
   A VERY EXALTED NATURE.

   1. Our Lord excites the love of His spouse. 2. The wound of love. 3.
   The pain it causes. 4. The call of the Bridegroom. 5. Effect on the
   soul. 6. A spark of the fire of love. 7. The spark dies out. 8. This
   grace evidently divine. 9. One such wound repays many trials. 10. First
   reason of immunity from deception. 11. Second and third reasons. 12.
   The imagination not concerned in it. 13. St. Teresa never alarmed at
   this prayer. 14. The odour of Thine ointment.' 15. No reason to fear
   deception here.

   1. IT seems as if we had deserted the little dove for a long time, but
   this is not the case, for these past trials cause her to take a far
   higher flight. I will now describe the way in which the Spouse treats
   her before uniting her entirely to Himself. He increases her longing
   for Him by devices so delicate that the soul itself cannot discern
   them; nor do I think I could explain them except to people who have
   personally experienced them. These desires are delicate and subtle
   impulses springing from the inmost depths of the soul; I know of
   nothing to which they can be compared.

   2. These graces differ entirely from anything we ourselves can gain,
   and even from the spiritual consolation before described. [228]   In
   the present case, even when the mind is not recollected or even
   thinking of God, although no sound is heard, His Majesty arouses it
   suddenly as if by a swiftly flashing comet or by a clap of thunder.
   [229]   Yet the soul thus called by God hears Him well enough--so well,
   indeed, that sometimes, especially at first, it trembles and even cries
   out, although it feels no pain. It is conscious of having received a
   delicious wound but cannot discover how, nor who gave it, yet
   recognizes it as a most precious grace and hopes the hurt will never
   heal.

   3. The soul makes amorous complaints to its Bridegroom, even uttering
   them aloud; nor can it control itself, knowing that though He is
   present He will not manifest Himself so that it may enjoy Him. This
   causes a pain, keen although sweet and delicious from which the soul
   could not escape even if it wished; but this it never desires. [230]
   This favour is more delightful than the pleasing absorption of the
   faculties in the prayer of quiet which is unaccompanied by suffering.
   [231]

   4. I am at my wits' end, sisters, as to how to make you understand this
   operation of love: I know not how to do so. It seems contradictory to
   say that the Beloved clearly shows He dwells in the soul and calls by
   so unmistakable a sign and a summons so penetrating, that the spirit
   cannot choose but hear it, while He appears to reside in the seventh
   mansion. He speaks in this manner, which is not a set form of speech,
   and the inhabitants of the other mansions, the senses, the imagination
   and the faculties, dare not stir. [232]

   5. O Almighty God! how profound are Thy secrets and how different are
   spiritual matters from anything that can be seen or heard in this
   world! I can find nothing to which to liken these graces, insignificant
   as they are compared with many others Thou dost bestow on souls. This
   favour acts so strongly upon the spirit that it is consumed by desires
   yet knows not what to ask, for it realizes clearly that its God is with
   it. You may inquire, if it realizes this so clearly, what more does it
   desire and why is it pained? What greater good can it seek? I cannot
   tell: I know that this suffering seems to pierce the very heart, and
   when He Who wounded it draws out the dart He seems to draw the heart
   out too, so deep is the love it feels. [233]

   6. I have been thinking that God might be likened to a burning furnace
   [234]   from which a small spark flies into the soul that feels the
   heat of this great fire, which, however, is insufficient to consume it.
   The sensation is so delightful that the spirit lingers in the pain
   produced by its contact. This seems to me the best comparison I can
   find, for the pain is delicious and is not really pain at all, nor does
   it always continue in the same degree; sometimes it lasts for a long
   time; on other occasions it passes quickly. This is as God chooses, for
   no human means can obtain it; and though felt at times for a long
   while, yet it is intermittent.

   7. In fact it is never permanent and therefore does not wholly inflame
   the spirit; but when the soul is ready to take fire, the little spark
   suddenly dies out, leaving the heart longing to suffer anew its loving
   pangs. No grounds exist for thinking this comes from any natural cause
   or from melancholy, or that it is an illusion of the devil or the
   imagination. Undoubtedly this movement of the heart comes from God Who
   is unchangeable; nor do its effects is resemble those of other
   devotions in which the strong absorption of delight makes us doubt
   their reality.

   8. There is no suspension here of the senses or other faculties: they
   wonder at what is happening, without impeding it. Nor do I think that
   they can either increase or dispel this delightful pain. Any one who
   has received this favour from our Lord will understand my meaning on
   reading this: let her thank Him fervently: there is no need to fear
   deception but far more fear of not being sufficiently grateful for so
   signal a grace. Let her endeavour to serve Him and to amend her life in
   every respect; then she will see what will follow and how she will
   obtain still higher and higher gifts.

   9. A person on whom this grace was bestowed passed several years
   without receiving any other favour, yet was perfectly satisfied, for
   even had she served God for very many years in the midst of severe
   trials, she would have felt abundantly repaid. May He be for ever
   blessed! Amen.

   10. Perhaps you wonder why we may feel more secure against deception
   concerning this favour than in other cases. I think it is for these
   reasons. Firstly, because the devil cannot give such delicious pain: he
   may cause pleasure or delight which appears spiritual but is unable to
   add suffering, especially suffering of so keen a sort, united to peace
   and joy of soul. His power is limited to what is external; suffering
   produced by him is never accompanied with peace, but with anxieties and
   struggles.

   11. Secondly, because this welcome storm comes from no region over
   which Satan has control. Thirdly, because of the great benefits left in
   the soul which, as a rule, is resolute to suffer for God and longs to
   bear many crosses. It is also far more determined than before to
   withdraw from worldly pleasures and intercourse and other things of the
   same sort.

   12. It is very clear that this is no fiction: the imagination may
   counterfeit some favours but not this, which is too manifest to leave
   room for doubt. Should any one still remain uncertain, let her know
   that hers were not genuine impulses; [235]   that is, if she is dubious
   as to whether or no she experienced them, for they are as certainly
   perceived by the soul as is a loud voice by the ears. It is impossible
   for these experiences to proceed from melancholy whose whims arise and
   exist only in the imagination, whereas this emotion comes from the
   interior of the soul.

   13. I may be mistaken, but I shall not change my opinion until I hear
   reasons to the contrary from those who understand these matters. I know
   some one who has always greatly dreaded such deceptions, yet could
   never bring herself to feel any alarm about this state of prayer. [236]

   14. Our Lord also uses other means of rousing the soul; for
   instance--when reciting vocal prayer without seeking to penetrate the
   sense, a person may be seized with a delightful fervour [237]   as if
   suddenly encompassed with a fragrance powerful enough to diffuse itself
   through all the senses. I do not assert that there really is any
   perfume but use this comparison because it somewhat resembles the
   manner by which the Spouse makes His presence understood, moving the
   soul to a delicious desire of enjoying Him and thus disposing it to
   heroic acts, and causing it to render Him fervent praise.

   15. This favour springs from the same source as the former, but causes
   no suffering here, nor are the soul's longings to enjoy God painful:
   this is what is more usually experienced by the soul. For the reasons
   already given there appears no cause here for fear, but rather for
   receiving it with thanksgiving.

  INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER III.

        BY THE EDITOR

   THE readers, especially those not well acquainted with Scholastic
   philosophy, will, perhaps, be glad to find here a short explanation of
   the various kinds. of Vision and Locution, Corporal, Imaginary, and
   Intellectual. The senses of Taste, Touch, and Smell are not so often
   affected by mystical phenomena, but what we are about to say in respect
   of Sight and Hearing applies, mutatis mutandis, to these also.

   1. A CORPORAL VISION is when one sees a bodily object. A Corporal
   Locution is when one hears words uttered by a human tongue. In both
   cases the respective senses are exercising their normal function, and
   the phenomenon differs from ordinary seeing or hearing merely by the
   fact that in the latter the object seen is a real body, the words
   perceived come from a real tongue, whereas in the Vision or Locution
   the object is either only apparent or at any rate is not such as it
   seems to be. Thus, when young Tobias set out on a journey, his
   companion, Azarias, was not a real human being, but an archangel in
   human form. Tobias did really see and hear him, and felt the grip of
   his hand; Sara and her parents, as well as Tobias's parents, saw and
   heard him too, but all the time the archangel made himself visible and
   audible by means of an assumed body, or perhaps of an apparent body. It
   would be more correct to describe such a phenomenon as an APPARITION
   than as a Vision, and in fact the apparitions of our Risen Lord to the
   holy women and the apostles belong to this category. For, though His
   was a real body, it was glorified and therefore no longer subject to
   the same laws which govern purely human things. (St. Thomas, Summa
   theol. III., qu. 54, art. I-3).

   St. Teresa tells us more than once that she never beheld a Corporal
   Vision, nor heard a Corporal Locution.

   II. AN IMAGINARY VISION OR LOCUTION is one where nothing is seen or
   heard by the senses of seeing or hearing, but where the same impression
   is received that would be produced upon the imagination by the senses
   if some real object were perceived by them. For, according to the
   Scholastics, the Imagination stands half-way between the senses and the
   intellect, receiving impressions from the former and transmitting them
   to the latter. This is the reason why imaginary Visions and Locutions
   are so dangerous that, according to St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross,
   and other spiritual writers, they should not only never be sought for,
   but as much as possible shunned and under all circumstances
   discountenanced. For the Imagination is closely connected with the
   Memory, so that it is frequently impossible to ascertain whether a
   Vision, etc., is not perhaps a semi-conscious or unconscious
   reproduction of scenes witnessed. It is here also that deception,
   wilful or unwilful, self-deception or deception by a higher agency, is
   to be feared. Hence the general rule that such Visions or Locutions
   should only be trusted upon the strongest grounds. According to St.
   Thomas Aquinas, (Summa theol. IIa IIæ, gu. 175, art. 3 ad q.) the
   visions of Isaias, St. John in the Apocalypse etc., were Imaginary.

   As an example of Imaginary Visions we may mention St. Stephen, who saw
   the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing on the right hand of
   God'; or St. Peter, who saw the heaven opened, and a certain vessel
   descending, as it were a great linen sheet, let down by the four
   corners from heaven to the earth . . . and there came a voice to him:
   Arise, Peter, kill and eat.' (Acts, vii. 55; X. 11-13).

   These Visions, Locutions, etc., are not hallucinations. The latter are
   due to physical disorder which affects the memory and causes it to
   represent impressions formerly received by it, in a disorderly and
   often grotesque manner. The Imaginary Vision takes place independently
   of a morbid state, is caused by an extraneous power, good or evil, and
   has for its object things of which the memory neither has nor ever has
   had cognizance.

   III. AN INTELLECTUAL VISION OR LOCUTION is one where nothing is seen or
   heard by the eyes and ears, and where no sensation is received by the
   imagination. But the impression which would be delivered by the
   imagination to the intellect, had it come through the senses and been
   handed on to the imagination, is directly imprinted upon the intellect.
   To understand this it is necessary to bear in mind that the impressions
   we receive through the senses must undergo a transformation--must be
   spiritualized--before they reach the intellect. This is one of the most
   difficult problems of psychology; none of the solutions offered by
   various schools of philosophy seem to render it entirely free from
   obscurity. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, the impression received by
   the eye (Species sensibilis) is spiritualized by a faculty called
   Intellectus agens by means of abstraction (Species impressa), and is
   treasured up in the memory, like lantern slides, available at demand.
   The mind, identifying itself with the Species impressa, produces the
   Word of the mind' (Verbum mentis), wherein consists the act of
   Understanding or Mental Conception. In the Intellectual Vision or
   Locution, God, without co-operation on the part of the senses, the
   imagination, or the memory, produces directly on the mind the Species
   impressa. As this is supernatural with regard to its origin, and often
   also with respect to its object, it stands to reason that it is too
   exalted for the memory to receive it, so that such Visions and
   Locutions are frequently only imperfectly remembered and sometimes
   altogether forgotten, as St. Teresa tells us. On the other hand they
   are far less dangerous than Corporal or Imaginary Visions and
   Locutions, because the senses and imagination have nothing to do with
   them, whilst evil spirits are unable to act directly upon the mind, and
   self-deception is altogether excluded for the reasons stated by St.
   Teresa. An instance of such a vision is mentioned by St. Paul: I know a
   man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not,
   or out of the body I know not: God knoweth), such an one rapt even to
   the third heaven. And I know such a man (whether in the body or out of
   the body, I know not: God knoweth): that he was caught up into
   paradise, and heard secret words, which it is not granted to man to
   utter' (2 Cor. xii. 2-4).

  CHAPTER III.

   TREATS OF THE SAME SUBJECT AND OF THE WAY GOD IS SOMETIMES PLEASED TO
   SPEAK TO THE SOUL. HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE IN SUCH A CASE, IN WHICH WE
   MUST NOT FOLLOW OUR OWN OPINION. GIVES SIGNS TO SHOW HOW TO DISCOVER
   WHETHER THIS FAVOUR IS A DECEPTION OR NOT: THIS IS VERY NOTEWORTHY.

   1. Locutions. 2. Sometimes caused by melancholia. 3. Caution needed at
   first. 4. Locutions frequently occur during prayer. 5. Resist those
   containing false doctrine. 6. First sign of genuine locutions. 7.
   Effect of the words: Be not troubled.' 8. It is I, be not afraid.' 9.
   Be at Peace.' 10. Second sign. 11. Third sign. 12. The devil suggests
   doubts about true locutions. 13. Confidence of the soul rewarded. 14.
   Its joy at seeing God's words verified. 15. Its zeal for God's honour.
   16. Locutions coining from the fancy. 17. Imaginary answers given to
   prayer. 18. A confessor should be consulted about locutions. 19.
   Interior locutions. 20. First sign of genuine interior locutions. 21.
   Second sign. 22. Third sign. 23. Fourth sign. 24. Fifth sign. 25.
   Results of true locutions. 26. They should remove alarm. 27. Answer to
   an objection.

   1. GOD arouses the soul in another manner which, though in some ways
   apparently a greater favour than the above mentioned, yet may prove
   more dangerous, therefore I will give some particulars about it. He
   does this by means of words addressed to the soul in many different
   ways; sometimes they appear to come from without; at other times from
   the inner depths of the soul; or again, from its superior part; while
   other speeches are so exterior as to be heard by the ears like a real
   voice.

   2. At times, indeed very often, this may be only a fancy; especially
   with persons of a lively imagination or who are afflicted with
   melancholy to any marked extent. I think that no attention should be
   paid to either class of people when they say they see, hear, or learn
   anything supernaturally. Do not disturb them by saying that it comes
   from the devil, [238]   but listen to them as if they were sick
   persons. Let the prioress or confessor to whom they tell their story
   bid them think no more of it as such matters are not essential in the
   service of God: the devil has deceived many Christians thus, although
   perhaps it is not so in their case; therefore they need not trouble
   themselves about it. Thus we must accomodate ourselves to their humour:
   if we tell them their fancies proceed from melancholia, there will be
   no end to the matter, for they will persist in maintaining they have
   seen and heard these things, for so it seems to them.

   3. The truth is, care should be taken to keep such people from too much
   prayer and to persuade them, as far as possible, to take no notice of
   their fancies: the devil makes use of these weak souls to injure
   others, even if they themselves escape unhurt. There is need for
   caution both with feeble and strong souls at first, until it is certain
   from what spirit these things proceed. I maintain that, in the
   beginning, it is always wiser to resist these communications; if they
   come from God this is the best way to receive more, for they increase
   when discouraged. At the same time the soul should not be too strictly
   controlled or disquieted, for it cannot help itself in the matter.

   4. To return to discuss the words addressed to the soul: any kind I
   mentioned may come either from God, the devil, or the imagination. By
   the help of God I will endeavour to describe the signs distinguishing
   the one from the other, and when these locutions are dangerous, for
   they occur to many persons who praise prayer. I do not wish you to
   think, sisters, that there is any harm either in believing or in
   disregarding them. When they only console you, or warn you of your
   faults, it matters not whence they come or whether they are only
   fancies.

   5. I caution you on one point--although they may come from God, you
   must not esteem yourself more highly, for He often spoke to the
   Pharisees [239] --all the good consists in profiting by His words. Take
   no more notice of any speeches you hear which disagree with the Holy
   Scriptures than if you heard them from Satan himself. Though they may
   only rise from your vivid imagination, look upon them as a temptation
   against the faith. Always resist them; then they will leave you, and
   cease, for they have little strength of their own. [240]

   6. Now let us return to the first point--whether these communications
   come from the inferior or the superior part of the soul, or from
   without, does not affect their originating from God.

   7. In my opinion these are the most certain signs of their being
   divine. The first and truest is the power and authority they carry with
   them, for these words are operative. [241]   For example: a soul is
   suffering all the sorrow and disquiet I have described: the mind is
   darkened and dry; but it is set at peace, freed from all trouble and
   filled with light merely by hearing the words: Be not troubled.' These
   deliver it from all its pains, although it felt as though, if the whole
   world and all its theologians had united in trying to persuade it there
   was no cause for grief, it could not, in spite of all their efforts,
   have been delivered from its affliction. [242]

   8. Again, a person is troubled and greatly terrified at being told by
   her confessor and other people that her soul is under the influence of
   the evil one: she hears a single sentence which says, It is I, be not
   afraid,' [243]   and is at once freed from all fears and filled with
   consolation; indeed, she believes it would be impossible for any one to
   disturb her confidence. [244]

   9. Again, when exceedingly anxious about important business, not
   knowing whether or not it will be successful, on hearing words bidding
   her Be at peace; all will go well,' she feels reassured and free from
   all care in the matter. [245]   Many other instances of the same sort
   could be mentioned.

   10. The second sign is a great calm and a devout and peaceful
   recollection which dwell in the soul together with a desire to praise
   God. They say that communications, at any rate in this mansion, are not
   uttered direly by God but are transmitted by an angel. [246]   Then, O
   my God, if a word sent to us by Thee through Thy messenger has such
   force, what effects wilt Thou not leave in the soul united to Thee in a
   mutual bond of love? [247]

   11. The third proof is that these words do not pass from the memory but
   remain there for a very long time; sometimes they are never forgotten.
   This is not the case with what men may utter, which, however grave and
   learned they may be, is not thus impressed on our memory. Neither, if
   they prophesy of things to come, do we believe them as we do these
   divine locutions which leave us so convinced of their truth that,
   although their fulfilment sometimes seems utterly impossible and we
   vacillate and doubt about them, there still remains in the soul a
   certainty of their verity which cannot be destroyed. Perhaps everything
   may seem to militate against what was heard and years pass by, yet the
   spirit never loses its belief that God will make use of means unknown
   to men for the purpose and that finally what was foretold must surely
   happen; as indeed it does. [248]

   12. Still, as I said, the soul is troubled at seeing many obstacles in
   the way of the accomplishment of the prophecy. The words, their
   effects, and the assurance they carry with them convinced the soul at
   the moment that they came from God. Afterwards, however, doubts arise
   as to whether the locutions came from the devil or from the
   imagination, although while hearing them the person would have died to
   defend their truth. [249]   But, as I said, these misgivings must be
   suggested by the evil one to afflict and intimidate her, especially if
   by carrying out a command thus given great good will result to souls
   and some work be done conducing notably to the honour and service of
   God, concerning which great difficulties have to be overcome. In such
   cases, where will Satan stop short? At least, he weakens faith, and it
   is a terrible evil to doubt that God has power to work in a way far
   beyond our understanding.

   13. Despite all these difficulties and although the confessors
   consulted on these matters say the words were but fancies, while events
   take such an unfavourable turn as to make the realization of these
   predictions seem impossible, yet there remains so lively a spark of
   certainty in the mind (I know not whence it comes) that, although all
   other hopes die out, it cannot, if it would, quench this ardent spark
   of confidence. At last, as I said, our Lord's words are accomplished,
   at which the soul is so satisfied and joyful that it can do nothing but
   praise His Majesty--more because it sees His words prove true than on
   account of the thing itself, even though it may be of consequence to
   the person concerned.

   14. I know not why the soul attaches such importance to these
   communications being verified. I think that if the person herself were
   detected in telling falsehoods, she would not be so grieved as at these
   locutions proving untrue--as if she could do anything in the matter
   beyond repeating what has been said to her! A certain person was
   frequently reminded in such a case of the Prophet Jonas, when he found
   Ninive was not to be destroyed. [250]

   15. In fact, as these words come from the Spirit of God, it is right
   thus to trust them and to desire that He Who is supreme truth should
   not be thought a deceiver. Justly, therefore, does their hearer rejoice
   when, after a thousand delays and enormous difficulties, they are
   accomplished. Although this success may entail great suffering on
   herself, she prefers it to the nonfulfilment of what she knows our Lord
   most certainly foretold. Possibly every one is not so weak as this, if
   indeed it is a weakness, though I cannot myself condemn it as an evil.

   16. If these locutions proceed from the imagination [251]   they show
   no such signs, bringing neither conviction, peace, nor interior joy
   with them. But in some cases I have come across, on account of a very
   weak constitution or vivid imagination or of other causes I do not
   know, persons while absorbed in the prayer of quiet and in spiritual
   slumber are so entirely carried out of themselves by their deep state
   of recollection as to be unconscious of anything external. All their
   senses being thus dormant, as if asleep--as indeed, at times they
   really are--they thus, in a sort of dream, fancy they are spoken to or
   see things they imagine come from God, but which leave no more effect
   than dreams.

   17. Again, one who very lovingly asks something of our Lord may fancy
   that an answer comes from Him. [252]   This often occurs, but I think
   that no one accustomed to receive divine communications could be
   deceived on this point by the imagination.

   18. The devil's deceptions are more dangerous; but if the foregoing
   signs are present, we may feel fairly confident that these locutions
   are from God, though not so certain but that, if they refer to some
   weighty matter in which we are called upon to act or if they concern a
   third person, we should consult some confessor who is both learned and
   a servant of God, before attempting or thinking of acting on them,
   although we may have heard them repeated several times and are
   convinced of their truth and divine origin. [253]   His Majesty wishes
   us to take this course; it is not disobedience to His commands, for He
   has bidden us hold our confessor as His representative even where there
   is no doubt that the communications come from Him: thus we shall gain
   courage if the matter is a very difficult one. Our Lord will reassure
   our confessor, whom, when He so chooses, He will inspire with faith
   that these locutions are from the Holy Ghost. [254]   If not, we are
   freed from all further obligations in the matter. I think it would be
   very dangerous to act against our confessor's advice and to prefer our
   own opinions in such a matter. Therefore, sisters, I admonish you in
   the name of our Lord, never to do anything of the sort.

   19. God speaks to the soul in another way by a certain intellectual
   vision which I think undoubtedly proceeds from Him; it will be
   described later on. [255] 8 It takes place far within the innermost
   depths of the soul which appears to hear distinctly in a most
   mysterious manner, with its spiritual hearing, the words spoken to it
   by our Lord Himself. The way in which the spirit perceives these words
   and the results produced by them, convince us that they cannot in any
   way come from the devil. Their powerful aftereffects force us to admit
   this and plainly show they do not spring from the imagination. [256]
   Careful consideration will assure us of this for the following
   reasons;--

   20. Firstly, the clearness of the language varies in the different
   kinds of locutions. Those that are divine are so distinct that the
   hearer remembers if there were a syllable missing, and what words were
   made use of even though a whole sentence was spoken. But if the speech
   were only a freak of fancy, it would not be so audible nor would the
   words be so distinct but would be only half articulated. [257]

   21. The second reason is that often the person was not thinking of what
   is heard; sometimes the locution even comes unexpectedly during
   conversation, though at times it refers to some thought that passed
   quickly through the mind or to a subject it was before engaged upon.
   Frequently it concerns things of whose existence the hearer knew
   nothing nor even imagined such events could ever come to pass;
   therefore it is impossible for the imagination to have framed such
   speeches and deceived the mind by fancies about what it had never
   wished, nor sought for, nor even thought about. [258]

   22. The third reason is that in a genuine case the soul seems to listen
   to the words, whereas when the imagination is at work, little by little
   it composes what the person wishes to hear. [259]

   23. The fourth reason is because divine locutions differ immensely from
   others, a single word comprising a depth of meaning which our
   understanding could not thus quickly condense into one phrase. [260]

   24. Fifthly because, in a manner I cannot explain, these
   communications, without any further explanations, frequently give us to
   understand far more than is implied by the words themselves. I shall
   speak farther on of this way of understanding hidden things which is
   very subtle and a favour for which we should thank God. Some people are
   exceedingly suspicious about these and other communications of the same
   kind. I speak particularly of some one [261]   who experienced them
   herself, though there may be others who cannot understand them. I know
   that she has considered the subject very carefully, God having often
   bestowed this grace on her. Her principal difficulty was to discover
   whether the locutions were merely fancied. It is easier to know when
   they come from the devil although being so wily, he can with facility
   imitate the spirit of light. However, he would do this in a form of
   words pronounced so distinctly that there would be no more doubt as to
   their reality than if they came from the spirit of truth, while those
   coming from the imagination leave us uncertain whether we heard the
   words or not. But Satan could never counterfeit the effects I spoke of;
   [262]   he leaves neither peace nor light in the soul, only anxiety and
   confusion. In any case, he can do little or no harm to one who is
   humble and who, as I advised, does not act on what is heard.

   25. If the soul receives favours and caresses from our Lord, let it
   examine carefully whether it rates itself more highly in consequence;
   unless self-abasement increases with God's expressions of love, they do
   not come from the Holy Spirit. Inevitably, when they are divine, the
   greater the favours, the less the soul esteems itself and the more
   keenly it remembers its sins. [263]   It becomes more oblivious of
   self-interest: the will and memory grow more fervent in seeking solely
   God's honour with no thought of self. It also becomes unceasingly
   careful not to deviate deliberately from the will of God and feels a
   keener conviction that instead of meriting such favours, it deserves
   hell.

   26. When these results follow, no graces or gifts received during
   prayer need alarm the soul which should rather trust in the mercy of
   God, Who is faithful and will not allow the devil to deceive it; but it
   is always well to be on one's guard.

   27. Those our Lord does not lead by this path may suppose that the soul
   can avoid listening to these locutions and that even if they are
   interior it is at least possible to distract the attention from them so
   as not to hear them and thus escape danger. This cannot be done: I am
   not speaking of freaks of fancy which may be prevented by ceasing to
   desire certain things or by paying no attention to its inventions. This
   is not feasible when these communications come from the Holy Ghost Who,
   when He speaks, stops all other thoughts and compels the mind to
   listen. [264]   Mark this: that I believe it would be easier for a
   person with very keen ears to avoid hearing a loud voice, for he could
   occupy his thoughts and mind in other things. Not so here; the soul can
   do nothing, nor has it ears to stop, nor power to think of aught but
   what is said to it. For He Who could stay the sun on its course (at the
   prayer of Josue, [265]   I believe) can so quiet the faculties and the
   interior of the spirit as to make it perceive that another and a
   stronger Lord than itself governs this castle; it is thus affected with
   profound devotion and humility, seeing that it cannot but listen. May
   the divine Majesty vouchsafe that, forgetting ourselves, our only aim
   may be to please Him, as I said. Amen. God grant I have succeeded in
   explaining what I wished and that it may be some guide to those who may
   experience such favours.

  CHAPTER IV.

   TREATS OF HOW GOD SUSPENDS THE SOUL IN PRAYER BY A TRANCE, ECSTASY OR
   RAPTURE, WHICH I BELIEVE ARE ALL THE SAME THING. GREAT COURAGE REQUIRED
   TO RECEIVE EXTRAORDINARY FAVOURS FROM HIS MAJESTY.

   1. Courage required by the soul for the divine espousals. 2. Raptures.
   3. Rapture caused by the spark of love. 4. The powers and senses
   absorbed. 5. Mysteries revealed during ecstasies. 6. These mysteries
   are unspeakable. 7. Moses and the burning bush. 8. Simile of the
   museum. 9. St. Teresa's visit to the Duchess of Alva. 10. Joy of the
   soul during raptures. 11. No imaginary vision. 12. True and false
   raptures. 13. Revelations of future bliss. 14. The soul's preparation.
   15. The soul blinded by its faults. 16. God ready to give these graces
   to all. 17. Faculties lost during ecstasy. 18. Spiritual inebriation.
   19. Fervour and love of suffering left in the soul. 20. Scandal caused
   to spectators by such favours. 21. Our Lord's predilection for such a
   soul. 22. Illusionary raptures.

   1. WHAT rest can the poor little butterfly find, with all the trials I
   have told you of and many more? They serve to make her desire the
   Bride-groom more ardently. His Majesty, well aware of our weakness,
   fortifies her by these and other means in order that she may obtain
   courage for union with a Lord so great and may take Him for her Spouse.
   Perhaps you will laugh and think I am talking foolishly: there can be
   no call for courage here; there is no woman, however low her class, who
   would not dare to wed a king. So I think, were he an earthly monarch,
   but there is need of more fortitude than you suppose in order to
   espouse the King of heaven. [266]   Our nature appears too timid and
   base for anything so high; without doubt, unless God gave us the grace
   it would be impossible for us, however much we might appreciate its
   benefits. You will learn how His Majesty ratifies these espousals;
   probably this is done when He ravishes the soul by ecstasies, thus
   depriving it of its faculties; if the use of these were retained, I
   think the sight of its close vicinity to so mighty a Sovereign would
   probably deprive the body of life. I am speaking of genuine raptures,
   not fancies that come from women's weakness--which so often occur
   nowadays--making them imagine everything to be a rapture or an ecstasy.
   As I think I said, some are so feebly constituted as to die of a single
   prayer of quiet. [267]

   2. I should like to describe here several kinds of raptures of which I
   have learnt from spiritual persons with whom I have discussed the
   subject, but I am not sure whether I shall succeed in explaining them
   as I did elsewhere. [268]   It has been decided that it will not be
   amiss to repeat what was said about these and other things that happen
   in this state, if only that I may treat of all the mansions contain in
   proper order.

   3. In one sort of rapture the soul, although perhaps not engaged in
   prayer at the time, is struck by some word of God which it either
   remembers or hears. [269]   His Majesty, touched with pity by what He
   has seen it suffer for so long past in its longing for Him, appears to
   increase the spark I described in the interior of the spirit until it
   entirely inflames the soul which rises with new life like a phoenix
   from the flames. Such a one may piously believe her sins are now
   forgiven, [270]   supposing that she is in the disposition and has made
   use of the means required by the Church. The soul being thus purified,
   God unites it to Himself in a way known only to Him and the spirit, nor
   does even the latter so understand what happens as to be able to
   explain it to others afterwards. Yet the mind had not lost the use of
   its faculties, for this ecstasy does not resemble a swoon or a fit in
   which nothing either interior or exterior is felt.

   4. What I do understand is that the soul has never been more alive to
   spiritual things nor so full of light and of knowledge of His Majesty
   as it is now. This might seem impossible; if the powers and senses were
   so absorbed that we might call them dead, how does the soul understand
   this mystery? I cannot tell; perhaps no one but the Creator Himself can
   say what passes in these places--I mean this and the following mansions
   which may be treated as one, the door leading from one to the other
   being wide open. However, as some things in the last rooms are only
   shown to those who get thus far, I thought it better to treat the
   mansions separately.

   5. While the soul is in this suspension, our Lord favours it by
   discovering to it secrets such as heavenly mysteries and imaginary
   visions, which admit of description afterwards because they remain so
   imprinted on the memory that it never forgets them. But when the
   visions are intellectual they are not thus easily related, some of
   those received at such a time being so sublime that it is not fitting
   for man, while living in this world, to understand them in a way that
   can be told, although when the use of the faculties returns much can be
   described of what was seen in intellectual vision. Possibly you do not
   know what a vision is, especially an intellectual one. Since I have
   been bidden by one who has authority, I will tell you at the proper
   time. Although seemingly superfluous, it may prove useful to certain
   people.

   6. 'But,' you will ask me, if the very sublime favours our Lord bestows
   in this mansion cannot afterwards be remembered, what profit do they
   bring?' [271]   O daughters! their value cannot be overrated; for
   though the recipient is incapable of describing them, they are deeply
   imprinted in the centre of the soul and are never forgotten. How can
   they be remembered if no image is seen and the powers of the soul do
   not comprehend them?' I, too, do not understand this, but I know that
   certain truths of the greatness of God remain so impressed on the
   spirit by this favour that, did not faith teach Who He is and that it
   is bound to believe He is God, the soul would henceforth worship Him as
   such, as did Jacob when he saw the ladder. [272]   Doubtless the
   Patriarch learnt other secrets he was unable to reveal, for unless he
   had received more interior light he could never have discovered such
   sublime mysteries merely by watching angels ascending and descending
   the steps. I am not certain whether this quotation is correct; although
   I have heard the passage, I cannot feel sure of recalling it exactly.

   7. Neither was Moses able to relate more than God willed of what he had
   seen in the burning bush; [273]   but unless the Almighty had clearly
   revealed certain mysteries to his soul, causing it to see and know its
   God was present, the lawgiver could never have undertaken so many and
   such great labours. Such sublime revelations were shown him amidst the
   thorns of the bush as to give him the needful courage for his great
   deeds on behalf of the Children of Israel. We must not, sisters, search
   out reasons for understanding the hidden things of God, but, believing
   Him to be Almighty, we should be convinced that such worms as
   ourselves, with our limited power of intelligence, are unable to
   comprehend His wonders. Let us praise Him fervently for allowing us to
   understand something of them.

   8. I wish I could find some simile for my subject: none seem to suit
   the purpose, but I will make use of the following. Imagine that you are
   in an apartment--I fancy it is termed camarin (or private
   museum)--belonging to a king or a great nobleman, in which are placed
   numberless kinds of articles of glass, porcelain, and other things, so
   arranged that most of them are at once seen on entering the room.

   9. While on a visit to the house of the Duchess of Alva (where at her
   request I was bidden by obedience to stay during a journey) [274]   I
   was taken into such a room. I stood amazed on entering it and wondered
   what could be the use of such a jumble of knick-knacks; then I thought
   that the sight of so many different things should lead one to praise
   God. It is fortunate I saw them, for they offer me a suitable
   comparison in this case. Although I was in the room some time, there
   were so many objects in it that I forgot what I had seen and could no
   more remember each object, nor of what it was made, than if I had never
   seen it, though I recalled the sight of the whole collection.

   10. Something of this sort occurs when the spirit is very closely
   united to God. It is introduced into this mansion of the empyrean
   heaven which must be in the centre of our souls for since God resides
   in them, He must own one of the mansions. While the soul is in ecstasy,
   our Lord does not appear to wish it to apprehend these mysteries and
   its inebriation of joy in Him suffices it. But sometimes He is pleased
   to withdraw it from this rapture when it at once perceives what the
   mansion contains. On returning to itself, the mind can recall what has
   been seen but is unable to describe it, nor can it, by its natural
   abilities, attain to see more of the supernatural than God has chosen
   to show it.

   11. Do I seem to own that the soul really sees something and that this
   is an imaginary vision? I mean nothing of the sort: I am speaking of an
   intellectual vision, but being so ignorant and dull I can explain
   nothing and am well aware that if anything is rightly stated, it does
   not come from myself.

   12. I think that if the soul learns no mysteries at any time during
   raptures, they are no true raptures but some natural weakness that may
   occur to people of delicate constitutions, such as women, when by its
   strenuous efforts the spirit overpowers physical nature, and produces
   stupor, as I think I said in connection with the prayer of quiet. [275]

   13. This is not so in genuine raptures, for then I believe God ravishes
   the soul wholly to Himself, as being His very own and His bride, and
   shows her some small part of the kingdom she has thus won. However
   little this may be, all is great that is in this great God. He will
   allow of no obstacle from the powers or the senses but bids that the
   doors of all the mansions should be closed at once, only leaving open
   the one He is in, so that we may enter it. Blessed be such mercy--well
   may men be accursed who do not seek to profit by it, but who forfeit
   it!

   14. O, my sisters! what nothingness is all we have given up, or that we
   do, or ever could do for a God who thus wills to communicate Himself to
   a worm! If we hope to enjoy this favour even during our mortal life,
   what are we doing? Why do we delay? What can repay the loss of the time
   of a Memento' [276]   in searching for this Lord, like the bride
   through the streets and squares. [277]   Oh, what a mockery is
   everything in this world that does not lead towards and help us to
   attain to this state! Even though all the earthly pleasures, riches,
   and happiness that can be imagined could last for eternity, they would
   be disappointing and base contrasted with the treasures which are to be
   enjoyed for ever--and yet even these are nothing compared with the
   possession for our own of the Lord of all treasures in heaven and
   earth.

   15. Oh, human blindness! When, oh, when shall this dust be taken from
   our eyes? Although we think it insufficient to blind us, yet I see some
   little motes or grains of dust which, if left to spread, will suffice
   to harm us greatly. At least, for the love of God, my sisters, let
   these faults convince us of our misery, serving to clear our sight as
   did the clay the eyes of the blind man who was cured by the Spouse.
   [278]   Then, realizing our imperfections, we shall beg Him more
   fervently to let us benefit by our defers so as to please Him in all
   things.

   16. I have unconsciously wandered far from my subject: forgive me,
   sisters. Believe me, when I come to these wonders of God's greatness (I
   mean when I come to speak of them) I cannot but feel keenly grieved at
   seeing what we lose by our own fault. It is true that His Majesty
   grants such favours to whom He chooses; yet if we sought Him as He
   seeks us, He would give them to us all. He only longs for souls on whom
   He may bestow them, for His gifts do not diminish His riches.

   17. To return to what I was describing. By the commands of the
   Bridegroom, the doors of the mansions and even those of the keep and of
   the whole castle are closed; for when He intends ravishing the soul He
   takes away the power of speech, and although occasionally the other
   faculties are retained rather longer, no word can be uttered. [279]
   Sometimes the person is at once deprived of all the senses, the hands
   and body becoming as cold as if the soul had fled; occasionally no
   breathing can be detected. [280]   This condition lasts but a short
   while; I mean in the same degree, [281]   for when this profound
   suspension diminishes the body seems to come to itself and gain
   strength to return again to this death which gives more vigorous life
   to the soul.

   18. This supreme state of ecstasy never lasts long, but although it
   ceases, it leaves the will so inebriated, [282] and the mind so
   transported out of itself that for a day, or sometimes for several
   days, such a person is incapable of attending to anything but what
   excites the will to the love of God; although wide awake enough to
   this, she seems asleep as regards all earthly matters.

   19. Oh, when the soul wholly returns to itself, how abashed does it
   feel at having received this favour and how passionate are its desires
   of serving God in any way He asks of it! If the former states of prayer
   caused the powerful effects described, what will not such a signal
   grace as this do? Such a person wishes she had a thousand lives [283]
   to spend for God; she would have all earthly creatures changed into as
   many tongues to praise Him on her account. She longs to perform most
   severe penances, [284]   nor do they cost her much, for the power of
   her love almost prevents their being felt. She realizes how little the
   martyrs suffered during their tortures, for pain is easy when our Lord
   thus aids us: therefore such a soul complains to His Majesty when He
   gives her no suffering? [285]

   20. She considers it a great favour when God sends her this rapture in
   secret, for when others see it the shame and confusion she feels are so
   great as somewhat to diminish her transport. Knowing the malice of the
   world, she fears her ecstasy will not be attributed to its proper cause
   but may give rise to rash judgment instead of the praise due for it to
   God. Although this pain and distress are unavoidable, they seem to me
   to show a certain want of humility, for if she wished to be despised,
   what would she care? [286]

   21. Our Lord once said to some one who was troubled by such thoughts:
   Do not be disturbed; people will either praise Me or condemn thee; in
   either case thou wilt be the gainer.' [287]   I learnt afterwards that
   she was greatly encouraged and comforted by this speech; I speak of it
   in case others may suffer in the same way. Apparently our Lord would
   have all men know that this soul is His own and that none may molest
   it, for it is all His. Men are welcome to attack, if they will, the
   body, the honour, and the possessions of such a person, for glory will
   accrue to His Majesty from all they do; but the soul they may not
   assail; unless by a most culpable presumption it withdraws from the
   protection of its Spouse, He will defend it against the whole world and
   against all hell besides.

   22. I do not know whether I have succeeded in teaching you what a
   rapture is; to explain it fully would, as I said, be impossible. Still
   I do not think time has been lost in describing a genuine rapture. The
   effects in false raptures are very different. I do not call them false'
   because people who experience them intentionally deceive others, but
   because they are themselves unwittingly deceived. As the signs and
   effects do not correspond with this great grace, the favour itself
   becomes so discredited that naturally, when our Lord afterwards bestows
   it on any soul, nobody believes in it. May He be for ever blessed and
   praised! Amen, Amen!

   difference between raptures, ecstasies, and other elevations and subtle
   flights of the spirit, to which spiritual persons are liable; but as my
   object is to do nothing more than explain this canticle, I leave the
   subject for those who are better qualified than I am. I do this the
   more readily because our mother, the blessed Teresa of Jesus, has
   written admirably on this matter, whose writings I hope to see soon
   published,'
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER V.

   TREATS OF THE SAME SUBJECT AS THE LAST CHAPTER AND DESCRIBES THE FLIGHT
   OF THE SPIRIT, WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY BY WHICH GOD ELEVATES THE SOUL:
   THIS REQUIRES GREAT COURAGE IN ONE EXPERIENCING IT. THIS FAVOUR, BY
   WHICH GOD GREATLY DELIGHTS THE SOUL IS EXPLAINED. THIS CHAPTER IS VERY
   PROFITABLE.

   1. The flight of the spirit. 2. Self-control completely lost. 3. Symbol
   of the two cisterns. 4. Obligations following these favours. 5.
   Humility produced by them. 6. How our crucified Lord comforted such a
   soul. 7. A humble soul fears these favours. 8. Mysteries learnt during
   the flight of the spirit. 9. Imaginary visions sometimes accompany
   intellectual ones. 10. How the flight of the spirit takes place. 11.
   The soul fortified by it. 12. Three great graces left in the soul. 13.
   The third grace. 14. Fear caused by this favour.

   1. THERE is another form of rapture, which, though essentially the same
   as the last, yet produces very different feelings in the soul. I call
   it the flight of the spirit,' [288]   for the soul suddenly feels so
   rapid a sense of motion that the spirit appears to hurry it away with a
   speed which is very alarming, especially at first. Therefore I said
   that the soul on whom God bestows this favour requires strong courage,
   besides great faith, trust, and resignation, so that God may do what He
   chooses with it.

   2. Do you suppose a person in perfect possession of her senses feels
   but little dismay at her soul's being drawn above her, while sometimes,
   as we read, even the body rises with it? [289]   She does not know
   where the spirit is going, who is raising her, nor how it happens; for
   at the first instant of this sudden movement one does not feel sure it
   is caused by God. Can it possibly be resisted? No; resistance only
   accelerates the motion, as some one told me. God now appears to be
   teaching the soul, which has so often placed itself absolutely in His
   hands and offered itself entirely to Him, that it no longer belongs to
   itself; thus it is snatched away more vehemently in consequence of its
   opposition. Therefore this person resolved to resist no more than does
   a straw when attracted by amber (a thing you may have seen); she
   yielded herself into the hands of Him who is Almighty, seeing it is
   best to make a virtue of necessity. Speaking of straw, doubtless it is
   as easy for a stalwart, strapping fellow to lift a straw as for our
   mighty and powerful Giant to elevate our spirit. [290]

   3. It seems that the cistern of water of which I spoke (but I cannot
   quite remember where) in the fourth mansion, [291]   was formerly
   filled gently and quietly, without any movement; but now this great God
   Who restrains the springs and the waters and will not permit the ocean
   to transgress its bounds, [292]   lets loose the streams, which with a
   powerful rush flow into the cistern and a mighty wave rises, strong
   enough to uplift on high the little vessel of our soul. Neither the
   ship herself nor her pilot and sailors can at their choice control the
   fury of the sea and stop its carrying the boat where it will: far less
   can the interior of the soul now stay where it chooses or force its
   senses or faculties to act more than He Who holds them in His dominion
   decrees; as for the exterior powers, they are here quite useless.

   4. Indeed I am amazed, sisters, while merely writing of this
   manifestation of the immense power of this great King and Monarch. Then
   what must be felt by those who actually experience it? I am convinced
   that if His Majesty were to reveal Himself thus to the greatest sinners
   on earth, they would never dare to offend Him again--if not through
   love at least through fear of Him. What obligations bind those taught
   in so sublime a manner to strive with all their might not to displease
   such a Master! In His Name I beg of you, sisters, who have received
   these or the like favours, not to rest content with merely receiving
   them but to remember that she who owes much has much to pay. [293]

   5. This thought terrifies the soul exceedingly: unless the great
   courage needed was given it by our Lord, it would suffer great and
   constant grief; for looking first at what His Majesty has done for it
   and then upon itself, it sees how little good it has performed compared
   with what it was bound to do, and that the paltry service it has
   rendered was full of faults, failures and tepidity. To efface the
   remembrance of the many imperfections of all its good deeds (if indeed
   it has ever performed any) it thinks best to forget them altogether and
   to be ever mindful of its sins, casting itself on the mercy of God
   since it cannot repay its debt to Him and begging for the pity and
   compassion He ever shows to sinners.

   6. Perhaps He will answer as He did to some one who was kneeling before
   a crucifix in great affliction on this account, for she felt she had
   never had anything to offer God nor to sacrifice for His sake. The
   Crucified One consoled her by saying that He gave her for herself all
   the pains and labours He had borne in His passion, that she might offer
   them as her own to His Father. [294]   I learnt from her that she at
   once felt comforted and enriched by these words which she never forgets
   but recalls whenever she realizes her own wretchedness and feels
   encouraged and consoled. I could relate several other incidents of the
   same kind learnt in conversation with many holy people much given to
   prayer, but I will not recount them lest you might imagine they relate
   to myself.

   7. I think this example is very instructive; it shows that we please
   our Lord by self-knowledge, by the constant recollection of our poverty
   and miseries, and by realizing that we possess nothing but what we have
   received from Him. [295]   Therefore courage is needed, sisters, in
   order to receive this and many other favours which come to a soul
   elevated to this state by our Lord; I think that if the soul is humble
   it requires more valour than ever for this last mercy. May God grant us
   humility for His Name's sake.

   8. To return to this sudden rapture of the spirit. The soul really
   appears to have quitted the body, which however is not lifeless, and
   though, on the other hand, the person is certainly not dead, yet she
   herself cannot, for a few seconds, tell whether her spirit remains
   within her body or not. [296]   She feels that she has been wholly
   transported into another and a very different region from that in which
   we live, where a light so unearthly is shown [297]   that, if during
   her whole lifetime she had been trying to picture it and the wonders
   seen, she could not possibly have succeeded. In an instant her mind
   learns so many things at once that if the imagination and intellect
   spent years in striving to enumerate them, it could not recall a
   thousandth part of them.

   9. This vision is not intellectual but imaginary and is seen by the
   eyes of the soul more clearly than earthly things are seen by our
   bodily eyes. Although no words are pronounced, the spirit is taught
   many truths; for instance, if it beholds any of the saints, it knows
   them at once as well as if intimately acquainted with them for years.
   [298]   Occasionally, besides what the eyes of the soul perceive in
   intellectual vision, other things are shown it. In an imaginary vision
   it usually sees our Lord accompanied by a host of angels; yet neither
   the bodily eyes nor the eyes of the soul [299]   see anything, for
   these visions and many other things impossible to describe, are
   revealed by some wonderful intuition that I cannot explain. Perhaps
   those who have experienced this favour and possess more ability than
   myself may be able to describe it, although it seems to me a most
   difficult task.

   10. I cannot tell whether the soul dwells in the body meanwhile or not:
   I would neither affirm that it does nor that the body is deprived of
   it. I have often thought that as, though the sun does not leave his
   place in the heavens yet his rays have power to reach the earth
   instantaneously, so the soul and the spirit, which make one and the
   same thing (like the sun and its rays) may, while remaining in its own
   place, through the strength of the ardour coming to it from the true
   Sun of Justice, send up some higher part of it above itself. In fact I
   do not understand what I am talking about, but the truth is that, with
   the swiftness of a bullet fired from a gun, an upward flight takes
   place in the interior of the soul. (I know no other name for it but
   flight.') Although noiseless, it is too manifest a movement to be any
   illusion [300]   and the soul is quite outside itself; at least that is
   the impression made upon it. Great mysteries are revealed to it
   meanwhile, and when the person returns to consciousness she is so
   greatly benefited that she holds all this world's goods as filth
   compared with what she has seen. Henceforth earthly life is grievous to
   her and what used to please her now remains uncared for and unnoticed.
   [301]

   11. Those children of Israel who were sent on first to the Land of
   Promise brought back tokens from it; [302]   so here our Lord seems to
   seek to show the soul something of the land to which it is travelling,
   to give it courage to pass through the trials of its painful journey,
   now that it knows where it must go to find rest. You may fancy that
   such profit could not thus quickly be obtained, yet only those who have
   experienced what signal benefits this favour leaves in the soul can
   realize its value.

   12. This clearly shows it to be no work of the devil; neither the
   imagination nor the evil one could represent what leaves such peace,
   calm, and good fruits in the soul, and particularly the following three
   graces of a very high order. [303]   The first of these is a perception
   of the greatness of God which becomes clearer to us as we witness more
   of it. Secondly, we gain self-knowledge and humility from seeing how
   creatures so base as ourselves in comparison with the Creator of such
   wonders have dared to offend Him in the past or venture to gaze on Him
   now.

   13. The third grace is a contempt for all earthly things unless they
   are consecrated to the service of so great a God. With such jewels the
   Bridegroom begins to deck His Bride; they are too valuable for her to
   keep them carelessly. [304]   These visions are so deeply engraved in
   her memory that I believe she can never forget them until she enjoys
   them for evermore, for to do so would be the greatest misfortune. [305]
     But the Spouse Who gave her these gifts has power to give her grace
   not to lose them.

   14. I told you that courage was required by the soul, for do you think
   it is a trifling matter for the spirit to feel literally separated from
   the body, as it does when perceiving that it is losing its senses
   without understanding the reason? There is need that He Who gives all
   the rest should include fortitude. You will say this fright is well
   rewarded, and so say I. May He Who can bestow such graces be for ever
   praised and may His Majesty vouchsafe that we may be worthy to serve
   Him. Amen.

  CHAPTER VI.

   DESCRIBES AN EFFECT WHICH PROVES THE PRAYER SPOKEN OF IN THE LAST
   CHAPTER TO BE GENUINE AND NO DECEPTION, TREATS OF ANOTHER FAVOUR OUR
   LORD BESTOWS ON THE SOUL TO MAKE IT PRAISE HIM FERVENTLY.

   1. The soul longs for death. 2. The soul cannot help desiring these
   favours. 3. St. Teresa bewails her inability to serve God. 3. Fervour
   resulting from ecstasies. 5. Excessive desires to see God should be
   restrained. 6. They endanger health. 7. Tears often come from Physical
   causes. 8. St. Teresa's own experience. 9. Works, not tears, are asked
   by God. 10. Confide entirely in God. 11. The jubilee of the soul. 12.
   Impossibility of concealing this joy. 13. The world's judgment of this
   jubilee. 14. Which is often felt by the nuns of St. Joseph's. 15. The
   Saint's delight in this jubilee.

   1. THESE sublime favours leave the soul so desirous of fully enjoying
   Him Who has bestowed them that life becomes a painful though delicious
   torture, and death is ardently longed for. Such a one often implores
   God with tears to take her from this exile where everything she sees
   wearies her. [306]   Solitude alone brings great alleviation for a
   time, but soon her grief returns and yet she cannot bear to be without
   it. In short, this poor little butterfly can find no lasting rest. So
   tender is her love that at the slightest provocation it flames forth
   and the soul takes flight. Thus in this mansion raptures occur very
   frequently, nor can they be resisted even in public. Persecutions and
   slanders ensue; [307]   however she may try, she cannot keep free from
   the fears suggested to her by so many people, especially by her
   confessors.

   2. Although in one way she feels great confidence within her soul,
   especially when alone with God, yet on the other hand, she is greatly
   troubled by misgivings lest she is deceived by the devil and so should
   offend Him Whom she deeply loves. She cares little for blame, except
   when her confessor finds fault with her as if she could help what
   happens. She asks every one to pray for her [308]   since she has been
   told to do so, and begs His Majesty to direct her by some other way
   than this which is so full of danger. Nevertheless, so great are the
   benefits left by these favours that she cannot but see that they lead
   her on the way to heaven, [309]   of which she has read and heard and
   learnt in the law of God. As, strive how she may, she cannot resist
   desiring to receive these graces, she resigns herself into God's hands.
   Yet she is grieved at finding herself forced to wish for these favours
   which appears to be disobedience to her confessor, for she believes
   that in obedience, and in avoiding any offence against God, lies her
   safeguard against deception. Thus she feels she would prefer to be cut
   in pieces rather than wilfully commit a venial sin, yet is greatly
   grieved at seeing that she cannot avoid unwittingly falling into a
   great number. God bestows on such people so intense a desire neither
   ever to displease Him in however small a matter, nor to commit any
   avoidable imperfection, that, were there no other reason, they would
   try to avoid society and they greatly envy those who live in deserts.
   [310]   On the other hand, they seek to live amidst men in the hopes of
   helping if but one soul to praise God better. [311]   In the case of a
   woman, she grieves over the impediment offered by her sex [312]   and
   envies those who are free to proclaim aloud to all Who is this mighty
   God of hosts. [313]

   3. O poor little butterfly! chained by so many fetters that stop thee
   from flying where thou wouldst! Have pity on her, O my God, and so
   dispose her ways that she may be able to accomplish some of her desires
   for Thy honour and glory! Take no account of the poverty of her merits,
   nor of the vileness of her nature, Lord, Thou Who hast the power to
   compel the vast ocean to retire, and didst force the wide river Jordan
   to draw back so that the Children of Israel might pass through! [314]
   Yet spare her not, for aided by Thy strength she can endure many
   trials. She is resolved to do so--she desires to suffer them. Stretch
   forth Thine arm, O Lord, to help her lest she waste her life on
   trifles! Let Thy greatness appear in this Thy creature, womanish and
   weak as she is, so that men, seeing the good in her is not her own, may
   praise Theefor it! Let it cost her what it may and as dear as she
   desires, for she longs to lose a thousand lives to lead one soul to
   praise Thee but a little better. If as many lives were hers to give,
   she would count them well spent in such a cause, knowing as a truth
   most certain that she is unworthy to bear the lightest cross, much less
   to die for Thee.

   4. I cannot tell why I have said this, sisters, nor what made me do so;
   indeed I never intended it. You must know that these effects are bound
   to follow from such trances or ecstasies: they are not transient, but
   permanent desires; when opportunity occurs of acting on them, they
   prove genuine. How can I say that they are permanent, when at times the
   soul feels cowardly in the most trivial matters and too timorous to
   undertake any work for God?

   5. I believe it is because our Lord, for its greater good, then leaves
   the soul to its natural weakness, which at once convinces it so
   thoroughly that any strength it possessed came from His Majesty as to
   destroy its self-love, enduing it with a greater knowledge of the mercy
   and greatness of God which He deigned to show forth in one so vile.
   However, the soul is usually in the former state. Beware of one thing,
   sisters; these ardent desires to behold our Lord are sometimes so
   distressing as to need rather to be checked than to be encouraged--that
   is, if feasible, for in another kind of prayer of which I shall speak
   later, it is not possible as you will see.

   6. In the state I speak of these longings can sometimes be arrested,
   for the reason is at liberty to conform to the will of God and can
   quote the words of St. Martin; [315]   should these desires become very
   oppressive, the thoughts may be turned to some other matter. As such
   longings are generally found in persons far advanced in perfection, the
   devil may excite them in order to make us think we are of their
   number--in any case it is well to be cautious. For my part, I do not
   believe he could cause the calm and peace given by this pain to the
   soul, but would disturb it by such uneasiness as we feel when afflicted
   concerning any worldly matter. A person inexperienced in both kinds of
   sorrow cannot understand the difference, but thinking such grief an
   excellent thing, will excite it as much as possible which greatly
   injures the health, as these longings are incessant or at least very
   frequent.

   7. You must also notice that bodily weakness may cause such pain,
   especially with people of sensitive characters who cry over every
   trifling trouble. [316]   Times without number do they imagine they are
   mourning for God's sake when they are doing no such thing. If for a
   considerable space of time, whenever such a person hears the least
   mention of God or thinks of Him at all, these fits of uncontrollable
   weeping occur, [317]   the cause may be an accumulation of humour round
   the heart, which has a great deal more to do with such tears than has
   the love of God. Such persons seem as if they would never stop crying:
   believing that tears are beneficial, they do not try to check them nor
   to distract their minds from the subject, but encourage them as much as
   possible. The devil seizes this opportunity of weakening nuns so that
   they become unable to pray or to keep their Rule.

   8. I think you must be puzzling over this and would like to ask what I
   would have you do, as I see danger in everything. If I am afraid of
   delusions in so good a thing as tears, perhaps I myself am deluded, and
   may be I am! But believe me, I do not say this without having witnessed
   it in other people although not in my own case, for there is nothing
   tender about me and my heart is so hard as often to grieve me. [318]
   However, when the fire burns fiercely within, stony as my heart may be,
   it distils like an alembic. [319]   It is easy to know when tears come
   from this source, for they are soothing and gentle rather than stormy
   and rarely do any harm. This delusion, when it is one, has the
   advantage, with a humble person, of only injuring the body and not the
   soul. But if one is not humble, it is well to be ever on one's guard.

   9. Let us not fancy that if we cry a great deal we have done all that
   is needed--rather we must work hard and practise the virtues: that is
   the essential--leaving tears to fall when God sends them, without
   trying to force ourselves to shed them. Then, if we do not take too
   much notice of them, they will leave the parched soil of our souls well
   watered, making it fertile in good fruit; for this is the water which
   falls from heaven. [320]   However we may tire ourselves in digging to
   reach it, we shall never get any water like this; indeed, we may often
   work and search until we are exhausted without finding as much as a
   pool, much less a springing well!

   10. Therefore, sisters, I think it best for us to place ourselves in
   the presence of God, contemplate His mercy and grandeur and our own
   vileness and leave Him to give us what He will, whether water or
   drought, for He knows best what is good for us; thus we enjoy peace and
   the devil will have less chance to deceive us.

   11. Amongst these favours, at once painful and pleasant, Our Lord
   sometimes causes in the soul a certain jubilation [321]   and a strange
   and mysterious kind of prayer. If He bestows this grace on you, praise
   Him fervently for it; I describe it so that you may know that it is
   something real. I believe that the faculties of the soul are closely
   united to God but that He leaves them at liberty to rejoice in their
   happiness together with the senses, although they do not know what they
   are enjoying nor how they do so. This may sound nonsense but it really
   happens. So excessive is its jubilee that the soul will not enjoy it
   alone but speaks of it to all around so that they may help it to praise
   God, which is its one desire. [322]

   12. Oh, what rejoicings would this person utter and what demonstrations
   would she make, if possible, so that all might know her happiness! She
   seems to have found herself again and wishes, like the father of the
   prodigal son, to invite all her friends to feast with her [323]   and
   to see her soul in its rightful place, because (at least for the time
   being) she cannot doubt its security. I believe she is right, for the
   devil could not possibly infuse a joy and peace into the very centre of
   her being which make her whole delight consist in urging others to
   praise God. It requires a painful effort to keep silent and to
   dissemble such impulsive happiness. St. Francis must have experienced
   this when, as the robbers met him rushing through the fields crying
   aloud, he told them in answer to their questions that he was the herald
   of the great King.' [324]   So felt other saints who retired into the
   deserts so that, like St. Francis, they might proclaim the praises of
   their God.

   13. I knew Fray Peter of Alcantara who used to do this. I believe he
   was a saint on account of the life he led, yet people often took him
   for a fool when they heard him. [325]   Oh happy folly, sisters! Would
   that God might let us all share it! What mercy He has shown you in
   placing you where, if He gave you this grace and it were perceived by
   others, it would rather turn to your advantage than bring on you
   contempt as it would do in the world, where men so rarely hear God
   praised that it is no wonder they take scandal at it.

   14. Oh miserable times and wretched life spent in the world! How blest
   are those whose happy lot it is to be freed from them! [326]   It often
   delights me, when in my sisters' company to see how the joy of their
   hearts is so great that they vie with one another in praising our Lord
   for placing them in this convent: it is evident that their praises come
   from the very depths of their souls. I should like you to do this
   often, sisters, for when one begins she incites the rest to imitate
   her. How can your tongues be better employed when you are together than
   in praising God, Who has given us so much cause for it?

   15. May His Majesty often grant us this kind of prayer which is most
   safe and beneficial; we cannot acquire it for ourselves as it is quite
   supernatural. Sometimes it lasts for a whole day and the soul is like
   one inebriated, although not deprived of the senses; [327]   nor like a
   person afflicted with melancholia, [328]   in which, though the reason
   is not entirely lost, the imagination continually dwells on some
   subject which possesses it and from which it cannot be freed. These are
   coarse comparisons to make in connection with such a precious gift, yet
   nothing else occurs to my mind. In this state of prayer a person is
   rendered by this jubilee so forgetful of self and everything else that
   she can neither think nor speak of anything but praising God, to which
   her joy prompts her. Let us all of us join her, my daughters, for why
   should we wish to be wiser than she? What can make us happier? And may
   all creatures unite their praises with ours for ever and ever. Amen,
   amen, amen!

  CHAPTER VII.

   DESCRIBES THE GRIEF FELT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SINS BY SOULS ON WHOM GOD
   HAS BESTOWED THE BEFORE-MENTIONED FAVOURS. SHOWS THAT HOWEVER SPIRITUAL
   A PERSON MAY BE, IT IS A GREAT ERROR NOT TO KEEP BEFORE OUR MIND THE
   HUMANITY OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST AND HIS SACRED PASSION
   AND LIFE, AS ALSO THE GLORIOUS MOTHER OF GOD AND THE SAINTS. THE
   BENEFITS GAINED BY SUCH A MEDITATION. THIS CHAPTER IS MOST PROFITABLE.

   1. Sorrow for sin felt by souls in the Sixth Mansion. 2. How this
   sorrow is felt. 3. St. Teresa's grief for her past sins. 4. Such souls,
   centred in God, forget self-interest. 5. The remembrance of divine
   benefits increases contrition. 6. Meditation on our Lord's Humanity. 7.
   Warning against discontinuing it. 8. Christ and the saints our models.
   9. Meditation of contemplatives. 10. Meditation during aridity. 11. We
   must search for God when we do not feel His presence. 12. Reasoning and
   mental prayer. 13. A form of meditation on our Lord's Life and Passion.
   14. Simplicity of contemplatives' meditation. 15. Souls in every state
   of prayer should think of the Passion. 16. Need of the example of
   Christ and the saints. 17. Faith shows us our Lord as both God and Man.
   18. St. Teresa's experience of meditation on the sacred Humanity. 19.
   Evil of giving up such meditation.

   1. IT may seem to you, sisters, that souls to whom God has communicated
   Himself in such a special manner may feel so sure of enjoying Him for
   ever as no longer to require to fear or to mourn over their past sins.
   Those of you will be most apt to hold this opinion who have never
   received the like favours; souls to whom God has granted these graces
   will understand what I say. This is a great mistake, for sorrow for sin
   increases in proportion to the divine grace received and I believe will
   never quit us until we come to the land where nothing can grieve us any
   more. Doubtless we feel this pain more at one time than at another and
   it is of a different kind. A soul so advanced as that we speak of does
   not think of the punishment threatening its offences but of its great
   ingratitude towards Him to Whom it owes so much [329]   and Who so
   justly deserves that it should serve Him, for the sublime mysteries
   revealed have taught it much about the greatness of God.

   2. This soul wonders at its former temerity and weeps over its
   irreverence; its foolishness in the past seems a madness which it never
   ceases to lament as it remembers for what vile things it forsook so
   great a Sovereign. The thoughts dwell on this more than on the favours
   received, which, like those I am about to describe, are so powerful
   that they seem to rush through the soul at times like a strong, swift
   river. Yet the sins remain like the mire in the river bed and dwell
   constantly in the memory, making a heavy cross to bear.

   3. I know some one who, though she had ceased to wish for death in
   order to see God, [330]   yet desired it that she might be freed from
   her continual regret for her past ingratitude towards Him to Whom she
   owed, and always would owe, so much. She thought no one's guilt could
   be compared to her own, for she felt there could be none with whom God
   had borne so patiently nor on whom He had bestowed such graces.

   4. Souls that have reached the state I speak of have ceased to fear
   hell. At times, though very rarely, they grieve keenly over the
   possibility of their losing God; their sole dread is lest He should
   withdraw His hand, allowing them to offend Him, and so they might
   return to their former miserable condition. They care nothing for their
   own pain or glory; if they are anxious not to stay long in Purgatory,
   it is more on account of its keeping them from the Presence of God than
   because of its torments. Whatever favours God may have shown a soul, I
   think it is dangerous for it to forget the unhappy state it was once
   in; painful as the remembrance may be, it is most beneficial.

   5. Perhaps I think so because I have been so wicked and that may be the
   reason why I never forget my sins; people who have led good lives have
   no cause for grief; yet we always fall at times whilst living in this
   mortal body. This pain is not lessened by reflecting that our Lord has
   already forgiven and forgotten our faults; our grief is rather
   increased at seeing such kindness and favours bestowed on one who
   deserves nothing but hell. I think St. Paul and the Magdalen must thus
   have suffered a cruel martyrdom; [331]   their love was intense, they
   had received many mercies and realized the greatness and the majesty of
   God and so must have found it very hard to bear the remembrance of
   their sins, which they must have regretted with a most tender sorrow.

   6. You may fancy that one who has enjoyed such high favours need not
   meditate on the mysteries of the most sacred Humanity of our Lord Jesus
   Christ but will be wholly absorbed in love. I have written fully about
   this elsewhere. [332]   I have been contradicted and told that I was
   wrong and did not understand the matter; that our Lord guides souls in
   such a way that after having made progress it is best to exercise
   oneself in matters concerning the Godhead and to avoid what is
   corporeal; yet nothing will make me admit that this latter is a good
   way.

   7. I may be mistaken; we may all really mean the same thing but I found
   the devil was trying to lead me astray in this manner. Having been
   warned by experience in this respell, I have decided to speak again
   about it here although I have very often done so elsewhere. [333]   Be
   most cautious on the subject; attend to what I venture to say about it
   and do not believe any one who tells you the contrary. I will endeavour
   to explain myself more clearly than I did before. If the person who
   undertook to write on the matter had treated it more explicitly he
   would have done well, for it may do much harm to speak of it in general
   terms to us women, who have scanty wits.

   8. Some souls imagine they cannot meditate even on the Passion, still
   less on the most blessed Virgin or on the saints, the memory of whose
   lives greatly benefits and strengthens us. [334]   I cannot think what
   such persons are to meditate upon, for to withdraw the thoughts from
   all corporeal things like the angelic spirits who are always inflamed
   with love, is not possible for us while in this mortal flesh; we need
   to study, to meditate upon and to imitate those who, mortals like
   ourselves, performed such heroic deeds for God. How much less should we
   wilfully endeavour to abstain from thinking of our only good and
   remedy, the most sacred Humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ? I cannot
   believe that any one really does this; they misunderstand their own
   minds and so harm both themselves and others. Of this at least I can
   assure them: they will never thus enter the last two mansions of the
   castle. If they lose their Guide, our good Jesus, they cannot find the
   way and it will be much if they have stayed safely in the former
   mansions. Our Lord Himself tells us that He is the Way'; He also says
   that He is the Light'; that no man cometh to the Father but by Him; and
   that He that seeth Me, seeth the Father also.' [335]

   9. Such persons tell us that these words have some other meaning; I
   know of no other meaning but this, which my soul has ever recognized as
   the true one and which has always suited me right well. Some people
   (many of whom have spoken to me on the subject) after our Lord has once
   raised them to perfect contemplation, wish to enjoy it continually.
   This is impossible; still, the grace of this state remains in their
   souls in such a way that they cannot reason as before on the mysteries
   of the Passion and the Life of Christ. I cannot account for it but it
   is very usual for the mind thus to remain less apt for meditation. I
   think it must be because, as the one end of meditation is to seek God,
   after He has once been found and the soul is accustomed to seek Him
   again by means of the will, it no longer wearies itself by searching
   for Him with the intellect.

   10. It also appears to me that as the will is already inflamed with
   love, this generous faculty would, if it could, cease to make use of
   the reason. This would be well, were it not impossible, especially
   before the soul has reached the last two mansions. [336]   Time spent
   in prayer would thus be lost as the will often needs the use of the
   understanding to rekindle its love. Notice this point, sisters, which
   as it is important I will explain more fully. Such a soul desires to
   spend all its time in loving God and wishes to do nothing else; but it
   cannot succeed, for though the will is not dead yet the flame which
   kindled it is dying out and the spark needs fanning into a glow. Ought
   the soul to remain quiescent in this aridity, waiting like our father
   Elias for fire to descend from heaven [337]   to consume the sacrifice
   which it makes of itself to God? Certainly not; it is not right to
   expect miracles; God will work them for this soul when He chooses. As I
   have told you already and shall do again, His Majesty wishes us to hold
   ourselves unworthy of their being wrought on our account and desires us
   to help ourselves to the best of our abilities.

   11. In my opinion we ought during our whole life, to act in this
   manner, however sublime our prayer may be. True, those whom our Lord
   admits into the seventh mansion rarely or never need thus to help their
   fervour, for the reason I will tell you of; if I recollect it when I
   come to write of this room where, in a wonderful manner, souls are
   constantly in the company of Christ our Lord both in His Humanity and
   His Divinity. [338]   Thus, when the fire in our hearts, of which I
   spoke does not burn in the will, nor do we feel the presence of God, we
   must search for Him as He would have us do, like the Bride in the
   Canticles, [339]   and must ask all creatures who it was that made
   them;' as St. Augustine (either in his Soliloquies or his Confessions)
   tells us that he did. [340]   Thus we shall not stand like blockheads,
   wasting our time in waiting for what we before enjoyed. At first, it
   may be that our Lord will not renew His gift again for a year or even
   for many years; His Majesty knows the reason which we should not try to
   discover since there is no need for us to understand it.

   12. As most certainly the way to please God is to keep the commandments
   and counsels, let us do so diligently, while meditating on His life and
   death and all we owe Him; then let the rest be as God chooses. Some may
   answer that their mind refuses to dwell on these subjects; and for the
   above causes, this to a certain extent is true. You know that it is one
   thing to reason and another thing for the memory to bring certain
   truths before the mind. Perhaps you may not understand me; possibly I
   fail to express myself rightly but I will do my best. Using the
   understanding much in this manner is what I call meditation.

   13. Let us begin by considering the mercy God showed us by giving us
   His only Son; let us not stop here but go on to reflect upon all the
   mysteries of His glorious life; or let us first turn our thoughts to
   His prayer in the garden, then allow them to continue the subject until
   they reach the crucifixion. Or we may take some part of the Passion
   such as Christ's apprehension and dwell on this mystery, considering in
   detail the points to be pondered and thought over, such as the
   treachery of Judas, the flight of the Apostles, and all that followed.
   This is an admirable and very meritorious kind of prayer. [341]

   14. Souls led by God in supernatural ways and raised to perfect
   contemplation are right in declaring they cannot practise this kind of
   meditation. As I said, I know not why, but as a rule they are unable to
   do so. Yet they would be wrong in saying that they cannot dwell on
   these mysteries nor frequently think about them, especially when these
   events are being celebrated by the Catholic Church. Nor is it possible
   for the soul which has received so much from God to forget these
   precious proofs of His love which are living sparks to inflame the
   heart with greater love for our Lord, nor can the mind fail to
   understand them. Such a soul comprehends these mysteries, which are
   brought before the mind and stamped on the memory in a more perfect way
   than with other people, so that the mere sight of our Lord prostrate in
   the garden, covered with His terrible sweat, suffices to engross the
   thoughts not merely for an hour but for several days. The soul looks
   with a simple gaze upon Who He is and how ungratefully we treat Him in
   return for such terrible sufferings. Then the will, although perhaps
   without sensible tenderness, desires to render Him some service for
   such sublime mercies and longs to suffer something for Him Who bore so
   much for us, employing itself in similar considerations in which the
   memory and understanding also take their part.

   15. I think this is why such souls cannot reason connectedly about the
   Passion and fancy they are unable to mediate on it. Those who do not
   meditate on this subject had better begin to do so; for I know that it
   will not impede the most sublime prayer nor is it well to omit praising
   this often. If God then sees fit to enrapture them, well and good; even
   if they are reluctant, He will make them cease to meditate. I am
   certain that this way of king is most helpful to the soul and not the
   hindrance it would become were great efforts made to use the intellect.
   This, as I said, I believe cannot be done when a higher state of prayer
   is attained. It may be otherwise in some cases, for God leads souls in
   many different ways. Let not those be blamed, however, who are unable
   to discourse much in prayer, nor should they be judged incapable of
   enjoying the great graces contained in the mysteries of Jesus Christ,
   our only Good, which no one, however spiritual he may be, can persuade
   me it is well to omit contemplating. 16. There are souls who, having
   made a beginning, or advanced half-way, when they begin to experience
   the prayer of quiet and to taste the sweetness and consolations God
   gives, think it is a great thing to enjoy these spiritual pleasures
   continually. Let them, as I advised elsewhere, cease to give themselves
   up so much to this absorption. Life is long and full of crosses and we
   have need to look on Christ our pattern, to see how He bore His trials,
   and even to take example by His Apostles and saints if we would bear
   our own trials perfectly. Our good Jesus and His most blessed Mother
   are too good company to be left and He is well pleased if we grieve at
   His pains, even though sometimes at the cost of our own consolations
   and joys. [342]   Besides, daughters, consolations are not so frequent
   in prayer that we have no time for this as well. If any one should tell
   me she continually enjoys them, and that she is one of those who can
   never meditate on the divine mysteries, I should feel very doubtful
   about her state. Be convinced of this; keep free from this deception
   and to the utmost of your power stop yourselves from being constantly
   immersed in this intoxication. If you cannot do so, tell the Prioress
   so that she may employ you too busily for you to think of the matter;
   thus you will be free from this danger which, if it does no more, when
   it lasts long, greatly injures the health and brain. I have said enough
   to prove to those who require it that, however spiritual their state,
   it is an error so to avoid thinking of corporeal things as to imagine
   that meditation on the most sacred Humanity can injure the soul.

   17. People allege, in defence, that our Lord told His disciples that it
   was expedient for them that He should go from them. [343]   This I
   cannot admit. He did not say so to His blessed Mother, for her faith
   was firm. She knew He was both God and man; and although she loved Him
   more dearly than did His disciples, it was in so perfect a way that His
   bodily presence was a help to her. The faith of the Apostles must have
   been weaker than it was later on, and than ours has reason to be. I
   assure you, daughters, that I consider this a most dangerous idea
   whereby the devil might end by robbing us of our devotion to the most
   blessed Sacrament.

   18. The mistake I formerly made [344]   did not lead me as far as this,
   but I did not care so much about meditating on our Lord Jesus Christ,
   preferring to remain absorbed, awaiting spiritual consolations. I
   recognized clearly that I was going wrong, for as I could not always
   keep in this state, my thoughts wandered hither and thither and my soul
   seemed like a bird, ever flying about and finding no place for rest.
   Thus I lost much time and did not advance in virtue nor make progress
   in prayer.

   19. I did not understand the reason, and as I believed that I was
   acting wisely I think I should never have learnt it but for the advice
   of a servant of God whom I consulted about my mode of prayer. Then I
   perceived plainly how mistaken I had been and I have never ceased
   regretting that there was a time when I did not realize how difficult
   it would be to gain by so great a loss. Even if I could, I would seek
   for nothing save by Him through Whom comes all the good we possess. May
   He be for ever praised! Amen.

   meditation upon it will help us up to all good, and it is by it we
   shall ascend most easily to the highest state of union. It is evident
   at once that, while all visible and bodily things ought to be

   and the whole air with its inhabitants answered: 'Anaximenes was

   say they, are we the God Whom thou seekest.' And I replied unto all

  CHAPTER VIII.

   SPEAKS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH GOD COMMUNICATES WITH THE SOUL BY
   INTELLECTUAL VISION AND GIVES ADVICE UPON THE SUBJECT. OF THE EFFECTS
   PRODUCED BY THIS VISION WHEN GENUINE. SECRECY ABOUT THESE FAVOURS IS
   ENJOINED.

   1. Our Lord's presence accompanying the soul. 2. St. Teresa's
   experience of this. 3. Confidence and graces resulting from this
   vision. 4. Its effects . 5. It Produces humility. 6. And prepares the
   soul for other graces. 7. Consciousness of the presence of the saints.
   8. Obligations resulting from this grace. 9. Signs that this favour is
   genuine. 10. A confessor should be consulted. 11. Our Lord will
   enlighten our advisers. 12. Cautions about this vision.

   1. To prove to you more clearly, sisters, the truth of what I have been
   saying and to show that the more the soul advances, the closer does
   this good Jesus bear it company, it would be well for me to tell you
   how, when He so chooses, it cannot withdraw from His presence. This is
   clearly shown by the manners and ways in which His Majesty communicates
   Himself to us, manifesting His love by wonderful apparitions and
   visions which, if He is pleased to aid me, I will describe to you so
   that you may not be alarmed if any of these favours are granted you. We
   ought, even if we do not receive them ourselves, to praise Him
   fervently for thus communing with creatures, seeing how sovereign are
   His majesty and power.

   2. For example, a person who is in no way expecting such a favour nor
   has ever imagined herself worthy of receiving it, is conscious that
   Jesus Christ stands by her side although she sees Him neither with the
   eyes of the body nor of the soul. [345]   This is called an
   intellectual vision; I cannot tell why. I knew a person to whom God
   granted both this grace and others I shall describe later on. At first
   it distressed her, for she could not understand it; she could see
   nothing, yet so convinced did she feel that Jesus Christ was thus in
   some way manifesting Himself that she could not doubt that it was some
   kind of vision, whether it came from God or no. Its powerful effects
   were a strong argument that it was from Him; still she was alarmed,
   never having heard of an intellectual vision, nor was she aware that
   such a thing could be. She however felt certain of our Lord's presence,
   [346]   and He spoke to her several times in the way that I described.
   Before she had received this favour, she had heard words spoken but had
   never known who uttered them.

   3. She was frightened by this vision which, unlike an imaginary one,
   does not pass away quickly but lasts for several days and even
   sometimes for more than a year. She went, in a state of great anxiety,
   to her confessor [347]   who asked her how, if she saw nothing, she
   knew that our Lord was near her, and bade her describe His appearance.
   She said that she was unable to do so, nor could she see His face nor
   tell more than she had already done, but that she was sure it was the
   fact that it was He Who spoke to her and it was no trick of her
   imagination. Although people constantly cautioned her against this
   vision, as a rule she found it impossible to disbelieve in it,
   especially when she heard the words: It is I, be not afraid' [348]

   4. The effect of this speech was so powerful that for the time being
   she could not doubt its truth. She felt much encouraged and rejoiced at
   being in such good company, seeing that this favour greatly helped her
   to a constant recollection of God and an extreme care not to displease
   in any way Him Who seemed ever by her side, watching her. Whenever she
   desired to speak to His Majesty in prayer, or even at other times, He
   seemed so close that He could not fail to hear her though He did not
   speak to her whenever she wished, but unexpectedly, when necessity
   arose. She was conscious of His being at her right hand, although not
   in the way we know an ordinary person to be beside us but in a more
   subtle manner which cannot be described. Yet this presence is quite as
   evident and certain, and indeed far more so, than the ordinary presence
   of other people about which we may be deceived; not so in this, for it
   brings with it graces and spiritual effects which could not come from
   melancholia. Nor could the devil thus fill the soul with peace, with a
   constant desire to please God, and such utter contempt of all that does
   not lead to Him. As time went on, my friend recognized that this was no
   work of the evil one, as our Lord showed her more and more clearly.

   5. However, I know that she often felt great alarm and was at times
   overcome with confusion, being unable to account for so high a favour
   having been granted her. She and I were so very intimate [349]   that I
   knew all that passed in her soul, hence my account is thoroughly true
   and reliable. This favour brings with it an overwhelming sense of
   self-abasement and humility; the reverse would be the case, did it come
   from Satan. [350]   It is evidently divine; no human effort could
   produce such feelings nor could any one suppose that such profit came
   from herself, but must needs recognize it as a gift from the hand of
   God.

   6. Although I believe some of the former favours are more sublime, yet
   this brings with it a special knowledge of God; a most tender love for
   Him results from being constantly in His company, while the desires of
   devoting one's whole being to His service are more fervent than any
   hitherto described. The conscience is greatly purified by the knowledge
   of His perpetual and near presence, for although we know that God sees
   all we do, yet nature inclines us to grow careless and forgetful of it.
   This is impossible here since our Lord makes the soul conscious that He
   is close at hand, thus preparing it to receive the other graces
   mentioned by constantly making acts of love to Him Whom it sees or
   feels at its side. In short, the benefits caused by this grace prove
   how great and how valuable it is. The soul thanks our Lord for
   bestowing it on one unworthy of it, but who would refuse to exchange it
   for any earthly riches or delight.

   7. When our Lord chooses to withdraw His presence, the soul in its
   loneliness makes every possible effort to induce Him to return. This
   avails but little, for this grace comes at His will and not by our
   endeavours. At times we may enjoy the company of some saint, [351]
   which also brings us great profit. You will ask me, if we see no one,
   how can we know whether it is Christ, or His most glorious Mother, or a
   saint? Such a person cannot answer this question or know how she
   distinguishes them, but the fact remains undoubted. It seems easy to
   recognize our Lord when He speaks, but it is surprising how the soul
   can, without hearing a word from him, recognize which saint has been
   sent by God to be its companion and helper.

   8. There are other spiritual matters which cannot be explained. Our
   inability to grasp them should teach us how incapable is our nature of
   understanding the sublime mysteries of God. Those on whom these favours
   are bestowed should marvel at and praise God's mercy for them. As these
   particular graces are not granted to everybody, any one who receives
   them should esteem them highly and strive to serve God more zealously,
   since He has given her such special aid. Therefore such a person does
   not rate herself more highly on this account, but rather thinks she
   serves Him less than any one else in the world; feeling herself to be
   under greater obligations to Him than others, any fault she commits
   pierces her to the heart, as indeed it ought under the circumstances.

   9. When the effects described are felt, any of you whom our Lord leads
   by this way may be certain that it is neither deception nor fancy in
   her case. I believe it to be impossible for the devil to produce an
   illusion lasting so long, neither could he benefit the soul so
   remarkably nor cause such interior peace. It is not his custom, nor, if
   he would, could such an evil creature bring about so much good; the
   soul would soon be clouded by self-esteem and the idea that it was
   better than others. The mind's continual keeping in the presence of God
   [352]   and the concentration of its thoughts on Him would so enrage
   the fiend that, although he might try the experiment once, he would not
   often repeat it. God is too faithful to permit him so much power over
   one whose sole endeavour is to please His Majesty and to lay down her
   life for His honour and glory; He would soon unmask the demon's
   artifices.

   10. I contend, as I always shall, that if the soul reaps the effects
   described from these divine graces, although God may withdraw these
   special favours, His Majesty will turn all things to its advantage;
   even should He permit the devil to deceive it at any time, the evil
   spirit will only reap his own confusion. Therefore, as I told you,
   daughters, none of you who are led by this way need feel alarm. Fear is
   good and we should be cautious and not overconfident, for if such
   favours made you careless, it would prove they were not from God as
   they did not leave the results I described. It would be well at first
   to tell your case, under the seal of confession, to a thoroughly
   qualified theologian (for that is the source whence we must obtain
   light) or to some highly spiritual person. If your confessor is not
   very spiritual, a good theologian would be preferable; [353]   best of
   all, one who unites both qualities. [354]   Do not be disturbed if he
   calls it mere fancy; if it is, it can neither harm nor benefit your
   soul much. Recommend yourself to the divine Majesty and beg Him not to
   allow you to be misled.

   11. It would be worse should he tell you the devil is deceiving you,
   although no learned man would say so if he sees in you the effects
   described. Even should your adviser say this, I know that the same Lord
   Who is beside you will comfort and reassure you and will go to your
   counsellor and give him light that he may impart it to you. [355]   If
   the director, though given to prayer, has not been led by God in this
   way, he will at once take fright and condemn it. Therefore I advise you
   to choose a qualified theologian and, if possible, one who is also
   spiritual. The Prioress ought to allow you this, for although she may
   feel sure that you are safe from delusion because you lead a good life,
   yet she is bound to permit you to consult some one for your mutual
   security. When you have conferred with these persons, be at peace;
   trouble yourself no more about the matter, for sometimes when there is
   no cause for fear, the demon gives rise to such immoderate scruples
   that the person cannot be satisfied with consulting her confessor only
   once on the subject, especially if he is inexperienced and timid or if
   he bids her consult him again.

   12. Thus that which should have been kept strictly private becomes
   public; [356]   such a person is persecuted and tormented and finds
   that what she believed to be her own secret has become public property.
   Hence she suffers many troubles which may even devolve upon the Order
   in such times as these. Consequently I warn all Prioresses that great
   caution is required in such matters; also they must not think a nun
   more virtuous than the rest because such favours are shown her. Our
   Lord guides every one, in the way He knows to be best. This grace, if
   made good use of, prepares one receiving it to become a great servant
   of God, but sometimes our Lord bestows it on the weakest souls;
   therefore in itself it is neither to be esteemed nor condemned. We must
   look to the virtues; she who is most mortified, humble and
   single-minded in serving God is the most holy. However, we can never
   feel very certain about such matters until the true Judge rewards each
   one according to his merits. Then we shall be surprised to find how
   very different is His judgment from that of this world. May He be for
   ever praised. Amen.

  CHAPTER IX.

   THIS CHAPTER SPEAKS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH GOD COMMUNICATES WITH THE
   SOUL BY IMAGINARY VISIONS. STRONG REASONS ARE GIVEN FOR NOT DESIRING TO
   BE LED IN THIS WAY; THIS IS VERY PROFITABLE READING.

   1. The jewel in the locket. 2. The simile explained. 3. The apparition
   explained. 4. Awe produced by this vision. 5. False and genuine
   visions. 6. Illusive visions. 7. Effects of a genuine vision. 8.
   Conviction left by a genuine vision. 9. Its effects upon the after
   conduct. 10. A confessor should be consulted. 11. How to treat visions.
   12. Effects of seeing the face of Christ. 13. Reasons why visions are
   not to be sought. 14. The second reason. 15. Third reason. 16. Fourth
   reason. 17. Fifth reason. 18. Sixth reason. 19. Additional reasons. 20.
   The virtues more meritorious than consolations. 21. Fervent souls
   desire to serve God for Himself alone.

   1. Now we come to treat of imaginary visions, whereby it is held that
   the devil is more liable to deceive people than by the other visions I
   have already described. This is probably true. Yet when imaginary
   visions are divine, they seem, in a certain manner, more profitable for
   us than the others, as being more suited to our nature--with the
   exception of the visions sent by our Lord in the seventh mansion which
   far surpass all others. The presence of our Lord described in the last
   chapter may thus be symbolized. Let us suppose that we have in our
   possession a gold locket containing a precious stone of the highest
   value and powers, which, though we have not seen it, we are certain is
   in the case, and its virtues benefit us when we wear the pendant.
   Although we have never gazed on it we value it highly, knowing by
   experience that it has cured us of maladies for which it is remedial.
   However, we dare not look at it nor open the locket nor could we do so
   even if we wished, for the owner of the jewel alone knows the secret of
   unfastening its casket. Although he lent it us for our use, yet he kept
   the key for himself; he will open the trinket when he chooses to show
   us its contents and close it again when he sees fit to do so.

   2. Our Lord treats us here in this way. Now, suppose the owner of this
   locket suddenly opened it at times for the benefit of the person to
   whom he has entrusted it; doubtless the latter would value the diamond
   more highly through remembering its wonderful lustre. This may be
   compared to what happens when our Lord is pleased to caress the soul.
   He shows it in vision His most sacred Humanity under whatever form He
   chooses; either as He was during His life on earth [357]   or after His
   resurrection. [358]   The vision passes as quickly as a flash of
   lightning, yet this most glorious picture makes an impression on the
   imagination that I believe can never be effaced until the soul at last
   sees Christ to enjoy Him for ever. Although I call it a picture,' you
   must not imagine that it looks like a painting; Christ appears as a
   living Person Who sometimes speaks and reveals deep mysteries. You must
   understand that though the soul sees this for a certain space of time,
   it is no more possible to continue looking at it than to gaze for a
   very long time on the sun; therefore this vision passes very quickly,
   although its brightness does not pain the interior sight in the same
   way as the sun's glare injures our bodily eyes.

   3. The image is seen by the interior sight alone; but of bodily
   apparitions I can say nothing, for the person I know so intimately
   never having experienced anything of the kind herself could not speak
   about them with certainty. [359]   The splendour of Him Who is revealed
   in the vision resembles an infused light like that of the sun covered
   with a veil as transparent as a diamond, if such a texture could be
   woven, while His raiment looks like fine linen. The soul to whom God
   grants this vision almost always falls into an ecstasy, nature being
   too weak to bear so dread a sight. I say dread,' though this apparition
   is more lovely and delightful than anything that could be imagined even
   though any one should live a thousand years and spend all that time in
   trying to picture it, for it far surpasses our limited imagination and
   understanding; yet the presence of such surpassing majesty inspires the
   soul with great fear.

   4. There is no need to ask how the soul knew Who He was or who declared
   with absolute certainty that He was the Lord of heaven and earth. This
   is not so with earthly kings; unless we were told their names or saw
   their attendant courtiers, they would attract little notice. O Lord,
   how little do we Christians know Thee! What will that day be in which
   Thou comest as our Judge, since now, when Thou comest as a Friend to
   Thy spouse, the sight of Thee strikes us with such awe? O daughters!
   what will it be when He says in wrath: Go, accursed of my Father?'
   [360] Let this impression be the result of this favour granted by God
   to the soul and we shall reap no little benefit from it, since St.
   Jerome, saint as he was, ever kept the thought of the last judgment
   before his eyes. [361]   Thus we shall care nothing what sufferings we
   endure from the austerities of our Rule, for long as they may last, the
   time is but a moment compared to this eternity of pain. I sincerely
   assure you that, wicked as I am, I have never feared the torments of
   hell [362]   for they have seemed to me as nothing when I remembered
   that the lost would see the beautiful, meek and pitiful eyes of our
   Lord turned on them in wrath. [363]   I have thought all my life that
   this would be more than my heart could bear.

   5. How much more must any one fear this to whom our Lord so revealed
   Himself in vision here as to overcome her feelings and produce
   unconsciousness! This must be the reason that the soul remains in a
   rapture: our Lord strengthens its weakness so as to unite it to His
   greatness in this sublime communion with God. When any one can
   contemplate this sight of our Lord for a long time, I do not believe it
   is a vision but rather some overmastering idea which causes the
   imagination to fancy it sees something; but this illusion is only like
   a dead image in comparison with the living reality of the other case.

   6. As not only three or four, but a large number of people have spoken
   to me on the subject, I know by experience that there are souls which,
   either because they possess vivid imaginations or active minds, or for
   some other reason of which I am ignorant, are so absorbed in their own
   ideas as to feel certain they see whatever their fancy imagines. If
   they had ever beheld a genuine vision, they would recognize the
   deception unmistakably. They themselves fabricate, piece by piece, what
   they fancy they see: no after effects are produced on the mind, which
   is less moved to devotion than by the sight of a sacred picture. It is
   clear that no attention should be paid to such fancies, which pass more
   quickly than dreams from the memory.

   7. In the favour of which I speak, the case is very different. A person
   is far from thinking of seeing anything, no idea of which has crossed
   the mind, when suddenly the vision is revealed in its entirety, causing
   within the powers and senses of the soul a fright and confusion soon
   changed into a blissful peace. Thus, after St. Paul was thrown to the
   ground, a great tempest and noise followed from heaven; [364]   so, in
   the interior world of the soul, there is a violent tumult followed
   instantly, as I said, by perfect calm. Meanwhile certain sublime truths
   have been so impressed on the mind that it needs no other master, for
   with no effort of its own, Wisdom Himself has enlightened its former
   ignorance.

   8. The soul for some time afterwards possesses such certainty that this
   grace comes from God that whatever people may say to the contrary it
   cannot fear delusion. Later on, when her confessor suggests doubts to
   her, God may allow such a person to waver in her belief for a time and
   to feel misgivings lest, in punishment for her sins, she may possibly
   have been left to go astray. However, she does not give way to these
   apprehensions, but (as I said in speaking of other matters) [365]
   they only affect her in the same way as the temptations of the devil
   against faith, which may disturb the mind but do not shake the firmness
   of belief. In fact, the more severe the assault, [366]   the more
   certain is she that the evil one could never have produced the great
   benefits she is conscious of having received, because he exercises no
   such power over the interior of the soul. He may present a false
   apparition but it does not possess such truth, majesty, and efficacy.

   9. As confessors cannot see these effects, which perhaps the person to
   whom God has shown the vision is unable to explain, they are afraid of
   deception, as indeed they have good reason to be. Therefore caution is
   necessary and time should be allowed to see what effects follow. Day by
   day, the progress of the soul in humility and in the virtues should be
   watched: if the devil is concerned in the matter, he will soon show
   signs of himself and will be detected in a thousand lies. If the
   confessor is experienced and has received such favours himself, he will
   not take long in discovering the truth. In fact, he will know
   immediately, on being told of the vision, whether it is divine or comes
   from the imagination or the demon: more especially if he has received
   the gift of discerning spirits--then, if he is learned, he will
   understand the matter at once even though he has not personally
   experienced the like.

   10. The great point is, sisters, that you should be perfectly candid
   and straightforward with your confessor: I do not mean in declaring
   your sins that is evident enough--but in giving him an account of your
   prayer. [367]   Unless you do this, I cannot assure you of your safety
   nor that you are led by God. Our Lord desires that we should be as
   truthful and open with those who stand in His place as we should with
   Himself; that we should wish them to know not only our thoughts but
   especially all relating to our actions, however insignificant. Then you
   need feel no trouble nor anxiety [368]   because even if your vision
   were not from God, it could do you no harm if you are humble and
   possess a good conscience, for His Majesty knows how to glean good from
   evil. What the devil intended to injure you will benefit you instead:
   believing that God has granted you such signal favours, you will strive
   to please Him better and will keep His image ever before your memory.

   11. A great theologian [369]   once said that he should not trouble
   himself though the devil, who is a clever painter, should present
   before his eyes the living image of Christ, which would only kindle his
   devotion and defeat the evil one with his own weapons. However wicked
   an artist may be, we should reverence his picture if it represents Him
   Who is our only good. This great scholar held that it was very wrong to
   advise any one who saw a vision of our Lord to offer it signs of scorn,
   [370]   because we are bound to show respect to the portrait of our
   King wherever we see it. I am sure that he was right, for even in the
   world any one who was on friendly terms with a person would take it as
   an offence were his portrait treated with contempt. How much more
   should we always show respect to a crucifix or a picture of our
   heavenly Sovereign wherever it meets our gaze! Although I have written
   about this elsewhere, I am glad of the opportunity of saying it now for
   I know some one who was deeply pained at being bidden to behave in this
   way. I know not who can have invented such a torture for one who felt
   bound to obey the counsel given by her confessor, for she would have
   thought her soul was at stake had she disobeyed him. My advice is, if
   you are given such an order, that humbly alleging the reasons I have
   set before you to your confessor, you should not carry it out. I am
   perfectly satisfied with the motives given for doing so by him who
   counselled me on this subject.

   12. One great advantage gained by the soul from this favour shown by
   our Lord is that when thinking of Him or of His life and Passion, the
   remembrance of His most meek and beautiful face brings with it the
   greatest consolation. In the same way, we feel happier after having
   seen a benefactor than if we had never known him personally. I can
   assure you that the remembrance of the joy caused by this vision gives
   us the greatest comfort and assistance.

   13. Many other advantages result; but as I have written elsewhere [371]
     at length about the effect these visions produce, and must do so
   again later on, I will say no more now lest I weary us both. But I most
   earnestly advise you, when you know or hear of God's bestowing these
   graces on others, never to pray nor desire to be led by this way
   yourself though it may appear to you to be very good; indeed, it ought
   to be highly esteemed and reverenced, yet no one should seek to go by
   it for several reasons. Firstly, as it is a want of humility to desire
   what you have never deserved, I do not think any one who longs for
   these graces can be really humble: a common labourer never dreams of
   wishing to be made a king--the thing seems impossible and he is unfit
   for it; a lowly mind has the same feeling about these divine favours. I
   do not believe God will ever bestow these gifts on such a person, as
   before doing so He always gives thorough self-knowledge. How can that
   soul, while filled with such lofty aspirations, realize the truth that
   He has shown it great mercy in not casting it into hell?

   14. The second reason is that such a one is certain to be deceived or
   at least is in great danger of delusion, for an entrance is thus left
   open to the devil, who only needs to see the door left ajar to slip in
   at once and play us a thousand tricks.

   15. Thirdly: when people strongly desire a thing, the imagination makes
   them fancy they see or hear it, just as when a man's mind is set upon a
   subject all day he dreams of it at night.

   16. Fourthly: it would be very presumptuous of me to choose a way for
   myself without knowing what is good for me. [372]   I should leave our
   Lord, Who knows my soul, to guide me as is best for me so that His will
   may be done in all things.

   17. Fifthly: do you think people on whom our Lord bestows these favours
   have little to suffer? No, indeed! their trials are most severe and of
   many kinds. How can you tell whether you would be able to bear them?

   18. Sixthly: perhaps what you think would be your gain might prove your
   loss, as happened to Saul when he was made king. [373]   In short,
   sisters, there are other reasons besides these; believe me, it is safer
   to wish only what God wishes, Who knows us better than we know
   ourselves and Who loves us. Let us place ourselves entirely in His
   hands so that His will may be done in us; we can never go astray if our
   will is ever firmly fixed on this.

   19. Know that for having received many favours of this kind, you will
   not merit more glory but will be the more stringently obliged to serve,
   since you have received more. God does not deprive us of anything by
   which we merit more, for this remains in our own control. There are
   many saints who never knew what it was to receive one such favour,
   while others who have received them are not saints at all. Do not
   imagine that these gifts are continually bestowed; indeed, for one that
   is granted, the soul bears many a cross, so that instead of longing to
   receive more favours, it only strives to use them better.

   20. True, such a grace is a most powerful aid towards practising the
   virtues in their highest perfection, but it is far more meritorious to
   gain them at the cost of one's own toil. I was acquainted with some
   one, [374]   indeed with two people (of whom one was a man), on whom
   our Lord had bestowed some of these gifts. They were both so desirous
   of serving His Majesty at their own cost without these great
   consolations and so longed to suffer for His sake, that they
   remonstrated with Him for giving them these favours, and if it had been
   possible would have refused to receive them. When I say consolations,'
   I do not mean these visions which greatly benefit the soul and are
   highly to be esteemed, but the delights given by God during
   contemplation.

   21. I believe that these desires are supernatural and proper to very
   fervent souls who wish to prove to God that they do not serve Him for
   pay; so as I said, such people do not urge themselves to work harder
   for Him by the thought of the glory they will gain, but rather labour
   to satisfy their love, of which the nature is to toil for the Beloved
   in a thousand ways. Such souls would fain find a way to consume
   themselves in Him, and were there need that, for the sake of God's
   greater glory, they should be annihilated for ever, they would count it
   great gain. May He be for ever praised Who, in abasing Himself to hold
   converse with us miserable creatures, vouchsafes to manifest His
   greatness! Amen.

  CHAPTER X.

   SPEAKS OF VARIOUS OTHER GRACES GOD BESTOWS ON THE SOUL IN DIFFERENT
   WAYS, AND OF THE GREAT BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THEM.

   1. Reasons for speaking of these supernatural favours. 2. An
   intellectual vision. 3. God compared to a palace in which His creatures
   dwell. 4. Forgive as we are forgiven. 5. The vision shows God to be
   Truth itself. 6. We should imitate God by truthfulness. 7. Why God
   reveals these truths.

   1. OUR Lord communicates with the soul by means of these apparitions on
   many occasions--sometimes when it is afflicted, at other times when it
   is about to receive some heavy cross, and again for the sake of the
   mutual delight of Himself and His beloved. There is no need for me to
   specify each different case nor do I intend to do so. I only wish to
   teach you (as far as I am acquainted with them myself) what are the
   different favours God shows a soul in this state so that you may
   understand their characteristics and the effects they produce. Thus you
   will not mistake every idle fancy for a vision and if you really see
   one, knowing that such a thing is possible, you will not be disturbed
   nor unhappy. The devil, who gains greatly by it, is delighted to see a
   soul troubled and distressed, knowing how this hinders it from
   employing itself wholly in loving and serving God.

   2. His Majesty has far higher ways of communicating Himself to the
   soul; they are less dangerous for I do not think the evil spirit can
   imitate them. They are more difficult to explain, being more abstruse;
   therefore imaginary visions are easier to describe. God is sometimes
   pleased, while a person is engaged in prayer and in perfect possession
   of her senses, to suspend them and to discover sublime mysteries to her
   which she appears to see within God Himself. This is no vision of the
   most sacred Humanity nor can I rightly say the soul sees,' for it sees
   nothing; this is no imaginary vision but a highly intellectual one,
   wherein is manifested how all things are beheld in God and how He
   contains them within Himself. [375]   It is of great value, for
   although passing in an instant, it remains deeply engraved in the
   memory, producing a feeling of great shame in the mind which perceives
   more clearly the malice of offences against God, since these most
   heinous sins are committed within His very being since we dwell within
   Him. I will try to explain this truth to you by a comparison, for
   although it is obvious and has been often told us, we either never
   reflect upon it or do not wish to understand it. If we realized it, we
   could not possibly behave with such audacity.

   3. Let us compare God to a very spacious and magnificent mansion or
   palace and remember that this edifice is God Himself. Can the sinner
   withdraw from it in order to carry out his crimes? No, certainly not,
   for within this very palace, that is, within God Himself, are
   perpetrated all the abominations, impurities and evil deeds that
   sinners commit. Oh awful thought, well worthy to be pondered over! What
   profit it would bring to us, who know so little and understand these
   truths but partially or how could we possibly be so reckless in our
   daring? Let us, sisters, meditate on the infinite mercy and patience of
   God in not casting us down to hell at once and let us render Him hearty
   thanks. Surely we should be ashamed of resenting anything done or said
   against us--we who are the scum of the earth--when we see what outrages
   are offered to God our Creator within His very being, by us His
   creatures; yet we are wounded whenever we hear of an unkind word having
   been spoken of us in our absence, although perhaps with no evil
   intention.

   4. Oh misery of mankind! When, daughters, shall we imitate Almighty God
   in any way? Oh, let us not think we are doing great things if we suffer
   injuries patiently: rather let us bear them with alacrity; let us love
   our enemies, since this great God has not ceased to love us in spite of
   our many sins! This is indeed the chief reason that all should forgive
   any harm done them. I assure you, daughters, that though this vision
   passes very quickly, our Lord has bestowed signal grace on her to whom
   He grants it, if she seeks to profit by keeping it constantly in mind.

   5. Short as the time lasts, yet, in a manner impossible to describe,
   God also manifests that in Him there is a verity which makes all truth
   in creatures seem obscure. He convinces the soul that He alone is that
   Truth which cannot lie, thus demonstrating the meaning of David's words
   in the psalm: Every man is a liar,' [376]   which could never be thus
   realized by any other means, however often we might hear that God is
   truth infallible. As I recall Pilate and how he besought our Lord in
   His Passion to answer his question: What is truth?' [377]   I realize
   how little mortals know of that sublime veracity.

   6. I wish I could explain this better but am unable to do so. Let us
   learn from it, sisters, that if we would bear any resemblance to our
   God and our Spouse, we must strive to walk ever in the truth. I do not
   merely mean that we should not tell falsehoods thank God, I see that in
   these convents you are most careful never to do so on any account--but
   I desire that as far as possible we should at with perfect truth before
   God and man and above all that we should not wish to be thought better
   than we are; that in all our deeds we should ascribe to God what is His
   and attribute what is ours to ourselves, and that we should seek for
   verity in all things. Thus we shall care little for this world, which
   is but deception and falsehood, and therefore cannot last. Once, while
   I was wondering why our Lord so dearly loves the virtue of humility,
   the thought suddenly struck me, without previous reflection, that it is
   because God is the supreme Truth and humility is the truth, for it is
   most true that we have nothing good of ourselves but only misery and
   nothingness: whoever ignores this, lives a life of falsehood. They that
   realize this fact most deeply are the most pleasing to God, the supreme
   Truth, for they walk in the truth. God grant, sisters, that we may have
   the grace never to lose this self-knowledge! Amen.

   7. Our Lord shows the soul these favours because she is now indeed His
   bride, resolute to do His will in all things; therefore He wishes to
   give her some idea how to accomplish it and to manifest to her some of
   His divine attributes. I need say no more about it, but I believe the
   two points above mentioned will prove very useful. These favours should
   cause no fear but lead us to praise God for bestowing these graces. I
   think neither the devil nor our own imaginations can have much to do
   with them, therefore the soul may rest in perfect peace.

  CHAPTER XI.

   TREATS OF HOW GOD INSPIRES THE SOUL WITH SUCH VEHEMENT AND IMPETUOUS
   DESIRES OF SEEING HIM AS TO ENDANGER LIFE. THE BENEFITS RESULTING FROM
   THIS DIVINE GRACE.

   1. Favours increase the soul's desire for God. 2. The dart of love. 3.
   Spiritual sufferings produced. 4. Its physical effects. S. Torture of
   the desire for God. 6. These sufferings are a purgatory. 7. The
   torments of hell. 8. St. Teresa's painful desire after God. 9. This
   suffering irresistible. 10. Effects of the dart of love. 11. Two
   spiritual dangers to life. 12. Courage needed here and given by our
   Lord.

   1. WILL all these graces bestowed by the Spouse upon the soul suffice
   to content this little dove or butterfly (you see I have not forgotten
   her after all!) so that she may settle down and rest in the place where
   she is to die? No indeed: her state is far worse than ever; although
   she has been receiving these favours for many years past, she still
   sighs and weeps because each grace augments her pain. She sees herself
   still far away from God, yet with her increased knowledge of His
   attributes her longing and her love for Him grow ever stronger as she
   learns more fully how this great God and Sovereign deserves to be
   loved. As, year by year her yearning after Him gradually becomes
   keener, she experiences the bitter suffering I am about to describe. I
   speak of years' because relating what happened to the person I
   mentioned, though I know well that with God time has no limits and in a
   single moment He can raise a soul to the most sublime state I have
   described. His Majesty has the power to do all He wishes and He wishes
   to do much for us. These longings, tears, sighs, and violent and
   impetuous desires and strong feelings, which seem to proceed from our
   vehement love, are yet as nothing compared with what I am about to
   describe and seem but a smouldering fire, the heat of which, though
   painful, is yet tolerable.

   2. While the soul is thus inflamed with love, it often happens that,
   from a passing thought or spoken word of how death delays its coming,
   the heart receives, it knows not how or whence, a blow as from a fiery
   dart. [378]   I do not say that this actually is a dart,' but, whatever
   it may be, decidedly it does not come from any part of our being. [379]
     Neither is it really a blow' though I call it one, but it wounds us
   severely--not, I think, in that part of our nature subject to physical
   pain but in the very depths and centre of the soul, where this,
   thunderbolt, in its rapid course, reduces all the earthly part of our
   nature to powder. At the time we cannot even remember our own
   existence, for in an instant, the faculties of the soul are so fettered
   as to be incapable of any action except the power they retain of
   increasing our torture. Do not think I am exaggerating; indeed I fall
   short of explaining what happens which cannot be described.

   3. This is a trance of the senses and faculties except as regards what
   helps to make the agony more intense. The understanding realizes
   acutely what cause there is for grief in separation from God and His
   Majesty now augments this sorrow by a vivid manifestation of Himself.
   This increases the anguish to such a degree that the sufferer gives
   vent to loud cries which she cannot stifle, however patient and
   accustomed to pain she may be, because this torture is not corporal but
   attacks the innermost recesses of the soul. The person I speak of
   learnt from this how much more acutely the spirit is capable of
   suffering than the body; she understood that this resembled the pains
   of purgatory, where the absence of the flesh does not prevent the
   torture's being far worse than any we can feel in this world.

   4. I saw some one in this condition who I really thought would have
   died, nor would it have been surprising, for there is great danger of
   death in this state. Short as is the time it lasts, it leaves the limbs
   all disjointed and the pulse as feeble as if the soul were on the point
   of departure, which is indeed the case, for the natural heat fails,
   while that which is supernatural so burns the frame that were it
   increased ever so little God would satisfy the soul's desire for death.
   Not that any pain is felt by the body at the moment, although, as I
   said, all the joints are dislocated so that for two or three days
   afterwards the suffering is too severe for the person to have even the
   strength to hold a pen; [380]   indeed I believe that the health
   becomes permanently enfeebled in consequence. At the time this is not
   felt, probably because the spiritual torments are so much more keen
   that the bodily ones remain unnoticed; just as when there is very
   severe pain in one part, slighter aches elsewhere are hardly perceived,
   as I know by experience. During this favour there is no physical
   suffering either great or small, nor do I think the person would feel
   it were she torn to pieces.

   5. Perhaps you will say this is an imperfection, and you may ask why
   she does not conform herself to the will of God since she has so
   completely surrendered herself to it. Hitherto she has been able to do
   so and she consecrated her life to it; but now she cannot because her
   reason is reduced to such a state that she is no longer mistress of
   herself; nor can she think of anything but what tends to increase her
   torment--for why should she seek to live apart from her only Good? She
   feels a strange loneliness, finding no companionship in any earthly
   creature; nor could she, I believe, among those who dwell in heaven,
   since they are not her Beloved: meanwhile all society is a torture to
   her. She is like one suspended in mid-air, who can neither touch the
   earth nor mount to heaven; she is unable to reach the water while
   parched with thirst and this is not a thirst that can be borne, but one
   which nothing will quench nor would she have it quenched save with that
   water of which our Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman, but this is not
   given to her. [381]

   6. Alas, O Lord, to what a state dost Thou bring those who love Thee!
   Yet these sufferings are as nothing compared with the reward Thou wilt
   give for them. It is right that great riches should be dearly bought.
   Moreover, her pains purify her soul so that it may enter the seventh
   mansion, as purgatory cleanses spirits which are to enter heaven: [382]
     then indeed these trials will appear like a drop of water compared to
   the sea. Though this torment and grief could not, I think, be surpassed
   by any earthly cross (so at least this person said and she had endured
   much both in body and mind), yet they appeared to her as nothing in
   comparison with their recompense. The soul realizes that it has not
   merited anguish which is of such measureless value. This conviction,
   although bringing no relief; enables the sufferer to bear her trials
   willingly--for her entire lifetime, if God so wills,--although instead
   of dying once for all, this would be but a living death, for truly it
   is nothing else.

   7. Let us remember, sisters, how those who are in hell lack this
   submission to the divine will and the resignation and consolation God
   gives such a soul and the solace of knowing that their pains benefit
   them, for the damned will continually suffer more and more; (more and
   more, I mean in regard to accidental pains [383] ). The soul feels far
   more keenly than the body and the torments I have just described are
   incomparably less severe than those endured by the lost, who also know
   that their anguish will last for ever: what, then, will become of these
   miserable souls? What can we do or suffer during our short lives which
   is worth reckoning if it will free us from such terrible and endless
   torments? I assure you that, unless you have learned by experience, it
   would be impossible to make you realize how acute are spiritual pangs
   and how different from physical pain. Our Lord wishes us to understand
   this, so that we may realize what gratitude we owe Him for having
   called us to a state where we may hope, by His mercy, to be freed from
   and forgiven our sins.

   8. Let us return to the soul we left in such cruel torment. This agony
   does not continue for long in its full violence--never, I believe,
   longer than three or four hours; were it prolonged, the weakness of our
   nature could not endure it except by a miracle. In one case, where it
   lasted only a quarter of an hour, the sufferer was left utterly
   exhausted; indeed, so violent was the attack that she completely lost
   consciousness. This occurred when she unexpectedly heard some verses to
   the effete that life seemed unending; she was engaged in conversation
   at the time, which was on the last day of Easter. All Eastertide she
   had suffered such aridity as hardly to realize what mystery was being
   celebrated. [384]

   9. It is as impossible to resist this suffering as it would be to
   prevent the flame's having heat enough to burn us if we were thrown
   into a fire. These feelings cannot be concealed: all who are present
   recognize the dangerous condition of such a person although they are
   unable to see what is passing within her. True, she knows her friends
   are near, but they and all earthly things seem to her but shadows. To
   show you that, should you ever be in this state, it is possible for
   your weakness and human nature to be of help to you, I may tell you
   that at times, when a person seems dying from her desire for death
   [385]   which so oppresses her soul with grief that it appears on the
   point of leaving her body, yet her mind, terrified at the thought,
   tries to still its pain so as to keep death at bay. Evidently this fear
   arises from human infirmity, for the soul's longings for death do not
   abate meanwhile nor can its sorrows be stilled or allayed until God
   brings it comfort. [386]   This He usually does by a deep trance or by
   some vision whereby the true Comforter consoles and strengthens the
   heart, which thus becomes resigned to live as long as He wills. [387]

   10. This favour entails great suffering but leaves most precious graces
   within the soul, which loses all fear of any crosses it may henceforth
   meet with, for in comparison with the acute anguish it has gone through
   all else seems nothing. Seeing what she has gained, the sufferer would
   gladly endure frequently the same pains [388]   but can do nothing to
   help herself in the matter. There are no means of reaching that state
   again until God chooses to decree it, when neither resistance nor
   escape is possible. The mind feels far deeper contempt for the world
   than before, realizing that nothing earthly can succour it in its
   torture; it is also much more detached from creatures, having learnt
   that no one but its Creator can bring it consolation and strength. It
   is more anxious and careful not to offend God, seeing that He can
   torment as well as comfort. [389]

   11. Two things in this spiritual state seem to me to endanger
   life,--one is that of which I have just spoken which is a real peril
   and no small one; the other an excessive gladness and a delight so
   extreme that the soul appears to swoon away and seems on the point of
   leaving the body, which indeed would bring it no small joy.

   12. Now you see. sisters, whether I had not reason to tell you that
   courage was needed for these favours and that when any one asks for
   them from our Lord He may well reply, as He did to the sons of Zebedee:
   Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink?' [390]   I believe,
   sisters, we should all answer 'Yes'--and we should be perfectly right
   for His Majesty gives strength when He sees it needed: He ever defends
   such souls and answers for them when they are persecuted and slandered
   as He did for the Magdalen--if not in words, at least in deeds. [391]
   At last, ah, at last! before they die He repays them for all they have
   suffered, as you shall now learn. May He be for ever blessed and may
   all creatures praise Him! Amen.

   [383] Marginal note in the Saint's handwriting. The substantial' pain
   of hell consists in the irrevocable loss of God, our last end and
   supreme Good; this is incurred from the first moment in its fullest
   intensity and therefore cannot increase. The physical pain with which
   the bodies will be afflicted when united to the souls after the general
   resurrection may vary, but will neither increase nor abate. The
   accidental' pain of the damned arises from various causes, for instance
   from the ever-increasing effects of evil actions, and therefore
   increases in the same proportion. Thus a heresiarch will suffer keener
   accidental pain as more and more souls are lost through his false
   teaching.

     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

   TREATS OF THE SUBLIME FAVOURS GOD BESTOWS ON SOULS WHICH HAVE ENTERED
   THE SEVENTH MANSIONS. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE SHE BELIEVES TO
   EXIST BETWEEN SOUL AND SPIRIT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE BOTH ONE. THIS CHAPTER
   CONTAINS SOME NOTEWORTHY THINGS.

   1. Sublime mysteries of these mansions. 2. St. Teresa abashed at
   treating such subjects. 3. Our Lord introduces His bride into His
   presence chamber. 4. Darkness of a soul in mortal sin. 5. Intercession
   for sinners. 6. The soul an interior world. 7. The spiritual nuptials.
   8. Former favours differ from spiritual nuptials. 9. The Blessed
   Trinity revealed to the soul. 10. Permanence of Its presence in the
   soul. 11. The effects. 12. This presence is not always equally
   realized. 13. It is beyond the soul's control. 14. The centre of the
   soul remains calm. 15. The soul and the spirit distinct though united.
   16. The soul and its faculties not identical.

   1. You may think, sisters, that so much has been said of this spiritual
   journey that nothing remains to be added. That would be a great
   mistake: God's immensity has no limits, neither have His works;
   therefore, who can recount His mercies and His greatness? [392]   It is
   impossible, so do not be amazed at what I write about them which is but
   a cipher of what remains untold concerning God. He has shown great
   mercy in communicating these mysteries to one who could recount them to
   us, for as we learn more of His intercourse with creatures, we ought to
   praise Him more fervently and to esteem more highly the soul in which
   He so delights. Each of us possesses a soul but we do not realize its
   value as made in the image of God, therefore we fail to understand the
   important secrets it contains. May His Majesty be pleased to guide my
   pen and to teach me to say somewhat of the much there is to tell of His
   revelations to the souls He leads into this mansion. I have begged Him
   earnestly to help me, since He sees that my object is to reveal His
   mercies for the praise and glory of His name. I hope He will grant this
   favour, if not for my own sake, at least for yours, sisters--so that
   you may discover how vital it is for you to put no obstacle in the way
   of the Spiritual Marriage of the Bridegroom with your soul which
   brings, as you will learn, such signal blessings with it.

   2. O great God! surely such a miserable creature as myself should
   tremble at the thought of speaking on such a subject so far beyond
   anything I deserve to understand. Indeed I felt abashed and doubted
   whether it would not be better to finish writing about this Mansion in
   a few words, lest people might imagine that I am recounting my personal
   experience. I was overwhelmed with shame for, knowing what I am, it is
   a terrible undertaking. On the other hand, this fear seemed but a
   temptation and weakness: even if I should be misjudged, so long as God
   is but a little better praised and known, let all the world revile me.
   Besides, I may be dead before this book is seen. May He Who lives and
   shall live to all eternity be praised! Amen.

   3. When our Lord is pleased to take pity on the sufferings, both past
   and present, endured through her longing for Him by this soul which He
   has spiritually taken for His bride, He, before consummating the
   celestial marriage, brings her into this His mansion or presence
   chamber. This is the seventh Mansion, for as He has a dwelling-place in
   heaven, so has He in the soul, where none but He may abide and which
   may be termed a second heaven.

   4. It is important, sisters, that we should not fancy the soul to be in
   darkness. As we are accustomed to believe there is no light but that
   which is exterior, we imagine that the soul is wrapt in obscurity. This
   is indeed the case with a soul out of the state of grace, [393]   not,
   however, through any defer in the Sun of Justice which remains within
   it and gives it being, but the soul itself is incapable of receiving
   the light, as I think I said in speaking of the first Mansion. [394]
   A certain person was given to understand that such unfortunate souls
   are, as it were, imprisoned in a gloomy dungeon, chained hand and foot
   and unable to perform any meritorious action: they are also both blind
   and dumb. Well may we pity them when we reflect that we ourselves were
   once in the same state and that God may show them mercy also.

   5. Let us, then, sisters, be most zealous in interceding for them and
   never neglect it. To pray for a soul in mortal sin is a far more
   profitable form of almsgiving than it would be to help a Christian whom
   we saw with hands strongly fettered behind his back, tied to a post and
   dying of hunger--not for want of food, because plenty of the choicest
   delicacies lay near him, but because he was unable to put them into his
   mouth, although he was extremely exhausted and on the point of dying,
   and that not a temporal death, but an eternal one. Would it not be
   extremely cruel of us to stand looking at him, and give him nothing to
   eat? What if by your prayers you could loose his bonds? Now you
   understand.

   6. For the love of God I implore you constantly to remember in your
   prayers souls in a like case. We are not speaking now of them but of
   others who, by the mercy of God, have done penance for their sins and
   are in a state of grace. You must not think of the soul as
   insignificant and petty but as an interior world containing the number
   of beautiful mansions you have seen; as indeed it should, since in the
   centre of the soul there is a mansion reserved for God Himself.

   7. When His Majesty deigns to bestow on the soul the grace of these
   divine nuptials, He brings it into His presence chamber and does not
   treat it as before, when He put it into a trance. I believe He then
   united it to Himself, as also during the prayer of union; but then only
   the superior part was affected and the soul did not feel called to
   enter its own centre as it does in this mansion. Here it matters little
   whether it is in the one way or the other.

   8. In the former favours our Lord unites the spirit to Himself and
   makes it both blind and dumb like St. Paul after his conversion, [395]
     thus preventing its knowing whence or how it enjoys this grace, for
   the supreme delight of the spirit is to realize its nearness to God.
   During the actual moment of divine union the soul feels nothing, all
   its powers being entirely lost. But now He acts differently: our
   pitiful God removes the scales from its eyes [396]   letting it see and
   understand somewhat of the grace received in a strange and wonderful
   manner in this mansion by means of intellectual vision.

   9. By some mysterious manifestation of the truth, the three Persons of
   the most Blessed Trinity reveal themselves, preceded by an illumination
   which shines on the spirit like a most dazzling cloud of light. [397]
   The three Persons are distinct from one another; a sublime knowledge is
   infused into the soul, imbuing it with a certainty of the truth that
   the Three are of one substance, power, and knowledge and are one God.
   Thus that which we hold as a doctrine of faith, the soul now, so to
   speak, understands by sight, though it beholds the Blessed Trinity
   neither by the eyes of the body nor of the soul, this being no
   imaginary vision. All the Three Persons here communicate Themselves to
   the soul, speak to it and make it understand the words of our Lord in
   the Gospel that He and the Father and the Holy Ghost will come and make
   their abode with the soul which loves Him and keeps His commandments.
   [398]

   10. O my God, how different from merely hearing and believing these
   words is it to realize their truth in this way! Day by day a growing
   astonishment takes possession of this soul, for the three Persons of
   the Blessed Trinity seem never to depart; it sees with certainty, in
   the way I have described, that They dwell far within its own centre and
   depths; though for want of learning it cannot describe how, it is
   conscious of the indwelling of these divine Companions.

   11. You may fancy that such a person is beside herself and that her
   mind is too inebriated to care for anything else. On the contrary, she
   is far more active than before in all that concerns God's service, and
   when at leisure she enjoys this blessed companionship. Unless she first
   deserts God, I believe He will never cease to make her clearly sensible
   of His presence: she feels confident, as indeed she may, that He will
   never so fail her as to allow her to lose this favour after once
   bestowing it; at the same time, she is more careful than before to
   avoid offending Him in any way.

   12. This presence is not always so entirely realized, that is, so
   distinctly manifest, as at first, or as it is at times when God renews
   this favour, otherwise the recipient could not possibly attend to
   anything else nor live in society. Although not always seen by so clear
   a light, yet whenever she reflects on it she feels the companionship of
   the Blessed Trinity. This is as if, when we were with other people in a
   very well lighted room, some one were to darken it by closing the
   shutters; we should feel certain that the others were still there,
   though we were unable to see them. [399]

   13. You may ask: Could she not bring back the light and see them
   again?' [400]   This is not in her power; when our Lord chooses, He
   will open the shutters of the understanding: He shows her great mercy
   in never quitting her and in making her realize it so clearly. His
   divine Majesty seems to be preparing His bride for greater things by
   this divine companionship which clearly helps perfection in every way
   and makes her lose the fear she sometimes felt when other graces were
   granted her.

   14. A certain person so favoured found she had improved in all virtues:
   whatever were her trials or labours, the centre of her soul seemed
   never moved from its resting-place. Thus in a manner her soul appeared
   divided: a short time after God had done her this favour, while
   undergoing great sufferings, she complained of her soul as Martha did
   of Mary, [401]   reproaching it with enjoying solitary peace while
   leaving her so full of troubles and occupations that she could not keep
   it company.

   15. This may seem extravagant to you, daughters, yet though the soul is
   known to be undivided, it is fact and no fancy and often happens.
   Interior effects show for certain that there is a positive difference
   between the soul and the spirit, although they are one with each other.
   [402]   There is an extremely subtle distinction between them, so that
   sometimes they seem to at in a different manner from one another, as
   does the knowledge given to them by God.

   16. It also appears to me that the soul and its faculties are not
   identical. There are so many and such transcendental mysteries within
   us, that it would be presumption for me to attempt to explain them. If
   by God's mercy we enter heaven we shall understand these secrets.

   substance of the soul independently of its powers. In the inferior
   degrees of the Mystical life God operates through the faculties, while
   in the Mystical marriage He acts directly on the substance of the soul.
   St. Teresa is not quite consistent in the use of these terms, which is
   not surprising, as she owns that she does not quite understand this
   subtle distinction.

  CHAPTER II.

   TREATS OF THE SAME SUBJECT: EXPLAINS, BY SOME DELICATELY DRAWN
   COMPARISONS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPIRITUAL UNION AND SPIRITUAL
   MARRIAGE.

   1. The spiritual nuptials introduced by an imaginary vision. 2.
   Spiritual betrothal and marriage differ. 3. Spiritual marriage lasting.
   4. Not so spiritual betrothal. 5. Spiritual marriage permanent. 6. St.
   Paul and spiritual marriage. 7. The soul's joy in union. 8. Its
   conviction of God's indwelling. 9. Its peace. 10. Christ's prayer for
   the divine union of the soul. 11. Its fulfilment. 12. Unalterable peace
   of the soul in the seventh Mansion. 13. Unless it offends God. 14.
   Struggles outside the seventh Mansion. 15. Comparisons explaining this.

   1. WE now come to speak of divine and spiritual nuptials, although this
   sublime favour cannot be received in all its perfection during our
   present life, for by forsaking God this great good would be lost. The
   first time God bestows this grace, He, by an imaginary vision of His
   most sacred Humanity, reveals Himself to the soul so that it may
   understand and realize the sovereign gift it is receiving. He may
   manifest Himself in a different way to other people; the person I
   mentioned, after having received Holy Communion beheld our Lord, full
   of splendour, beauty, and majesty, as He was after His resurrection.
   [403]   He told her that henceforth she was to care for His affairs as
   though they were her own and He would care for hers: He spoke other
   words which she understood better than she can repeat them. This may
   seem nothing new, for our Lord had thus revealed Himself to her at
   other times; [404]   yet this was so different that it left her
   bewildered and amazed, both on account of the vividness of what she saw
   and of the words heard at the time, also because it took place in the
   interior of the soul where, with the exception of the one last
   mentioned, no other vision had been seen.

   2. You must understand that between the visions seen in this and in the
   former mansions there is a vast difference; there is the same
   distinction between spiritual espousals and spiritual marriage as
   between people who are only betrothed and others who are united for
   ever in holy matrimony. I have told you [405]   that though I make this
   comparison because there is none more suitable, yet this betrothal is
   no more related to our corporal condition than if the soul were a
   disembodied spirit. This is even more true of the spiritual marriage,
   for this secret union takes place in the innermost centre of the soul
   where God Himself must dwell: I believe that no door is required to
   enter it. I say, no door is required,' for all I have hitherto
   described seems to come through the senses and faculties as must the
   representation of our Lord's Humanity, but what passes in the union of
   the spiritual nuptials is very different. Here God appears in the
   soul's centre, not by an imaginary but by an intellectual vision far
   more mystic than those seen before, just as He appeared to the Apostles
   without having entered through the door when He said: Pax vobis.' [406]

   3. So mysterious is the secret and so sublime the favour that God thus
   bestows instantaneously on the soul, that it feels a supreme delight,
   only to be described by saying that our Lord vouchsafes for the moment
   to reveal to it His own heavenly glory in a far more subtle way than by
   any vision or spiritual delight. As far as can be understood, the soul,
   I mean the spirit of this soul, is made one with God [407]   Who is
   Himself a spirit, and Who has been pleased to show certain persons how
   far His love for us extends in order that we may praise His greatness.
   He has thus deigned to unite Himself to His creature: He has bound
   Himself to her as firmly as two human beings are joined in wedlock and
   will never separate Himself from her.

   4. Spiritual betrothal is different and like the grace of union is
   often dissolved; for though two things are made one by union,
   separation is still possible and each part then remains a thing by
   itself. This favour generally passes quickly, and afterwards the soul,
   as far as it is aware, remains without His company.

   5. This is not so in the spiritual marriage with our Lord, where the
   soul always remains in its centre with its God. Union may be symbolized
   by two wax candles, the tips of which touch each other so closely that
   there is but one light; or again, the wick, the wax, and the light
   become one, but the one candle can again be separated from the other
   and the two candles remain distinct; or the wick may be withdrawn from
   the wax. But spiritual marriage is like rain falling from heaven into a
   river or stream, becoming one and the same liquid, so that the river
   and rain water cannot be divided; or it resembles a streamlet flowing
   into the ocean, which cannot afterwards be disunited from it. This
   marriage may also be likened to a room into which a bright light enters
   through two windows--though divided when it enters, the light becomes
   one and the same.

   6. Perhaps when St. Paul said, He who is joined to the Lord is one
   spirit,' [408]   he meant this sovereign marriage, which presupposes
   His Majesty's having been joined to the soul by union. The same Apostle
   says: To me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.' [409]   This, I
   think, might here be uttered by the soul, for now the little butterfly
   of which I spoke dies with supreme joy, for Christ is her life.

   7. This becomes more manifest by its effects as time goes on, for the
   soul learns that it is God Who gives it life,' by certain secret
   intuitions too strong to be misunderstood, and keenly felt, although
   impossible to describe. These produce such over-mastering feelings that
   the person experiencing them cannot refrain from amorous exclamations,
   such as: O Life of my life, and Power which doth uphold me!' with other
   aspirations of the same kind. [410]   For from the bosom of the
   Divinity, where God seems ever to hold this soul fast clasped, issue
   streams of milk, which solace the servants of the castle. I think He
   wishes them to share, in some way, the riches the soul enjoys;
   therefore from the flowing river in which the little streamlet is
   swallowed up, some drops of water flow every now and then to sustain
   the bodily powers, the servants of the bride and Bridegroom.

   8. A person who was unexpectedly plunged into water could not fail to
   be aware of it; here the case is the same, but even more evident. A
   quantity of water could not fall on us unless it came from some
   source--so the soul feels certain there must be some one within it who
   lances forth these darts and vivifies its own life, and that there is a
   Sun whence this brilliant light streams forth from the interior of the
   spirit to its faculties.

   9. The soul itself, as I said, never moves from this centre, nor loses
   the peace He can give Who gave it to the Apostles when they were
   assembled together. [411]   I think this salutation of our Lord
   contains far deeper meaning than the words convey, as also His bidding
   the glorious Magdalen to go in peace.' [412]   Our Lord's words act
   within us, [413]   and in these cases they must have wrought their
   effect in the souls already disposed to banish from within themselves
   all that is corporal and to retain only what is spiritual, in order to
   be joined in this celestial union with the uncreated Spirit. Without
   doubt, if we empty ourselves of all that belongs to the creature,
   depriving ourselves of it for the love of God, that same Lord will fill
   us with Himself.

   10. Our Lord Jesus Christ, praying for His Apostles, (I cannot remember
   the reference), asked that they might be made one with the Father and
   with Himself; as Jesus Christ our Lord is in the Father and the Father
   in Him! [414]   I do not know how love could be greater than this! Let
   none draw back from entering here, for His Majesty also said: Not only
   for them do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall
   believe in Me'; [415]   and He declared: I am in them.' [416]

   11. God help me! how true these words are, and how clearly are they
   understood by the soul which in this state of prayer finds them
   fulfilled in itself! So should we all but for our own fault, for the
   words of Jesus Christ, our King and our Lord, cannot fail. It is we who
   fail by not disposing ourselves fitly, nor removing all that can
   obstruct this light,so that we do not behold ourselves in this mirror
   wherein our image is engraved. [417]

   12. To return to what I was saying. God places the soul in His own
   mansion which is in the very centre of the soul itself. They say the
   empyreal heavens, in which our Lord dwells, do not revolve with the
   rest: so the accustomed movements of the faculties and imagination do
   not appear to take place in any way that can injure the soul or disturb
   its peace.

   13. Do I seem to imply that after God has brought the soul thus far it
   is certain to be saved and cannot fall into sin again? [418]   I do not
   mean this: whenever I say that the soul seems in security, I must be
   understood to imply for as long as His Majesty thus holds it in His
   care and it does not offend Him. At any rate I know for certain that
   though such a person realizes the high state she is in and has remained
   in it for several years, she does not consider herself safe, but is
   more careful than ever to avoid committing the least offence against
   God. As I shall explain later on, she is most anxious to serve Him and
   feels a constant pain and confusion at seeing how little she can do for
   Him compared with all she ought.' This is no light cross but a severe
   mortification, for the harder the penances she can perform, the better
   is she pleased. Her greatest penance is to be deprived by God of health
   and strength to perform any. I told you elsewhere what keen pain this
   caused her, but now it grieves her far more. This must be because she
   is like a tree grafted on a stock growing near a stream which makes it
   greener and more fruitful. [419]   Why marvel at the longings of this
   soul whose spirit has truly become one with the celestial water I
   described?

   14. To return to what I wrote about. It is not intended that the
   powers, senses and passions should continually enjoy this peace. The
   soul does so, indeed, but in the other mansions there are still times
   of struggle, suffering, and fatigue, though as a general rule, peace is
   not lost by them. This centre of the soul' or spirit' is so hard to
   describe or even to believe in, that I think, sisters, my inability to
   explain my meaning saves your being tempted to disbelieve me; it is
   difficult to understand how there can be crosses and sufferings and yet
   peace in the soul.

   15. Let me give you one or two comparisons--God grant they may be of
   use; if not, I know that what I say is true. A king resides in his
   palace; many wars and disasters take place in his kingdom but he
   remains on his throne. In the same way, though tumults and wild beasts
   rage with great uproar in the other mansions, yet nothing of this
   enters the seventh mansions, nor drives the soul from it. Although the
   mind regrets these troubles, they do not disturb it nor rob it of its
   peace, for the passions are too subdued to dare to enter here where
   they would only suffer still further defeat. Though the whole body is
   in pain, yet the head, if it be sound, does not suffer with it. I smile
   at these comparisons--they do not please me--but I can find no others.
   Think what you will about it--I have told you the truth.

   spiritual nuptials must be placed between the aforementioned year and
   May 1575, but it is not possible to ascertain the exact date. (For the

   [417] This idea is expressed in St. Teresa's poem: Alma, buscarte has
   en Mi' (Poem 10, Minor Works).

   Such is the power of love, O soul,

   To paint thee in my heart

   No craftsman with such art

   Whate'er his skill might be, could there

   Thine image thus impart!

   'Twas love that gave thee life--

   Then, fair one, if thou be

   Lost to thyself, thou'lt see

   Thy portrait in my bosom stamped--

   Soul, seek thyself in Me.

   [418] In a letter dated May 1581, addressed to Don Alonso Velasquez,
   then bishop of Osma, St. Teresa writes as follows: 'She [herself] has
   received such an assurance of coming one day to the fruition of God
   that she almost imagines she has already come into possession of Him,
   without, however, the joy that will accompany it. She is in the same
   position as one who by legal contract has received a splendid property
   which will become his, and whose fruit he will enjoy at a given date.
   Until then he only holds the title-deeds, without being able to take
   possession of the property. Nevertheless my soul would not like to come
   immediately into the possession of God, for it does not believe that it
   has deserved such a grace. It only desires to continue in His service,
   even at the cost of terrible sufferings. It would not mind thus serving
   Him to the end of the world, after having received such a pledge.' St.
   John of the Cross, in treating of this subject (Spir. Cant. stanza
   xxii. 3) says: I believe that no soul ever attains to this state
   without being confirmed in grace in it.' See also Ribera, in the Acta
   Ss. p. 554, circa finem.

   [419] Ps. i. 3: Et erit tamquam lignum quod plantatum est secus
   decursus aquarum, quod fructum suum dabit in tempore suo.'

  CHAPTER III.

   THE GREAT FRUITS PRODUCED BY THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PRAYER. THE WONDERFUL
   DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE EFFECTS AND THOSE FORMERLY DESCRIBED SHOULD BE
   CAREFULLY STUDIED AND REMEMBERED.

   1. Effects of the graces last received. 2. The soul only cares for
   God's honour. 3. But still performs its duties. 4. Other fruits of
   these favours. 5. The soul's fervent desire to serve God. 6. Christ
   dwells within this soul. 7. And recalls it to fervour if negligent. 8.
   God's constant care of such souls. 9. Their peace and silence. 10. Few
   ecstasies in the Seventh Mansions. 11. Probable reasons for this. 12.
   Allusions in Holy Scripture to this state. 13. Watchfulness of such
   souls. 14. Crosses suffered in this state.

   1. THE little butterfly has died with the greatest joy at having found
   rest at last, and now Christ lives in her. [420]   Let us see the
   difference between her present and her former life, for the effects
   will prove whether what I told you was true. As far as can be
   ascertained they are these: first, a self-forgetfulness so complete
   that she really appears not to exist, as I said, [421]   for such a
   transformation has been worked in her that she no longer recognizes
   herself; nor does she remember that heaven, or life, or glory are to be
   hers, but seems entirely occupied in seeking God's interests.
   Apparently the words spoken by His Majesty have done their work: 'that
   she was to care for His affairs, and He would care for hers.' [422]

   2. Thus she recks nothing, whatever happens, but lives in such strange
   oblivion that, as I stated, she seems no longer to exist, nor does she
   wish to be of any account in anything--anything! unless she sees that
   she can advance, however little, the honour and glory of God, for which
   she would most willingly die.

   3. Do not fancy I mean, daughters, that she neglects to eat and drink,
   though it brings no small torment to her, or to perform the duties of
   her state. I am speaking of her interior; as regards her exterior
   actions there is little to say, for her chief suffering is to see that
   she has hardly strength to do anything. For nothing in the world would
   she omit doing all she can which she knows would honour our Lord.

   4. The second fruit is a strong desire for suffering, though it does
   not disturb her peace as before because the fervent wish of such souls
   for the fulfilment of God's will in them makes them acquiesce in all He
   does. If He would have her suffer, she is content; if not, she does not
   torment herself to death about it as she used to do. She feels a great
   interior joy when persecuted, and is far more peaceful than in the
   former state under such circumstances: she bears no grudge against her
   enemies, nor wishes them any ill. Indeed she has a special love for
   them, is deeply grieved at seeing them in trouble, and does all she can
   to relieve them, [423]   earnestly interceding with God on their
   behalf. She would be glad to forfeit the favours His Majesty shows her,
   if they might be given to her enemies instead, to prevent their
   offending our Lord. 5. The most surprising thing to me is that the
   sorrow and distress which such souls felt because they could not die
   and enjoy our Lord's presence [424]   are now exchanged for as fervent
   a desire of serving Him, of causing Him to be praised, and of helping
   others to the utmost of their power. Not only have they ceased to long
   for death, but they wish for a long life and most heavy crosses, if
   such would bring ever so little honour to our Lord. Thus, if they knew
   for certain that immediately on quitting their bodies their souls would
   enjoy God, it would make no difference to them, nor do they think of
   the glory enjoyed by the saints, and long to share it. Such souls hold
   that their glory consists in helping, in any way, Him Who was
   crucified, especially as they see how men offend against Him, and how
   few, detached from all else, care for His honour alone. True, people in
   this state forget this at times, and are seized with tender longings to
   enjoy God and to leave this land of exile, especially as they see how
   little they serve Him. Then, returning to themselves and reflecting how
   they possess Him continually in their souls, they are satisfied,
   offering to His Majesty their willingness to live as the most costly
   oblation they can make. [425]

     They fear death no more than they would a delicious trance.

   [6. The fact is, that He Who gave them these torturing desires of death
   has exchanged them for the others. May He be for ever blessed and
   praised! Amen. In fact, such persons no longer wish for consolations
   nor delights, since they bear God Himself within them, and it is He Who
   lives in them. It is evident that His life was one continual torment:
   so would He have ours to be, at least in desire, for as to the rest He
   leads us mercifully as our weakness requires, though when He sees the
   need He imparts to us His strength.]

   7. Such a soul, thoroughly detached from all things, wishes to be
   either always alone or occupied on what benefits the souls of others:
   she feels neither aridity nor any interior troubles, but a constant
   tender recollection of our Lord Whom she wishes to praise unceasingly.
   When she grows negligent, the same Lord arouses her in the way that I
   told you, and it is easy to see that this impulse (I know not what term
   to use for it) comes from the interior of the soul, like the former
   impetuous desires. [426]   It is now felt very sweetly, but is neither
   produced by the intellect nor the memory, nor is there reason to
   believe the soul itself has any share in it. This is so usual and so
   frequent that whoever has been in this state must have noticed it.
   However large a fire may be, the flame never burns downwards, but
   upwards, and so this movement is seen to come from the centre of the
   soul whose powers it excites. Indeed, were nothing else gained by this
   way of prayer but the knowledge of the special care God takes to
   communicate Himself to us and how He entreats us to abide with Him (for
   indeed I can describe it in no other way) I think that for the sake of
   these sweet and penetrating touches of His love all our past pains
   would be well spent.

   8. You will have learnt this by experience, sisters, for I think that
   when our Lord has brought us to the prayer of union, He watches over us
   in this way unless we neglect to keep His commandments. When these
   impulses are given you, remember that they come from the innermost
   mansion, where God dwells in our souls. Praise Him fervently, for it is
   He Who sends you this message, or love letter, so tenderly written, and
   in a cipher that only you can understand and know what He asks. By no
   means neglect to answer His Majesty, even though you may be occupied
   exteriorly and engaged in conversation. Our Lord may often be pleased
   to show you this secret favour in public; but it is very easy, as the
   reply should be entirely interior, to respond by an at of love or to
   ask with Saint Paul: 'Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?" [427]
   Jesus will show you in many ways how to please Him. It is a propitious
   moment, for He seems to be listening to us and the soul is nearly
   always disposed by this delicate touch to respond with a generous
   determination. [428]   As I told you, this mansion differs from the
   rest in that, as I said, [429]   the dryness and disturbance felt in
   all the rest at times hardly ever enter here, where the soul is nearly
   always calm. It does not fear that this sublime favour can be
   counterfeited by the devil, but feels a settled conviction that it is
   of divine origin because, as above stated, nothing is here perceived by
   the senses or faculties but His Majesty reveals Himself to the spirit,
   which He takes to be with Himself in a place where I doubt not the
   devil dares not enter, nor would our Lord ever permit him.

   9. All the graces here divinely bestowed on the soul come, as I said,
   through no a Lion of its own except its total abandonment of itself to
   God. They are given in peace and silence, like the building of
   Solomon's Temple where no sound was heard. [430]   It is thus with this
   temple of God, this mansion of His where He and the soul rejoice in
   each other alone in profound silence. The mind need not act nor search
   for anything, as the Lord Who created it wishes it to be at rest and
   only to watch through a little chink, what passes within. Though at
   times it cannot see this, yet such intervals are very short, I believe
   because the powers are not here lost but only cease to work, being, as
   it were, dazed with astonishment.

   10. I, too, am astonished at seeing that when the soul arrives at this
   state it does not go into ecstasies except perhaps on rare
   occasions--even then they are not like the former trances and the
   flight of the spirit and seldom take place in public as they did
   before. [431]   They are no longer produced by any special calls to
   devotion, such as by the sight of a religious picture, by hearing a
   sermon (were it only the first few words), or by sacred music;
   formerly, like the poor little butterfly, the soul was so anxious that
   anything used to alarm it and make it take flight. This may be either
   because the spirit has at last found repose, or that it has seen such
   wonders in this mansion that nothing can frighten it, or perhaps
   because it no longer feels solitary since it rejoices in such Company.

   11. In short, sisters, I cannot tell the reason, but as soon as God
   shows the soul what this mansion contains, bringing it to dwell within
   the precincts, the infirmity formerly so troublesome to the mind and
   impossible to get over, disappears at once. Probably this is because
   our Lord has now strengthened, dilated, and developed the soul, or it
   may be that He wished to make public (for some end known only to
   Himself) what He was doing in secret within such souls, for His
   judgments are beyond our comprehension in this life.

   12. These effects, with all the other good fruits I have mentioned of
   the different degrees of prayer, are given by God to the soul when it
   draws near Him to receive that kiss of His mouth' for which the bride
   asked, [432]   and I believe her petition is now granted. Here the
   overflowing waters are given to the wounded hart: here she delights in
   the tabernacles of God [433] : here the dove sent out by Noe to see
   whether the flood had subsided, has plucked the olive branch, showing
   that she has found firm land amongst the floods and tempests of this
   world. [434]   O Jesus! Who knows how much in Holy Scripture refers to
   this peace of soul? Since, O my God, Thou dost see of what grave import
   is this peace to us, do Thou incite Christians to strive to gain it! In
   Thy mercy do not deprive those of it on whom Thou hast bestowed it, for
   until Thou hast given them true peace and brought them to where it is
   unending, they must ever live in fear.

   13. I do not mean that peace is unreal on earth because I say true
   peace,' but that such souls might have to begin all their struggles
   over again if they forsook God. What must these people feel at the
   thought that it is possible to lose so great a good? Their dread makes
   them more careful; they try to gather strength from their weakness
   lest, through their own fault, they should miss any opportunity of
   pleasing God better. The greater the favours they have received from
   His Majesty, the more diffident and mistrustful are they of themselves;
   the marvels they have witnessed having revealed more clearly to them
   their own miseries and the heinousness of their sins, so that often,
   like the publican, they dare not so much as lift up their eyes. [435]

   14. Sometimes they long to die and be in safety, but then their love at
   once makes them wish to live in order to serve God, as I told you;
   therefore they commit all that concerns them to His mercy. [436]   At
   times they are more crushed than ever by the thought of the many graces
   they have received lest, like an overladen ship, they sink beneath the
   burden. I assure you, sisters, such souls have their cross to bear, yet
   it does not trouble them nor rob them of their peace, but is quickly
   gone like a wave or a storm which is followed by a calm, for God's
   presence within them soon makes them forget all else. May He be for
   ever blessed and praised by all His creatures! Amen,

  CHAPTER IV.

   THE CONCLUSION SETS FORTH WHAT APPEARS TO BE OUR LORD'S PRINCIPAL
   INTENTION IN CONFERRING THESE SUBLIME FAVOURS ON SOULS, AND EXPLAINS
   HOW NECESSARY IT IS FOR MARY AND MARTHA TO GO TOGETHER. THIS CHAPTER IS
   VERY PROFITABLE.

   1. Vicissitudes of the Seventh Mansion. 2. Humility produced by them.
   3. Such souls free from mortal and from wilful venial sins. 4. The fate
   of Solomon. 5. Holy fear. 6. These favours strengthen souls to suffer.
   7. Crosses borne by the saints. 8. Effect of vision of our Lord on St.
   Peter. 9. Fruits of these favours. 10. Why the spiritual marriage takes
   place. 11. Love for Christ proved by our deeds. 12. True spirituality.
   13. Humility and the virtues must combine with prayer. 14. Zeal of
   advanced souls. 15. Strengthened by the divine Presence within them.
   16. Examples of the saints. 17. Both Martha and Mary must serve our
   Lord. 18. Christ's food. 19. Mary's mortification. 20. Her grief at the
   Passion. 21. Can we lead souls to God? 22. How to do so. 23. Love gives
   value to our deeds. 24. Conclusion.

   1. You must not suppose, sisters, that the effects I mentioned always
   exist in the same degree in these souls, for as far as I remember, I
   told you that in most cases our Lord occasionally leaves such persons
   to the weakness of their nature. The venomous creatures from the moat
   round the castle and the other mansions at once unite to revenge
   themselves for the time when they were deprived of their power.

   2. True, this lasts but a short time--a day perhaps or a little
   longer--but during this disturbance, which generally arises from some
   passing event, these persons learn what benefits they derive from the
   holy Company they are in. Our Lord gives them such great fortitude that
   they never desert His service nor the good resolutions they have made,
   which only seem to gather strength by trial, nor do their hearts ever
   turn from them, even by a slight movement of the will. This trouble
   rarely happens; our Lord wishes the soul to keep in mind its natural
   condition so that it may be humble and may better understand how much
   it owes Him, and how great a grace it has received, and so may praise
   Him.

   3. Do not fancy that in spite of the strong desire and determination of
   these souls that they do not commit imperfections and even fall into
   many sins: that is, not wilfully; for such people are given special
   grace from God on this point: I mean venial sins. As far as they are
   aware, they are free from mortal sins, although they do not feel
   certain they may not be guilty of some of which they are ignorant.

   4. This grieves their hearts sorely, as does the sight of the souls
   perishing around them; although on the one hand they have strong hopes
   of not being themselves among the number of the lost, yet remembering
   what we are told in Holy Scripture of the fate of men who, like
   Solomon, seemed the special favourites of God [437]   and conversed so
   familiarly with His Majesty, they cannot help fearing for themselves.

   5. Let that one among you who feels most confidence on this point fear
   the most, for: Blessed is the man who feareth the Lord,' as David said.
   [438]   May His Majesty ever protect us. Let us beg Him never to permit
   us to offend Him: therein lies our greatest safety. May He be for ever
   praised. Amen.

   6. It would be well to tell you, sisters, the reason why God bestows
   such favours on souls in this world, although you must have learned
   this by the effects produced if you have considered the matter. I
   return to the matter in order that none of you may think it is only for
   the sake of the pleasure such persons feel, which would be a great
   mistake on your part, for His Majesty can bestow no greater favour on
   us than to give us a life such as was led by His beloved Son.
   Therefore, as I have often told you, I feel certain that these graces
   are sent to strengthen our weakness so that we may imitate Him by
   suffering much.

   7. We always find that those nearest to Christ our Lord bear the
   heaviest cross: think of what His glorious Mother and the Apostles
   bore. How do you think St. Paul went through such immense labours?
   [439]   We learn from his conduct the fruits of genuine visions and
   contemplation which come from our Lord and not from our own
   imagination, or the devil's fraud. Do you suppose that St. Paul hid
   himself to enjoy these spiritual consolations at leisure and did
   nothing else? You know that he never took a day's rest so far as we can
   learn, nor could he have slept much since he worked all night to get
   his living. [440]

   8. I am delighted with St. Peter, who when fleeing from prison was met
   by our Lord, Who told him He was going to Rome to be crucified again. I
   never recite the Office in which this is commemorated without feeling a
   special joy. [441]   What effect did this vision have on St. Peter, and
   what did he do? He went at once to meet his death--and our Lord did him
   no small favour in finding him an executioner!

   9. Oh, my sisters, how forgetful of her ease, how unmindful of honours,
   and how far from seeking men's esteem should she be whose soul God thus
   chooses for His special dwelling-place! For if her mind is fixed on
   Him, as it ought to be, she must needs forget herself: all her thoughts
   are bent on how to please Him better and when and how she can show the
   love she bears Him.

   10. This is the end and aim of prayer, my daughters; this is the reason
   of the spiritual marriage whose children are always good works. Works
   are the unmistakable sign which shows these favours come from God, as I
   told you. It will do me little good to be deeply recollected when
   alone, making acts of the virtues, planning and promising to do wonders
   in God's service, if afterwards, when occasion offers, I do just the
   opposite. I did wrong in saying, It will do me little good,' for all
   the time we spend with God does us great good. Though afterwards we may
   weakly fail to perform our good intentions, yet some time or other His
   Majesty will find a way for us to practise them although perhaps much
   to our regret. Thus when He sees a soul very cowardly, He often sends
   it some great affliction, much against its will, and brings it through
   this trial with profit to itself, When the soul has learnt this, it is
   less timid in offering itself to Him.

   11. I ought to have said, will do us little good' in comparison with
   the far greater good we can gain when our works fulfil our aspirations
   and our promises. She that cannot do all this at once should do it
   little by little, gradually dominating her will, if she wishes to gain
   fruit from prayer. Even in this little nook she will find many a chance
   to praise this. Remember, this is of far more importance than I know
   how to express. Fix your eyes on the Crucified One, and all will seem
   easy. If His Majesty proved His love for us by such stupendous labours
   and sufferings, how can you seek to please Him by words alone?

   12. Do you know what it is to be truly spiritual? It is for men to make
   themselves the slaves of God--branded with His mark, which is the
   cross. Since they have given Him their freedom, He can sell them as
   slaves to the whole world, as He was, which would be doing them no
   wrong but the greatest favour. Unless you make up your minds to this,
   never expect to make much progress, [442]   for as I said humility is
   the foundation of the whole building and unless you are truly humble,
   our Lord, for your own sake, will never permit you to rear it very high
   lest it should fall to the ground.

   13. Therefore, sisters, take care to lay a firm foundation by seeking
   to be the least of all and the slave of others, watching how you can
   please and help them, for it will benefit you more than them. Built on
   such strong rocks, your castle can never go to ruin. I insist again:
   your foundation must not consist of prayer and contemplation alone:
   unless you acquire the virtues and praise them, you will always be
   dwarfs; and please God no worse may befall you than making no progress,
   for you know that to stop is to go back--if you love, you will never be
   content to come to a standstill.

   14. Perhaps you think I am speaking of beginners and that one may rest
   later on, but, as I told you, the rest such souls feel is within them:
   they have less outwardly nor do they wish for it. Why, do you think,
   does the soul send from its centre these inspirations, or rather
   aspirations, (the messages of which I spoke), to the dwellers in the
   precincts of the castle and to the surrounding mansions? To send them
   to sleep? No, no, no! The soul wages a fiercer war from thence to keep
   the powers, senses and the whole body from being idle, than ever it did
   when it suffered in their company. Formerly it did not understand the
   immense benefit its afflictions brought, though indeed they may have
   been the means God used to advance it to this state.

   15. Besides, the company it enjoys gives it far greater strength than
   ever before. If, as David says: With the holy thou shalt be holy,'
   [443]   doubtless by its becoming one with the Almighty, by this
   sovereign union of spirit with spirit, the soul must gather strength,
   as we know the saints did, to suffer and to die. Beyond doubt, with the
   force thus gained, the soul succours all within the castle and even the
   very body itself, which often seems to have no feeling left in it. The
   vigour the soul derives from the wine' drunk in the cellar' [444]
   (into which the Bridegroom brought her and would not let her go)
   overflows into the feeble body, just as the food we eat nourishes both
   the head and the whole frame.

   16. Indeed the body suffers much while alive, for whatever work it
   does, the soul has energy for far greater tasks and goads it on to
   more, for all it can perform appears as nothing. This must be the
   reason of the severe penances performed by many of the saints,
   especially the glorious Magdalen, who had always spent her life in
   luxury. [445]   This caused the zeal felt by our Father Elias for the
   honour of God, [446]   and the desires of St. Dominic, [447]   and St.
   Francis [448]   to draw souls to praise the Almighty. I assure you
   that, forgetful of themselves, they must have passed through no small
   trials.

   17. This, my sisters, is what I would have us strive for--to offer our
   petitions and to practise prayer, not for our own enjoyment but to gain
   strength to serve God. Let us seek no fresh path; we should lose
   ourselves in ways of ease. It would be a strange thing to fancy we
   should gain these graces by any other road than that by which Jesus and
   all His saints have gone before. Let us not dream of such a thing:
   believe me, both Martha and Mary must entertain our Lord and keep Him
   as their Guest, nor must they be so inhospitable as to offer Him no
   food. How can Mary do this while she sits at His feet, if her sister
   does not help her? [449]

   18. His food is that in every possible way we should draw souls to Him
   so that they may be saved and may praise Him for ever. You may offer
   two objections--first, that I said that Mary had chosen the better
   part, [450]   for she had already done Martha's work by waiting on our
   Lord, by washing His feet and by wiping them with her hair.

   19. Do you think it was a small mortification for a woman of rank, as
   she was, to go through the street, perhaps by herself, for in her zeal
   she never thought of how she went? Then she entered a house where she
   was a stranger and had to bear the railing of the Pharisee and many
   other trials. [451]   It was strange to see such a woman as she had
   been thus publicly change her life. With a wicked nation like the Jews,
   the sight of her love for our Lord Whom they hated so bitterly was
   enough to make them cast in her face her former life and taunt her with
   wanting to become a saint. Doubtless she must have changed her rich
   robes and all the rest. Considering how men talk now of people far less
   known than she was, what must have been said of her?

   20. I assure you, sisters, she won the better part after many crosses
   and mortifications. Must not the mere sight of men's hatred of her
   Master have been an intolerable trial? Then, think of what she endured
   afterwards at our Lord's death! I believe, myself, that she did not
   suffer martyrdom because she was already a martyr by grief at
   witnessing the crucifixion. [452]   Then what terrible pain His absence
   must have caused her [453]   during the long years afterwards! You see,
   she was not always enjoying contemplation at the feet of our Saviour!

   21. Secondly, you may say that you have neither the power nor the means
   to lead souls to God; though you would willingly do so, you do not know
   how, as you can neither teach nor preach as did the Apostles. I have
   often written an answer to this objection though I cannot tell whether
   I have done so in connection with the Castle. However, as the
   difficulty probably often crosses your minds on account of the desires
   our Lord gives you of serving Him, I will now speak of it again. [454]
     I told you elsewhere how the devil frequently fills our thoughts with
   great schemes, so that instead of putting our hands to what work we can
   do to serve our Lord, we may rest satisfied with wishing to perform
   impossibilities.

   22. You can do much by prayer; and then, do not try to help the whole
   world, but principally your companions; this work will be all the
   better because you are the more bound to it. Do you think it is a
   trifling matter that your humility and mortification, your readiness to
   serve your sisters, your fervent charity towards them, and your love of
   God, should be as a fire to enkindle their zeal, and that you should
   constantly incite them to practise the other virtues? This would be a
   great work and one most pleasing to our Lord: by thus doing all that is
   in your power, you would prove to His Majesty your willingness to do
   still more and He would reward you as if you had won Him many souls. Do
   you answer: 'This would not be converting my sisters, for they are very
   good already?' What business is that of yours? If they were still
   better, the praise they render God would please Him more and their
   prayers would be more helpful to their neighbours. [455]

   23. In short, my sisters, I will conclude with this advice; do not
   build towers without a foundation, for our Lord does not care so much
   for the importance of our works as for the love with which they are
   done. When we do all we can, His Majesty will enable us to do more
   every day. If we do not grow weary, but during the brief time this life
   lasts (and perhaps it will be shorter than any of you think) we give
   our Lord every sacrifice we can, both interior and exterior, His
   Majesty will unite them with that He offered to His Father for us on
   the Cross so that they may be worth the value given them by our love,
   however mean the works themselves may be.

   24. May it please His Majesty, my sisters and my daughters, that we may
   all meet together where we may praise Him for ever, and may He give me
   grace to practice something of what I have taught you, by the merits of
   His Son, Who liveth and reigneth for ever! Amen. I assure you that I am
   filled with confusion at myself and I beg you, for the sake of the same
   Lord, not to forget this poor sinner in your prayers.

   [438] Ps. cxi. 1. Beatus vir qui timet Dominum.'

   [439] Though thou shouldst have been rapt up to the third heaven with
   Saint Paul, thou art not thereby secured that thou shalt suffer no
   adversity. I,' said Jesus, will shew him how great things he must
   suffer for My name's sake' (Acts. ix. 16). To suffer, therefore, is
   what waits for thee, if thou wilt love Jesus and constantly serve Him
   For our merit and the advancement of our state consist not in having
   many sweetnesses and consolations, but rather in bearing great
   afflictions and tribulations' (Imitation, bk. ii. ch. xii. 12).

   [440] i Thess. ii. 9.

   [441] The Antiphon of the Magnificat at first Vespers of the Feast of
   Saints Peter and Paul, June 29, in the Carmelite Breviary used by St.
   Teresa is: Beatus Petrus Apostolus vidit sibi Christum occurrere.
   Adorans eum ait: "Domine, quo vadis?"--"Venio Romam iterum crucifigi."
   The Blessed Apostle Peter saw Christ come to meet him. Adoring Him, he
   asked "Lord, where art Thou going?"--"I go to Rome to be crucified
   anew." The saint at once returned to Rome and was taken by the soldiers
   and crucified. See Letter of Jan. 17. 1577, note 4. Vol. II.

   [442] "If thou wilt stand upon self and wilt not offer thyself freely
   to My will, thine offering is not perfect, nor will there be entire
   union between us.' (Imitation, bk. iv. ch. viii. 2.)

   [443] Ps. xvii. 26: Cum sancto sanctus eris.'

   [444] Cant. ii. 4.

   [445] 'St. Mary Magdalen gave herself up to penance and contemplation
   in a deep excavation of the rocks at La Baume, near Marseilles. In this
   wild spot there was neither bread, water, nor even herbage. Thus she
   lived for more than thirty-two years without any kind of nourishment
   but that which was celestial, performing meanwhile most severe
   penances.' (St. Vincent Ferrer.)

   [446] III Reg. xix. 10.

   [447] 'There was one sentiment within him to which may almost be given
   the name of passion: it was his ceaseless burning thirst for the
   salvation of souls. As his Divine Master had come into the world to
   save sinners and loved them even unto death, so he, too, gave up all
   that was most dear to him in his life to win souls to Christ. He was
   always giving himself: it was the very key-note of his existence. He
   would have sold himself as a slave, he would have been cut to pieces by
   the heretics, he would spare himself neither by day nor by night, if by
   any means he might save some.' (From the History of St. Dominic, by
   Augusta Theodosia Drane. London, 1891, p. 256).

   [448] 'St. Francis of Assisi, at the very beginning of his Order, when
   he had only seven followers, said to them: "Consider, my brethren, what
   is our vocation. It is not only for our own salvation that the mercy of
   God has called us, but for the salvation of many other souls. It is
   that we may go forth and exhort all men rather by our example than by
   our words, to do penance and keep the divine commands."' (The Life of
   St. Francis of Assisi, by a religious of the Order of Poor Clares,
   London, 1861, p. 32).

  IHS

   ALTHOUGH, as I told you, I felt reluctant to begin this work, yet now
   it is finished I am very glad to have written it, and I think my
   trouble has been well spent, though I confess it has cost me but
   little. Considering your strict enclosure, the little recreation you
   have, my sisters, and how many conveniences are wanting in some of your
   convents, I think it may console you to enjoy yourselves in this
   interior castle which you can enter, and walk about at will, at any
   hour you please, without asking leave of your superiors. It is true you
   cannot enter all the mansions by your own power, however great it may
   appear to you, unless the Lord of the castle Himself admits you.
   Therefore I advise you to use no violence if you meet with any
   obstacle, for that would displease Him so much that He would never give
   you admission to them. He dearly loves humility: [456]   if you think
   yourselves unworthy to enter the third mansion, He will grant you all
   the sooner the favour of entering the fifth. Then, if you serve Him
   well there and often repair to it, He will draw you into the mansion
   where He dwells Himself, whence you need never depart unless called
   away by the Prioress, whose commands this sovereign Master wishes you
   to obey as if they were His own. If by her orders, you are often absent
   from His presence chamber, whenever you return He will hold the door
   open for you. When once you have learnt how to enjoy this castle, you
   will always find rest, however painful your trials may be, in the hope
   of returning to your Lord, which no one can prevent. Although I have
   only mentioned seven mansions, yet each one contains many more rooms,
   above, below, and around it, with fair gardens, fountains, and
   labyrinths, besides other things so delightful that you will wish to
   consume yourself in praising in return the great God Who has created
   the soul to His own image and likeness. If you find anything in the
   plan of this treatise which helps you to know Him better, be certain
   that it is sent by His Majesty to encourage you, and that whatever you
   find amiss in it is my own. In return for my strong desire to aid you
   in serving Him, my God and my Lord, I implore you, whenever you read
   this, to praise His Majesty fervently in my name and to beg Him to
   prosper His Church, to give light to the Lutherans, to pardon my sins
   and to free me from purgatory, where perhaps I shall be, by the mercy
   of God, when you see this book (if it is given to you after having been
   examined by theologians). If these writings contain any error, it is
   through my ignorance; I submit in all things to the teachings of the
   holy Catholic Roman Church, of which I am now a member, as I protest
   and promise I will be both in life and death. May our Lord God be for
   ever praised and blessed! Amen, Amen.

   I finished writing this book in the convent of St. Joseph of Avila,
   1577, on the Vigil of St. Andrew, for the glory of God, Who liveth and
   reigneth for ever and ever! Amen.
