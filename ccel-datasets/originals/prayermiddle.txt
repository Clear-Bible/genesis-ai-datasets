Preface

   This is a companion volume to the Prayers of the Early Church. That
   little volume has been started on its way and the editor has been
   encouraged to do this one on the Prayers of the Middle Ages.

   The period covered by these prayers is that of a thousand years from
   A.D. 500 to A.D. 1500. Generally speaking, the period is from the fall
   of Rome to the Reformation. This period was formerly called the Dark
   Ages. Evidence of the lack of light has been found in the lack of
   material in some of the centuries. It has been hard to find any prayers
   in a few. However, taken collectively, it is seen that there was much
   light that came out of these ages. The Church was kept alive by those
   who kept the light burning. The latter half of this period is now
   called the Golden Age of Mysticism.

   The arrangement of the prayers is century by century. There are some
   questions about dates of these as well as authorship. The authorities
   do not always agree.

   We are indebted to many collections of prayers and to other sources.
   Some of the books which have been most valuable are Prayers of the
   Ages, compiled by Caroline S. Whitmarsh; Of the Imitation of Christ;
   Great Souls at Prayer, arranged by Mrs. Mary W. Tileston; The Cloud of
   Witness, by Hon. Mrs. Gell; Prayers, from the collection of the late
   Baron Bunsen; A Chain of Prayer Across the Ages, compiled by Selina
   Fitzherbert Fox; Prayers We Love to Pray, arranged by Edward Leigh
   Pell; Morning Readings, compiled by Frank M. Rich; Prayers of the
   Saints, by Cecil Headlam; Prayers Ancient and Modern, compiled by Mary
   Wilder Tileston; Ancient Collects, by Rev. William Bright; Prayers,
   Massachusetts Council of the Church Service League; Theologia
   Germanica; The Cloud of Unknowing; His Words of Admonition and Praises
   of God, by St. Francis of Assisi; Common Prayers for Family Use, by
   Westcott.

   The main purpose of this little volume is for individual and family
   devotions. However, it is found that prayers like these are read in
   worship services, in prayer cells, and prayer meetings. Young people's
   and women's groups constantly make use of them. This little book is
   recommended for all types of worship services and for use in church
   bulletins. Many other ways will be found to use them.

   The editor wishes to acknowledge his deep debt of gratitude to the late
   lamented Dr. J. Minton Batten, professor of church history in
   Vanderbilt University, and to Miss Clarice Winstead, secretary to the
   editor, for their invaluable service in compiling this book of prayers.

  For Forgiveness

   O God, whose nature and property is ever to have mercy and to forgive,

   Lord. Amen. --Gregorian Sacramentary

  For the Loving Care of the Good Shepherd

   O Lord Jesus Christ, Thou, good Shepherd of the sheep, who camest to

   weary to lie down in Thy pastures, bind up those who are broken in
   heart, and strengthen those who are weak, that we, relying on Thy care

   Ancient Collect

  For Love and Light

   O Lord, give us, we beseech Thee, in the name of Jesus Christ Thy Son
   our God, that love which can never cease, that will kindle our lamps
   but not extinguish them, that they may burn in us and enlighten others.
   Do Thou, O Christ, our dearest Saviour, Thyself kindle our lamps, that
   they may evermore shine in Thy temple, that they may receive
   unquenchable light from Thee that will enlighten our darkness, and
   lessen the darkness of the world. Lord Jesus, we pray Thee give Thy
   light to our lamps, that in its light the most holy place may be
   revealed to us in which Thou dwellest as the Eternal Priest, that we
   may always behold Thee, desire Thee, look upon Thee in love, and long
   after Thee, for Thy sake. Amen. --Columba

   thirsting souls the draught of life, and restore to our darkened minds
   the light from heaven; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Mozarabic
   Liturgy
     __________________________________________________________________

  For the Church

   Hear us, O God of our salvation, Thou hope of all the ends of the
   earth, and in Thy strength, set fast as the mountains, the outposts of
   Thy power, and strongholds of lofty virtues. On Thee we rely for gifts
   of aspiration, whereby to ascend to the summit of all blessedness; that

   begin; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Mozarabic Liturgy

     __________________________________________________________________

  Good Friday

   Today, O good Jesus, for us Thou didst not hide Thy face from shame and
   spitting. Today, Jesus our Redeemer, for us Thou wast mocked, buffeted
   by unbelievers, and crowned with thorns. Today, O good Shepherd, Thou
   didst lay down Thy life on the Cross for the sheep, and wast crucified
   with robbers, and hadst Thy sacred hands nailed through. Today Thou
   wast laid in the guarded sepulchre, and the saints burst open their
   tombs. Today, O good Jesus, put an end to our sins, that on the day of
   Thy resurrection we may joyfully receive Thy holy body, and be
   refreshed with Thy sacred blood. Amen. --Mozarabic Sacramentary
     __________________________________________________________________

  Easter

   The Day of Resurrection has dawned upon us, the day of true light and
   life, wherein Christ, the life of believers, arose from the dead. Let
   us give abundant thanks and praise to God, that while we solemnly
   celebrate the day of our Lord's resurrection, He may be pleased to
   bestow on us quiet peace and special gladness; so that being protected
   from morning to night by His favoring mercy, we may rejoice in the gift
   of our Redeemer. Amen. --Mozarabic Sacramentary

   pardon and entire absolution; and, thus healed, may arise and sin no
   more, through the merits and for the sake of Jesus Christ, my Lord and
   only Saviour. Amen. --Mozarabic Sacramentary

   and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of
   knowledge and godliness, and of Thy fear. Make me ever to seek Thy face
   with all my heart, all my soul, all my mind; grant me to have a

   Thy holy calm; gather together with Thy hand all those who are
   scattered, and bring them like sheep into the fold of Thy holy Church,
   through Jesus Christ our Lord.

   Strengthen and confirm me, O Lord, by Thy Cross, on the rock of faith,
   that my mind be not shaken by the attacks of the enemy. For Thou alone
   art holy.

   Thou knowest, O Lord, how many and great are my sins, Thou knowest how
   often I sin, from day to day, from hour to hour, in the things I do and
   the things I leave undone. No more, O Lord, no more, O Lord my God,
   will I provoke Thee; no more shall my desire be for anything but Thee,
   for Thou alone art truly lovable. And if again I offend in anything, I
   humbly beseech Thee of Thy mercy to grant me strength to find favour
   again in Thy sight and to live in a manner more pleasing to Thee. Amen.

   O God the Father, origin of Divinity, good beyond all that is good,
   fair beyond all that is fair, in whom is calmness, peace, and concord;
   do Thou make up the dissensions which divide us from each other, and
   bring us back into a unity of love, which may bear some likeness to Thy
   divine nature. And as Thou art above all things, make us one by the
   unanimity of a good mind, that through the embrace of charity and the

   Lord God Almighty, shaper and ruler of all creatures, we pray Thee for
   Thy great mercy, that Thou guide us better than we have done, towards
   Thee, and guide us to Thy will, to the need of our soul, better than we
   can ourselves. And steadfast our mind towards Thy will and to our
   soul's need. And strengthen us against the temptations of the devil,
   and put far from us all lust, and every unrighteousness, and shield us
   against our foes, seen and unseen. And teach us to do Thy will, that we
   may inwardly love Thee before all things, with a pure mind. For Thou
   art our maker and our redeemer, our help, our comfort, our trust, our
   hope; praise and glory be to Thee now, ever and ever, world without

   Thine, to Thee, Lord, we pray, who art the supreme truth, for all truth
   that is, is from Thee. Thee we implore, O Lord, who art the highest
   wisdom, through Thee are wise, all those that are so. Thou art the
   supreme joy, and from Thee all have become happy that are so. Thou art
   the highest good, and from Thee all beauty springs. Thou art the
   intellectual light, and from Thee man derives his understanding. To
   Thee, O God, we call and speak. Hear us, O Lord, for Thou art our God
   and our Lord, our father and our creator, our ruler and our hope, our
   wealth and our honour, our home, our country, our salvation, and our
   life; hear, hear us, O Lord. Few of Thy servants comprehend Thee, but
   at least we love Thee--yea, love Thee above all other things. We seek
   Thee, we follow Thee, we are ready to serve Thee; under Thy power we
   desire to abide, for Thou art the Sovereign of all. We pray Thee to
   command us as Thou wilt; through Jesus Christ Thy Son our Lord. Amen.

  For Pardon, Grace, and Guidance

   O Thou plenteous source of every good and perfect gift, shed abroad the
   cheering light of Thy sevenfold grace over our hearts. Yea, Spirit of
   love and gentleness, we most humbly implore Thy assistance. Thou
   knowest our faults, our failings, our necessities, the dulness of our
   understanding, the waywardness of our affections, the perverseness of
   our will. When, therefore, we neglect to practise what we know, visit
   us, we beseech Thee, with Thy grace, enlighten our minds, rectify our
   desires, correct our wanderings, and pardon our omissions, so that by
   Thy guidance we may be preserved from making shipwreck of faith, and
   keep a good conscience, and may at length be landed safe in the haven
   of eternal rest; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Anselm
     __________________________________________________________________

  For the Afflicted and Distressed

   We bring before Thee, O Lord, the troubles and perils of people and
   nations, the sighing of prisoners and captives, the sorrows of the
   bereaved, the necessities of strangers, the helplessness of the weak,
   the despondency of the weary, the failing powers of the aged. O Lord,
   draw near to each; for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

  For Blessedness

   O God, Thou art life, wisdom, truth, bounty, and blessedness, the
   Eternal, the only true Good! My God and my Lord, Thou art my hope and
   my heart's joy. I confess, with thanksgiving, that Thou hast made me in
   Thine image, that I may direct all my thoughts to Thee, and love Thee.
   Lord, make me to know Thee aright, that I may more and more love, and
   enjoy, and possess Thee. And since, in the life here below, I cannot
   fully attain this blessedness, let it at least grow in me day by day,
   until it all be fulfilled at last in the life to come. Here be the
   knowledge of Thee increased, and there let it be perfected. Here let my
   love to Thee grow, and there let it ripen; that my joy being here great
   in hope, may there in fruition be made perfect. Amen. --Anselm

  For Heavenly-Mindedness

   O merciful God, fill our hearts, we pray Thee, with the graces of Thy
   Holy Spirit, with love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
   goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Teach us to love those who hate
   us, to pray for those who despitefully use us, that we may be the
   children of Thee our Father, who makest Thy sun to shine on the evil
   and on the good, and sendest rain on the just and on the unjust. In
   adversity grant us grace to be patient; in prosperity keep us humble;
   may we guard the door of our lips; may we lightly esteem the pleasures
   of this world, and thirst after heavenly things; through Jesus Christ
   our Lord. Amen. --Anselm

  For the Presence of the Holy Spirit

   O holy Paraclete, sweetest consolation of the sorrowful, gracious

   enrich all with the dew of Thine abundant comfort. Kindle our inward
   parts with holy favour, that the incense of our prayers and praises may
   ever go up to Thee, O our God; through Jesus Christ Thy Son our Lord.
   Amen. --Anselm
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Zeal

   O almighty and merciful Father, who pourest Thy benefits upon us,
   forgive the unthankfulness with which we have requited Thy goodness. We
   have remained before Thee with dead and senseless hearts, unkindled
   with love of Thy gentle and enduring goodness. Turn Thou us, O merciful
   Father, and so shall we be turned. Make us with our whole heart to
   hunger and thirst after Thee, and with all our longing to desire Thee.
   Make us with our whole heart to serve Thee alone and with all our zeal
   to seek those things which are well-pleasing in Thy sight; for the sake
   of Thine only begotten Son, to whom with Thee and the Holy Ghost be all
   honour and glory, for ever and ever. Amen. --Anselm

  For Holy Week

   O Father, most merciful, who in the beginning didst create us, and by
   the passion of Thine only begotten Son hast created us anew, work in us
   now, we beseech Thee, both to will and to do of Thy good pleasure. And
   forasmuch as we are weak, and can do no good thing of ourselves, grant
   us Thy grace and heavenly benediction, that in whatsoever work we
   engage we may do all to Thy honour and glory; and that, being kept from
   sin and daily increasing in good works, so long as we live in the body
   we may ever show forth some service to Thee; and after our departure
   may receive pardon of all our sins, and attain eternal life; through
   Him who, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, liveth and reigneth for ever and
   ever. Amen. --Anselm
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Perfection

   O Lord Jesus Christ, our redemption and our salvation, we praise Thee
   and give Thee thanks; and though we be unworthy of Thy benefits, and
   cannot offer unto Thee due devotion, yet let Thy loving-kindness fill
   up that which our weakness endeavoureth. Before Thee, O Lord, is all
   our desire, and whatsoever our heart rightly willeth, it is of Thy
   gift. Grant that we may attain to love Thee even as Thou commandest.
   Let not Thy gift be unfruitful in us. Perfect that Thou hast begun,
   give that which Thou hast made us to long after, convert Thou our
   lukewarmness into fervent love of Thee; for the glory of Thy holy name.
   Amen. --Anselm

  For Absent Friends

   O blessed Lord and Saviour, who hast commanded us to love one another,
   grant us grace that, having received Thine undeserved bounty, we may
   love every man in Thee and for Thee. We beseech Thy blessing for all;
   but especially for the friends whom Thy love hast given to us. Love
   Thou them, O Thou fountain of love, and make them to love Thee with all
   their heart, with all their mind, and with all their soul, that those
   things only which are pleasing to Thee they may will, and speak, and
   do. And though our prayer is cold, because our charity is so little
   fervent, yet Thou art rich in mercy. Measure not to them Thy goodness
   by the dulness of our devotion; but as Thy kindness surpasseth all
   human affection, so let Thy hearing transcend our prayer. Do Thou to
   them what is expedient for them, according to Thy will, that they,
   being always and everywhere ruled and protected by Thee, may attain in
   the end to everlasting life; and to Thee, with the Father and the Holy
   Spirit, be all honour and praise for ever and ever. Amen. --Anselm

   Almighty God and heavenly Father, who of Thine infinite love and
   goodness towards us, hast given to us Thy only and most dearly beloved
   Son, Jesus Christ, to be our redeemer and the author of everlasting
   life, who, after He made perfect our redemption, by His death and was
   ascended into heaven, sent abroad into the world His apostles,
   prophets, evangelists, doctors, and pastors; by whose labour and
   ministry He gathered together a great flock from all parts of the
   world, to set forth the eternal praise of Thy holy name: for these so
   great benefits of Thy eternal goodness we render unto Thee most hearty
   thanks. We praise and worship Thee, and we humbly beseech Thee, by the

   Almighty and merciful God, who dost grant unto Thy faithful people the
   grace to make every path of life temporal, the strait and narrow way
   which leadeth unto life eternal, grant that we, who know that we have

  Need for Heavenly Refreshment

   [O God,] my heart is a vain heart, a vagabond and instable heart; while
   it is led by its own judgment, and wanting divine counsel, cannot
   subsist in itself; and whilst it divers ways seekest not, findeth none,
   but remaineth miserable through labor, and void of peace: it agreeth
   not with itself, it dissenteth from itself, it altereth resolutions,
   changeth the judgment, frameth new thoughts, pulleth down the old, and
   buildeth them up again: it willeth and willeth not; and never remaineth
   in the same state.

   Come, Holy Spirit, and bring from heaven a ray of Thy light! Come, Thou
   father of the poor, Thou giver of gifts, Thou light of the world, the
   blessed Comforter, the dear guest of the soul, and its sweetest
   refreshment; Thou, our repose in labor, our coolness in heat, our
   comfort in affliction! O, most blessed Spirit, fill full the hearts of
   Thy faithful people! Without Thy influence there is nothing in man
   which is not weakness and guilt. O, cleanse that which is sordid; bedew
   that which is dried up; heal that which is wounded; bend that which is
   stubborn, cherish in Thy bosom that which is cold; guide that which is
   wandering; and grant unto Thy servants, putting their trust in Thee,
   the merit of Thy righteousness; grant them final salvation; grant them
   everlasting joy! O Lord, hear our prayer, and let our cry come unto
   Thee. Amen. --Bernard of Clairvaux

  Delight in Christ


   Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts!

   Thou fount of life! Thou light of men!

   From the best bliss that earth imparts,

   We turn unfilled to Thee again.


   Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;

   Thou savest those that on Thee call;

   To them that seek Thee, Thou art good,

   To them that find Thee--All in All!


   We taste Thee, O Thou living bread,

   And long to feast upon Thee still;

   We drink of Thee, the fountain head,

   And thirst our souls from Thee to fill.


   Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,

   Where'er our changeful lot is cast;

   Glad, when Thy gracious smile we see,

   Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.


   O Jesus, ever with us stay!

   Make all our moments calm and bright

   Chase the dark night of sin away--

   Shed o'er the world Thy holy light!


   Amen.

   --Ascribed to Bernard of Clairvaux

  For Grace

   O Lord Jesus, grant us Thy grace and give unto us time for repentance.
   We would keep Thy commandments and do Thy bidding, choose the better
   part and no longer follow after evil; grant us Thy strength that this
   may so be, O loving Saviour for Thine own name's sake. Amen. --Dan

  Make Me an Instrument of Thy Peace


   Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;

   Where hate rules, let me bring love,

   Where malice, forgiveness,

   Where disputes, reconciliation,

   Where error, truth,

   Where doubt, belief,

   Where despair, hope,

   Where darkness, Thy light,

   Where sorrow, joy!


   O Master, let me strive more to comfort others than to be comforted,

   To understand others than to be understood,

   To love others, more than to be loved!


   For he who gives, receives,

   He who forgets himself, finds,

   He who forgives, receives forgiveness,

   And dying, we rise again to eternal life. Amen.

  The Daily Prayer of St. Francis

   My God, and my all, who art Thou, sweetest Lord, my God? And who am I,
   a poor worm, Thy servant? Holiest Lord, I would love Thee! Sweetest
   Lord, I would love Thee! Lord, my God, I give to Thee all my heart and

  Praise

   Now to that God, who has suffered so much for us, who at one giving has
   conferred on us so many good things, and will yet confer so many more,
   to this God let every creature who is in heaven or upon the earth, in
   the sea or in the depth of the abyss, render praise, glory, honour and

   lofty, almighty, admirable, and glorious; the only holy, worthy of
   praise and blessed through ages of ages. Amen. --Francis of Assisi

  For the Knowledge of God's Will

   God, almighty, eternal, righteous, and merciful, give to us poor
   sinners to do for Thy sake all that we know of Thy will, and to will

   kindled by the fire of the Holy Spirit, we may follow in the footprints
   of Thy well-beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. --Francis of

  Thanksgiving

   Almighty, most holy, most high and supreme God, holy and just Father,
   Lord, king of heaven and earth, for Thyself we give thanks to Thee
   because by Thy holy will, and by Thine only Son, Thou hast created all
   things spiritual and corporal in the Holy Ghost and didst place us made
   to Thine image and likeness in paradise, whence we fell by our own
   fault. And we give Thee thanks because, as by Thy Son Thou didst create
   us, so by the true and holy love with which Thou hast loved us, Thou
   didst cause Him, true God and true man, to be born.... And we give
   thanks to Thee because Thy Son Himself is to come again in the glory of
   His Majesty ... to say to all who have known Thee and adored Thee, and
   served Thee in repentance: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess the
   Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world." And since
   all we wretches and sinners are not worthy to name Thee, we humbly
   beseech Thee, that our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, in whom Thou
   art well pleased, together with the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, may give
   thanks to Thee as it is pleasing to Thee and Them, for all. Amen.
   --Francis of Assisi

  Praise and Guidance

   Almighty, most holy, most high, and supreme God, highest good, all
   good, wholly good, who alone art good, to Thee we render all praise,
   all glory, all thanks, all honor, all blessing, and we shall always
   refer all good to Thee.

   Almighty, eternal, just, and merciful God, give to us wretches to do
   for Thee what we know Thee to will and to will always that which is
   pleasing to Thee; so that inwardly purified, inwardly illumined and
   kindled by the flame of the Holy Ghost, we may be able to follow in the
   footsteps of Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and by Thy grace alone
   come to Thee the Most High, who in perfect Trinity and simple unity
   livest and reignest and gloriest God Almighty for ever and ever. Amen.

  For the Brothers

   Lord Jesus, Thou didst choose Thine apostles to the number of twelve,
   and if one of them did betray Thee, the others, remaining united to
   Thee, preached Thy holy Gospel, filled with one and the same
   inspiration; and behold now, remembering the former days, Thou hast
   raised up the Religion of the Brothers in order to uphold faith, and
   that by them the mystery of Thy Gospel may be accomplished. Who will
   take their place if, instead of fulfilling their mission and being
   shining examples for all, they are seen to give themselves up to the
   works of darkness? Amen. --Francis of Assisi
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Thy Love

   I beseech Thee, O Lord, that the fiery and sweet strength of Thy love
   may absorb my soul from all things that are under heaven, that I may
   die for love of Thy love as Thou didst deign to die for the love of my
   love. Amen. --Francis of Assisi

  Thanksgiving

   Thanks be to Thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, for all the benefits which Thou
   hast given us; for all the pains and insults which Thou hast borne for

   clearly, love Thee more dearly, and follow Thee more nearly; for Thine
   own sake. Amen. --Richard of Chichester

  Daily Prayer

   Grant me, I beseech Thee, O merciful God, prudently to study, rightly

   Thou, O Christ, art the King of glory; Thou art the everlasting Son of
   the Father. Amen. --Thomas Aquinas
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Steadfastness

   Grant me, I beseech Thee, almighty and most merciful God, fervently to
   desire, wisely to search out, and perfectly to fulfill, all that is
   well-pleasing unto Thee. Order Thou my worldly condition to the glory
   of Thy name; and, of all that Thou requirest me to do, grant me the
   knowledge, the desire, and the ability, that I may so fulfill it as I
   ought, and may my path to Thee, I pray, be safe, straightforward, and
   perfect to the end.

   Give me, O Lord, a steadfast heart, which no unworthy affection may
   drag downwards; give me an unconquered heart, which no tribulation can
   wear out; give me an upright heart, which no unworthy purpose may tempt
   aside.

   Bestow upon me also, O Lord my God, understanding to know Thee,
   diligence to seek Thee, wisdom to find Thee, and a faithfulness that
   may finally embrace Thee. Amen. --Thomas Aquinas
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Love of Jesus

   Ah! sweet Jesus, pierce the marrow of my soul with the healthful shafts
   of Thy love, that it may truly burn, and melt, and languish, with the
   only desire of Thee; that it may desire to be dissolved, and to be with
   Thee; let it hunger alone for the bread of life: let it thirst after
   Thee, the spring and fountain of eternal light, the stream of true
   pleasure; let it always desire Thee, seek Thee, and find Thee, and
   sweetly rest in Thee. Amen. --Bonaventura
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Pardon, Purity, and Grace

   O Holy God, in whom is all goodness, whose pity and mercy made Thee to
   descend from the high throne down into this world, the valley of woe
   and weeping, and here to take our nature, and in that nature to suffer
   pain and death, to bring our souls to Thy Kingdom. Merciful Lord,
   forgive us all our sins that we have done, thought, and said. O
   glorious Trinity, send us cleanness of heart and purity of soul;
   restore us with Thy Holy Spirit, and strengthen us with Thy might, that
   we may always withstand evil temptations. Comfort us with Thy Holy
   Ghost, and fulfill us with grace and charity, that we may henceforth
   live virtuously and love Thee with all our heart, with all our might,
   and with all our soul, so that we may never offend Thee, but ever
   follow Thy pleasure in will, word, thought, and deed. Now grant us
   this, good Lord, that art infinite, which eternally shall endure;
   through Jesus Christ Thy Son. Amen. --Richard Rolle

  A Memorial of the Resurrection

   O Lord Jesus Christ, by Thy glorious resurrection, in which Thou didst
   appear alive and immortal to Thy disciples and faithful followers, by
   Thy forty days' abiding and sweet converse, in which by many infallible
   proofs, speaking of things pertaining to the Kingdom of God, Thou didst
   comfort them and assure them of Thine actual resurrection, removing all
   doubt from their hearts. We beseech Thee, O Lord, grant that we may be
   numbered among those who were fore-ordained by God to be witnesses of
   Thy resurrection, not only by word of mouth, but in reality of good
   works; for Thine honour and glory, who with the Father and the Holy
   Ghost livest and reignest ever one God, world without end. Amen.
   --Ludolphus of Saxony

  For Heavenly-Mindedness

   O most blessed Lord, deign to help us, and of Thy great mercy abolish
   our sins; detach our minds from earthly things, and raise them to the
   love of heavenly riches. Most merciful God, who dost favour all true
   love, do Thou so aid and direct us that we may love Thee above all
   things, and recognizing Thine infinite benefits, may keep them in
   memory, and give Thee everlasting thanks for them. Finally, grant that
   ours may be the blessed life which shall enjoy Thy love for ever;
   through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Raymond Jordanus
     __________________________________________________________________

  Self-Renunciation

   If a man may attain thereunto, to be unto God as his hand is unto man,
   let him be therewith content, and not seek further....

   That we may thus deny ourselves, and forsake and renounce all things
   for God's sake, and give up our own wills, and die unto ourselves, and
   live unto God alone and to his will, may He help us who gave up His
   will to His heavenly Father,--Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be
   blessing for ever and ever. Amen. --Theologia Germanica
     __________________________________________________________________

  The God We Love

   Now, he who will hold to God, loves all things in the One which is One
   and All; and the One in All, because All is in the One; and he who
   loves somewhat, this or that, otherwise than in the One, and for the
   sake of the One, loves not God; for he loves somewhat which is not God,
   therefore he loves it more than God. But he who loves somewhat more
   than God, or equally with God, loves not God; for God must be and will
   be alone loved, and in truth nothing ought to be loved but God alone.
   And when the True Light and the True divine Love dwell in a man, he
   loves nothing else but God alone. For he loves God as the Good, and for
   the sake of the Good, and all Goods as One, and One as All. For,
   verily, All is One and One is All in God. Amen. --Theologia Germanica

  The Quiet Hour

   Lord, I offer unto Thee all my sins and offences, which I have
   committed before Thee, from the day wherein I first could sin even to
   this hour; that Thou mayest consume and burn them, one and all, with
   the fire of Thy love, and do away all the stains of my sins, and
   cleanse my conscience from all offences, and restore to me Thy grace,
   fully forgiving me all, and admitting me mercifully to the kiss of
   peace. I offer up also unto Thee all that is good in me, though it be
   very small and imperfect, in order that Thou mayest amend and sanctify
   it, that Thou mayest make it grateful and acceptable unto Thee, and
   always be perfecting it more and more; and bring me also, slothful and
   unprofitable poor creature as I am, to a good and blessed end. Amen.

  For Faithful and Prepared Lives

   Who can tell what a day may bring forth? Cause us, therefore, gracious
   God, to live every day as if it were to be our last, for that we know
   not but it may be such. Cause us to live so at present as we shall wish
   we had done when we come to die. O grant that we may not die with any
   guilt upon our consciences, or any known sin unrepented of, but that we
   may be found in Christ, who is our only Saviour and Redeemer. Amen.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Let Thy Will Be Mine

   O most merciful Lord, grant to me Thy grace, that it may be with me,
   and labor with me, and persevere with me even to the end. Grant that I
   may always desire and will that which is to Thee most acceptable, and
   most dear. Let Thy will be mine, and my will ever follow Thine, and
   agree perfectly with it. Grant to me, above all things that can be
   desired, to rest in Thee, and in Thee to have my heart at peace. Thou
   art the true peace of the heart, Thou its only rest; out of Thee all
   things are hard and restless. In this very peace, that is, in Thee, the
   one Chiefest Eternal Good, I will sleep and rest. Amen. --Thomas à
   Kempis

  Praise

   I will say unto my God, my Lord, and my King, "O how great is the
   abundance of Thy goodness, O Lord, which Thou hast laid up for them
   that fear Thee." But what art Thou to those who love Thee? What to
   those who serve Thee with their whole heart? In this especially Thou
   hast showed me the sweetness of Thy love; that, when I was not, Thou
   madest me, when I went far astray from Thee, Thou broughtest me back
   again, that I might serve Thee, and hast commanded me to love Thee. I
   would I were able, at least for one day, to do Thee some worthy
   service. Truly, Thou art my Lord, and I Thy servant, who am bound to
   serve Thee with all my might; and this I wish to do, this I desire; and
   whatsoever is wanting unto me, do Thou, I beseech Thee, vouchsafe to
   supply. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  Thy Will Be Done

   O Lord, Thou knowest what is best for us, let this or that be done, as
   Thou shalt please. Give what Thou wilt, and how much Thou wilt, and
   when Thou wilt. Deal with me as Thou thinkest good, and as best
   pleaseth Thee. Set me where Thou wilt, and deal with me in all things
   just as Thou wilt. Behold, I am Thy servant, prepared for all things;
   for I desire not to live unto myself, but unto Thee; and Oh, that I
   could do it worthily and perfectly! Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  My Hope and Refuge

   Ah, Lord God, Thou holy Lover of my soul, when Thou comest into my
   soul, all that is within me shall rejoice. Thou art my Glory and the
   exultation of my heart; Thou art my hope and refuge in the day of my
   trouble. Set me free from all evil passions, and heal my heart of all
   inordinate affections; that, being inwardly cured and thoroughly
   cleansed, I may be made fit to love, courageous to suffer, steady to
   persevere. Nothing is sweeter than love, nothing more courageous,
   nothing fuller nor better in heaven and earth; because love is born of
   God, and cannot rest but in God, above all created things. Let me love
   Thee more than myself, nor love myself but for Thee; and in Thee all
   that truly love Thee, as the law of love commandeth, shining out from
   Thyself. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Others

   I offer up unto Thee my prayers and intercessions, for those especially
   who have in any matter hurt, grieved, or found fault with me, or who
   have done me any damage or displeasure.

   For all those also whom, at any time, I may have vexed, troubled,
   burdened, and scandalized, by words or deeds, knowingly or in
   ignorance; that Thou wouldst grant us all equally pardon for our
   offences against each other.

   Take away from our hearts, O Lord, all suspiciousness, indignation,
   wrath, and contention, and whatsoever may hurt charity, and lessen
   brotherly love.

   Have mercy, O Lord, have mercy on those that crave Thy mercy, give
   grace unto them that stand in need thereof, and make us such as that we
   may be worthy to enjoy Thy grace, and go forward to life eternal. Amen.
   --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  To Do Thy Will

   O Lord, my God, Thou art to me whatsoever is good. Remember me because
   I am nothing, I have nothing, and I can do nothing. Thou alone art
   good, just, and holy; Thou canst do all things, Thou accomplishest all
   things, Thou fillest all things. Remember Thy mercies, and fill my
   heart with Thy grace, Thou who wilt not that Thy works should be void
   and in vain. Turn not Thy face away from me; withdraw not Thy
   consolation, lest my soul become as a thirsty land to Thee. Teach me, O
   Lord, to do Thy will; teach me to live worthily and humbly in Thy
   sight. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  My Salvation and My Redemption

   In confidence of Thy goodness and great mercy, O Lord, I draw near unto
   Thee, as a sick person to the healer, as one hungry and thirsty to the
   fountain of life, a creature to the creator, a desolate soul to my own
   tender comforter. Behold, in Thee is all whatsoever I can or ought to
   desire; Thou art my salvation and my redemption, my hope and my
   strength. Rejoice therefore this day the soul of Thy servant; for unto
   Thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For the Holy Spirit

   Strengthen me, O God, by the grace of Thy Holy Spirit. Grant me to be
   strengthened with might in the inner man, and to empty my heart of all
   useless care and anguish. O Lord, grant me heavenly wisdom, that I may
   learn above all things to seek and to find Thee, above all things to
   relish and to love Thee, and to think of all other things as being,
   what indeed they are, at the disposal of Thy wisdom. Amen. --Thomas à
   Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Thee, O Lord

   Lord, what is my confidence which I have in this life? Is it not Thou,
   O Lord, my God, whose mercies are without number? Where hath it ever
   been well with me without Thee, or where could it be ill with me, when
   Thou wert present? I rather choose to be a pilgrim on earth, than
   without Thee to possess heaven. Where Thou art, there is heaven; and
   where Thou art not, there is death and hell. There is none that can
   help me in my necessities, but only Thou, my God; Thou art my hope,
   Thou my confidence. Although Thou exposest me to divers temptations and
   adversities, yet Thou orderest all this to my advantage; in which trial
   of me Thou oughtest no less to be loved and praised, than if Thou didst
   fill me full of heavenly consolations. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Consolation

   O Thou most sweet and loving Lord, Thou knowest mine infirmities, and
   the necessities which I endure; in how great evils and sins I am
   involved; how often I am weighed down, tempted, and disturbed by them.
   I entreat of Thee consolation and support. I speak to Thee who knowest
   all things, to whom all my inward thoughts are open, and who alone
   canst perfectly comfort and help me. Thou knowest what things I stand
   in most need of. Behold, I stand before Thee poor and naked, calling
   for grace, and imploring mercy. Refresh Thy hungry supplicant, kindle
   my coldness with the fire of Thy love, enlighten my blindness with the
   brightness of Thy presence. Suffer me not to go away from Thee hungry
   and dry, but deal mercifully with me, as often times Thou hast dealt
   wonderfully with Thy saints. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Trust in Thee

   O Lord my God, be not Thou far from me; my God, have regard to help me;
   for there have risen up against me sundry thoughts, and great fears,
   afflicting my soul. How shall I pass through unhurt? How shall I break
   them to pieces? This is my hope, my one only consolation, to flee unto
   Thee in every tribulation, to trust in Thee, to call upon Thee from my
   inmost heart, and to wait patiently for Thy consolation. Amen. --Thomas
   à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For the Comforter

   Write Thy blessed name, O Lord, upon my heart, there to remain so
   indelibly engraven, that no prosperity, no adversity shall ever move me
   from Thy love. Be Thou to me a strong tower of defence, a comforter in
   tribulation, a deliverer in distress, a very present help in trouble,
   and a guide to heaven through the many temptations and dangers of this
   life. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Love of God and His Laws

   O most gracious God, from whom every good and perfect gift cometh, we
   beseech Thee to work in us both to will and to do according to Thy good
   pleasure. Enlighten our minds that we may know Thee, and let us not be
   unfruitful in that knowledge. Lord, work in our hearts a true faith, a
   purifying hope, and an unfeigned love towards Thee. Give us a full
   trust in Thee, zeal for Thee, reverence of all things that relate to
   Thee. Make us fearful to offend Thee, thankful for Thy mercies, humble
   under Thy corrections, devout in Thy service, and sorrowful for our
   sins. Grant that in all things we may behave ourselves so as befits a
   creature to his Creator, a servant to his Lord. Make us diligent in all
   our duties, watchful against all temptations, pure and temperate and
   moderate in Thy most lawful enjoyments, that they may never become a
   snare to us. Help us, O Lord, to act towards our neighbour that we may
   never transgress the royal law of Thine, of loving him as ourselves.
   Finally, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to sanctify us throughout, that our
   whole spirit, soul, and body, may be preserved blameless unto the
   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; to whom with Thee and the Holy Ghost
   be all honour and glory for ever. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Consecration

   Almighty God, who hast made all things for man, and man for Thy glory,
   sanctify our body and soul, our thoughts and our intentions, our words
   and actions, that whatsoever we shall think, or speak or do, may by us
   be designed to the glorification of Thy name, and by Thy blessing, it
   may be effectual and successful in the work of God, according as it can
   be capable. Lord, turn necessities into virtues, the works of Nature
   into the works of grace, by making them orderly, regular and temperate,
   subordinate and profitable to ends beyond their own proper efficacy;
   and let no pride or self-seeking, no impure motive, or unworthy
   purpose, no little ends, and low imagination stain our spirit, and
   unhallow any of our words and actions. But let our body be a servant to
   our spirit, and both body and spirit servants of Jesus Christ, that
   doing all things for Thy glory here, we may be partakers of Thy glory
   hereafter; through Jesus Christ. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Friends

   Almighty, everlasting God, have mercy on Thy servants our friends. Keep
   them continually under Thy protection, and direct them according to Thy
   gracious favour in the way of everlasting salvation; that they may
   desire such things as please Thee, and with all their strength perform
   the same. And forasmuch as they trust in Thy mercy, vouchsafe, O Lord,
   graciously to assist them with Thy heavenly help, that they may ever
   diligently serve Thee, and by no temptations be separated from Thee;
   through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. --Thomas à Kempis
     __________________________________________________________________

  For Thy Spirit


   The prayers I make will then be sweet indeed,

   If Thou the spirit give by which I pray;

   My unassisted heart is barren clay,

   That of its native self can nothing feed;

   Of good and pious works Thou art the seed

   That quickens only where Thou say'st it may.

   Unless Thou show to us Thy own true way,

   No man can find it! Father! Thou must lead;

   Do Thou then breathe those thoughts into my mind

   By which such virtue may in me be bred

   That in Thy holy footsteps I may tread;

   The fetters of my tongue do Thou unbind,

   That I may have the power to sing to Thee,

   And sound Thy praises everlastingly! Amen.

   --Michelangelo
