PREFACE

   The only considerable and competent work that has ever been done, so
   far as I am aware, upon the subject dealt with in the following pages,
   is contained in some papers which appeared in the Wesleyan Methodist
   Magazine more than forty years ago, by the late Rev. John Wesley
   Thomas, the distinguished translator of Dante, and in some
   contributions to the Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society in
   recent years by the late Mr. Charles Lawrence Ford, B.A. I have
   consulted these, but it is only fair to myself to say that more than
   nine-tenths of the references given in the book are the result of my
   own reading.

   About a fourth of the matter contained in this volume has appeared in
   the pages of the Wesleyan Methodist Magazine, the Methodist Recorder,
   and the Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society. I make grateful
   acknowledgements to the Editors of these publications.

THE METHODIST HYMNS AND ENGLISH LITERATURE

  Literary Recognition

   It was remarked by Archbishop Trench that the greatest hymn of the
   Middle Ages owes much of its modern recognition to the use that Goethe
   made of it in Faust. It was this circumstance which helped to bring it
   to the knowledge of some who would not otherwise have known it; or if
   they had, would not have believed its worth, but that the sage and seer
   of this world had thus stood sponsor to it, and set his seal of
   recognition upon it.' [1] It would appear that the literary world is
   waiting for some such warranty before it realizes that in the early
   hymns of Methodism we possess a unique literature of devotion. The rare
   quality, literary and spiritual, of the hymns of the Wesleys has passed
   almost unrecognized for more than a hundred and fifty years, except
   among Methodists. There is a perverse tradition among men of letters
   that Methodism has no literature. Leslie Stephen contrasted the
   literary result of the Oxford Movement and of the Evangelical Revival,
   and deplored, in the latter, the absence of any literature possessing
   more than a purely historical interest.' [2] This is one of the most
   amazing judgements to which a critic ever committed himself. It is
   surely beyond question, for those who know both books, that John
   Wesley's Journal is in its way as absolutely literature as Newman's
   Apologia, and what a gulf there is between the pale, ecclesiastical
   verse of Keble and the lyrical raptures of Charles Wesley!

   The mere fact is that the hymns of Methodism constitute the finest body
   of devotional verse in the language, and that the very best of them
   belong to the exalted region of the Dies irae, dies illa of Thomas of
   Celano, and the Jesu dulcis memoria of St. Bernard.

   The extraordinary fecundity of Charles Wesley as a writer of religious
   verse has certainly obscured our sense of the literary value of what he
   wrote. No poet can maintain the highest level throughout a dozen
   volumes. In the thousands of hymns he wrote there are inevitably many
   that are mere versification of evangelical commonplace. But the general
   quality of the style is remarkably high, and scattered through this
   mass of work there are many scores of hymns, at the least, that are of
   the very highest order. The best work of Charles Wesley abides for the
   universal Church in the Collection of Hymns for the Use of the People
   called Methodists of 1780--an anthology, selected mainly from the vast
   mass of his brother's work by John Wesley--of which so unprejudiced a
   critic as Dr. Martineau declared that it was after the Scriptures, the
   grandest instrument of popular religious culture that Christendom has
   ever produced.' [3]

  Early Methodism and Literature

   The writings of the early Methodists mark an epoch in English
   literature. The early eighteenth century was a period when almost every
   writer was chilled into conventionality by a false classicism. Addison
   represented the perfection of English prose. And, as De Quincey once
   declared, in a very discerning paragraph, Addison, in particular,
   shrank from every bold and every profound expression as from an offence
   against good taste. He dared not for his life have used the word
   "passion" except in the vulgar sense of an angry paroxysm. He durst as
   soon have danced a hornpipe on the top of the Monument as have talked
   of "rapturous emotion." What would he have said? Why, "sentiments that
   were of a nature to prove agreeable after an unusual rate."' [4] The
   writings of the early Methodists marked the first return to simplicity
   and sincerity in prose. It was Edward FitzGerald who was the first to
   point this out, with characteristic insight and independence of
   judgement. Another book I have had is Wesley's Journal,' he wrote to
   Professor Cowell. If you don't know it, do know it; it is curious to
   think of this Diary of his running almost coevally with Walpole's
   Letter-Diary, the two men born and dying too within a few years of one
   another, and with such different lives to record. And it is remarkable
   to read pure, unaffected, and undying English, while Addison and
   Johnson are tainted with a style which all the world imitated!'

  The Methodist Hymns a Lyrical Prelude

   And as in the prose, so in the poetry of the age. Appearing at the very
   time when English poetry was most stilted and sterile, the hymns of
   Methodism became the prelude of a lyrical revival. Wordsworth remarked
   that, with one or two negligible exceptions, the poetry of the period
   intervening between the publication of Paradise Lost and The Seasons
   does not contain a single new image of external nature, and scarcely
   presents a familiar one from which it can be inferred that the eye of
   the poet had been steadily fixed upon his object, much less that his
   feelings had urged him to work upon it in the spirit of genuine
   imagination.' [5] It would be equally true to say that for a similar
   period, beginning and ending a little later, say, from the death of
   Henry Vaughan to the youth of Robert Burns, the lyrical note was never
   heard in these lands. Poetry had ceased to be simple, sensuous, and
   passionate.' Fire and fervor, the sense of wonder, the arresting note
   of reality, had all gone. Lyrical sincerity and spontaneity reappear
   first of all in the hymns of Methodism. We hear again the authentic
   note of passion, and it betokens much for English poetry in the days to
   come. A single example will serve where scores might be adduced. Think
   of the verve, the imaginative boldness, the ecstatic fervor of stanzas
   like these in an age when English verse was dominated by the influence
   of Pope--the lines were published in 1749:


   I cannot see Thy face, and live,

   Then let me see Thy face, and die!

   Now, Lord, my gasping spirit receive;

   Give me on eagle's wings to fly,

   With eagle's eyes on Thee to gaze,

   And plunge into the glorious blaze!


   The fullness of my great reward

   A blest eternity shall be,

   But hast Thou not on earth prepared

   Some better thing than this for me?

   What, but one drop! one transient sight!

   I want a sup, a sea of light.

THE SOURCE AND DATE OF THE EARLIEST METHODIST HYMNS

  John Wesley's Earliest Translations

   The earliest of the hymns of Methodism were written during John
   Wesley's residence in America. One of the most interesting passages in
   the first volume of the Standard Edition of Wesley's Journal is that in
   which we are given a page from Wesley's Diary for 1736, containing the
   text of four of his hymns. Hitherto the only knowledge we have had as
   to any hymn written in that year has been the reference in the Plain
   Account of Christian Perfection, where Wesley wrote We embarked for
   America in the latter end of 1735. It was the next year, while I was at
   Savannah, that I wrote the following lines:


   Is there a thing beneath the sun

   That strives with Thee my heart to share?

   Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone,

   The Lord of every motion there!'

   It was in 1736, therefore, that he made his great version of
   Tersteegen's Verborgne Gottes Liebe du, [1]Thou hidden love of God,
   whose height,' which Emerson declared to be the greatest hymn in the
   language. Now we have to add the four hymns from the Diary for that
   year. We do not know the date of the writing,' remarks Mr. Curnock, but
   it must have been some weeks earlier than December, 1736.' These five
   hymns are the earliest of the hymns of Methodism: they are all
   translations from the German, they are all the work of John Wesley, and
   they all date from the first year of his sojourn in Georgia. Not only
   are these the first hymns of which we have any knowledge, but it is
   almost certain that they are the very first that John Wesley ever
   wrote. He began to learn German at the beginning of the voyage, on
   October 17, 1735, and the Diary for 1736 has many entries such as
   German,' verses,' translated German,' made verses.' These entries,
   which show that he was working at German hymns, begin in May, 1736, and
   these hymns date from the next few months. The hymns in the Diary
   (except the first) have numbers attached--a valuable detail--and three
   of the four were previously known to be translations from
   Freylinghausen, Richter, and Zinzendorf. The fourth had never been
   published before, and there was some doubt as to whether it was a
   translation or an original hymn of Wesley's, until the present writer
   discovered, in searching through Knapp's Evangelischer Liederschatz,
   that it was a version of Paul Gerhardt's Ich singe dir mit Herz und
   Mund. The first lines of these hymns and the numbers, as given in the
   Diary, are as follows:

       [2]O Jesu, Source of calm repose.'
   124 My soul before Thee prostrate lies.'
   215 Jesu, to Thee my heart I bow.'
   306 To Thee with heart and mouth I sing.'

   Mr. Curnock suggested in a note that these numbers prefixed to the
   hymns might possibly give a clue to the original source whence they
   were drawn before translation.'

  The German Source

   Some time ago, the writer became the happy possessor of a copy of the
   1737 edition of Das Gesang-Buch der Gemeine in Herrn-Huth--the hymnal
   of the Moravians at Herrnhut. This, except for a few corrections and an
   appendix, is an exact reprint of the first edition of 1735. On looking
   for the originals of the hymns in the Diary, it appeared that the
   numbers were the numbers of the pages in this book. On p. 724 (the
   printed number, 124, is a very natural mistake, due to Wesley's faded
   writing) is Hier legt mein Sinn sich vor dir nieder, on p. 215 Reiner
   Bräut'gam meiner Seele, and on p. 306 Ich singe dir mit Herz und Mund.

   There are no tunes in the Herrnhut Gesangbuch, but the names of
   familiar chorales are put at the head of some of the hymns, and at the
   beginning of the book there is a table in which the hymns are grouped
   according to metre, some of the sections having an asterisked number at
   their head. This number, as the preface explains, refers to the page of
   the Halle Gesangbuch where a suitable melody may be found. What is
   meant by the Halle Gesangbuch is evidently Freylinghausen's hymnal, the
   accepted collection of the Pietists, whose head quarters were at Halle.
   In the Library of Richmond College are Wesley's copies of the Herrnhut
   Gesangbuch and of Freylinghausen's Gesangbuch. We now know that Wesley
   had both books in his possession in Georgia in 1736, or, at any rate,
   had access to them there, for under the date, Sunday, November 21, in
   that year, there is an entry in his Diary: Freylinghausen's Gesangbuch
   with Delamotte,' and the numbered hymns in the Diary prove that he used
   the Herrnhut Gesangbuch then. Most of those who were aware that Wesley
   possessed both books seem to have thought that these were merely two
   different hymnals, without any special relation, and it has been
   suggested that he drew upon each of them for his translations. But the
   unquestionable fact is that his copy of Freylinghausen's Gesangbuch was
   Wesley's tune-book: it was simply the musical companion of the Herrnhut
   hymnal. There remains no possible doubt about this. All the
   thirty-three hymns that Wesley translated are found in the Herrnhut
   Gesangbuch, many of them are found nowhere else, and--as we have
   seen--where he attached a number it was that of the page in this book,
   despite the fact that two of the three numbered hymns are found in
   Freylinghausen also. It is plain that he did not use Freylinghausen for
   the hymns which the book contained, but merely for the tunes.

   Seven of the hymns that Wesley translated are by Zinzendorf; four by
   Gerhardt; four by Scheffler; two by Tersteegen; two by Freylinghausen;
   two by C. F. Richter; one each by Ernst Lange, Joachim Lange, W. C.
   Dessler, J. J. Winckler, J. A. Rothe, Anna Dober, Maria Böhmer,
   Gottfried Arnold, Sigismund Gmelin, L. A. Gotter, and A. G.
   Spangenberg; and one is a cento from four hymns by Zinzendorf, Johann
   Nitschmann, and Anna Nitschmann. [6]

  Pietists and Moravians

   It should be noted that the bulk of these writers are Pietists and
   Moravians. Freylinghausen (1670-1739) was the son-in-law and successor
   of A. H. Francke, the founder of the Orphan House at Halle. C. F.
   Richter (1676-1711) was the physician of the Orphan House. Joachim
   Lange (1670-1744) was Professor of Divinity at Halle. J. J. Winckler
   (1670-1722) was a Pietist clergyman. Gottfried Arnold (1666-1714), a
   distinguished ecclesiastical historian, was a disciple of Spener, the
   founder of Pietism. Ludwig Andreas Gotter (1661-1735), who was Hofrat
   at Gotha, had relations with Pietism. Sigismund Christian Gmelin
   (1679-1707) was a Separatist who had a variegated career, but was in
   touch with Pietists all his life. Maria Magdalena Böhmer (167?-1743)
   was a Pietist who contributed three hymns to Freylinghausen's
   collection.

   Then, in addition to Zinzendorf, there are three other Moravians whose
   hymns Wesley translated. J. A. Rothe (1688-1758) was appointed by the
   Count to the pastorate of Berthelsdorf, the parish in which Herrnhut
   was situated, Anna Dober (1713-39) (nèe Schindler) was the wife of
   Leonhard J. Dober, one of the bishops of the Brethren, and A. G.
   Spangenberg (1704-1792), who had been Assistant Professor of Divinity
   at Halle, was the most learned and lovable of the Moravians, and became
   also one of their bishops.

   Thus, excepting the classical hymns of Gerhardt (1607-1676), Scheffler
   (1624-1677), and Tersteegen (1697-1769), practically all the rest of
   the hymns that Wesley translated were the product of the two great and
   closely related spiritual movements that had their head quarters at
   Halle and at Herrnhut.

   The translations from the German were all published between 1737 and
   1742. They were probably all written by 1739.

  John Wesley and the German Language

   Apparently Wesley disused German after his breach with the Moravians in
   1740. In November, 1745, when many German troops were encamped on the
   Town Moor at Newcastle-on-Tyne, in consequence of the Rebellion, he
   wrote in his Journal: I observed many Germans standing disconsolate at
   the skirts of the congregation. To these I was constrained (though I
   had discontinued it so long) to speak a few words in their own
   language. Immediately they gathered up close together, and drank in
   every word.' This, of course, refers to disuse of the spoken language,
   but it is significant that no German books are mentioned in the Journal
   after the earliest period, while French books are often referred to.
   Yet, on the other hand, he read Bengel's Erklärte Offenbarung Johannis
   as late as 1754, for use in his Notes on the New Testament. It is
   probable, however, that this was merely a case of furbishing up his
   German to read a book of which he was in special need. In his knowledge
   of German, as in so much else, Wesley was a pioneer. It was not until
   the end of the eighteenth century, at the time when the fame of Goethe
   and Schiller was filtering through into England, that Englishmen began
   to regard German as a language worth learning. It would be possible to
   count on the fingers of one hand the distinguished Englishmen who knew
   German in 1740.

  Translated Hymns

   John Wesley's versions of German hymns are amongst the very finest
   examples of translated verse in the language. They stand the supreme
   test of a translator's art, for they are as vigorous and as poetical as
   the originals. They read as if they had been written in English. His
   own standard of translation varied. Sometimes his version is as literal
   as it could be, to retain freedom of poetical movement, as, for
   example, in the stanza:


   O Love, Thou bottomless abyss!

   My sins are swallowed up in Thee.

   Covered is my unrighteousness,

   Nor spot of guilt remains on me,

   While Jesu's blood, through earth and skies

   Mercy, free, boundless mercy, cries!

   which renders the German verse:


   O Abgrund, weicher alle Sünden

   Durch Christi Tod verschlungen hat!

   Das heisst die Wunde recht verbinden,

   Da findet kein Verdammen statt,

   Weil Christi Blut beständig schreit,

   Barmherzigkeit! Barmherzigkeit!

   In other hymns, again, the English does little more than express the
   central thought of the German, as in the lines:


   Through Thy rich grace, in Jesu's blood

   Blessing, redemption, life we find.

   Our souls washed in this cleansing flood,

   No stain of guilt remains behind.

   Who can Thy mercy's stores express?

   Unfathomable, numberless!

   which are a version of the German stanza:


   Du segnest uns in ihm, dem Herm,

   Mit überschwenglich reichem Segen,

   Und gehest unser Armut gern

   Mit deiner theurern Gnad' entgegen,

   Was sind wir doch, du allerschönstes Gut,

   Dass deine Lieb' so Grosses an uns thut?

   John Wesley learned some Spanish while in Georgia, in order to minister
   to a few Spanish Jews who were in the colony. He translated one Spanish
   hymn, O God, my God, my all Thou art!'--a fine version of Psalm 68. The
   Spanish source has never been traced.

  Charles Wesley's Earliest Hymns

   The earliest of Charles Wesley's hymns appear to have been those
   entitled A Hymn for Midnight' (While midnight shades the earth
   o'erspread'), Written in the Beginning of a Recovery from Sickness'
   (Peace, fluttering soul! the storm is o'er'), and After a Recovery from
   Sickness' (And live I yet by power divine?'). The first of these
   probably dates from the early months of 1738; the others were certainly
   written during that period. But the real beginning of Charles Wesley's
   work as the poet of Methodism came with the wonderful experience of May
   21, 1738. Immediately thereafter he wrote three hymns which have a new
   accent. [3]Where shall my wondering soul begin?' is almost certainly
   the hymn referred to in the entry in his Journal for May 24, Toward ten
   my brother was brought in triumph by a troop of our friends, and
   declared, "I believe!" We sang the hymn with great joy.' And can it be
   that I should gain' is colored throughout by reminiscences of a passage
   in Luther's Galatians that be had read on May 17. What morn on thee
   with sweeter ray' is entitled Congratulations to a Friend on believing
   in Christ,' and was unquestionably addressed to his brother at this
   time.

   These hymns, the firstfruits of Charles Wesley's genius, were all first
   published in the Hymns and Sacred Poems of 1739. From that year onward
   his hymns appeared in a stream of publications that only ceased in
   1785--three years before his death.

CHAPTER I
THE SCRIPTURES

   apo blefouV ta iera grammata oidaV

  Many Allusions to Scripture

   In the year 1729,' wrote John Wesley, I began not only to read but to
   study the Bible.' The results of that devoted study of the Word of God
   are to be seen in every page that he wrote. Both the brothers must have
   had a most profound, exact, and extensive acquaintance with the
   Scriptures. Indeed, it is only a close study of the Bible on our own
   part that can reveal to us the extent of their intimacy with it. There
   can hardly be a single paragraph anywhere in the Scriptures that is not
   somewhere reflected in the writings of the Wesleys. The hymns, in many
   cases, are a mere mosaic of biblical allusions. Here is a stanza--and
   many others would have served equally well--where there is a distinct
   quotation of Scripture in every line:


   Behold the servant of the Lord!

   I wait Thy guiding eye to feel,

   To hear and keep Thy every word,

   To prove and do Thy perfect will;

   Joyful from my own works to cease,

   Glad to fulfil all righteousness.

   These six lines recall the following six passages in the Authorized
   Version:

   And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord' (Luke 1:38).

   I will guide thee with Mine eye' (Ps. 32:8).

   If a man love Me he will keep My words' (John 14:23).

   That ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of
   God' (Rom. 12:2).

   For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own
   works, as God did from His' (Heb. 4:10).

   For thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness' (Matt. 3:15).

  The Prayer-Book Psalter

   But the most interesting points with regard to the Wesleys and the
   Authorized Version are naturally their many divergencies from it. They
   often used, and sometimes deliberately preferred to use, the older
   version of the Psalms (substantially Coverdale's) which is retained in
   the Book of Common Prayer. As devout Churchmen they had been familiar
   with this from childhood, and in many cases their use of it was
   doubtless merely casual. But there are other instances in which they
   remembered both versions, and combined or contrasted them.

   Much of Charles Wesley's language and thought was colored by renderings
   in this version. Thus the words of Ps. 27:16 O tarry thou the Lord's
   leisure,' are recalled in many of his verses:


   Fainting soul, be bold, be strong,

   Wait the leisure of thy Lord;

   Though it seem to tarry long,

   True and faithful is His word.

   And the language of Ps. 45:4, Gird Thee with Thy sword upon Thy thigh,
   O Thou most Mighty, according to Thy worship and renown,' is closely
   paraphrased in another hymn:


   Gird on Thy thigh the Spirit's sword,

   And take to Thee Thy power divine;

   Stir up Thy strength, Almighty Lord,

   All power and majesty are Thine;

   Assert Thy worship and renown;

   O all-redeeming God, come down!

   In a poetical paraphrase of Ps. 84, both versions of the eleventh verse
   are utilized, For the Lord God is a light and a defence' (P.B.V.), For
   the Lord God is a sun and shield' (A.V.):


   God is a sun and shield,

   A light and a defence,

   With gifts His hands are filled,

   We draw our blessings thence.

   The earlier version of Ps. 99:1, The Lord is King, be the people never
   so impatient,' is remembered in the opening verse of a hymn--


   The Lord is King, and earth submits,

   Howe'er impatient, to His sway,

   Between the cherubim He sits,

   And makes His restless foes obey.

   So a clause from Ps. 139:23, Try me, O God, and seek the ground of my
   heart,' is remembered in another hymn--


   Try us, O God, and search the ground

   Of every sinful heart!

   Whate'er of sin in us is found,

   O bid it all depart!

   Many other examples might be quoted. There is one, however, of unusual
   interest. In Ps. 74:12, where the Authorized Version with the Hebrew,
   Septuagint, and Vulgate, has For God is my King of old, working
   salvation in the midst of the earth,' the Prayer-Book Version renders
   For God is my King of old; the help that is done upon earth, He doeth
   it Himself.' This is following Luther, der alle Hilfe thut, so auf Er
   den geschieht,' and the Zurich Bible, du der alles heyl und hilff (das
   in der gantzen welt geschieht) allein thust.'

   It is reproduced in one of the hymns:


   A feeble thing of nought,

   With lowly shame I own

   The help that upon earth is wrought

   Thou dost it all alone.

   John Wesley emphatically preferred this rendering. He wrote in his
   Journal, under the date October 14, 1785, I preached in the evening in
   the old Temple Church, on Ps. 74:12. In the old translation it runs,
   "The help that is done upon earth, God doeth it Himself." A glorious
   and important truth! In the new, "Working salvation in the midst of the
   earth." What a wonderful emendation! Many such emendations there are in
   this translation; one would think King James had made them himself.' In
   another passage in the Journal, a year and a half later, April 22,
   1787, he refers to the text and translation again: I opened and applied
   that glorious text, "The help that is done upon earth, He doeth it
   Himself." Is it not strange that this text, Ps. 74:12, is vanished out
   of the new translation of the Psalms?'

   Notwithstanding Wesley's uncritical scorn of the emendation,' it is the
   only correct rendering. He was very old, and very busy, or a glance at
   his Hebrew Bible would have shown him that the Authorized Version was
   unquestionably right.

  John Wesley's Revision of the New Testament

   In the Notes on the New Testament Wesley freely revised the Authorized
   Version. And it has never yet been sufficiently recognized that in this
   (as in so much else) he was wonderfully ahead of his age. Wesley's
   version, issued in 1754, was a marvellous anticipation of the Revised
   Version of a hundred and thirty years later. We have tested three
   chapters, chosen haphazard, and find that in these chapters Wesley
   introduced sixty-one changes into the text. Out of these sixty-one
   changes he anticipated the reading of the Revised Version in thirty-two
   cases. Moreover, it is nearly always in the more serious alterations
   that the Revisers agree with him. There must be in the whole New
   Testament, say, 3,000 changes in the text of the Authorized Version, in
   which Wesley anticipated the Revisers of 1881. And he anticipated them
   in the arrangement of the text into paragraphs.

  The Wesleys and the Greek Testament

   Behind all this there was, of course, an intimate knowledge of the
   Greek Testament. John Wesley was Greek Lecturer at Lincoln College, and
   that did not mean that he had to do with Hellenic studies (as some who
   have written about it have assumed), but that he lectured on the Greek
   Testament. One of the early Methodist preachers recorded that Wesley
   could always remember the Greek of a passage in the New Testament, even
   when he was at a loss for the exact language of the Authorized Version.
   And Charles Wesley, like his brother, had a devout scholar's knowledge
   of the New Testament in the original. [7]

   This intimacy with the Greek Testament appears in many delightful ways
   in their writings, as well as in the revised text given in the Notes on
   the New Testament. Naturally it is most easily discerned where the
   Authorized Version is defective. Many scores of examples might be
   quoted.

  Mistranslations in the Authorized Version

   There are a few absolute mistranslations in the Authorized Version. One
   of the worst is in Philip. 2:7, where made Himself of no reputation'
   represents the Greek eauton ekenwte emptied Himself.' The translators
   of 1611 were apparently afraid of the Apostle's bold and simple word.
   Wesley removed the futile circumlocution of the Authorized Version and
   gave the only possible rendering, as the Revised Version did later.
   Wherever the passage is referred to in the hymns, the proper equivalent
   of the Greek is given--


   He left His Father's throne above,

   So free, so infinite His grace!

   Emptied Himself of all but love,

   And bled for Adam's helpless race.


   To Thee, who from the eternal throne,

   Cam'st emptied of Thy glory down,

   For us to groan, to bleed, to die!

   There is another passage in Philippians where the translation,
   inadequate to begin with, became still more unsatisfactory through the
   change in meaning of an English word. The Authorized Version of Philip.
   3:20 is For our conversation is in heaven.' The Greek is politeuma,
   citizenship,' and the Revised Version reads accordingly, For our
   citizenship is in heaven.' The poet evidently had the original in mind
   when he wrote--


   To me the victor's title give

   Among Thy glorious saints to live.

   And all their happiness to know,

   A citizen of heaven below.

  The Greek Article

   Again, one of the striking defects of the Authorized Version is its
   strange indifference as to the presence or absence of the Greek article
   -- a characteristic largely due to the influence of the Vulgate. The
   Authorized Version of 2 Tim. 4:7 is, I have fought a good fight,' but
   the Textus Receptus is, ton agwna ton kalon the good fight.' So Wesley
   rendered it in the Notes, and the force of the article is remembered in
   more than one hymn--


   I the good fight have fought,

   O when shall I declare?

   The victory by my Savior got

   I long with Paul to share.

   There is only one good fight'--what the Apostle calls elsewhere the
   good fight of faith.'

   The very next verse, of Scripture furnishes another example of the same
   thing. The Authorized Version translates Henceforth there is laid up
   for me a crown of righteousness.' But the Greek is o ths dikaiosunhV
   stefanoV the crown of righteousness.' So Wesley renders it in the
   Notes. And so constantly in the hymns:


   The glorious crown of righteousness

   To me reached out I view,

   Conqueror through Him, I soon shall seize

   And wear it as my due.

  Different Words in the Original

   Again the Authorized Version frequently ignores that important canon of
   translation which ordains that different words in the original shall be
   rendered by different words in the version. It is well known that there
   are two words in the Greek Testament, both of which the Authorized
   Version renders crown,' diadhma and stefanoV. The former is the kingly
   ornament, the royal crown. The word only occurs thrice, in the whole of
   the New Testament, and all the three instances are in the
   Apocalypse--the seven diadems' of the dragon (Rev. 12:3), the ten
   diadems' of the beast (Rev. 13:1), and the many diadems' of Christ
   (Rev. 19:12). In each case Wesley, in the Notes, retained the original
   word, as the Revisers did in 1881. One of the hymns, too, remembers the
   word--


   And who in Christ are found,

   They His diadem shall wear,

   With life and glory crowned.

   The other word, stefanoV, is much more frequent, and it is poorly
   represented by the English crown,' since it never means the badge of
   royalty, as the English word generally does. The significance of the
   word has been beautifully defined by Archbishop Trench, in his Synonyms
   of the New Testament. It is the crown of victory in the games, of civic
   worth, of military valor, of nuptial joy, of festal gladness--woven of
   oak, of ivy, of parsley, of myrtle, of olive--or imitating in gold
   these leaves or others--of flowers, as of violets or roses, the
   "wreath," in fact, or the "garland," the German "Kranz" as
   distinguished from "Krone."' This is the word consistently used in the
   New Testament of the rewards of the faithful; the stefanoV of life, of
   glory, of righteousness. It is this which is used in Rev. 2:10, Be thou
   faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life,' ton
   stefanoV thV zohV. The passage is quoted in many of the hymns, and the
   proper significance of the word is brought out in nearly every case.


   Be faithful unto death,

   Partake My victory,

   And thou shalt wear this glorious wreath,

   And thou shalt reign with Me.

   And so in references to 2 Tim. 4:8--


   The glorious wreath which now I see

   The Lord, the righteous Judge, on me

   Shall at that day bestow.

   In John 13:10 the Authorized Version is, He that is washed needeth not
   save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit.' This fails to
   distinguish between the two Greek verbs upon which the whole meaning of
   the passage turns, and which should be rendered as in the Revised
   Version, He that is bathed (o leloumenoV) needeth not save to wash
   (niyasqai) his feet.' The point is remembered in a hymn--


   If bathed in Thine atoning blood,

   Am I not every whit made clean?

   My care is now to wash my feet,

   And if I humbly walk with Thee,

   Sin I need never more repeat,

   Or lose my faith and purity.

   There is a remarkable example of this in regard to Heb. 4:9, There
   remaineth, therefore, a rest to the people of God' (A.V.). The word
   here translated rest,' sabbatismoV, is one which means a keeping of the
   Sabbath,' and it stands in deliberate contrast to the ordinary word
   rest,' katapausiV, which occurs eight times in the immediate context.
   The only satisfactory translation, of course, is one which marks the
   difference, like that of the Revised Version, A promise being left of
   entering into His rest . . . For we which have believed do enter into
   rest . . . As I sware in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest .
   . . There remaineth therefore a sabbath-rest for the people of God.'
   Now recall the lines:


   Lord, I believe a rest remains

   To all Thy people known,

   A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,

   And Thou art loved alone.


   O that I now the rest might know,

   Believe, and enter in!

   Now, Savior, now the power bestow,

   And let me cease from sin.


   Remove this hardness from my heart,

   This unbelief remove;

   To me the rest of faith impart,

   The sabbath of Thy love!

   In 1 Peter 5:7 two different Greek words are used where the Authorized
   Version would suggest the same word: Casting all your care (merimnan)
   upon Him, for He careth (melei) for you.' The first word should, of
   course, be rendered anxiety,' or trouble.' The point is remembered in a
   hymn based upon the passage--


   O Lover of sinners, on Thee

   My burden of trouble I cast,

   Whose care and compassion for me

   For ever and ever shall last.

  Vivid or Unusual Words

   Again, the Authorized Version did not always do justice to the vivid or
   unusual character of a word in the text. It rendered Philip. 4:7, The
   peace of God shall keep your hearts.' The Revised Version guard' is
   much better, but the Apostle's word, frourhsei, means to keep with a
   military guard.' It is the same word that he uses in 2 Cor. 11:32. In
   Damascus the Governor under Aretas the King kept-with-a-garrison
   (efrourei) the city of the Damascenes, desirous to apprehend me.'
   Wesley remembered this in dealing with Philip. 4:7 in the Notes. His
   comment is Shall guard, as a garrison does a city.' Again the point was
   recollected in a hymn--


   My strength, the joy Thy smiles impart,

   Thy peace doth garrison my heart.

   The Authorized Version of Matt. 28:9 is, Go ye therefore, and teach all
   nations,' but the word does not here represent the usual Greek verb
   (which occurs in the next sentence, teaching (didaskonteV) them to
   observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you'), but maqheusate
   make-ye-disciples-of.' This is remembered in a hymn At the Baptism of
   Adults'--


   We now Thy promised presence claim

   Sent to disciple all mankind,

   Sent to baptize into Thy name,

   We now Thy promised presence find.

   The Authorized Version of a phrase in Col. 1:13 is His dear Son,' but
   the Greek is literally translated by the Revised Version, the Son of
   His love.' [8] John Wesley was clearly thinking of the exact language
   of the Apostle when he wrote--


   Son of Thy Sire's Eternal Love,

   Take to Thyself Thy mighty power,

   Let all earth's sons Thy mercy prove,

   Let all Thy bleeding grace adore!

   It is well known that the word in John 14:18, rendered comfortless' in
   the Authorized Version, and desolate' in the Revised Version, is
   orfanouV, literally, orphans. This is remembered in a hymn for
   Whit-Sunday--


   . . . Orphans we

   Awhile Thine absence mourn,

   But we Thy face again shall see,

   But Thou wilt soon return.

   The Authorized Version renders John 16:33, But be of good cheer, I have
   overcome the world,' and the Revised Version retains the reading. But
   the exact and vivid sense of alla qarseute, But take-courage!' is
   conveyed in the line--


   Courage! your Captain cries,

   Who all your toil foreknew;

   Toil ye shall have, yet all despise,

   I have o'ercome for you.

   In the lines--


   The pure in heart obtain the grace

   To see without a veil His face,

   there are two references to Scripture, the first to Matt. 5:8, the
   second to 2 Cor. 3:18, where the Authorized Version translates With
   open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord.' The Greek is,
   however, anakekalummenw proswpw with unveiled face.' So it is rendered
   by the Revisers, and by Wesley in the Notes on the New Testament.

   Obviously the proper sense of anakekalummenoV was in the mind of the
   writer of the line To see without a veil His face.' The rendering is
   specially important, because the Apostle was referring to his own words
   throughout the previous paragraph about the veil (kalumma) of Moses.
   There is a subtle illustration of the intimate knowledge of the Greek
   Testament possessed by the Wesleys in the lines--


   Jesus, confirm my heart's desire,

   To work and speak and think for Thee,

   Still let me guard the holy fire,

   And still stir up Thy gift in me.

  A Suggestive Word

   The hymn is based upon Lev. 6:13, Fire shall be kept burning upon the
   altar continually: it shall not go out.' The text is prefaced to the
   hymn in the Short Hymns on Select Passages of the Holy Scriptures. This
   thought of a perpetual flame pervades the verses, and it was this which
   suggested the quotation of Paul's words to Timothy, Wherefore I put
   thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in
   thee.' There is no apparent connection to the English reader, but there
   is to a student of the Greek Testament. For the word rendered stir up,'
   anazwpurein--it only occurs this once in the whole of the New
   Testament--is a word that means (as is apparent in the very structure
   of it) to stir up a fire, to rekindle.' Literally, blowing up the coals
   into a flame,' as Wesley remarks in the Notes on the New Testament.
   Unquestionably, it was this remembrance of the original sense of
   anazwpurein which suggested the particular form of the lines--


   Still let me guard the holy fire,

   And still stir up Thy gift in me.

  Some Important Words

   The important word diaqhkh is always rendered covenant' by John Wesley
   in the Notes on the New Testament, despite the authority of Bengel, who
   prefers testamentum. Wesley was right, for, as Farrar has said, diaqhkh
   always means "covenant"--except that in Heb. 9:17 by a play upon words
   it has the meaning "will."' [9] So constantly in the hymns--


   Stablish with me the covenant new

   And write perfection on my heart!

   Then there is the obvious preference for new creation' rather than new
   creature' as a rendering of the Apostle's phrase kainh ktisiV in 2 Cor.
   5:17, and Gal. 6:18, which is evidenced by several hymns--


   My Soul's new creation, a life from the dead,

   The day of salvation, that lifts up my head,

   And there is the constant use of bears away' for the feebler (though
   legitimate) taketh away,' in allusions to John 1:29--


   Lamb of God, who bear'st away

   All the sins of all mankind!


   Behold the Lamb of God, who bears

   The sins of all the world away!

   Such are some of the cases in which the Wesleys anticipated later
   scholarship in the exact and sensitive rendering of important phrases
   of Scripture.

  The Very Words of the Apostles

   There are also several striking instances in which, while no question
   of accurate translation arises, the ipsissima verba of the New
   Testament writers are recalled. Such is the allusion in one of the
   hymns to Titus 3:4, the kindness of God our Savior, and His love toward
   man' (R.V.), where the latter phrase is a translation of one Greek
   word, filanqrwpia our word philanthropy. The original text of the
   passage is remembered in the lines--


   When that philanthropy divine

   Into a sinner's heart doth shine,

   It shows the wondrous plan,

   The wisdom in a mystery

   Employed by the great One and Three,

   To save His favorite, man.

   In Eph. 4:11,13--the whole armor of God'--the two words represent one
   Greek word, panoplia, which we have in English as panoply. The splendid
   word is remembered and used in the lines--


   Stand then in His great might,

   With all His strength endued;

   But take, to arm you for the fight,

   The panoply of God.

  The Wisdom of Solomon'

   One of the books of the Apocrypha--the finest of them all--has
   considerably influenced the hymns. There are numerous allusions in the
   verse of the Wesleys to the language of the Wisdom of Solomon. One of
   John Wesley's translations, the fine version of Scheffler's Du
   unvergleichlich Gut, combines two recollections of this book in two
   lines--


   High throned on heaven's eternal hill,

   In number, weight, and measure still,

   Thou sweetly orderest all that is;

   And yet Thou deign'st to come to me,

   And guide my steps, that I, with Thee

   Enthroned, may reign in endless bliss.

   This recalls both, But Thou hast ordered all things in number, and
   measure, and weight' (Wisdom 11:20), and Wisdom reacheth from one end
   to another, and mightily and sweetly doth she order all things (Wisdom
   8:1). Neither reference is in the German--


   Du bist die Weisheit selbst die ewiglich regieret,

   Der tiefeste Verstand, der alles glücklich führet.

   One of the most affecting titles given to our Lord in the hymns is from
   the same source. But Thou sparest all, for they are Thine, O Lord, Thou
   Lover of Souls' (Wisdom 11:26). This is used again and again:


   Jesu, Lover of my soul,

   Let me to Thy bosom fly,

   While the nearer waters roll,

   While the tempest still is high.


   Lover of Souls! Thou know'st to prize

   What Thou hast bought so dear;

   Come then, and in Thy people's eyes,

   With all Thy wounds appear!

   The fine rhapsody in Wisdom 3:1-4: But the souls of the righteous are
   in the hand of God. . . . For though they be punished in the sight of
   men, yet is their hope full of immortality,' is remembered in the
   verse--


   The promised land, from Pisgah's top,

   I now exult to see:

   My hope is full (O glorious hope!)

   Of immortality.

   And the noble passage in Wisdom 11:24, For Thou lovest all the things
   that are, and abhorrest nothing which Thou hast made, for never
   wouldest Thou have made anything if Thou hadst hated it,' is behind the
   stanza--


   O may I love like Thee!

   In all Thy footsteps tread!

   Thou hatest all iniquity,

   But nothing Thou hast made.

  Luther's Galatians'

   The first allusion to any book other than the Bible in the hymns of
   Charles Wesley is a reminiscence, often repeated, of Luther's
   [4]Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians--a reference rather to
   the Reformer's emphasis than to his language. There is a manuscript of
   1738 in the archives of the Brethren from the hand of William Holland,
   one of the earliest of the English Moravians, in which he writes: Being
   providentially directed to Martin Luther's Commentary on the Epistle to
   the Galatians, I carried it round to Mr. Charles Wesley, who was then
   sick at Mr. Bray's, as a very precious treasure that I had found.'
   Charles Wesley writes in his Journal, under the date Wednesday, May 17,
   1738: Today I first saw Luther on the Galatians, which Mr. Holland had
   accidentally lit upon. We began, and found him nobly full of faith.' On
   the evening of the same day he writes: I spent some hours this evening
   in private with Martin Luther, who was greatly blessed to me,
   especially his conclusion of the second chapter. I labored, waited, and
   prayed to feel "Who loved me and gave Himself for me."' Luther spends
   some beautiful pages over these words of the Apostle, words full of
   great and mighty comfort.' He writes: Therefore thou shouldest so read
   these little words me and for me, as to meditate well upon them, and
   deem that they have much in them. Use thyself to lay hold of this
   little word me with a sure faith, and apply it to thyself, and do not
   doubt that thou art of the number named in this little word me.'

   Three days after Charles Wesley had first read these words, on Sunday,
   May 21, he found the peace of God. Luther's loving insistence upon the
   Apostle's words is remembered and reflected in more than one hymn
   written at the time.


   O Filial Deity,

   Accept my new-born cry!

   See the travail of Thy soul,

   Savior, and be satisfied:

   Take me now, possess me whole,

   Who for me, for me hast died!


   And can it be that I should gain

   An interest in the Savior's blood?

   Died He for me, who caused His pain?

   For me, who Him to death pursued?

   Amazing love! how can it be

   That Thou, my God, should'st die for me?

   And throughout a hymn written exactly a year later, in May, 1739, and
   entitled For the Anniversary Day of one's Conversion':


   Then with my heart I first believed,

   Believed with faith divine;

   Power with the Holy Ghost received

   To call the Savior mine.

   I felt my Lord's atoning blood

   Close to my soul applied;

   Me, me, He loved--the Son of God--

   For me, for me, He died!

  Bengel's Exposition of the Apocalypse

   John Wesley's Notes on the New Testament were largely indebted to the
   Gnomon of Bengel--that great light of the Christian world (lately gone
   to his reward) Bengelius,' as he is called in the preface. It is a
   striking proof of Wesley's scholarship and shrewdness that he should
   have selected as the basis of his exposition a work which, in the
   language of Dr. Sanday, stands out among the exegetical literature not
   only of the eighteenth century, but of all centuries, for its masterly
   terseness and precision, and for its combination of spiritual insight
   with the best scholarship of the time.' In his notes on the Apocalypse
   Wesley used in addition to the Gnomon Bengel's German exposition of the
   book, the Erklärte Offenbarung Johannis, und vielmehr Jesu Christi, as
   it is quaintly entitled.

   On Rev. 2:17 Bengel has this beautiful note: A new name. So Jacob after
   his victory received the new name of Israel. The word new is very
   characteristic of the Revelation (ein recht apocalyptisches Wort): a
   new name, a new song, a new heaven, a new earth, new Jerusalem, all
   things new. Which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it. Jesus
   Himself had a new name, known only to Himself. Would'st thou know what
   the new name shall be? Overcome! Before that thou askest in vain:
   thereafter thou wilt soon read it, written on the white stone.' Charles
   Wesley assisted in compiling the Notes, and this comment, the last two
   sentences of which were translated by the elder brother, evidently
   impressed him; for eight years later, in the Short Hymns on Select
   Passages of the Holy Scriptures, he published a hymn which paraphrases
   Bengel's note:


   Dost thou desire to know and see

   What thy mysterious name shall be?

   Contending for thy heavenly home,

   Thy latest foe in death o'ercome;

   Till then thou searchest out in vain

   What only conquest can explain.


   But when the Lord hath closed thine eyes,

   And opened them in Paradise,

   Receiving thy new name unknown,

   Thou read'st it wrote on the white stone,

   Wrote on thy pure humanity,

   God, Three in One, and One in Three.

CHAPTER II
THE FATHERS, THE LITURGIES, AND THE MYSTICS

   upo PneumatoV Agion feromeuoi elalhsan oi agioi Qeou anqrwpoi

  Ignatius

   There are many allusions in the hymns to the writings of the Fathers of
   the Church. Samuel Wesley the elder, in a letter to a young clergyman
   containing detailed advice as to his studies--a letter which John
   Wesley published, with a preface, many years later--declared that the
   blessed Ignatius's Epistles can never be enough read, or praised, or
   valued, next to the inspired writings.' And John Wesley devoted thirty
   pages of the first volume of the Christian Library to the Epistles of
   Ignatius. It is not surprising, therefore, that there should be several
   echoes of a passage in his [5]Epistle to the Romans (7:2), Living I
   write unto you, but it is as loving to die. For my Love has been
   crucified (o emos eros estaurwtai) and there is left in me no fire of
   earthly love at all.' The famous phrase becomes the refrain of the
   hymn, O Love Divine, what hast thou done?'--


   The immortal God for me hath died:

   My Lord, my Love is crucified--

   and it is recalled in several other hymns. It had been previously used
   in an old German hymn which John Wesley is not likely to have seen, and
   it is quoted in one of the Spiritual Songs of John Mason, which was
   certainly known to both brothers:


   My Lord, my Love is crucified,

   He all the Pains did bear;

   But in the Sweetness of His Rest,

   He makes His Servants share.

  Tertullian

   Another hymn contains an echo of Tertullian--


   Though earth and hell the word gainsay

   The Word of God can never fail;

   The Lamb shall take my sins away;

   'Tis certain, though impossible;

   The thing impossible shall be,

   All things are possible to me.

   The passage is in Tertullian's treatise De Carne Christi. He is arguing
   against Marcion, whose contention was that the humiliation implied in
   the fact of the Incarnation was unworthy of God. Tertullian answers
   this in a passage splendidly paradoxical and profoundly spiritual:
   Spare the whole world's one only hope, thou who art destroying the
   indispensable dishonor of our faith. Whatever is unworthy of God is of
   gain to me. . . . The Son of God is born; we are not ashamed, because
   we ought to be ashamed. And the Son of God died; it is perfectly
   credible, because it is absurd. And being buried He rose again; it is
   certain, because it is impossible.' (Natus est Dei Filius; non pudet
   quia pudendum est; et mortuus est Dei Filius; prorsus credibile est
   quia ineptum est; et sepultus resurrexit; certum est quia impossibile.)
   The hymn, however, merely quotes the famous phrase that is known to all
   the world.

   A passage in Tertullian's Apology (c. 39), Look ye, say they, how these
   Christians seem to love one another!' is also recalled in a hymn which
   is probably by John Wesley--


   In them let all mankind behold

   How Christians lived in days of old

   Mighty their envious foes to move,

   A proverb of reproach--and love.

   Here it is hardly probable that this is a direct reference to the
   passage, for John Wesley wrote to his mother from Marienborn while on
   his journey to Herrnhut, quoting the words and attributing them to
   Julian the Apostate: Eighty-eight of them [the Moravians] praise God
   with one heart and one mouth at Marienborn; another little company at
   Runnesburg, an hour off; another at Budingen, an hour from thence; and
   yet another at Frankfort. I now understand those words of poor Julian,
   "See how these Christians love one another!"' The phrase is quoted as
   proverbial in the introduction to Arndt's True Christianity, and in at
   least one other of the works included in the Christian Library.

  The Christians to the Lions!'

   Another passage in the Apology is referred to in more than one hymn: If
   Tiber overflows, and Nile does not; if heaven stands still and
   withholds its rain, and the earth quakes; if famine or pestilence take
   their marches through the country, the word is, Away with these
   Christians to the lions!' (c. 40.)


   Away with them,' the world exclaim,

   The Christians to the lions cast!'

   The stream is troubled by the lamb,

   And must be so, while time shall last.


   The Lamb, they say, disturbs the stream,

   The world confounded is by them

   Who its confusions end:

   Yet still, Away with them,' they cry,

   The Christians burn or crucify,

   Or to the lions send!'

  Aesop

   It is curious that both these hymns which have the allusion to
   Tertullian's words should also contain a reference to one of Aesop's
   fables, the story of the wolf who complained that the stream of which
   he was drinking was disturbed by a lamb farther down--a mere pretext
   for devouring the alleged disturber.

  Jerome

   It has been suggested that the lines--


   To damp our earthly joys,

   To increase our gracious fears,

   For ever let the Archangel's voice

   Be sounding in our ears:

   The solemn midnight cry,

   Ye dead, the Judge is come.

   Arise, and meet Him in the sky,

   And meet your instant doom!

   --recall a passage of Jerome: Quoties diem ilium considero, toto
   corpore contremisco, sive enim comedo, sive bibo, sive aliquid aliud
   facio, semper videtur illa tuba terribilis sonare in auribus meis,
   Surgite, mortui, venite ad judicum.' (In xvii. Johannis.) Charles
   Wesley may very probably have met with the words, apart from any
   patristic reading, for they are quoted in the Latin in Burton's Anatomy
   of Melancholy, and in English by Chaucer in the Persones Tale: For as
   Seint Jerome sayth: at every time that me remembreth of the day of
   dome, I quake: for whan I ete or drinke, or do what so I do, ever
   semeth me that the trompe sowneth in min eres: riseth ye up that ben
   ded, and cometh to the jugement.'

   In John Austin's Offices (1668) (partly republished in the Christian
   Library) there is a hymn of which one verse runs--


   O quicken, Lord, our Faith,

   Of these great Joys and Fears;

   And make the last Day's Trumpet be

   Still sounding in our Ears.

   But Charles Wesley's stanza is more than an echo of this: it carries
   the allusion to Jerome's language farther than Austin's lines do, to
   Surgite, mortui, venite ad judicum.

  Eusebius

   The lines in one of the hymns on heaven--


   A brother dead to God,

   By sin alas! undone,

   --recall the famous story of St. John and the robber, told by Eusebius
   in the Ecclesiastical History (iii. 23)--a book which John Wesley
   records reading for the second time in November, 1741. Inquiring of a
   bishop in the neighborhood of Ephesus as to the welfare of a young man
   whom he had previously committed to the bishop's special charge, the
   Apostle received the answer, He is dead.' Being further questioned, the
   bishop said, He is dead to God, for alas! he is become a villain, and
   is fled to the mountains to be a robber.' Whereupon the Apostle
   hastened to the mountain fastnesses, and never rested until he had
   brought back the young man in penitence, and restored him to the
   Church. (It may be added that the story is told in Wesley's abridgement
   of Cave's Primitive Christianity in the Christian Library.)

  Augustine

   When we reach Augustine we are on surer ground. The Wesleys evidently
   knew the Confessions well. It was one of the highly interesting list of
   books which had to be provided (by the direction of an early
   Conference) for the use of Wesley and the preachers at the three
   centers of London, Bristol, and Newcastle. Wesley once prepared for the
   press an edition of it in the original Latin, probably intended for the
   scholars of Kingswood School.

   In 1745 Wesley maintained a long correspondence with Mr John
   Smith'--supposed to be the nom de guerre of Dr. Secker, Bishop of
   Oxford. In one of his letters Wesley quoted, as an instance of what he
   meant by his doctrine of assurance, a whole chapter of the Confessions,
   which,' he writes, I was reading yesterday.' It is the great passage
   which ends with the words, And Thou criedst to me from afar, Yea,
   verily, I am that I am. And I heard, as the heart heareth, nor had I
   room to doubt, and I should sooner doubt that I live, than that Truth
   is not' (vii. 10).

  Confessions'

   This great spiritual classic has left considerable traces in the hymns
   of both brothers. A passage in the first book recalls some of Charles
   Wesley's most impassioned lines. Augustine wrote: Hide not Thy face
   from me. Let me die (that I die not) that I may see Thy face!' (Moriar
   ne moriar, ut cam videam) (i. 5). There is a very similar passage in
   the Soliloquies: But why dost thou hide Thy face? Haply Thou wilt say,
   "No man can see Me and live." Ah, Lord, let me die, that I may see
   Thee; let me see Thee, that I may die.' (Sed cur faciem tuam abscondis?
   Forte dicis non videbit me homo et vivet' (Ex. 33:20). Eia, Domine,
   moriar ut te videam. Videam, ut hic moriar) (Solil. c. i.). This became
   a favorite thought with the poet of Methodism, and inspired many
   stanzas such as:


   I cannot see Thy face and live!

   Then let me see Thy face, and die!

   Now, Lord, my gasping spirit receive!

   Give me on eagles' wings to fly;

   With eagles' eyes on Thee to gaze,

   And plunge into the glorious blaze.

   And if there were any doubt about the connection between such lines as
   these and the words of the great African Father, it would be dispelled
   by the fact that another hymn which echoes the thought--


   Live only Christ in me, not I;

   O let me see Thy face, and die!

   --was headed, when published in the Hymns and Sacred Poems of 1742,
   Moriar ut te videam!' Let me die that I may see Thee! Here the phrase
   is evidently quoted from the Soliloquies.

   Another reminiscence of the Confessions occurs in John Wesley's
   translation of Tersteegen's great hymn, '[6]Thou hidden love of God,
   whose height.' The lines--


   My heart is pained, nor can it be

   At rest, till it finds rest in Thee--

   deliberately recall the famous passage: Thou dost arouse us to delight
   in praising Thee; for Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our heart is
   restless, until it find rest in Thee!' (i. 1). Here the allusion is
   John Wesley's own; there is nothing of it in Tersteegen's German, the
   last lines of which are--


   Ich bin nicht stille, wie ich soll

   Ich fühles ist dem Geist nicht wohl,

   Weil er in dir nicht stehet.

   There is a further reminiscence of Augustine in another of John
   Wesley's translations from the German. The lines--


   Ah! why did I so late Thee know,

   Thee, lovelier than the sons of men!

   --recall the classic passage: Too late I loved Thee, Beauty so old and
   yet so new, too late I loved Thee!' (x. 27). Here it is Scheffler
   himself who is responsible for the allusion to Augustine, for it is
   clearer in the German than in the English: Ach, dass ich dich so spät
   erkennet, Du hochgelobte Schönheit du!'

   A phrase in one verse of John Wesley's translation of Scheffler's Du
   unvergleichlich Gut has been colored by the translator's remembrance of
   the same passage in Augustine. Angelus wrote Du bist die Schönheit
   selbst, Du kannst nichts Schönres finden! Es kann dich nichts als nur
   Dein eigne Schönheit binden.' But die Schonheit selbst becomes in
   Wesley's translation, with a memory of Augustine's pulchritudo antiqua:


   Primeval Beauty! in Thy sight,

   The first-born, fairest sons of light

   See all their brightest glories fade!

   In the hymn For an Unconverted Child' the lines occur:


   Regard my endless griefs and fears

   Nor let the Son of all these tears

   Be finally undone.

  Monica and the Bishop

   This is an unmistakable allusion to the story told by Augustine in the
   Confessions (iii. 12) about his mother and the Bishop. Monica besought
   the Bishop to see her son, and strive to bring him from the error of
   his ways. The Bishop replied that it was best to leave him alone, and
   pray for him. When she would not be satisfied, but urged him more, with
   entreaties and many tears, that he would see me, and discourse with me;
   he, a little displeased at her importunity, saith, "Go thy ways, and
   God be with thee: it is not possible that the son of these tears should
   perish." Which answer she took (as she often mentioned in her
   conversations with me) as if it had been a voice from heaven.

   And there is at least one other of Augustine's wonderful phrases; in
   the Confessions that influenced the verse of Charles Wesley. It is a
   part of a great supplication: Narrow is the home of my soul; enlarge
   it, that Thou mayest enter in. It is ruinous; do Thou repair it, (i.
   5). This is reflected in the lines--


   Thou know'st the way to bring me back,

   My fallen spirit to restore

   O for Thy truth and mercy's sake,

   Forgive, and bid me sin no more;

   The ruins of my soul repair,

   And make my heart a house of prayer.

  Soliloquies'

   There are other passages in the Soliloquies which seem to have
   influenced the hymns. Aegrotus sum, ad medicum clamo: caecus sum, ad
   lucem propero: mortuus sum, ad vitam suspiro. Tu es medicus, tu lux, tu
   vita. Jesu Nazarene, miserere mei' (c. ii.). It is difficult to read
   this without thinking that some remembrance of it was in Charles
   Wesley's mind when he wrote--


   Jesu, my all in all Thou art;

   My rest in toil, my ease in pain,

   The medicine of my broken heart,

   In war my peace, in loss my gain,

   My smile beneath the tyrant's frown,

   In shame my glory and my crown:


   In want my plentiful supply,

   In weakness my almighty power,

   In bonds my perfect liberty,

   My light in Satan's darkest hour,

   In grid my joy unspeakable,

   My life in death, my heaven in hell.

   And here is another characteristic passage: Quoniam Si quid boni est
   parvum vel magnum, donum tuum est, et nostrum non est nisi malum' (c.
   xv.). The thought seems to be reproduced in the lines--


   All power is Thine in earth and heaven,

   All fullness dwells in Thee alone;

   Whate'er I have was freely given,

   Nothing but sin I call my own.

   And, once more, Augustine's words: Et video nunc quia donum tuum est'
   (c. xv.) seem to be reflected in John Wesley's translation of
   Scheffler's Ich will dich tiebe, meine Stärke (there is an unquestioned
   allusion to Augustine, in the preceding verse, which we have already
   mentioned):


   And now if more at length I see,

   'Tis through Thy light, and comes from Thee.

  Exposition of St. John's Gospel

   Augustine's fine comment upon our Lord's first miracle (In Joan. Ev.
   Tract. viii. I) is quoted in another hymn. For He who made wine on that
   day at the marriage feast, in those six water-pots, which He commanded
   to be filled with water, the selfsame does this every year in vines...
   But we do not wonder at the latter, because it happens every year: it
   has lost its marvellousness by its constant recurrence.'

   Charles Wesley wrote, in a hymn upon John 2:7:


   When wine they want, the Almighty Lord

   Water instead of wine demands:

   He both created by His word,

   Nothing His sovereign will withstands:

   And every year in every vine

   He changes water into wine.

   In one of the hymns there is a singular idea as to the intercourse of
   heaven:


   Where glorified spirits by sight

   Converse in their holy abode.

   This, it has been suggested, may be derived from a passage in Hudibras
   (the Heroical Epistle)--a strange source!--


   For what can earth produce, but love,

   To represent the joys above?

   Or who but lovers can converse,

   Like angels, by the eye-discourse?

  Plotinus

   But the notion really comes from Plotinus, and it is quite likely that
   Charles Wesley may have met with it there. The passage is in the fifth
   Ennead (viii. 4), They speak not one with the other; but, as we
   understand many things by the eyes only, so does soul read soul in
   heaven, where the spiritual body is pure, and nothing is hidden, and
   nothing feigned.

   There are two rather recondite allusions in a stanza of one of the
   hymns on the Passion:


   Dies the glorious Cause of all,

   The true eternal Pan,

   Falls to raise us from our fall,

   To ransom sinful man:

   Well may Sol withdraw his light,

   With the Sufferer sympathize,

   Leave the world in sudden night,

   While his Creator dies!

  Plutarch

   The first reference is to the story recorded by Plutarch (De Oraculorum
   Delectu) that in the reign of Tiberius a pilot named Thamus was
   steering his ship round the coast of Epirus, when he heard voices
   proclaiming, Thamus, Thamus, great Pan is dead!' [10] (Pan o megas
   teqnhken.)

  Dionysius the Areopagite

   The other allusion is fainter. There is a legend that Dionysius the
   Areopagite, perceiving a disturbance in nature at the time of the
   Crucifixion, said, H to Qeion pascei, h tw pasconti sumpascei, [11]
   Either the Divinity suffers, or sympathizes with the sufferer!' It
   would seem that a recollection of this has colored the line, Well may
   Sol withdraw his light, With the Sufferer sympathize.'

  The Hymns and the Ecclesiastical Year

   It is a striking fact that Methodism has supplied English Christendom
   with hymns for all the great festivals of the ecclesiastical year. At
   Christmas [7]Hark! the herald angels sing!' is heard in every land
   where the English language is spoken. It is the same at Easter with
   [8]Christ the Lord is risen today!' and much the same on Ascension Day
   with [9]Hail the day that sees Him rise,' and on Whit-Sunday with
   [10]Granted is the Savior's prayer.'

   Some time ago an interesting suggestion was made by an Anglican
   hymnologist [12] with regard to two of these hymns. It was suggested
   that Hark! the herald angels sing!' was possibly inspired by a hymn
   from the Menaion of the Greek Church, [11]cristos gennatai doxasate.
   This forms a part of the Canon for Christmas Day. It was written by St.
   Cosmas, the foster-brother of St. John Damascene, who lived in the
   first half of the eighth century. Unhappily, there is not a great deal
   that can be urged in support of this attractive suggestion. There is
   little likeness between the Greek and the English, not more than we
   might expect to find between any two hymns for the Nativity, and hardly
   as much as exists, for example, between Wesley's English and the Latin
   of Peter the Venerable in the hymn Coelum gaude terra plaude.

   It was also suggested by the same writer that Charles Wesley may have
   had in mind, when writing [12]Hail the day that sees Him rise,' the
   hymn of Fortunatus (or a fourteenth-century imitator of his), Salve
   festa dies toto venerabilis aevo, Qua Deus ad coelos scandit et astra
   tenet. Here, again, there is very little resemblance--none whatever, in
   fact, except the initial phrase.

  Mediaeval Hymns

   But these suggestions, baseless as they seem to be, are enough to raise
   in one's mind the whole question of a possible indebtedness, on the
   part of the Wesleys, to the great hymns of the Middle Ages. At first
   sight, such a relation does not seem at all likely. In the eighteenth
   century the whole of the mediaeval hymnody was almost a terra
   incognita. It was only with the rise of romanticism in literature, at
   the end of that century, that these hymns began to come to their own.
   One may say that Scott's use of Thomas of Celano's great dirge (in
   which he followed Goethe) was almost the beginning of modern interest
   in mediaeval hymns. And it was nearly half a century later when these
   hymns began to be recovered for the use of the English Churches by Dr.
   Neale, and other High Anglican and Catholic scholars. In the age of the
   Wesleys there was very little knowledge in England of the Latin hymns
   of the Middle Ages, and still less of the Greek hymns, found in the
   service-books of the Eastern Church. On the face of it, therefore,
   these hymns are not likely to have been known to the brothers.

   On the other hand, there are some small but significant facts. John
   Wesley translated a German hymn which itself was a translation from the
   Latin. Jesu, Thy soul renew my own' is a version of Scheffler's Die
   Seele Christi heil'ge mich, which again was a version of the mediaeval
   Anima Christi sanctifica me. These lines are entitled in the Roman
   Breviary The Aspirations of St. Ignatius to the Most Holy Redeemer,'
   but the ascription to the founder of the Society of Jesus is an error.
   The lines probably date from the fourteenth century. It is surely
   possible that John Wesley was aware of the Latin original.

  St. Thomas Aquinas

   Again, when Charles Wesley was in Dublin in 1747 he wrote in his
   Journal: I spoke with great freedom to the poor Papists, urging them to
   repentance and the love of Christ, from the authority of their own
   Kempis, and their own Liturgy.' This can only mean that he was a
   student of the Breviary--a very suggestive fact. Doubtless it was there
   that he read the splendid story of the ecstasy of St. Thomas Aquinas,
   which impressed him so much, and left its mark upon more than one hymn.
   The incident is told in one of the lessons for the saint's festival.
   [13] As St. Thomas prayed, he heard the Savior's voice saying, Thou
   hast written well of Me; what reward wouldst thou have?' and he
   exclaimed in answer, Thyself, Lord, nothing but Thyself!' This is
   recalled unmistakably in such lines as--


   Give me Thyself from every boast,

   From every wish set free,

   Let all I have in Thee be lost,

   But give Thyself to me!

   and--


   Nothing beside my God I want,

   Nothing in earth or heaven!

   And if Charles Wesley knew the Breviary, he must have known the Latin
   hymns in it. Accordingly, we are not surprised to find that the
   language of the great hymn of St. Thomas Aquinas, Adoro te devote, has
   apparently colored several of our hymns.

   A phrase in the first line, latens Deitas, appears in a hymn for the
   Nativity:


   He laid His glory by

   He wrapped Him in our clay,

   Unmarked by human eye,

   The latent Godhead lay.

   Then, later in the hymn, the Angelic Doctor wrote:


   Me immundum myinda tuo sanguine,

   Cujus una stilla salvum facere

   Totum mundum quit ab omni scelere,

   --lines which have been translated very literally thus:


   Unclean I am, but cleanse me in Thy blood!

   Of which a single drop, for sinners spilt,

   Can purge the entire world of all its guilt.

   This mystical notion of the efficacy of a single drop of the Redeemer's
   blood became a favorite thought with Charles Wesley:


   By all Thou hast done for my sake,

   One drop of Thy blood I implore,

   Now, now let it touch me, and make

   The sinner a sinner no more!

   And again:


   Sprinkle it, Jesus, on my heart!

   One drop of Thine all-cleansing blood

   Shall make my sinfulness depart,

   And fill me with the life of God!

   At least a dozen other examples might be given of the presence of this
   thought in our hymns. It should be said, in fairness, that the thought
   occurs in some of the older English poets, notably Donne, who has it
   more than once:


   Now Thou art lifted up, draw me to Thee,

   And at Thy death, giving such liberal dole,

   Moist with one drop of Thy blood my dry soul.

   But Donne undoubtedly got it from St. Thomas Aquinas, and so may
   Charles Wesley, as we have seen. And since he knew the Latin hymns in
   the Breviary, he may very well have known other mediaeval hymns not
   found there.

  Adam of St. Victor

   John Wesley certainly did know the old Nativity hymns, Puer natus in
   Bethlehem, and In dulci jubilo, for they are found, with some modern
   Latin hymns written by Johann Wilhelm Petersen (1649-1727), in
   Freylinghausen's Gesangbuch. And the brothers may have encountered in
   their reading other Latin hymns of the Middle Ages. At any rate here is
   another extraordinary parallel. In a hymn by Adam of St. Victor there
   is the striking phrase, applied to the Holy Spirit: Tu qui dator es et
   donum, Thou who Giver art and Gift'; and in another hymn by the same
   writer there is a variation of the same phrase, Tu donum, tu donator,
   Thou the Gift, Thou the Giver.'

   This recurs constantly in Charles Wesley's hymns for Whit-Sunday:


   Life Divine in us renew,

   Thou the Gift and Giver too.


   For Thee our hearts we lift,

   And wait the heavenly Gift

   Giver, Lord of life Divine

   To our dying souls appear.

   Grant the grace for which we pine,

   Give Thyself, the Comforter.


   I come athirst and faint

   Thy Spirit to receive,

   Give me the Gift for which I pant,

   Thyself the Giver give.

  The English Liturgy

   There are in the hymns many reminiscences of the English Liturgy, as we
   should expect.


   Meet and right it is to sing,

   In every time and place,

   Glory to our heavenly king,

   The God of truth and grace,

   is a paraphrase of the Preface and the Sanctus of the Communion Office:
   It is very meet, right, and our bounden duty . . . Therefore with
   angels and archangels . . .'

   Similarly--


   Glory be to God on high,

   God, whose glory fills the sky,

   is a paraphrase of the Gloria in Excelsis of the Communion Office:
   Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will toward men. We
   praise Thee, we bless Thee, we worship Thee. . . .'


   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

   Thy Godhead we adore,

   is a poetical version of the Gloria Patri.

   The language of the Litany is paraphrased in the stanza--


   Thou loving, all-atoning Lamb,

   Thee, by Thy painful agony,

   Thy bloody sweat, Thy grief and shame,

   Thy Cross and passion on the tree,

   Thy precious Death and Life, I pray

   Take all, take all my sins away!

   And there are numerous other examples of an influence which, in the
   case of devout Churchmen like the Wesleys, was inevitable.

  Mysticism in the Hymns

   There is a strain of essential mysticism in the hymns of the Wesleys.
   The recognition of this fact would correct a frequent mis-judgement.
   Leslie Stephen wrote Mysticism seemed to John Wesley to be simply
   folly. His feet were on the solid earth, and he preferred the plain
   light of day to the glooms and glories loved by more imaginative
   natures.' [14]

   Even so learned and so candid a writer as Dr. Gwatkin thinks that
   Wesley's teaching was as clear and full of common sense as Matthew
   Tindal's Deism, and as characteristically wanting in a sense of
   mystery.' [15] Now it is perfectly true that Wesley was a man of his
   century, that he had a precise and logical intellect, and that he hated
   vagueness. It is also true that he said hard things, again and again,
   about the mystic divines,' driven thereto by the disastrous effects of
   an errant Quietism among the Societies. But it should be remembered
   that there is much on the other side.

   Some of the finest of John Wesley's translations from the German are
   versions of the profoundly mystical hymns of Tersteegen and Scheffler.
   And then there is the unmistakable accent of mysticism in much of
   Charles Wesley's verse. The latest French writer on Methodism, Dr.
   Augustin Leger, has remarked upon this Qui veut aimer Dieu, doit aimer
   toutes choses en Dieu seul : Un en tous, et tous en Un, formule que
   répéteront à satiété les vers des Wesley.' [16] Surely they were
   mystics who wrote:


   O sovereign Love to Thee I cry!

   Give me Thyself, or else I die!

   Save me from death; from hell set free:

   Death, hell, are but the want of Thee,

   and--


   Eager for Thee I ask and pant,

   So strong the principle divine,

   Carries me out with sweet constraint,

   Till all my hallowed soul is Thine;

   Plunged in the Godhead's deepest sea,

   And lost in Thy immensity!

   and--


   Nothing else in earth or skies,

   In time, or in eternity:

   Heaven itself could not suffice:

   I seek not Thine, but Thee.

   Then John Wesley was early and deeply imbued with mystical teaching. He
   read the Theologia Germanica and some of the writings of Tauler in
   early life, and at Oxford was a professed disciple of William Law. He
   greatly admired the writings of the Cambridge Platonists (a distinction
   in itself for one who lived in the eighteenth century) and printed some
   of John Smith's Sermons in the Christian Library. In the same
   collection he issued an abridgement of the Guida Spirituale of Molinos,
   the Spanish mystic. There does not appear to have been any other
   edition in English between 1699 and 1775.

   He was specially interested in two mystics of the preceding century,
   and refers to their life and doctrine again and again--Antoinette
   Bourignon and Jeanne de la Mothe Guyon.

  Antoinette Bourignon

   He read Antoinette Bourignon's Treatise of Solid Virtue and Light of
   the World in April 1736, while in Georgia. He included the former work
   in the Christian Library in 1754, and many years before he had
   published translations of some of the author's devotional verse.
   Scattered through her voluminous works are five hymns, two of which
   were translated and included in the Hymns and Sacred Poems of 1739,
   Venez, Jesus, mon salutaire, [13]Come, Savior Jesus, from above,' and
   Adieu, Monde, vray pipeur, World, adieu, thou real cheat!'

  Byrom or Wesley?

   The identity of the translator is a pretty problem in criticism. The
   hymns are claimed for Dr. Byrom, on the strength of two facts. First,
   they are included in his Miscellaneous Poems (1773). But, as these were
   collected and published ten years after his death, this is not
   absolutely conclusive evidence. Byrom might have copied out the verses
   because they interested him by their mysticism, and after his death
   they might thus have been easily mistaken for his own. (Yet Wesley read
   the Miscellaneous Poems when they appeared in 1773, and made no remark
   on the presence of these hymns.) In the second place, there is a letter
   of Byrom's to Charles Wesley dated March 3, 1738: As your brother has
   brought so many hymns translated from the French, you will have a
   sufficient number, and no occasion to increase them by the small
   addition of Mademoiselle Bourignon's two little pieces. I desire you to
   favor my present weakness, if I judge wrong, and not to publish them.'
   This seems to us to suggest unmistakably Byrom's authorship of the
   translations. There remains the difficulty that no other translations
   from the French are known to have been in John Wesley's possession. Is
   it possible that this was a slip of Byrom's for many hymns translated
   from the German,' of which he had previously heard? The sense would
   then be, since he has so many translated hymns, he will need no more.'
   Byrom did not himself begin to learn German until several years after
   this, which would make the mistake as to the language more conceivable.
   But, on the other side of the question, there is the fact that Byrom
   wrote to his son on April 26, 1739, referring to the Hymns and Sacred
   Poems published in that year by the Wesleys in these terms: They have
   together printed a book of hymns, amongst which they have inserted two
   of M. Bourignon's, one of which they call "A Farewell to the World,"
   and the other "Renouncing all for Christ" (Come, Savior Jesus), I
   think, from the French.'

   The style of the two hymns is unquestionably more like that of John
   Wesley than like that of Byrom. If the versions were by Byrom, they
   were certainly somewhat altered by Wesley.

  Where the Christians live!'

   An incident related in Antoinette Bourignon's autobiography has
   influenced the language of one hymn. When the Flemish Quietist was a
   child, struck by the unlikeness of the life around her to what she read
   of in the Gospels, she said to her parents, Where are the Christians?
   Let us go to the country where the Christians live!' This is remembered
   in a hymn on Primitive Christianity':


   Ye different sects, who all declare

   Lo! here is Christ! or Christ is there!'

   Your stronger proofs divinely give,

   And show me where the Christians live!

   When John Wesley was on his way to Herrnhut in July 1738 he recorded in
   his Journal: In the afternoon we came to Weymar, where we had more
   difficulty to get through the city than is usual, even in Germany;
   being not only detained a considerable time at the gate, but also
   carried before I know not what great man (I believe the Duke) in the
   Square; who after many other questions, asked what we were going so far
   as Herrnhut for: I answered, "To see the place where the Christians
   live." He looked hard, and let us go.'

  John Wesley and Frederick the Great

   Moore, in his Life of Wesley (i. 329), says that the great man' was
   Frederick, afterwards King of Prussia, then Prince Royal, as Mr. Wesley
   was informed.' It would be attractive to think of an encounter between
   two men so famous, and so different, as Frederick the Great and John
   Wesley; but unfortunately there is little to warrant us in such a
   fancy. Henry Moore was the intimate friend of Wesley, as well as his
   biographer, and it is not easy to understand how he could be mistaken
   in the matter, but there is no hint of the great man' being Frederick
   in the Journal, either in the passage quoted, or in several later
   passages which refer unflatteringly to the great King of Prussia.
   Moreover, it is difficult to understand how he could be doing the work
   of a city magistrate at Weimar, which was not in Prussian occupation,
   as Halle was. And finally, Frederick would appear to have been in
   another part of the country altogether at that time, spending most of
   July and August in that year upon a visit to the Duchy of Cleves and
   Loo in Holland.

  Madam Guyon

   In 1776 John Wesley published An Extract of the Life of Madame Guion.
   He had long been a critical student of her life and writings.

   In 1742 he records in his Journal that he read Madam Guyon's Les
   Torrents Spirituelles. It would seem probable that Charles Wesley read
   it a few years later, for there appear to be traces of it in some hymns
   published in the Hymns and Sacred Poems of 1749. The imagery of the
   following passages runs through the whole of the Spiritual Torrents.
   All have a loving impatience to purify themselves, and to adopt the
   necessary ways and means of returning to their source and origin, like
   rivers, which after leaving their source, flow on continuously, in
   order to precipitate themselves into the sea.' . . . Finally . . they
   reach the sea, where they are lost to be found no more . . . it is the
   sea, and yet it is the river, because the river, being lost in the sea,
   has become one with it.'

   This thought is reflected in the lines--


   Wherefore to Thee I all resign:

   Being Thou art, and love, and power;

   Thy only will be done, not mine!

   Thee, Lord, let earth and heaven adore!

   Flow back the rivers to the sea,

   And let our all be lost in Thee!

   and in the lines--


   Our love from earthly dross refine:

   Holy, angelical, divine,

   Thee its great Author let it show,

   And back to the pure Fountain flow,

   A drop of that unbounded sea,

   O Lord, resorb it into Thee!

   Another favorite image appears in this passage: Therefore the heart of
   man is perpetually in motion, and can find no rest until it returns to
   its origin and center, which is God: like fire, which, being removed
   from its sphere, is in continual agitation, and does not rest till it
   has returned to it.' This is reflected in another stanza of the last
   hymn quoted:


   A spark of That ethereal fire,

   Still let it to its Source aspire:

   To Thee in every wish return,

   Intensely for Thy glory burn,

   While all our souls fly up to Thee,

   And blaze through all eternity!

  William Law

   William Law was a mystic if there ever was one, and he was the early
   master of both brothers. They parted company with him, it is true, but
   he had an abiding influence upon them. As late as 1768, John Wesley
   published a volume of extracts from Law's later writings. Many
   illustrations of Law's influence might be given. There are some
   favorite ideas of Charles Wesley's which appear in the hymns again and
   again. Such is the thought that the regenerate soul is a reflection of
   the Holy Trinity:


   O that we now, in love renewed,

   Might blameless in Thy sight appear

   Wake me in Thy similitude,

   Stamped with the Triune character

   Flesh, spirit, soul, to Thee resign,

   And live and die entirely Thine!


   And when we rise, in love renewed,

   Our souls resemble Thee,

   An image of of the Triune God

   To all eternity.


   Made like the first happy pair,

   Let us here Thy nature share,

   Holy, pure, and perfect be,

   Transcripts of the Trinity.


   . . . a sinless saint

   In perfect love renewed;

   A mirror of the Deity,

   A transcript of the One in Three,

   A temple filled with God!

  Transcripts of the Trinity

   Charles Wesley once commented upon these last lines, which had been
   criticized. In a letter to his wife he wrote--

   You and the other objectors do not understand those lines. A transcript
   of the One in Three is the definition of man unfallen, and of man
   restored to the divine image. The expression is Mr. Law's, not mine;
   who proves a trinity throughout all nature.

   The thought recurs perpetually in the writings of William Law. [17] In
   An Appeal to all who doubt the Truths of the Gospel, he writes--

   How could the Holy Trinity be an object of Man's worship and adoration,
   if the Holy Trinity had not produced itself in Man? . . . Our
   redemption consists in nothing else but in the Bringing Forth this new
   Birth in us . . . that, being thus born again in the Likeness of the
   Holy Trinity, we may be capable of its threefold Blessing and
   Happiness.

   In Christian Regeneration he writes--

   We have before shown, that Man was created a living Image of the Holy
   Trinity in Unity, that the Divine Birth arose in him, and that Father,
   Son, and Holy Ghost saw themselves in him, in a creaturely Manner. . .
   . There appears a surprising Agreeableness and Fitness, in the Means of
   our Redemption, namely, that we could only be saved by the eternal Son
   of God; that He could only save us by taking our Nature upon Him, and
   so uniting it with Him, that His Life, or Birth, might again arise in
   us, as at the first, and so we become again a perfect living image of
   the Holy Trinity.

   The notion also occurs in Byrom's writings. In An Epistle to a
   Gentleman of the Temple there are the lines describing Adam--


   Formed in the likeness of the sacred Three,

   He stood immortal, powerful, and free;

   Image of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

   The destined sire of a new heavenly host.

  Jacob Böhme

   Byrom and Law had ploughed with the same heifer. They got the thought
   from Jacob Böhme, who wrote--

   So near thee, indeed, is God, that the birth of the Holy Trinity takes
   place in thy heart also, and there all Three Persons are born, Father,
   Son, and Holy Ghost (Aurora, c. x., 58)

CHAPTER III
THE POETS

   ws kai tines twn kaq umas poihtwn eirhkasi ...

   There are occasional reminiscences of the Latin poets in the hymns,
   naturally, for the Wesleys were good classical scholars. Charles Wesley
   once defended himself against the abuse of that virago, his brother's
   wife, by reciting Virgil at the top of his voice. Judging by their
   quotations, Virgil was his favorite Latin poet, as Horace was his
   brother John's.

  Virgil

   The most distinct allusion to Virgil that we have traced is in a hymn
   which paraphrases a famous passage in the sixth book of the Aeneid
   (724-729):


   Principio caelum ac terras camposque liquentis

   Lucentemque globum Lunae Titaniaque astra

   Spiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus

   Mens agitat molem et magno se corpore miscet.

   Inde hominum pecudumque genus vitaeque volantum

   Et quae marmoreo fert monstra sub aequore pontus.

   It is evident that this has colored the thought of some of the
   following lines:


   That all-informing breath Thou art

   Who dost continued life impart,

   And bid'st the world persist to be

   Garnished by Thee yon azure sky

   And all those beauteous orbs on high

   Depend in golden chains from Thee.


   Thou art the Uuiversal Soul,

   The plastic power that fills the whole,

   And governs earth, air, sea, and sky;

   The creatures all Thy breath receive,

   And who by Thy inspiring live,

   Without Thy inspiration die.


   Spirit immense, eternal Mind,

   That on the souls of lost mankind

   Dost with benignest influence move,

   Pleased to restore the ruined race,

   And new-create a world of grace

   In all the image of Thy love!

  Horace

   The most striking allusion to Horace is in the hymn, [14]Stand the
   omnipotent decree!'--which, while a paraphrase of a passage in Young's
   Night Thoughts, is yet influenced by the ode, Justum et tenacem
   propositi virum'--


   Si fractus illabitur orbis,

   Inpavidum ferient ruinae. (iii. 3.)


   Let this earth dissolve and blend

   In death the wicked and the just,

   Let those ponderous orbs descend

   And grind us into dust.

   Rests secure the righteous man!

   The English poets of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have
   influenced the hymns very considerably, especially Milton, George
   Herbert, Dryden, Prior, and Young.

  Milton

   The influence of Milton is visible everywhere in the hymns. The great
   Puritan poet is the source of many of their striking phrases, and his
   influence upon the poetic style of the Wesleys is greater, perhaps,
   than that of any other writer. John Wesley apparently knew a great part
   of Paradise Lost by heart. At Kingswood, in 1750, he selected passages
   of Milton for the eldest children to transcribe and repeat weekly.'
   Later--in 1763--he published An Extract from Milton's Paradise Lost,
   and in the Preface declared that Of all the poems which have hitherto
   appeared in the world, in whatever age or nation, the preference has
   generally been given by impartial judges to Milton's Paradise Lost.'

  Samson Agonistos'

   One or two passages in which the hymns reflect the language of the
   great poet are well known. Thus:


   O dark, dark, dark, I still must say

   Amid the blaze of gospel day,

   is a reminiscence of the wonderful plaint of the blinded giant in
   Samson Agonistes:


   Scarce half I seem to live, dead more than half,

   O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,


   Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse,

   Without all hope of day!

   And the fine stanza:


   With Thee conversing, I forget

   All time, and toil, and care:

   Labor is rest, and pain is sweet,

   If Thou, my God, art here,

   deliberately recalls the words of Eve to Adam:


   With thee conversing, I forget all time,

   An seasons and their change; all please alike.

  Paradise Lost'

   There are many other examples, however, less obvious than these, or at
   any rate less noticed, which are yet unmistakable allusions to Milton.
   For instance:


   Thine arm hath safely brought us

   A way no more expected

   Than when Thy sheep passed through the deep

   By crystal walls protected,

   reminds us of the lines:


   As on dry land, between two crystal walls,

   Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand,

   Divided till his rescued gain their shore.

   The quoted phrase, by the way, occurs a second time in Paradise Lost.
   The first apostrophe in


   O unexampled Love!

   O all-redeeming Grace!

   How swiftly didst Thou move

   To save a fallen race! ...

   is from the same source:


   . . .O unexampled Love!

   Love nowhere to be found less than divine!

   In the lines:


   But above all lay hold

   On faith's victorious shield,

   Armed with that adamant and gold

   Be sure to win the field,

   the poet of Methodism has borrowed his vivid phrase from the
   description of the arch-fiend:


   Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,

   Came towering, armed in adamant and gold.

   In the verse:


   With glorious clonds encompassed round,

   Whom angels dimly see,

   Will the Unsearchable be found,

   or God appear to me?

   there is a remembrance of the address to the Most High put into the
   mouths of our first parents in the fifth book of the poem:


   Unspeakable! Who sitt'st above these heavens

   To us invisible, or dimly seen.

   The one majestic phrase in the stanza:


   From heaven angelic voices sound,

   See the almighty Jesus crowned!

   Girt with omnipotence and grace

   And glory decks the Savior's face!

   is from the discourse of Raphael:


   . . . meanwhile the Son,

   On His great expedition now appeared,

   Girt with omnipotence, with radiance crowned.

   Behind Milton's phrase there is, of course, the language of Ps. 65:6.

   The stanza in one of the hymns on holiness:


   He wills that I should holy be,

   That holiness I long to feel,

   That full, divine conformity

   To all my Savior's blessed will,

   borrows a phrase from the address of Michael:


   . . . . Judge not what is best

   By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,

   Created, as thou art, to nobler end,

   Holy and pure, conformity divine.

   Charles Wesley wrote, in another hymn:


   For every sinful action

   Thou hast atonement made,

   The rigid satisfaction

   Thy precious death hath paid.

   The striking phrase is a quotation from Milton:


   Die he or justice must; unless for him

   Some other, able, and as willing, pay

   The rigid satisfaction, death for death.

   One phrase which occurs often in the hymns of the Wesleys is
   particularly unfortunate; we mean that awkward ellipsis the stony':


   The stony from my heart remove,

   And give me, Lord, O give me love,

   Or at Thy feet I die.

   It sounds unpleasantly like Mr. Swiveller's references to the rosy and
   the mazy. But the Wesleys were following the Miltonic usage, seen, to
   give one example only, in the lines:


   . . . For from the mercy-seat above

   Prevenient grace descending had removed

   The stony from their hearts.

   A phrase from the magnificent lines with which the third book of
   Paradise Lost begins was used by the Wesleys again and again:


   Hail, holy Light! offspring of heaven first-born!

   Or of the Eternal co-eternal Beam.

   This is remembered in the beginning of a hymn:


   Eternal Beam of Light Divine,

   Fountain of unexhausted Love,

   and in the dosing lines of one of John Wesley's splendid translations:


   Thou Beam of the Eternal Beam,

   Thou purging Fire, Thou quickening Flame!

   There is nothing corresponding to this in Tersteegen's German. It is
   John Wesley's remembrance of Milton. Doubtless the word had behind it,
   in the thought of both Milton and Wesley, the apaugasma of the
   Apostolic writer in Heb. 1:3.

  George Herbert

   George Herbert was a favorite poet with both the Wesleys. They adapted
   a considerable number of pieces from The Temple as hymns, and included
   them in their early publications. They must have been familiar with
   Herbert from childhood, for he was one of the writers most beloved by
   Susanna Wesley, and probably they hardly knew when they were echoing
   his words.

   The line in Obedience:


   O let Thy sacred will

   All Thy delight in me fulfil!

   is borrowed in John Wesley's translation of Zinzendorf's Du ewiger
   Abgrund der seligen Liebe:


   The dictates of Thy sovereign will,

   With joy our grateful hearts receive;

   All Thy delight in us fulfil;

   Lo! all we are to Thee we give.

   The first stanza of A True Hymn:


   My joy, my life, my crown!

   My heart was meaning all the day,

   Somewhat it fain would say:

   And still it runneth muttering up and down

   With only this, My joy, my life, my crown!'

   has influenced the language of another of John Wesley's translations,
   his great version of Scheffler's Ich will dich lieben, meine Stärke,
   where, in the last verse:


   Thee will I love, my joy, my crown,

   Thee will I love, my Lord, my God!

   represents:


   Ich will dich lichen, meine Krone,

   Ich will dich lieben, meinen Gott.

   And, curiously enough, in still another hymn from the German, John
   Wesley's version of Joachim Lange's O Jesu, süsses Licht, the lines:


   O God, what offering shall I give

   To Thee, the Lord of earth and skies?

   My spirit, soul, and flesh receive,

   A holy, living sacrifice;

   Small as it is, 'tis all my store

   More should'st Thou have, if I had more.

   suggest a recollection of Herbert's Praise


   To write a verse or two is all the praise

   That I can raise:

   Mend my estate in any ways

   Thou shalt have more.

   The last lines of the verse in Lange's German are merely Dass soll mein
   Opfer sein, Weil ich sonst nichts vermag.'

   A phrase in The Pulley:


   Let us (said He) pour on Him all we can:

   Let the world's riches, which dispersèd lie,

   Contract into a span,

   is remembered and used nobly in a hymn for the Nativity:


   Our God, contracted to a Span,

   Incomprehensibly made man.

   The lines in Longing:


   Lord Jesu, Thou did'st bow

   Thy dying head upon the tree,

   are recalled in the verse:


   Vessels, instruments of grace,

   Pass we thus our happy days

   'Twixt the mount and multitude,

   Doing or receiving good;

   Glad to pray and labor on,

   Till our earthly course is run,

   Till we, on the sacred tree,

   Bow the head, and die like Thee.

   The line in Sunday:


   O let me take thee at the bound,

   Leaping with thee from seven to seven,

   Till that we both, being tossed from earth,

   Fly hand in hand to heaven!

   is remembered in another hymn:


   Let us all together rise,

   To Thy glorious life restored,

   Here regain our paradise,

   Here prepare to meet our Lord;

   Here enjoy the earnest given,

   Travel hand in hand to heaven!

   And the thought in Praise:


   Small it is, in this poor sort

   To enrol Thee:

   E'en eternity is too short

   To extol Thee,

   is remembered in a version of one of the Psalms:


   And all eternity shall prove

   Too short to utter all His love.

  Dryden

   Some of the reminiscences of Dryden's lines in the hymns are striking
   and unmistakable, and altogether the allusions are enough to show a
   pretty close acquaintance on the part of the Wesleys with nearly all
   that the poet wrote.

   Charles Wesley's fine evening hymn:


   All praise to Him who dwells in bliss,

   Who made both day and night:

   Whose Throne is darkness in the abyss

   Of uncreated light,

   deliberately borrows a great line from The Hind and the Panther:


   But, gracious God, how well dost Thou provide

   For erring judgernents an unerring Guide!

   Thy throne is darkness in the abyss of light,

   A blaze of glory that forbids the sight.

   One of the hymns for the Nativity recalls another line from the same
   poem, for


   Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,

   Hail the incarnate Deity!

   is an echo of Dryden's argument for Transubstantiation--


   Could He His Godhead veil in flesh and blood,

   And not veil these again to be our food?

   The hymn:


   Love Divine, all loves excelling,

   Joy of heaven, to earth come down,

   Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,

   All Thy faithful mercies crown,

   owes both its trochaic metre and the form of its first line to the Song
   of Venus' in King Arthur:


   Fairest Isle, all isles excelling,

   Seat of pleasures and of loves;

   Venus here will choose her dwelling,

   And forsake her Cyprian groves.

   One of the hymns for Advent:


   Stupendous height of heavenly love,

   Of pitying tenderness divine!

   It brought the Savior from above,

   It caused the springing day to shine,

   The Sun of Righteousness to appear,

   And gild our gloomy hemisphere,

   adopts a phrase from the juvenile and affected Elegy upon the Death of
   Lord Hastings:


   Lived Tycho now, struck with this ray (which shone

   More bright i' th' morn than others beam at noon),

   He'd take his astrolabe and seek out here,

   What new star 'twas did gild our hemisphere.

   The verse:


   The things unknown to feeble sense,

   Unseen by reason's glimmering ray

   With strong commanding evidence,

   Their heavenly origin display,

   owes a phrase to the Religio Laici:


   So reason's glimmering ray

   Was lent, not to assure our doubtful way,

   But guide us upward to a better day.

   The hymn:


   O God of God, in whom combine

   The heights and depths of love divine,

   With thankful hearts to Thee we sing:

   To Thee our longing souls aspire,

   In fervent flames of strong desire:

   Come, and Thy sacred unction bring!

   borrows an entire line from Dryden's translation of the Veni, Creator
   Spiritus:


   Come, and Thy sacred unction bring

   To sanctify us while we sing!

   One of the penitential hymns echoes a phrase of Dryden's which he used
   in a very different connection. Wesley wrote:


   The godly grief, the pleasing smart,

   The meltings of a broken heart,

   evidently remembering a lively love-song in The Maiden Queen:


   I feel a flame within which so torments me

   That it both pains my heart and yet contents me;

   'Tis such a pleasing smart, and I so love it,

   That I would rather die than once remove it.

   And there are several other cases where single phrases or striking
   epithets of Dryden's have passed, perhaps unconsciously, into the
   hymns. So Wesley's O'er earth in endless circles roved,' is an echo of
   Religio Laici, Thus anxious thoughts in endless circles roll'; and the
   all-atoning Lamb' (which occurs frequently in the hymns) borrows the
   epithet from a line in Absalom and Achitophel:


   Then, seized with fear, yet still affecting fame,

   Usurped a patriot's all-atoning name.

  Cowley

   There are one or two allusions to Cowley. In the verses entitled Life
   occur the lines:


   But angels in their full-enlightened state,

   Angels who live, and know what tis to be!

   Who all the nonsense of our language see,

   And words, our ill-drawn pictures, scorn,

   when we, by a foolish figure, say,

   Behold an old man dead! then they

   Speak properly, and say, Behold a man-child born!

   This is recalled in one of the finest of the Funeral hymns:


   When from flesh the spirit freed,

   Hastens homeward to return,

   Mortals cry, A man is dead!'

   Angels Sing, A child is born!'

   There is a slighter parallel in Prior, a favorite poet with both the
   Wesleys:


   And while the buried man we idly mourn,

   Do angels joy to see his better half return?

   A hymn, popularly supposed to have been written at Land's End, has the
   lines:


   Lo! on a narrow neck of land

   'Twixt two unbounded seas I stand

   Secure, insensible.

   Cowley has the thought in Life:


   Vain, weak-built isthmus which dost proudly rise

   Up betwixt two eternities.

   The comparison was frequent in the eighteenth century. Prior wrote in
   Solomon:


   Amid two Seas on one small point of land,

   Wearied, uncertain, and amazed we stand.

   And Pope, in the Essay on Man:


   Placed on this isthmus of a middle state,

   A being darkly wise, and rudely great.

   Addison has the thought in the Spectator, in language which supplies
   the closest parallel of all:

   in our speculations of Eternity, we consider the Time which is present
   to us the Middle, which divides the whole time into two equal Parts.
   For this Reason, many witty Authors compare the present Time to an
   Isthmus or narrow Neck of Land that rises in the midst of an ocean,
   immeasurably diffused on either Side of it.

  Addison's Spectator'

   There are several other evidences in the hymns of that familiarity with
   Addison's Spectator which we should expect on the part of the Wesleys.
   A line of [15]Addison's version of Ps. 23. (which Wesley republished in
   the Collection of Psalms and Hymns of 1738):


   Thy friendly Crook shall give me Aid,

   And guide me through the dreadful Shade,

   is borrowed in one of the Advent hymns:


   And cheer the souls of death afraid,

   And guide them through the dreadful shade.

   Dr. John Duncan once remarked upon the curiosa filicitas of a line in
   the stanza:


   All are not lost and wandered back,

   All have not left Thy Church and Thee;

   There are who suffer for Thy sake,

   Enjoy Thy glorious infamy,

   Esteem the scandal of the Cross,

   And only seek divine applause.

   The happy phrase is borrowed, with a variation, from an apostrophe in
   the paper which Steele contributed to the Spectator, on Good Friday,
   1712 (it is really reprinted from The Christian Hero): See where they
   have nailed the Lord and Giver of Life! How His wounds blacken, His
   Body writhes, and Heart heaves with Pity and with Agony! O Almighty
   Sufferer, look down, look down from Thy triumphant Infamy!'

  A French Sonnet

   But the most striking illustration of the influence of the Spectator is
   an example in which the verse of Charles Wesley was considerably
   indebted to a French sonnet quoted by Addison in its pages -- an
   indebtedness which was first indicated, in a very roundabout fashion,
   by no less an eighteenth-century personage than Mrs. Piozzi.

  Contemporary Critics

   In 1745 the Rev. Thomas Church (the friend of Bolingbroke), who was
   Vicar of Battersea and Prebendary of St. Paul's, published a pamphlet
   entitled Remarks on the Rev. Mr. Wesley's Last Journal. He was one of
   the fairest of Wesley's innumerable critics. Thirty years afterwards,
   Wesley referred to him in contrast with Rowland Hill, and said that he
   was a gentleman, a scholar, and a Christian: and as such he both spoke
   and wrote.' In the Remarks Church attacked the extravagancy and
   presumption' of the lines:


   Doom, if Thou canst, to endless pains.

   And drive me from Thy face;

   But if Thy stronger love constrains,

   Let me be saved by grace!

   Wesley answered the Remarks in a letter addressed to the author, and a
   second pamphlet, Some Further Remarks, in a second letter. He expressed
   a natural amazement that the lines should have been so grossly
   misunderstood, and defended them as being one of the strongest forms of
   obtestation, of adjuring God to show mercy, by all His grace, and
   truth, and love.'

  Mrs. Piozzi's Comment

   Four years later, in 1749, Lavington, a much less reputable antagonist,
   repeated Church's attack. He quoted the same lines, and reiterated the
   charge of presumption, in The Enthusiasm of Methodists and Papists
   Compared. A copy of the first edition of the first part of Lavington's
   book was in the possession of Mrs. Piozzi, that lively lady who was
   Mrs. Thrale in earlier life, the friend of Dr. Johnson, and familiar to
   all readers of Boswell. She was very fond of writing marginal comments
   in her books. One of her biographers has remarked upon the habit. She
   enriched the margin of Lavington's book with considerable annotations.
   One of these is a comment on the lines he quoted: Doom, if Thou canst,
   to endless pains. And drive me from Thy face!' She says that they are
   in imitation of the famous French sonnet by Despreaux, but by an
   awkwardness of expression seem to lay the Supreme Being under
   constraint of destiny, and that is neither good philosophy nor good
   religion. In the French sonnet there is no such fault.'

  Des Barreaux

   We were unable to discover any sonnet by the famous poet Despreaux,
   better known as Boileau, which fits this reference; nor is he very
   likely to have written such a one. This is, in fact, an example of the
   trivial inaccuracy for which Boswell so often reproaches Mrs. Piozzi.
   For it is a famous sonnet by Des Barreaux, a poet of the generation
   immediately preceding Boileau, of which she was thinking. The editors
   of the old collection of French poetry [18] in which we found it say
   that the reputation of Des Barreaux rests upon a single sonnet, which
   is perhaps the masterpiece of that kind of verse' (le chef-d'oeuvre de
   ce genre). Almost immediately after finding this, we happened upon an
   essay of Addison's in the Spectator, in which be quotes the sonnet in
   full, and describes it as a noble hymn in French ... written by
   Monsieur Des Barreaux, who had been one of the greatest wits and
   libertines in France, but in his last years as remarkable a penitent.'

   Jacques Vallée, Seigneur des Barreaux, was born in 1602, and died in
   1673. He was a counsellor in the Parliament of Paris, but would never
   plead a cause, and eventually resigned the office, according to some
   accounts, that he might devote himself wholly to pleasure. Another
   story is that Cardinal Richelieu fell in love with the famous Marion de
   Lorme, [19] who was Des Barreaux's mistress, and that after the
   Cardinal had made some overtures to Des Barreaux, which he rejected,
   Richelieu became his determined enemy, and forced him to give up his
   office, and leave Paris. [20]

   Des Barreaux wrote many Latin and French verses, but never published
   anything. Pascal makes a casual reference to him. Writing in the
   Pensées, of the war between reason and passion, he alleges Des Barreaux
   as an example of those who would renounce their reason and become brute
   beasts.' He lived an exceedingly dissolute life, but in his later years
   repented and reformed, and spent his last days in religious retirement
   at Chalon-sur-Saône.

   He wrote this sonnet three or four years before his death. It is
   entitled A Sinner's Recourse to the Goodness of God.' We have roughly
   translated it thus:


   O God, just are Thy judgements, just and right

   Vast is Thy mercy, and Thy patience long;

   But I have done such evil in Thy sight

   As to forgive would do Thy justice wrong.

   Sin has annulled Thy love's prerogative:

   Thou canst not pardon such a wretch as I,

   Thy righteousness forbids Thee to forgive,

   Thy mercy must stand helpless while I die.

   Then take Thy vengeance, Lord--I plead no more--

   Mock at my tears, who mocked Thee to Thy face;

   Strike, slay! avenge Thee on my hardihood--

   I perish, yet Thy justice I adore;

   But where shall fall Thy thunders? on what place

   That is not covered with the Savior's blood?

   The last lines of the French are:


   Tonne, frappe, il est temps, rends-moi guerre pour guerre,

   J'adore en perissant la raison qui t'aigrit;

   Mais dessus quel endroit tombera ton tonnerre,

   Qui ne soit tout couveit du sang de Jesus-Christ!

  John Fletcher quotes the lines

   Charles Wesley must have seen this sonnet in the Spectator, and,
   besides, a letter is extant, written to him by John Fletcher, which
   quotes some lines of it as if they were perfectly familiar to them
   both. [21] Fletcher is describing his own experience at that time, when
   he was passing through a season of spiritual depression: It seemed
   altogether incompatible with the holiness, the justice, and the
   veracity of the Supreme Being to admit so stubborn an offender into His
   presence. I could do nothing but be astonished at the patience of God;
   and I would willingly have sung those verses of Desbaraux (sic) if I
   had had strength:


   Tonne, frappe, il est temps, rends-moi guerre pour guerre;

   J'adore en perissant la raison qui t'aigrit.'

   There is no doubt that the sonnet has considerably influenced the verse
   of Charles Wesley. There are echoes of it in


   But if my gracious day is past,

   And I am banished from Thy sight,

   When into outer darkness cast,

   My Judge, I'll own, hath done me right,

   Adore the Hand whose stroke I feel.

   Nor murmur when I sink to hell.

   and--


   Then pour Thy vengeance on my head,

   And quench the smoking flax in me;

   Break (if Thou caust) a bruised reed,

   And cast me out who come to Thee.

   and--


   While groaning at Thy feet I fall,

   Spurn me away, refuse my call;

   If love permit, contract Thy brow

   And if Thou canst, destroy me now!

   But there are some lines in one of the Eucharistic hymns which put the
   matter beyond doubt, for the allusion to the last lines of the sonnet
   is exact and unmistakable:


   Still the wounds are open wide,

   The blood doth freely flow,

   As when first His sacred side

   Received the deadly blow;

   Still, O God, the blood is warm,

   Covered with the blood we are;

   Find a part it doth not arm,

   And strike the sinner there!

   John Fletcher, who has been mentioned as quoting Des Barreaux's lines
   to Charles Wesley, was the saint of early Methodism.

  John Fletcher's Ecstasy

   In Wesley's Life of Fletcher, the following story is told in the
   language of Joseph Benson, from whom Wesley received it: I have
   sometimes seen him on these occasions [at Trevecca], once in
   particular, so filled with the love of God, that he could contain no
   more; but cried out, "O my God, withhold Thy hand, or the vessel will
   burst!" But he afterwards told me he was afraid he had grieved the
   Spirit of God; and that he ought rather to have prayed that the Lord
   would have enlarged the vessel, or have suffered it to break; that the
   soul might have no further bar or interruption to its enjoyment of the
   supreme good.' [22]

   The most singular circumstance here is that the experience is
   paralleled in the lives of many of the saints. It seems to be, if the
   phrase may be allowed, a standard type of spiritual ecstasy. It is
   related, in almost the same terms, with the same appeal against such
   excessive bliss, in the lives of holy men and women as different from
   John Fletcher as St. Francis Xavier, St. Philip Neri, and Blessed
   Margaret Mary Alacoque,--and, in our own days, Mr. Evan Roberts, the
   leader of the Welsh Revival of 1905. [23] But it was doubtless the
   wonderful experience of Fletcher that is recalled in Charles Wesley's
   fervent lines:


   O would He more of heaven bestow,

   And let the vessel break!

   And let our ransomed spirits go

   To grasp the God we seek!

  Samuel Wesley the younger

   Both John and Charles Wesley owed much, in many ways, to their elder
   brother Samuel. While he was Usher at Westminster School, he was the
   trusted friend of Prior and Pope: and he was a poet himself, not
   greatly gifted, but more than the equal of others who have made a
   greater name. There are constant reminiscences of his verse in the
   hymns.

   In The Battle of the Sexes he wrote (addressing the lady who later
   became his wife)


   And thou, dear object of my growing love,

   whom now I must not, or I dare not, name,

   Approve my verse, which shines if you approve!

   John Wesley borrowed a line of this in his translation of Spangenberg's
   Der König ruht and schauet doch:


   Great object of our growing love,

   To whom our more than all we owe,

   Open the fountain from above,

   And let it our full souls o'erfiow

   and the phrase is used many times in other hymns.

   Many other lines in the same poem are quoted in the hymns, such as:


   Now cruel false, now seeming faithful, kind,

   With well-dressed hate, and well-dissembled love,

   in--


   O may I calmly wait,

   Thy succors from above

   And stand against their open hate,

   And well-dissembled love,

   and--


   His hardened front, unblushing, unappalled,

   Laughed at reproaches, and enjoyed disgrace,

   in--


   I then shall turn my steady face,

   Want, pain defy, enjoy disgrace,

   Glory in dissolution near!

   and--


   With cool disdain, The preacher he derides,

   Who marks the eternal bounds of good and ill,

   in--


   To time our every smile or frown,

   To mark the bounds of good and ill,

   And beat the pride of nature down,

   And bend or break his rising will.

  Easter Hymn

   In a Hymn on Easter Day, Samuel Wesley wrote:


   In vain the stone, the watch, the seal,

   Forbid an early rise,

   To Him who breaks the gates of hell,

   And opens Paradise.

   This is closely copied in Charles Wesley's great Easter hymn,
   [16]Christ the Lord is risen today!'


   Vain the stone, the watch, the seal,

   Christ hath burst the gates of hell:

   Death in vain forbids His rise,

   Christ hath opened Paradise!

   Samuel Wesley wrote an elegy On the Death of Mr. William Morgan. He was
   an early associate of John and Charles Wesley at Oxford, whose death
   they were accused of hastening by the austerities which the early
   Methodists practised. In this poem occur these lines, describing
   Morgan:


   Fearful of sin in every close disguise

   Unmoved by threatening or by glozing lies,

   Whose zeal, for other men's salvation shown,

   Beyond the reach of hell secured his own.

   Two phrases in these lines are reflected in the hymns:


   I want a true regard,

   A single, steady aim,

   (Unmoved by threatening or reward),

   To Thee, and Thy great Name.


   Let us then sweet connsel take,

   How to make our calling sure,

   Our election how to make,

   Past the reach of hell secure.

   And there are many other phrases in the poems of Samuel Wesley that are
   similarly reflected in the hymns written by his younger and more famous
   brothers.

  Prior

   The hymns were were considerably influenced by the poems of Prior.
   There is, of course, a special reason for the high esteem in which
   Prior was held by all the Wesleys. He was the intimate friend of
   Atterbury--that singular prelate of whom John Wesley has recorded so
   high an opinion. And Samuel Wesley the younger, while Usher at
   Westminster School, was the trusted companion of Atterbury. He would
   meet Prior many a time at the Deanery, and John also, on his visits to
   the elder brother, would doubtless see the good-natured poet
   frequently. One can irnagine that the Usher would point the moral of
   Mr. Prior's rise to greatness through scholarship--had he not been
   Ambassador at Paris, and did it not all begin through construing Horace
   in a tavern? At any rate, John Wesley held Prior in great esteem; and
   toward the end of his life, in his Thoughts on the Character and
   Writings of Mr. Prior, he went out of his way to defend the poet's
   memory.

   An edition of Prior, with a memoir, appeared in 1779. Apparently this
   occasioned the revival of some scandalous stories which had been set
   about by Arbuthnot, Spence (of the Anecdotes), and Pope, as to the
   identity of Prior's Chloe.' Wesley wrote: I do not believe one word of
   this. Although I was often in his neighborhood, I never heard a word of
   it before. It carries no face of probability. Would Bishop Atterbury
   have kept up an acquaintance with a man of such a character?'

   Wesley passes on to express a high opinion of Prior's genius, and to
   record his judgement that his best verse does not yield to anything
   that has been wrote either by Pope, or Dryden, or any English poet,
   except Milton.' Especially he praises Solomon, as containing the
   strongest sense expressed in some of the finest verses that ever
   appeared in the English tongue.'

  Solomon'

   Charles Wesley shared his brother's admiration, and often recommended
   Solomon to his younger friends. He wrote, in a letter to his daughter
   Sally (Oct. 1, 1778): You should therefore be always getting something
   by heart. Begin with the first book of Prior's Solomon, the Vanity of
   Knowledge. Let me see how much of it you can repeat when we meet.'

   Accordingly we find frequent reminiscences of the poem in the hymns of
   the brothers.

   The second line of the couplet:


   We weave the chaplet, and we crown the bowl,

   And smiling see the nearer waters roll,

   was clearly in the mind of Charles Wesley when he wrote:


   Jesu, Lover of my soul,

   Let me to Thy bosom fly,

   While the nearer waters roll,

   While the tempest still is high.

   The lines spoken by the Egyptian:


   Or grant thy passion has these names destroyed:

   That Love, like Death, makes all distinction void,

   were evidently the inspiration of a verse in the hymn which Edward
   FitzGerald so much admired:


   Love, like Death, hath all destroyed,

   Rendered our distinctions void!

   Names, and sects, and parties fall

   Thou, O Christ, art all in all!

   And Prior's apostrophe:


   From Now, from instant Now, great Sire! dispel

   The clouds that press my soul: from Now reveal

   A gracious beam of light; from Now inspire

   My tongue to sing, my hand to touch the lyre,

   was apparently in the memory of the writer of the magnificent lines:


   While low at Jesu's Cross I bow,

   He hears the blood of sprinkling now.

   This instant now I may receive

   The answer of His powerful prayer:

   This instant now by Him I live,

   His prevalence with God declare.

   There are also phrases of constant occurrence in the hymns that are
   traceable to the same source. The sun's directer rays' (found in hymns
   by both Samuel and Charles Wesley, and in a schoolboy translation of
   Horace by John Wesley), our cautioned soul,' my constant flame,'--these
   are all from Solomon.

   The other poems of Prior have not influenced the Wesleys so much, but
   that is as we should expect; the difference of subject and tone amply
   accounts for it. Still, there are a few clear allusions to the minor
   poems. In his Ode to a Lady, She refusing to continue a Dispute with
   Me, Prior wrote:


   You, far from danger as from fear,

   Might have sustained an open fight.

   Charles Wesley wrote, in the hymn Captain of Israel's host and Guide':


   As far from danger as from fear,

   While Love, Almighty Love, is near.

   In Charity, a Paraphrase of the Thirteenth Chapter of the First Epistle
   to the Corinthians, Prior wrote:


   Soft peace she brings wherever she arrives,

   She builds our quiet, as she forms our lives,

   Lays the rough paths of peevish nature ev'n,

   And opens in each heart a little heaven.

   This is remembered in the hymn:


   The peace Thou hast given, This moment impart,

   And open Thy heaven, O Love, in my heart!

   And once more, Prior wrote in his Henry and Emma, an abominable
   Georgian perversion of a delightful old ballad (which John Wesley
   republished in the Arminian Magazine, to the great scandal of some of
   his followers)


   If love, alas! be pain, the pain I bear

   No thought can figure and no tongue declare.

   John Wesley, in his superb translation of Gerhardt's hymn, wrote:


   Jesu, Thy boundless love to me

   No thought can reach, no tongue declare,

   adopting Prior's phrase, and improving it.

   Today Matthew Prior is very largely a forgotten poet. But he had as
   much of the genuine poetic gift as any writer of his age. John Wesley,
   in this matter at any rate, is in very good company, for he is at one
   with writers as diverse as Cowper, Thackeray, and Swinburne, in his
   admiration for the genius of Prior.

  Prior's Influence

   Something of the freedom of their versification the Wesleys certainly
   owed to Prior. It was his influence that saved them from the monotonous
   antithesis of the correct' style of Pope, and almost every
   eighteenth-century writer, following in his train. In the Preface to
   Solomon Prior wrote: I would say one word of the measure in which this
   and most poems of the age are written. Heroic with continued rhyme, as
   Donne and his contemporaries used it, carrying the sense of one verse
   most commonly into another, was found too dissolute and wild, and came
   very often too near prose. As Davenant and Waller corrected, and Dryden
   perfected it, it is too confined: it cuts off the sense at the end of
   every first line, which must always rhyme to the next following, and
   consequently produces too frequent an identity in the sound, and brings
   every couplet to the point of an epigram.' Johnson, in his Lives of the
   Poets, characteristically decides that Prior's attempt to put his
   critical principle into practice, by extending the sense from one
   couplet to another, with variety of pauses,' is without success: his
   interrupted lines are unpleasing, and his sense, as less distinct, is
   less striking.' We do not agree: Solomon is more free, more fluent, in
   its use of the heroic measure than any poem that was published within
   the next three generations. One of Prior's favorite methods of breaking
   the monotony of the couplet brings about a pause after the second
   syllable of the second line, as in


   And at approach of death shall only know

   The truths, . . . which from these pensive members flow.


   On the vile worm, that yesterday began

   To crawl; . . . Thy fellow creature, abject man!


   Yet take thy bent, my soul; another sense

   Indulge, . . . add music to magnificence.

   John Wesley caught this trick of enjambement from Prior, and his hymns
   abound with it. One or two examples will serve where dozens might be
   given:


   To gain earth's gilded toys, or flee

   The Cross . . . endured, my God, by Thee?


   A man! an heir of death! a slave

   To sin! . . . a bubble on the wave.

  Pope

   The verse of the Wesleys has not been greatly influenced by the
   writings of Pope, with the exception of a single poem. The hymns only
   contain two or three slight allusions to the Essay on Man, but they
   echo the language of Eloïsa to Abelard in the most extraordinary way.
   Probably Charles Wesley had got the poem by heart, and hardly knew when
   he was quoting it.

   The first line of the couplet:


   Thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray,

   And gleams of glory brightened all the day,

   is recalled in one of Charles Wesley's earliest hymns, with a single
   change necessitated by the metre:


   Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,

   I woke, the dungeon flamed with light.

   The lines:


   To sounds of heavenly harps she dies away,

   And melts in visions of eternal day,

   are remembered in another hymn:


   Till, on the bosom of my Lord,

   I sink in blissful dreams away

   And visions of eternal day.

   The thought in the passage:


   When, at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,

   Fancy restores what vengeance snatched away,

   Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,

   All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee,

   is remembered and redeemed to a nobler significance in an evening hymn:


   Loose me from the chains of sense,

   Set me from the body free,

   Draw, with stronger influence,

   My unfettered soul to Thee!

   In me, Lord, Thyself reveal,

   Fill me with a sweet surprise:

   Let me Thee when waking feel;

   Let me in Thine image rise.

   The lines in the same poem


   O happy state, when souls each other draw,

   When love is liberty, and nature law,

   lines which Pope repeated with a variation in the Essay on Man:


   Converse and love mankind might strongly draw,

   When love was liberty, and nature law,

   were evidently in Charles Wesley's mind when he wrote:


   Implant it deep within,

   Whence it may ne'er remove,

   The law of liberty from sin,

   The perfect law of love.

   Thy nature be my law,

   Thy spotless sanctity,

   And sweetly every moment draw

   My happy soul to Thee.

  Young

   It is difficult for us in these days to understand the immense vogue of
   Young's Night Thoughts in the eighteenth century. Young's turgid
   platitudes are so wearisome to a modern reader that it needs an effort
   to discern the real poetic power which sometimes underlies the
   bombastic lines, and which goes some way toward justifying the rather
   fantastic judgement of D. G. Rossetti, that Young was the greatest poet
   of his century. But there can be no doubt as to the extent of Young's
   fame and influence in that age. Charles Wesley set his daughter to
   learn by heart long passages of Young's poem, and he himself more than
   once transcribed the whole of it. He said expressly: No writings but
   the inspired are more useful to me.' And some of the greatest names of
   that century might be quoted in support of Charles Wesley's high
   estimate of Young. He was in good company, at least, in his admiration
   for a poet who influenced Goethe, who was quoted on the scaffold by
   Camille Desmoulins, and to the study of whose writings Burke himself
   ascribed his own splendid style.

  Night Thoughts'

   [17]One of the hymns:


   Stand the omnipotent decree!

   Jehovah's will be done!

   Nature's end we wait to see,

   And hear her final groan;

   Let this earth dissolve, and blend

   In death the wicked and the just,

   Let those ponderous orbs descend,

   And grind us into dust,

   is a deliberate paraphrase of a passage in the Night Thoughts:


   If so decreed, the Almighty Will be done,

   Let earth dissolve, you pond'rous orbs descend,

   And grind us into dust; the soul is safe;

   The man emerges.

   The lines:


   they see

   On earth a bounty not indulged on high,

   And downward look for Heaven's superior praise,

   are recalled in the verse:


   Ye seraphs, nearest to the Throne,

   With rapturous amaze,

   On us, poor ransomed worms, look down

   For Heaven's superior praise.

   And the vivid but unfortunate image in the lines


   Thou who didst save him, snatch the smoking brand

   From out the flames, and quench it in Thy Blood,

   is reproduced in many stanzas, such as:


   I want an even strong desire,

   I want a calmly fervent zeal,

   To save poor souls out of the fire,

   To snatch them from the verge of hell,

   And turn them to a pardoning God,

   And quench the brands in Jesu's blood!

   Young's apostrophe:


   Happy day that breaks our chain!

   That manumits, that calls from exile home,

   reappears in a hymn as:


   O happy, happy day,

   That calls Thy exiles home!

   The heavens shall pass away,

   The earth receive its doom;

   Earth we shall view, and heaven destroyed,

   And shout above the fiery void.

   The verse:


   His love, surpassing far

   The love of all beneath,

   We find within our hearts, and dare

   The pointless darts of death,

   borrows a phrase from Young's line


   Death's pointless darts, and hell's defeated storms.

   The lines


   the rush of years

   Beats down their strength; Their numberless escapes

   In ruin end,

   are remembered in a hymn which is a paraphrase of Jer. 32:24:


   The rush of numerous years bears down

   The most gigantic strength of man;

   And where is all his wisdom gone

   When dust he turns to dust again?

   Here Charles Wesley wrote beats down,' and the word was altered to
   bears down' by John Wesley in his revision.

  Last Day'

   There are also several recollections in the hymns of Young's Last Day.
   The apostrophe


   Triumphant King of Glory! Soul of bliss!

   What a stupendous turn of fate is this!

   is recalled in the hymn for Easter


   King of Glory! Soul of bliss!

   Everlasting life is this,

   Thee to know, Thy power to prove,

   Thus to sing, and thus to love.

   And the lines:


   Drive back the tide, suspend a storm in air,

   Arrest the sun, but still of this despair,

   are adapted in another hymn, with a mystical sense of which Young was
   utterly incapable:


   Thou my impetuous spirit guide,

   And curb my headstrong will,

   Thou only canst drive back the tide,

   And bid the sun stand still

   The hymn (the only one on this dread subject included in the Collection
   of 1780):


   Terrible thought! shall I alone,

   Who may be saved, shall I,

   Of all, alas! whom I have known,

   Through sin for ever die?

   is based upon a neighboring passage in the same poem:


   thy wretched self alone

   Cast on the left of all whom Thou hast known,

   How would it wound?

   Many other examples of Young's influence might be quoted. Apart from
   distinct allusions to his lines, he enriched the language of Charles
   Wesley by favorite phrases, such as the starry crown,' the mighty
   void,' and by favorite word such as triumph' and pomp '--the latter
   occurring almost as incessantly in Young as in the hymns.

  Links with Literature

   It is not the least part of the spiritual privilege of Methodists that
   these magnificent hymns have so many links with literature. Dryden
   called Ben Jonson the great plagiary,' and spoke of tracking his
   footsteps in the snow.' The Wesleys were great plagiarists, in the same
   honorable sense, and it has not been an unpleasant or an unfruitful
   task, we trust, to trace somewhat of their indebtedness, in thought and
   language, to the great writers of the past. It has been rightly said
   that one of the great charms of Milton is the implicit lore' of his
   verse--the amount of scholarship that is held in solution in his
   stately lines. There is a similar charm in the verse of the Wesleys:
   one is always finding fresh evidence, embedded in the hymns, of their
   wide reading and exact knowledge. These spiritual songs, like
   Prospero's isle, are full of echoes.

  The Hymns of Methodism are Unique

   The hymns of Methodism stand alone, in many respects, in the religious
   literature of the world. They are unique in their intimate connection
   with one of the greatest spiritual movements of history, for the very
   genius of the Evangelical Revival is in their burning lines: they
   enshrine what has been well called the holy, compassionate, believing
   spirit of early Methodism.' And, while they constitute the greatest
   body of devotional verse in the language, they are wholly the work of
   those astonishing and apostolic men who were not only brothers by
   blood, but also


   brothers

   In honor, as in one community,

   Scholars and gentlemen.

JOHN WESLEY'S TRANSLATIONS FROM THE GERMAN

   The following is a complete list of John Wesley's translations from the
          German:
          [18]Extended on a cursed tree.
          Welt, sieh bier dein Leben (Gerhardt).
          [19]Jesu, thy boundless love to me.

II
QUIETISM AND CALVINISM

   There were two movements, more or less within the Methodist Societies,
   during the lifetime of the Wesleys, that threatened to wreck their
   work. The first emanated from Molther and the Moravians, the second
   from Whitefield and his followers.

   A perverted Quietism, introduced by Molther, caused the breach with the
   Moravians, and gave the Wesleys a great deal of trouble for some years
   afterwards, especially in 1739 and 1740. Those who came under the spell
   made much of the text--the locus classicus of Quietism--Be still, and
   know that I am God.' Stillness' meant to cease from the means of grace,
   and even from the reading of the Scriptures and prayer, because of the
   peril of trusting in them. Those who were still' would call themselves
   nothing but poor sinners' or happy sinners'--greatly to the disgust of
   honest John Nelson, whose robust common sense held the poor sinnership'
   in hearty contempt. Two passages from Charles Wesley's Journal for
   April, 1740, will sufficiently illustrate the situation and the peril.
   April 8: I got home, weary, wounded, bruised, and faint, through the
   contradiction of sinner; poor sinners, as they call themselves, these
   heady, violent, fierce contenders for stillness. I could not bear the
   thought of meeting them again.' April 25: Many here (in London) insist
   that a part of their Christian calling is liberty from obeying, not
   liberty to obey. The unjustified, say they, are to be still: that is,
   not to search the Scriptures, not to pray, not to communicate, not to
   do good, not to endeavor, not to desire for it is impossible to use
   means without trusting in them. Their practice is agreeable to their
   principles. Lazy and proud themselves, bitter and censorious toward
   others, they trample upon the ordinances and despise the commands of
   Christ.'

   There are many allusions to stillness' in the hymns. One is headed The
   True Stillness':


   Still for Thy loving kindness, Lord,

   I in Thy Temple wait:

   I look to find Thee in Thy word,

   Or at Thy table meet.

   Here in Thine own appointed ways

   I wait to learn Thy will;

   Silent I stand belore Thy face,

   And hear Thee say, Be still!'

   Be still, and know that I am God!'

   'Tis all I live to know!

   To feel the virtue of Thy blood,

   And spread its praise below!

   Another hymn has the lines,


   Place no longer let us give

   To the old Tempter's will;

   Never more our deity leave,

   While Satan cries, Be still!'

   Stand we in the ancient way,

   And here with God ourselves acquaint;

   Pray we, every moment pray,

   And never, never faint.

   Another hymn is a lament over those who had lapsed into stillness':


   Whom still we love with grief and pain,

   And weep for their return in vain.


   In vain, till Thou the power bestow,

   The double power of quickening grace!

   And make the happy sinners know

   Their Tempter, with his angel face;

   Who leads Them captive at his will,

   Captive--but happy sinners still!

   Another is entitled A Poor Sinner':


   I would be truly still,

   Nor set a time to Thee,

   But act according to Thy will

   And speak, and think, and be.


   I would with Thee be one;

   And till the grace is given,

   Incessant pray, Thy will be done,

   In earth as 'tis in heaven.

   The other movement was the Calvinistic propaganda. Many of the hymns of
   Methodism reflect the life-long controversy of the Wesleys with the
   Calvinists.

   It was undoubtedly these great hymns that were largely accountable for
   the diffusion of Arminian doctrine throughout evangelical Christendom.
   In this respect they mark a theological epoch. For the work of the
   Wesleys was the death of Calvinism, or at least of its baser nature.

   The Calvinism that survives in the world today is a thing refined,
   rarefied. The baser sort of Calvinism is so utterly extinct in our
   days--thanks to Methodism--that it is difficult for us to realize that
   it ever existed. The sublimated spirit of Calvinism that lives in the
   modern representatives of the Reformed Churches we can admire greatly.
   The deep sense of the sinfulness of sin, the profound apprehension of
   grace as utterly and unutterably undeserved, the humility and the
   reverence which attend upon these thoughts--all these are spiritual
   characteristics for which we cannot be too thankful. And we could
   willingly detect more of all these notes in modern religion.

   There, indeed, lies at once the source and the strength of all that is
   best in Calvinism. The doctrine of Calvin is the doctrine of Augustine,
   extended to its relentless issue, and it is in the religious experience
   of Augustine that we must seek the germ of his doctrine. It was
   Augustine's deep conviction of sin and his sense of absolute
   helplessness apart from the overmastering and overwhelming grace of
   God--it was this, passing into his writings, and, after many centuries,
   developed with pitiless logic, by a mind much more formal and much less
   subtle than his, which became Calvinism. At this time of day we can
   afford to recognize that the noble source of the doctrinal perversion
   was nothing less than that deep instinct of the Christian soul which is
   expressed in the language of Toplady:


   Nothing in my hand I bring,

   Simply to Thy Cross I cling!

   This is the better side: there was a worse. There is plentiful evidence
   of that in the early literature of Methodism. Charles Wesley once
   quoted from Calvin's Institutes (l. iii. c. 24) a frightful passage
   concerning the reprobate, God speaketh to them that they may be the
   deafer: He gives light to them that they may be the blinder; He offers
   instruction to them that they may be the more ignorant; and uses the
   remedy that they may not be healed.' And elsewhere the poet of
   Methodism records that during his exposition of a controverted passage
   of Scripture at Bristol one of his hearers even called for damnation
   upon his own soul if Christ died for all, and if God was willing THAT
   ALL MEN SHOULD BE SAVED.' This was the faith, and this the temper of
   eighteenth-century Calvinism. And this was where the early Methodists
   joined issue with the doctrines of grace.' What the Wesleys contended
   for was a universal gospel; what they denied vehemently was that
   doctrine of election which, as John Wesley said, amounted to this: One
   in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are
   reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate
   shall be damned, do what they can.'

   It is characteristic that the reasons for which the Wesleys opposed
   Calvinism were all practical reasons. It disturbed the peace of the
   Societies, and they were forced to fight it for the sake of peace. It
   appeared amongst the early Methodists as an alien propaganda, and it
   had to be encountered. Then it led undoubtedly to serious laxity of
   conduct: the Antinomian peril was very real in the early days of
   Methodism, and it was largely the result of Predestinarian doctrine.
   Antinomianism was not then the mere ghost of dead heresy or the bold
   paradox of exalted pietism, but a hideous danger, which the Wesleys met
   everywhere. And then the doctrinal grounds of opposition were also
   practical. Neither of the Wesleys had much interest in speculative
   theology. But they preached an illimitable salvation; they denied that
   there was any limit whatever to the gospel except such as was set by
   the unwillingness of men to accept salvation. They taught that the
   forgiving love of God was boundless.

   The literature of the controversy between Methodism and Calvinism is
   today largely forgotten. It is as well so. The pamphlets and sermons of
   1740 and 1770, the publications of Wesley, Fletcher, and Olivers on the
   one side, and of Whitefield, Toplady, and Sir Richard Hill on the
   other, have only an antiquarian interest. All that really survives
   today from that remote contest is a batch of hymns--Toplady's Rock of
   Ages! cleft for me.'--and many of the stirring stanzas that Charles
   Wesley wrote at the time. Several of these familiar hymns, indeed, can
   scarcely be understood as they ought unless we remember the implicit
   protest against a limited gospel which they contain.


   The world He suffered to redeem:

   For all He hath the atonement made;

   For those that will not come to Him

   The ransom of His life was paid!


   O for a trumpet voice

   On all the world to call!

   To bid their hearts rejoice

   In Him who died for all!

   For all my Lord was crucified,

   For all, for all my Savior died!


   O let Thy love my heart constrain,

   Thy love for every sinner free,

   That every fallen soul of man

   May taste the grace that found out me;

   That all mankind with me may prove

   Thy sovereign, everlasting love.

   But if it be asked where in these hymns of controversy Charles Wesley's
   most effective protest against the doctrine of Calvin is to be found,
   there can be little doubt, we think, that it is in precisely those
   lines which express the deepest depth of humility, the lines in which
   he writes of the grace of God:


   Throughout the world its breadth is known,

   Wide as infinity!

   So wide, it never passed by one,

   Or it had passed by me.

III
ARCHAISMS IN THE HYMNS

   The style of Wesley's hymns is distinctly the most modern poetical
   style of the period. There are, however, a few archaisms, all of which
   are dealt with, we believe, in the following notes. In the examples
   from the hymns, the numbers given are those of the Collection of Hymns
   for the Use of the People called Methodists (1780).

1. WORDS USED WITH AN OBSOLETE PRONUNCIATION.

  ÁCCEPTABLE


   Thou our sacrifice receive,

   Acceptable through Thy Son. [26]

   The older pronunciation, as in Milton:


   Thy perfect gift, so good,

   So fit, so acceptable, so divine. [27]

  CÉMENTED


   Cemented by love divine,

   Seal our souls for ever Thine! [28]

   The older pronunciation, as in Shakespeare:


   The fear of us

   May cement their divisions, and bind up

   The petty difference. [29]

   But this pronunciation was already giving way before Wesley's time.
   Witness the lines of Swift, in the City Shower (1710):


   Sole coat! where dust cemented by the rain,

   Erects the nap, and leaves a cloudy stain!

  CÓNFESSOR


   His friends and confessors to own,

   And seat us on our glorious throne. [30]

   This is the historical pronunciation, which did not give way until the
   beginning of the nineteenth century. After this, for a while, both
   pronunciations were current, and there was an attempt to distinguish
   the two senses of the word by the differing accents--cónfessor, one who
   witnesses for religion in the face of danger--the meaning of the word
   in the hymn--conféssor one who makes or receives confession of a fault.

   But Wesley's pronunciation was universal up to his time, and for years
   after. So in Dryden (using the word in the second sense):


   For sundry years before did he complain,

   And told his ghostly confessor his pain. [31]

  OBDÚRATE


   Give the sweet relenting grace,

   Soften this obdurate stone! [32]

   The older pronunciation, as always in Shakespeare and Milton:


   His baleful eyes,

   That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,

   Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate. [33]

  SÚCCESSOR


   Where shall I wander now to find,

   The successors they left behind?

   The older pronunciation as in Dryden:


   I here declare you rightful successor,

   And heir immediate to my crown. [34]

  2. WORDS USED IN AN OBSOLETE SENSE.

  PREVENT


   He prevents His creatures' call,

   Kind and merciful to all. [35]

   This, of course, is the old and primary sense of the word, as in the
   collect:

   Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with Thy most gracious favor.

   And in Izaak Walton, who records that be rose early to go fishing,
   preventing the sunrise.'

  PROPRIETY


   Whate'er I have was freely given;

   Nothing but sin I call my own:

   Other propriety disclaim.

   Thou only art the great I AM. [36]

   This is the Latin sense of the word--what we mean now by property,
   proprietorship.' So, in Milton:


   Hail, wedded Love, mysterious law, true source

   Of human offspring, sole propriety

   In Paradise of all things common else! [37]

  RESENT


   My inmost bowels shalt resent

   The yearnings of Thy dying love. [38]

   When the word was first introduced into the language, in the
   seventeenth century, it simply meant, as the French ressentir still
   does, to feel--to have a sense or feeling of that which had been done
   to us, but whether a sense of gratitude for tbe good, or of enmity for
   the evil, the word said nothing' (Trench, Select Glossary, p. 186). It
   was only gradually that the sense of the word was narrowed to express
   angry feeling alone.

   The earlier and wider significance of the word (as in the hymn) is seen
   in these examples:

   It was mighty well resented and approved of. [39]


   'Tis by my touch alone that you resent

   What objects yield delight, what discontent. [40]

  UNITARIAN


   The Unitarian fiend expel,

   And chase his doctrine back to hell. [41]

   Remarks have often been ignorantly made on the bitter intolerance of
   these lines, which many have understood as referring to the teaching of
   those whom we now call Unitarians. The fact is, of course, that they
   refer solely to Mahometanism. The hymn is headed, in the Collection of
   1780, For the Mahometans' (in the pamphlet in which it was originally
   published, For the Turks'), and it is full of specific allusions to
   Mahomet, That Arab-thief, as Satan bold, Who quite destroyed Thine
   Asian fold.' The use of of Unitarian in reference to Moslem doctrine is
   quite correct, and, in the eighteenth century, was quite common.
   Gibbon, in describing the rise of Islam, refers again and again to the
   march of the Unitarian armies, the advance of the Unitarian banners.
   Those Christians who deny the Divinity of Christ were always called
   Socinians in Wesley's time; it was only at the end of the eighteenth
   century that they began to be generally called Unitarians. Indeed the
   next hymn but one to this in the Hymns of Intercession for all Mankind
   (1758), is entitled For the Arians, Socinians, Deists, Pelagians, &c.'

  3. OBSOLETE GRAMMATICAL USAGE.

   There is one grammatical archaism which frequently recurs in the
   hymns--the use of the Preterite for the Passive Participle, as in


   The Sun of Righteousness on me

   Hath rose with healing in his wings. [42]


   Holiness unto the Lord,

   Still be wrote upon our heart. [43]

   and innumerable other examples.

   Wesley, in his Short English Grammar, published in 1748, gives rose'
   and strove' as being both the Imperfect and the Passive Participle of
   rise' and strive.' He gives writ' or wrote' as the Imperfect, and
   written' as the Participle of write.'

   In the Gentleman's Magazine of 1758 there is a witty poem by Dr. Byrom,
   The Passive Participle's Petition:


   Till just of late, good English has thought fit

   To call me written, or to call me writ:

   But what is writ or written, by the vote

   Of writers now, hereafter must be wrote,

   And what is spoken, too, hereafter spoke,

   And measures never to be broken, broke.


   I never could be driven, but in spite

   Of Grammar, they have drove me from my right.

   None could have risen, to become my foes:

   But what a world of enemies have rose!

   Who have not gone, but they have went about,

   And, torn as I have been, have tore me out.

   The poem, which was probably suggested by The Humble Petition of Who
   and Which, in the Spectator, ends with the appeal:


   Let all The learned take some better heed,

   And leave the vulgar to confound the due

   Of preter sense, and participle too.

   Dr. Lowth also protested against this usage, and declared: This abuse
   has been long growing upon us, and is continually making further
   encroachments.' On the other hand, Home Tooke, in the Diversions of
   Pitney (1786), maintained that it was not a growing usage, but one
   which had greatly decreased; that it was not an innovation, but the
   idiom of the language'; and that examples of it might be given from
   every writer in the English tongue.' The pioneer of English philology
   was right. Byrom was mistaken in thinking the usage of recent
   introduction. It occurs more or less in all English writers until the
   middle of the eighteenth century. So Shakespeare, where Queen Katherine
   says in Henry VIII (ii. 4,30)


   Or which of your friends

   Have I not strove to love, although I knew

   He were mine enemy?

   and where Edmund says in King Lear (i. 2, 93):

   I dare pawn down my life for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
   affection to your honor.

   And often in Dryden:


   I made a sacred and a solemn vow

   To offer up the prisoners that were took. [44]

   Nevertheless, we have a strong impression that the practice of using
   the Preterite instead of the Participle was commoner in the early
   eighteenth century than it had ever been before, and we would suggest
   that this was because the age had become sensitive to the confusion,
   and was endeavoring to reach a consistent usage--either by making the
   Preterite regularly serve instead of the Participle, as the Wesleys
   did, or by distinguishing regularly between them--the usage which
   finally prevailed. Lowth and Byrom felt that the use of the Preterite
   for the Participle was becoming more common, as in some writers it
   probably was, through an effort after consistency, and they concluded
   that it was a new abuse, which it was not.

   And, finally, there is the use of rent' for rend':


   My stony heart Thy voice shall rent,

   Thou wilt, I trust, the veil remove. [45]

   John Wesley, in his Short English Grammar, gives rend' as the Present
   Tense, and rent' as the Imperfect; but Charles Wesley, in the hymns,
   consistently used rent' as the Present Tense of the verb. There is
   warrant for it in earlier writers, as in Shakespeare:


   And will yon rent our ancient love asunder

   To join with men in scorning your poor friend? [46]

   And in George Herbert:


   Better by worms be all once spent,

   Than to have hellish moths still gnaw and fret

   Thy name in books, which may not rent. [47]

   Rent' as the Present Tense occurred in several passages of the
   Authorized Version of the Bible, but it has been altered in later
   editions in every case but one (Jer. 4:30).

   Rend' and rent' would appear to have been used indifferently for the
   Present Tense--as they are in Shakespeare--until nearly Wesley's time.
