The Temple--Its Ministry and Services

  Alfred Edersheim

Preface

   It has been my wish in this book, to take the reader back nineteen
   centuries; to show him Jerusalem as it was, when our Lord passed
   through its streets, and the Sanctuary, when He taught in its porches
   and courts; to portray, not only the appearance and structure of the
   Temple, but to describe its ordinances and worshippers, the ministry of
   its priesthood, and the ritual of its services. In so doing, I have
   hoped, not only to illustrate a subject, in itself most interesting to
   the Bible-student, but also, and chiefly, to sketch, in one important
   aspect, the religious life of the period in which our blessed Lord
   lived upon earth, the circumstances under which He taught, and the
   religious rites by which He was surrounded; and whose meaning, in their
   truest sense, He came to fulfil.

   The Temple and its services form, so to speak, part of the life and
   work of Jesus Christ; part also of His teaching, and of that of His
   apostles. What connects itself so closely with Him must be of deepest
   interest. We want to be able, as it were, to enter Jerusalem in His
   train, along with those who on that Palm-Sunday cried, Hosanna to the
   Son of David'; to see its streets and buildings; to know exactly how
   the Temple looked, and to find our way through its gates, among its
   porches, courts, and chambers; to be present in spirit at its services;
   to witness the Morning and the Evening Sacrifice; to mingle with the
   crowd of worshippers at the great Festivals, and to stand by the side
   of those who offered sacrifice or free-will offering, or who awaited
   the solemn purification which would restore them to the fellowship of
   the Sanctuary. We want to see these rites, as it were, before us--to
   hear the Temple-music, to know the very Psalms that were chanted, the
   prayers that were offered, the duties of the priesthood, the
   sacrificial worship in which they engaged, and the very attitude of the
   worshippers--in short, all those details which in their combination
   enable us vividly to realise the scenes, as if we ourselves were
   present in them. For, amidst them all, we ever see that one great
   outstanding Personality, Whose presence filled that house with glory.

   The New Testament transports us into almost every one of the scenes
   described in this book. It also makes frequent reference to them for
   illustration. We see the father of John ministering in his course in
   the burning of incense; the Virgin-Mother at her purification,
   presenting her First-born; the child Jesus among the Rabbis; the Master
   teaching in the porches of the Temple, sitting in the Treasury,
   attending the various festivals, giving His sanction to the
   purifications by directing the healed leper to the priest, and, above
   all, as at the Feast of Tabernacles, applying to himself the
   significant rites of the Sanctuary. And, as we follow on, we witness
   the birth of the Church on the day of Pentecost; we mark the frequent
   illustrations of spiritual realities by Temple-scenes, in the writings
   of the apostles, but more especially in the Book of Revelation, whose
   imagery is so often taken from them; and we still look for the
   accomplishment of the one yet unfulfilled type--the Feast of
   Tabernacles, as the grand harvest-festival of the Church.

   I have thus placed the permanent Christian interest in the foreground,
   because it occupied that place in my own mind. At the same time, from
   the nature of the subject, I hope the volume may fulfil yet another and
   kindred purpose. Although it does not profess to be a Handbook of
   Biblical Antiquities, nor a treatise on the types of the Old Testament,
   both these subjects had to be constantly referred to. But to realise
   the gorgeous Temple ritual, in all its details, possesses more than a
   merely historical interest. We are indeed fascinated by it; we live
   over again, if not the period of Israel's temporal glory, yet that of
   deepest interest to us; and we can vividly represent to ourselves what
   the Temple had been before its services had for ever passed away. But
   beyond this, stretching far back through the period of prophets and
   kings, and reaching up to the original revelation of Jehovah amid the
   awful grandeur of Sinai, our holiest recollections, and the very
   springs of our religious life rise among these ordinances and types,
   which we here see fully developed and carried out, and that under the
   very light of His Presence, to Whom they all had pointed. I say not,
   whether or how far later Jewish practice may have misapprehended the
   original import or the meaning of the Divine ordinances. That was
   beyond my present task. But an accurate acquaintance with the
   sacrificial services at the time of Christ must not only tend to
   correct mistakes, but throw a fresh and vivid light upon all, and
   influence our views of what the Levitical ordinances were intended to
   be and to teach.

   To have thus stated my object in this book, is also to have indicated
   its difficulties. Yet abundant materials for such a work, though
   scattered far and wide, are within our reach. Not to speak of
   contemporary writings, as those of Josephus and Philo, and references
   in the New Testament itself, we have in the Mishnah a body of
   authoritative traditions, reaching up, not only to Temple-times, but
   even to the days of Jesus Christ. [1] On this source of information, of
   course in conjunction with the Old Testament itself, I have been
   chiefly dependent.

   While thus deriving my materials at first hand, I have also thankfully
   made use of any and every help within my reach. Foremost I place here
   the writings of Maimonides, not only because he is of greatest
   authority among the Jews, but because his vast and accurate knowledge
   of these subjects, and the clearness and subtlety of his intellect,
   entitle him to that position. Next to him come the numerous writers on
   Biblical Antiquities, in Latin and German; works on
   Typology--scientific and popular; treatises on the Life and Times of
   our Lord; histories of the Jewish Nation, or of Judaism; commentaries
   on such passages in the Old and New Testament as bore on these
   subjects; and numerous treatises on cognate points. In my study of
   ancient Jerusalem, I had the benefit of the labours of recent
   explorers, from Robinson and Barclay to the volumes published under the
   auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund.

   To the Cyclopaedias of Winer, Herzog, Ersch and Gruber, Dr. Smith, and
   Kitto (the third edition), I have been greatly indebted. The last-named
   of these works has the special merit of a series of articles on Jewish
   subjects (as I may designate them), written in quite an original
   manner, and with most competent knowledge. Although, as will appear
   from the text, I have been obliged frequently to differ from their
   writer, yet these articles must, from the fulness and ability of their
   treatment, be of very great use to the student. Lightfoot's Horae
   Hebraicae et Talmudicae are known to every scholar. Not so, perhaps,
   his small learned treatise De ministerio templi. The title and many of
   the subjects are similar to those treated in the present volume. But
   the learned reader will at once perceive that the plan and execution
   are quite different, though the work has been of great service to me.
   Perhaps I ought not here to omit such names as Relandus, Buxtorf, Otho,
   Schottgen, Meuschen, Goodwin, Hottinger, Wagenseil, and Lundius; and,
   among modern writers, Bahr, Keil, Kurtz, de Wette, Saalschutz, Zunz,
   Jost, Geiger, Herzfeld, and Fratz, of whose works I have, I may say,
   constantly availed myself. Many others have been consulted, some of
   which are quoted in the foot-notes, while others are not expressly
   referred to, as not adding anything material to our knowledge.

   In general, I should explain, that I have acted on the principle of
   giving the minimum of references possible. It would have been easy to
   have multiplied them almost indefinitely. But I wished to avoid
   cumbering my pages with an array of authorities, which too often give a
   mere appearance of learning; and, while they are not needed by
   scholars, may tend to interfere with the more general and popular use
   of such a work. For a similar reason, I have throughout avoided the use
   of Hebrew and even Greek letter-press. To print an expression in Hebrew
   letters could not be necessary for students, while the general reader,
   whom it too often bewilders by a show of knowledge, must in such case
   necessarily pass it over, unnoticed and unknown.

   While this book embodies the studies of many years, I have during its
   actual composition deemed no labour nor pains irksome in comparing the
   results of my own investigations with those of all, within reach, who
   were entitled to such consideration. Thus much for the matter of the
   book. As to its form, some subjects may be touched in it which do not
   equally interest all readers; [2] others may appear to have been
   treated with too little or else with too much detail; objections may be
   raised to interpretations of types, or even to the general view of the
   Old Testament which has been taken throughout. My aim has been to make
   the book as complete and generally useful as I could, and clearly to
   express my convictions as to the meaning of the Old Testament. But on
   one point especially I would wish to be quite explicit. At the close of
   these studies, I would say, with humble and heartfelt thankfulness,
   that step by step my Christian faith has only been strengthened by
   them, that, as I proceeded, the conviction has always been deepened
   that Christ is indeed the end of the Law for righteousness,' to Whom
   all the ordinances of the Old Testament had pointed, and in Whom alone,
   alike the people and the history of Israel find their meaning. Viewed
   in this light, the Temple-services are not so many strange or isolated
   rites, for the origin of which we must look among neighbouring nations,
   or in the tendencies natural to men during the infancy of their
   history. Rather, all now becomes one connected whole--the design and
   execution bearing even stronger evidence to its Divine authorship than
   other of God's works, --where every part fits into the other, and each
   and all point with unswerving steadfastness to Him in Whom the love of
   God was fully manifested, and its purposes towards the world entirely
   carried out. From first to last, the two dispensations are
   substantially one; Jehovah, the God of Israel, is also the God and
   Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ--Novum Testamentum in
   Vetere latet; Vetus in Novo patet.

   [1] Quite a different estimate must be formed of the Gemara (which in a
   general way may be described as a twofold commentary--the Jerusalem and
   Babylonian Gemara--upon the Mishnah), not only from its much later
   date, but also from the strange and heterogeneous congeries which are
   found in the many folios of the Talmud. Judaism was, at the time of its
   compilation, already thoroughly ossified; and the trustworthiness of
   tradition greatly impaired not merely by the long interval of time that
   had elapsed, but by dogmatic predilections and prejudices, and by the
   not unnatural wish to foist comparatively recent views, practices, and
   prayers upon Temple-times. Indeed, the work wants in its greatest part
   even the local colouring of the Mishnah--an element of such importance
   in Eastern traditions, where, so to speak, the colours are so fast,
   that, for example, to this day the modern Arab designations of places
   and localities have preserved the original Palestinian names, and not
   those more recent Greek or Roman with which successive conquerors had
   overlaid them.

   [2] Thus Chapters 1 and 2, which give a description of ancient
   Jerusalem and of the structure and arrangements of the Temple, may not
   interest some readers, yet it could neither be left out, nor put in a
   different part of the book. Those for whom this subject has no
   attractions may, therefore, begin with Chapter 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 1

  A First View of Jerusalem, and of the Temple

   And when He was come near, He beheld the city, and wept over it.'
   Luke 19:41

    The Charm of Jerusalem

   In every age, the memory of Jerusalem has stirred the deepest feelings.
   Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans turn to it with reverent affection.
   It almost seems as if in some sense each could call it his happy home,'
   the name ever dear' to him. For our holiest thoughts of the past, and
   our happiest hopes for the future, connect themselves with the city of
   our God.' We know from many passages of the Old Testament, but
   especially from the Book of Psalms, with what ardent longing the exiles
   from Palestine looked towards it; and during the long centuries of
   dispersion and cruel persecution, up to this day, the same aspirations
   have breathed in almost every service of the synagogue, and in none
   more earnestly than in that of the paschal night, which to us is for
   ever associated with the death of our Saviour. It is this one grand
   presence there of the Desire of all nations,' which has for ever cast a
   hallowed light round Jerusalem and the Temple, and given fulfillment to
   the prophecy--'Many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up
   to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He
   will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths: for out of
   Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.'
   (Isa 2:3) His feet have trodden the busy streets of Jerusalem, and the
   shady recesses of the Mount of Olives; His figure has filled with
   glory' the Temple and its services; His person has given meaning to the
   land and the people; and the decease which He accomplished at Jerusalem
   has been for the life of all nations. These facts can never be
   past--they are eternally present; not only to our faith, but also to
   our hope; for He shall so come in like manner' as the men of Galilee'
   had on Mount Olivet seen Him go into heaven.'

    Ancient Memories

   But our memories of Jerusalem stretch far back beyond these scenes. In
   the distance of a remote antiquity we read of Melchisedek, the typical
   priest-king of Salem, who went out to meet Abraham, the ancestor of the
   Hebrew race, and blessed him. A little later, and this same Abraham was
   coming up from Hebron on his mournful journey, to offer up his only
   son. A few miles south of the city, the road by which he travelled
   climbs the top of a high promontory, that juts into the deep Kedron
   valley. From this spot, through the cleft of the mountains which the
   Kedron has made for its course, one object rose up straight before him.
   It was Moriah, the mount on which the sacrifice of Isaac was to be
   offered. Here Solomon afterwards built the Temple. For over Mount
   Moriah David had seen the hand of the destroying angel stayed, probably
   just above where afterwards from the large altar of burnt-offering the
   smoke of countless sacrifices rose day by day. On the opposite hill of
   Zion, separated only by a ravine from Moriah, stood the city and the
   palace of David, and close by the site of the Temple the tower of
   David. After that period an ever-shifting historical panorama passes
   before our view, unchanged only in this, that, amidst all the varying
   events, Jerusalem remains the one centre of interest and attractions,
   till we come to that Presence which has made it, even in its
   desolateness, Hephzibah,' sought out,' a city not forsaken.' (Isa 62:4)

    Origin of the Name

   The Rabbis have a curious conceit about the origin of the name
   Jerusalem, which is commonly taken to mean, the foundation,' the
   abode,' or the inheritance of peace.' They make it a compound of Jireh
   and Shalem, and say that Abraham called it Jehovah-Jireh,' while Shem
   had named it Shalem, but that God combined the two into Jireh-Shalem,
   Jerushalaim, or Jerusalem. There was certainly something peculiar in
   the choice of Palestine to be the country of the chosen people, as well
   as of Jerusalem to be its capital. The political importance of the land
   must be judged from its situation rather than its size. Lying midway
   between the east and the west, and placed between the great military
   monarchies, first of Egypt and Assyria, and then of Rome and the East,
   it naturally became the battle-field of the nations and the highway of
   the world. As for Jerusalem, its situation was entirely unique. Pitched
   on a height of about 2, 610 feet above the level of the sea, its
   climate was more healthy, equable, and temperate than that of any other
   part of the country. From the top of Mount Olivet an unrivalled view of
   the most interesting localities in the land might be obtained. To the
   east the eye would wander over the intervening plains to Jericho, mark
   the tortuous windings of Jordan, and the sullen grey of the Dead Sea,
   finally resting on Pisgah and the mountains of Moab and Ammon. To the
   south, you might see beyond the king's gardens,' as far as the grey
   tops of the hill country of Judea.' Westwards, the view would be
   arrested by the mountains of Bether, (Song 2:17) whilst the haze in the
   distant horizon marked the line of the Great Sea. To the north, such
   well-known localities met the eye as Mizpeh, Gibeon, Ajalon, Michmash,
   Ramah, and Anathoth. But, above all, just at your feet, the Holy City
   would lie in all her magnificence, like a bride adorned for her
   husband.'

    The Situation of Jerusalem

   Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, on
   the sides of the north, the city of the Great King. . . . Walk about
   Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof. Mark ye well her
   bulwarks, consider her palaces.' If this could be said of Jerusalem
   even in the humbler days of her native monarchy, (Psa 48:2, 12, 13) it
   was emphatically true at the time when Jesus beheld the city,' after
   Herod the Great had adorned it with his wonted splendour. As the
   pilgrim bands came up' from all parts of the country to the great
   feasts, they must have stood enthralled when its beauty first burst
   upon their gaze. Not merely remembrances of the past, or the sacred
   associations connected with the present, but the grandeur of the scene
   before them must have kindled their admiration into enthusiasm. For
   Jerusalem was a city of palaces, and right royally enthroned as none
   other. Placed on an eminence higher than the immediate neighbourhood,
   it was cut off and isolated by deep valleys on all sides but one,
   giving it the appearance of an immense natural fortress. All round it,
   on three sides, like a natural fosse, ran the deep ravines of the
   Valley of Hinnom and of the Black Valley, or Kedron, which merged to
   the south of the city, descending in such steep declivity that where
   the two meet is 670 feet below the point whence each had started. Only
   on the north-west was the city, as it were, bound to the mainland. And
   as if to give it yet more the character of a series of
   fortress-islands, a deep natural cleft--the Tyropoeon--ran south and
   north right through the middle of the city, then turned sharply
   westwards, separating Mount Zion from Mount Acra. Similarly, Acra was
   divided from Mount Moriah, and the latter again by an artificial valley
   from Bezetha, or the New Town. Sheer up from these encircling ravines
   rose the city of marble and cedar-covered palaces. Up that middle
   cleft, down in the valley, and along the slopes of the hills, crept the
   busy town, with its streets, markets, and bazaars. But alone, and
   isolated in its grandeur, stood the Temple Mount. Terrace upon terrace
   its courts rose, till, high above the city, within the enclosure of
   marble cloisters, cedar-roofed and richly ornamented, the Temple itself
   stood out a mass of snowy marble and of gold, glittering in the
   sunlight against the half-encircling green background of Olivet. In all
   his wanderings the Jew had not seen a city like his own Jerusalem. Not
   Antioch in Asia, not even imperial Rome herself, excelled it in
   architectural splendour. Nor has there been, either in ancient or
   modern times, a sacred building equal to the Temple, whether for
   situation or magnificence; nor yet have there been festive throngs like
   those joyous hundreds of thousands who, with their hymns of praise,
   crowded towards the city on the eve of a Passover. No wonder that the
   song burst from the lips of those pilgrims:


   Still stand our feet

   Within thy gates, Jerusalem!

   Jerusalem, ah! thou art built

   As a city joined companion-like together.'

   Psalm 122:2, 3

   From whatever side the pilgrim might approach the city, the first
   impression must have been solemn and deep. But a special surprise
   awaited those who came, whether from Jericho or from Galilee, by the
   well-known road that led over the Mount of Olives. From the south,
   beyond royal Bethlehem--from the west, descending over the heights of
   Beth-horon--or from the north, journeying along the mountains of
   Ephraim, they would have seen the city first vaguely looming in the
   grey distance, till, gradually approaching, they had become familiar
   with its outlines. It was far otherwise from the east. A turn in the
   road, and the city, hitherto entirely hid from view, would burst upon
   them suddenly, closely, and to most marked advantage. It was by this
   road Jesus made His triumphal entry from Bethany on the week of His
   Passion. Up from the house of dates' the broad, rough road would round
   the shoulder of Olivet. Thither the wondering crowd from Bethany
   followed Him, and there the praising multitude from the city met Him.
   They had come up that same Olivet, so familiar to them all. For did it
   not seem almost to form part of the city itself, shutting it off like a
   screen from the desert land that descended beyond to Jordan and the
   Dead Sea?

  Mount of Olives

   From the Temple Mount to the western base of Olivet, it was not more
   than 100 or 200 yards straight across, though, of course, the distance
   to the summit was much greater, say about half a mile. By the nearest
   pathway it was only 918 yards from the city gate to the principal
   summit. [3]

   Olivet was always fresh and green, even in earliest spring or during
   parched summer--the coolest, the pleasantest, the most sheltered walk
   about Jerusalem. For across this road the Temple and its mountain flung
   their broad shadows, and luxuriant foliage spread a leafy canopy
   overhead. They were not gardens, in the ordinary Western sense, through
   which one passed, far less orchards; but something peculiar to those
   climes, where Nature everywhere strews with lavish hand her flowers,
   and makes her gardens--where the garden bursts into the orchard, and
   the orchard stretches into the field, till, high up, olive and fig
   mingle with the darker cypress and pine. The stony road up Olivet wound
   along terraces covered with olives, whose silver and dark green leaves
   rustled in the breeze. Here gigantic gnarled fig-trees twisted
   themselves out of rocky soil; there clusters of palms raised their
   knotty stems high up into waving plumed tufts, or spread, bush-like,
   from the ground, the rich-coloured fruit bursting in clusters from the
   pod. Then there were groves of myrtle, pines, tall, stately cypresses,
   and on the summit itself two gigantic cedars. To these shady retreats
   the inhabitants would often come from Jerusalem to take pleasure or to
   meditate, and there one of their most celebrated Rabbis was at one time
   wont in preference to teach. [4] Thither, also, Christ with His
   disciples often resorted.

   Coming from Bethany the city would be for some time completely hidden
   from view by the intervening ridge of Olivet. But a sudden turn of the
   road, where the descent of the Mount of Olives' begins, all at once a
   first glimpse of Jerusalem is caught, and that quite close at hand.
   True, the configuration of Olivet on the right would still hide the
   Temple and most part of the city; but across Ophel, the busy suburb of
   the priests, the eye might range to Mount Zion, and rapidly climb its
   height to where Herod's palace covered the site once occupied by that
   of David. A few intervening steps of descent, where the view of the
   city has again been lost, and the pilgrim would hurry on to that ledge
   of rock. What a panorama over which to roam with hungry eagerness! At
   one glance he would see before him the whole city--its valleys and
   hills, its walls and towers, its palaces and streets, and its
   magnificent Temple--almost like a vision from another world. There
   could be no difficulty in making out the general features of the scene.
   Altogether the city was only thirty-three stadia, or about four English
   miles, in circumference. Within this compass dwelt a population of
   600,000 (according to Tacitus), but, according to the Jewish historian,
   amounting at the time of the Passover to between two and three
   millions, or about equal to that of London. [5]

    The Walls

   The first feature to attract attention would be the city walls, at the
   time of Christ only two in number. [6]

   The first, or old wall, began at the north-western angle of Zion, at
   the tower of Hippicus, and ran along the northern brow of Zion, where
   it crossed the cleft, and joined the western colonnade of the Temple at
   the Council-house.' It also enclosed Zion along the west and the south,
   and was continued eastward around Ophel, till it merged in the
   south-eastern angle of the Temple. Thus the first wall would defend
   Zion, Ophel, and, along with the Temple walls, , Moriah also. The
   second wall, which commenced at a gate in the first wall, called
   Gennath,' ran first north, and then east, so as to enclose Acra, and
   terminated at the Tower of Antonia. Thus the whole of the old city and
   the Temple was sufficiently protected.

    Tower of Antonia

   The Tower of Antonia was placed at the north-western angle of the
   Temple, midway between the castle of the same name and the Temple. With
   the former it communicated by a double set of cloisters, with the
   latter by a subterranean passage into the Temple itself, and also by
   cloisters and stairs descending into the northern and the western
   porches of the Court of the Gentiles. Some of the most glorious
   traditions in Jewish history were connected with this castle, for there
   had been the ancient armoury of David,' the palace of Hezekiah and of
   Nehemiah, and the fortress of the Maccabees. But in the days of Christ
   Antonia was occupied by a hated Roman garrison, which kept watch over
   Israel, even in its sanctuary. In fact, the Tower of Antonia overlooked
   and commanded the Temple, so that a detachment of soldiers could at any
   time rush down to quell a riot, as on the occasion when the Jews had
   almost killed Paul (Acts 21:31). The city walls were further defended
   by towers--sixty in the first, and forty in the second wall. Most
   prominent among them were Hippicus, Phasaelus, and Mariamne, close by
   each other, to the north-west of Zion--all compactly built of immense
   marble blocks, square, strongly fortified, and surmounted by buildings
   defended by battlements and turrets. [7] They were built by Herod, and
   named after the friend and the brother he had lost in battle, and the
   wife whom his jealousy had killed.

    The Four Hills

   If the pilgrim scanned the city more closely, he would observe that it
   was built on four hills. Of these, the western, or ancient Zion, was
   the highest, rising about 200 feet above Moriah, though still 100 feet
   lower than the Mount of Olives. To the north and the east, opposite
   Zion, and divided from it by the deep Tyropoeon Valley, were the
   crescent-shaped Acra and Moriah, the latter with Ophel as its southern
   outrunner. Up and down the slopes of Acra the Lower City crept.
   Finally, the fourth hill, Bezetha (from bezaion, marshy ground), the
   New Town, rose north of the Temple Mount and of Acra, and was separated
   from them by an artificial valley. The streets, which, as in all
   Eastern cities, were narrow, were paved with white marble. A somewhat
   elevated footway ran along for the use of those who had newly been
   purified in the Temple, while the rest walked in the roadway below. The
   streets derived their names mostly from the gates to which they led, or
   from the various bazaars. Thus there were Water-street,' Fish-street,'
   East-street,' etc. The Timber Bazaar' and that of the Tailors' were in
   the New City; the Grand Upper Market on Mount Zion. Then there were the
   Wool' and the Braziers' Bazaar'; Baker-street,' Butcher-street,'
   Strangers'-street,' and many others similarly named. Nor would it have
   been difficult to identify the most prominent buildings in the city. At
   the north-western angle of Mount Zion, the ancient Salem and Jebus, on
   the site of the castle of David, was the grand palace of Herod,
   generally occupied by the Roman procurators during their temporary
   sojourn in Jerusalem. It stood high up, just within shelter of the
   great towers which Herod had reared--a marvel of splendour, of whose
   extent, strength, height, rooms, towers, roofs, porticoes, courts, and
   adjacent gardens Josephus speaks in such terms of admiration.

    High-priest's Palace

   At the opposite, or north-eastern corner of Mount Zion, was the palace
   of the High-priest. Being built on the slope of the hill, there was
   under the principal apartments a lower story, with a porch in front, so
   that we can understand how on that eventful night Peter was beneath in
   the palace.' (Mark 14:66) Beyond it, probably on the slope of Acra, was
   the Repository of the Archives, and on the other side of the cleft,
   abutting on the Temple, with which it was probably connected by a
   colonnade, the Council Chamber of the Sanhedrim. Following the eastern
   brow of Mount Zion, south of the High-priest's palace, and opposite the
   Temple, was the immense Xystus, which probably extended into the
   Tyropoeon. Whatever may have been its original purpose, [8] it was
   afterwards used as a place of public meetings, where, on great
   occasions, the populace was harangued.

   Here Peter probably addressed the three thousand converts on the day of
   Pentecost when the multitude had hurried thither from the Temple on
   hearing the mighty rushing sound.' The Xystus was surrounded by a
   covered colonnade. Behind it was the palace of Agrippa, the ancient
   palace of David and of the Maccabees, and again, in the rear of it,
   that of Bernice. On Acra stood afterwards the palaces of certain
   foreign princes, such as those of Queen Helena, King Monobasus, and
   other proselytes. In this quarter, or even beyond it to the north-west,
   one would naturally look for the Theatre and the Amphitheatre, which,
   being so essentially un-Jewish, must have been located as far as
   possible from the Temple. The space around the Temple was no doubt kept
   clear of buildings. On the south-eastern corner behind it was the great
   Sheep Market, and to the south of it the Hippodrome. Originally, the
   king's house by the horse-gate, built by Solomon, and the royal
   stables, had occupied the southern area of the Temple Mount, where
   Herod afterwards built the Royal Porch.' For the Temple of Solomon was
   300 feet shorter, from north to south, than that of Herod.
   Transversely, between Xystus and the Fish Gate, lay the quarter of
   Maktesh, (Zeph 1:10, 11) occupied by various bazaars, chiefly connected
   with the Temple. Lastly, south of the Temple, but on the same hill, was
   Ophel, the crowded suburb of the priests.

    The Shushan Gate

   Such must have been a first view of Jerusalem, as beheld' from the
   Mount of Olives, on which we are supposed to have taken our stand. If
   Jewish tradition on the subject may be trusted, a gate opened upon this
   Mount of Olives through the eastern wall of the Temple. [9]

   It is called the Shushan Gate,' from the sculptured representation over
   it of the city to which so many Jewish memories attached. From this
   gate an arched roadway, by which the priests brought out the red
   heifer,' and on the Day of Atonement the scapegoat, is said to have
   conducted to the Mount of Olives. Near the spot where the red heifer
   was burned were extensive lavatories, and booths for the sale of
   articles needed for various purifications. Up a crest, on one of the
   most commanding elevations, was the Lunar Station, whence, by fire
   signals, the advent of each new moon was telegraphed from hill to hill
   into far countries. If Jewish tradition may further be trusted, there
   was also an unused gate in the Temple towards the north--Tedit or
   Tere--and two gates towards the south. We know for certain of only a
   subterranean passage which led from the fortress Antonia on the
   north-western angle' of the Temple into the Temple Court, and of the
   cloisters with stairs descending into the porches, by one of which the
   chief captain Lysias rushed to the rescue of Paul, when nearly killed
   by the infuriated multitude. Dismissing all doubtful questions, we are
   sure that at any rate five gates opened into the outer Temple enclosure
   or Court of the Gentiles--one from the south, and four--and these the
   principal--from the west. That southern gate was double, and must have
   chiefly served the convenience of the priests. Coming from Ophel, they
   would pass through its gigantic archway and vestibule (40 feet each
   way), and then by a double tunnel nearly 200 feet long, whence they
   emerged at a flight of steps leading straight up from the Court of the
   Gentiles into that of the priests, close to the spot where they would
   officiate. [10]

   But to join the great crowd of worshippers we have to enter the city
   itself. Turning our back on Mount Zion, we now face eastwards to Mount
   Moriah. Though we look towards the four principal entrances to the
   Temple, yet what we see within those walls on the highest of the
   terraces is not the front but the back of the sanctuary. It is curious
   how tradition is here in the most palpable error in turning to the east
   in worship. The Holy Place itself faced east-wards, and was approached
   from the east; but most assuredly the ministering priests and the
   worshippers looked not towards the east, but towards the west.

    The Temple Plateau

   The Temple plateau had been artificially levelled at immense labour and
   cost, and enlarged by gigantic substructures. The latter served also
   partly for the purpose of purification, as otherwise there might have
   been some dead body beneath, which, however great the distance from the
   surface, would, unless air had intervened, have, according to
   tradition, defiled the whole place above. As enlarged by Herod the
   Great, the Temple area occupied an elongated square of from 925 to 950
   feet and upwards. [11]

   Roughly calculating it at about 1,000 feet, this would give an extent
   more than one-half greater than the length of St. Peter's at Rome,
   which measures 613 feet, and nearly double our own St. Paul's, whose
   extreme length is 520 1/2 feet. And then we must bear in mind that the
   Temple plateau was not merely about 1,000 feet in length, but a square
   of nearly 1,000 feet! It was not, however, in the centre of this
   square, but towards the north-west, that the Temple itself and its
   special courts were placed. Nor, as already hinted, were they all on a
   level, but rose terrace upon terrace, till the sacred edifice itself
   was reached, its porch protruding, shoulder-like,' on either
   side--perhaps rising into two flanking towers--and covering the Holy
   and Most Holy Places. Thus must the golden fane' have been clearly
   visible from all parts; the smoke of its sacrifices slowly curling up
   against the blue Eastern sky, and the music of its services wafted
   across the busy city, while the sunlight glittered on its gilt roofs,
   or shone from its pavement of tesselated marble, or threw great shadows
   on Olivet behind.

    Fables of the Rabbis

   Assuredly, when the Rabbis thought of their city in her glory, they
   might well say: The world is like unto an eye. The ocean surrounding
   the world is the white of the eye; its black is the world itself; the
   pupil is Jerusalem; but the image within the pupil is the sanctuary.'
   In their sorrow and loneliness they have written many fabled things of
   Jerusalem, of which some may here find a place, to show with what halo
   of reverence they surrounded the loving memories of the past.
   Jerusalem, they say, belonged to no tribe in particular--it was all
   Israel's. And this is in great measure literally true; for even
   afterwards, when ancient Jebus became the capital of the land, the
   boundary line between Judah and Benjamin ran right through the middle
   of the city and of the Temple; so that, according to Jewish tradition,
   the porch and the sanctuary itself were in Benjamin, and the Temple
   courts and altar in Judah. In Jerusalem no house might be hired. The
   houses belonged as it were to all; for they must all be thrown open, in
   free-hearted hospitality, to the pilgrim-brethren that came up to the
   feast. Never had any one failed to find in Jerusalem the means of
   celebrating the paschal festivities, nor yet had any lacked a bed on
   which to rest. Never did serpent or scorpion hurt within her precincts;
   never did fire desolate her streets, nor ruin occur. No ban ever rested
   on the Holy City. It was Levitically more sacred than other cities,
   since there alone the paschal lamb, the thank-offerings, and the second
   tithes might be eaten. Hence they carefully guarded against all
   possibility of pollution. No dead body might remain in the city
   overnight; no sepulchres were there, except those of the house of David
   and of the prophetess Huldah. No even domestic fowls might be kept, nor
   vegetable gardens be planted, lest the smell of decaying vegetation
   should defile the air; nor yet furnaces be built, for fear of smoke.
   Never had adverse acident interrupted the services of the sanctuary,
   nor profaned the offerings. Never had rain extinguished the fire on the
   altar, nor contrary wind driven back the smoke of the sacrifices; nor
   yet, however great the crowd of worshipperes, had any failed for room
   to bow down and worship the God of Israel!

   Thus far the Rabbis. All the more impressive is their own admission and
   their lament--so significant as viewed in the light of the Gospel: For
   three years and a half abode the Shechinah' (or visible Divine
   presence) on the Mount of Olives,'--waiting whether Israel would
   repent--'and calling upon them, "Seek ye the Lord while He may be
   found, call upon Him while He is near." And when all was in vain, then
   the Shechinah returned to its own place!'

    Jerusalem in Ruins

   The Shechinah has withdrawn to its own place! Both the city and the
   Temple have been laid even with the ground,' because Jerusalem knew not
   the time of her visitation (Luke 19:44). They have laid Jerusalem on
   heaps' (Psalm 79:1). The stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the
   top of every street' (Lam 4:1). All this, and much more, did the
   Saviour, the rightful King of Israel, see in the near future, when He
   beheld the city, and wept over it.' And now we must search very deep
   down, sinking the shaft from 60 to over 125 feet through the rubbish of
   accumulated ruins, before reaching at last the ancient foundations. And
   there, close by where once the royal bridge spanned the deep chasm and
   led from the City of David into the royal porch of the Temple, is the
   Jews' Wailing Place,' where the mourning heirs to all this desolation
   reverently embrace the fallen stones, and weep unavailing
   tears--unavailing because the present is as the past, and because what
   brought that judgment and sorrow is unrecognised, unrepented,
   unremoved. Yet--'Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the
   night? The watchman said, The morning cometh and also the night. If ye
   will inquire, inquire! Return, come!'

   [3] By the longer footpath it is 1,310 yards, and by the main camel
   road perhaps a little farther.' Josephus calculates the distance from
   the city evidently to the top of Mount Olivet at 1,010 yards, or 5
   furlongs. See City of the Great King, p. 59.

   [5] Mr. Fergusson, in Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, i. p. 1025,
   controverts these numbers, on the ground of the population of modern
   cities within a given area. But two millions represent not the ordinary
   population, only the festive throngs at the Passover. Taking into
   consideration Eastern habits--the sleeping on the roof, and possibly
   the camping out--the computation is not extravagant. Besides, however
   untruthful Josephus was, he may, as a general rule, be trusted where
   official numbers, capable of verification, are concerned. In fact,
   taking into account this extraordinary influx, the Rabbis distinctly
   state, that during the feasts--except on the first night--the people
   might camp outside Jerusalem, but within the limits of a sabbath-day's
   journey. This, as Otho well remarks (Lex. Rabb. p. 195), also explains
   how, on such occasions, our Lord so often retired to the Mount of
   Olives.

   [6] The third, largest, and strongest wall, which enclosed Bezetha, or
   the New Town, was built by Herod Agrippa, twelve years after the date
   of the crucifixion.

   [8] Barclay suggest that the Xystus had originally been the heathen
   gymnasium built by the infamous high-priest Jason. (City of the Great
   King, p. 101)

   [9] In the chamber above this gate two standard measures were kept,
   avowedly for the use of the workmen employed in the Temple. (Chel. 17.
   9.)

   [10] Jewish tradition mentions the following five as the outer gates of
   the Temple: that of Shushan to the east, of Tedi to the north, of
   Copponus to the west, and the two Huldah gates to the south. The
   Shushan gate was said to have been lower than the others, so that the
   priests at the end of the heifer-bridge' might look over it into the
   Temple. In a chamber above the Shushan gate, the standard measures of
   the cubit' were kept.

   [11] Many modern writers have computed the Temple area at only 606
   feet, while Jewish authorities make it much larger than we have stated
   it. The computation in the text is based on the latest and most
   trustworthy investigations, and fully borne out by the excavations made
   on the spot by Capts. Wilson and Warren.

Chapter 2

  Within the Holy Place

   There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be
   thrown down.'--Matthew 24:2

    The Royal Bridge'

   Of the four principal entrances into the Temple--all of them from the
   west--the most northerly descended, perhaps by flights of steps, into
   the Lower City; while two others led into the suburb, or Parbar, as it
   is called. But by far the most magnificent avenue was that at the
   south-western angle of the Temple. Probably this was the ascent . . .
   into the house of the Lord,' which so astounded the Queen of Sheba (1
   Kings 10:5) [12]

   It would, indeed, be difficult to exaggerate the splendour of this
   approach. A colossal bridge on arches spanned the intervening Valley of
   the Tyropoeon, connecting the ancient City of David with what is called
   the Royal Porch of the Temple.' From its ruins we can reconstruct this
   bridge. Each arch spanned 41 1/2 feet, and the spring-stones measured
   24 feet in length by 6 in thickness. It is almost impossible to realise
   these proportions, except by a comparison with other buildings. A
   single stone 24 feet long! Yet these were by no means the largest in
   the masonry of the Temple. Both at the south-eastern and the
   south-western angles stones have been found measuring from 20 to 40
   feet in length, and weighing above 100 tons.

    The Temple Porches

   The view from this Royal Bridge' must have been splendid. It was over
   it that they led the Saviour, in sight of all Jerusalem, to and from
   the palace of the high-priest, that of Herod, the meeting-place of the
   Sanhedrim, and the judgment-seat of Pilate. Here the city would have
   lain spread before us like a map. Beyond it the eye would wander over
   straggling suburbs, orchards, and many gardens--fairest among them the
   royal gardens to the south, the garden of roses,' so celebrated by the
   Rabbis--till the horizon was bounded by the hazy outline of mountains
   in the distance. Over the parapet of the bridge we might have looked
   into the Tyropoeon Valley below, a depth of not less than 225 feet. The
   roadway which spanned this cleft for a distance of 354 feet, from Mount
   Moriah to Mount Zion opposite, was 50 feet broad, that is, about 5 feet
   wider than the central avenue of the Royal Temple-Porch into which it
   led. These porches,' as they are called in the New Testament, or
   cloisters, were among the finest architectural features of the Temple.
   They ran all round the inside of its wall, and bounded the outer
   enclosure of the Court of the Gentiles. They consisted of double rows
   of Corinthian pillars, all monoliths, wholly cut out of one block of
   marble, each pillar being 37 1/2 feet high. A flat roof, richly
   ornamented, rested against the wall, in which also the outer row of
   pillars was inserted. Possibly there may have been towers where one
   colonnade joined the other. But the Royal Porch,' by which we are
   supposed to have entered the Temple, was the most splendid, consisting
   not as the others, of a double, but of a treble colonnade, formed of
   162 pillars, ranged in four rows of 40 pillars each, the two odd
   pillars serving as a kind of screen, where the Porch' opened upon the
   bridge. Indeed, we may regard the Royal Porch as consisting of a
   central nave 45 feet wide, with gigantic pillars 100 feet high, and of
   two aisles 30 feet wide, with pillars 50 feet high. By very competent
   authorities this Royal Porch, as its name indicates, is regarded as
   occupying the site of the ancient palace of Solomon, to which he
   brought up' the daughter of Pharaoh. Here also had been the stables of
   Solomon.' When Herod the Great rebuilt the Temple, he incorporated with
   it this site of the ancient royal palace. What the splendour and height
   (Professor Porter has calculated it at 440 feet) of this one porch in
   the Temple must have been is best expressed in the words of Captain
   Wilson (Recovery of Jerusalem, p. 9): It is almost impossible to
   realise the effect which would be produced by a building longer and
   higher than York Cathedral, standing on a solid mass of masonry almost
   equal in height to the tallest of our church spires.' And this was only
   one of the porches which formed the southern enclosure of the first and
   outermost court of the Temple--that of the Gentiles. The view from the
   top of this colonnade into Kedron was to the stupendous depth of 450
   feet. Here some have placed that pinnacle of the Temple to which the
   tempter brought our Saviour.

   These halls or porches around the Court of the Gentiles must have been
   most convenient places for friendly or religious intercourse--for
   meetings or discussions. Here Jesus, when still a child, was found by
   His parents disputing with the doctors; here He afterwards so often
   taught the people; and here the first assemblies of the Christians must
   have taken place when, continuing daily with one accord in the Temple,
   . . . praising God, and having favour with all the people, . . . the
   Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.' Especially do
   we revert to Solomon's Porch, that ran along the eastern wall of the
   Temple, and faced its great entrance. It was the only remnant left of
   the Temple built by the wise King of Israel. In this porch Jesus
   walked' on that Feast of the Dedication,' (John 10:23) when He told it
   plainly,' I and my Father are one'; and it was thither that all the
   people ran together' when the notable miracle' on the lame man had been
   wrought at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple.'

    Court of the Gentiles

   It was the rule when entering the Temple to pass in by the right, and
   when leaving it to go out by the left hand. The great Court of the
   Gentiles, [13] which formed the lowest or outer enclosure of the
   Sanctuary, was paved with the finest variegated marble.

   According to Jewish tradition, it formed a square of 750 feet. Its name
   is derived from the fact that it was open to all--Jews or
   Gentiles--provided they observed the prescribed rules of decorum and
   reverence. In this court tradition places eating and sleeping
   apartments for the Levites, and a synagogue. But, despite pharisaic
   punctilliousness, the noise, especially on the eve of the Passover,
   must have been most disturbing. For there the oxen, sheep, and doves
   selected as fit for sacrifices were sold as in a market; and here were
   those tables of the money-changers which the Lord overthrew when He
   drove from His Father's house them that bought and sold (Matt 21:12;
   John 2:14). Within a short distance, in the court, a marble screen 4
   1/2 feet high, and beautifully ornamented, bore Greek and Latin
   inscriptions, warning Gentiles not to proceed, on pain of death. One of
   those very tablets, bearing almost the same words as those given by
   Josephus, has been discovered in late excavations. It was because they
   thought Paul had infringed this order, that the infuriated multitude
   went about to kill him' (Acts 21:31). Beyond this enclosure a flight of
   fourteen steps, each 9 inches high, led up to a terrace 15 feet broad,
   called the Chel,' which bounded the inner wall of the Temple. We are
   now approaching the Sanctuary itself, which consisted, first, of three
   courts, each higher than the former, and, beyond them, of the Holy and
   Most Holy Places, with their outbuildings. Entering by the principal
   gate on the east we pass, first into the Court of the Women, thence
   into that of Israel, and from the latter into that of the Priests. This
   would have been, so to speak, the natural way of advancing. But there
   was a nearer road into the Court of the Priests. For both north and
   south, along the terrace, flights of steps led up to three gates (both
   north and south), which opened into the Court of the Priests, while a
   fourth gate (north and south) led into the middle of the Court of the
   Women. Thus there were nine gates opening from the Terrace' into the
   Sanctuary--the principal one from the east, and four north and south,
   of which one (north and south) also led into the Court of the Women,
   and the other three (north and south) into that of the Priests.

    The Beautiful Gate'

   These eight side gates, as we may call them, were all two-leaved, wide,
   high, with superstructures and chambers supported by two pillars, and
   covered with gold and silver plating. But far more magnificent than any
   of them was the ninth or eastern gate, which formed the principal
   entrance into the Temple. The ascent to it was from the terrace by
   twelve easy steps. The gate itself was made of dazzling Corinthian
   brass, most richly ornamented; and so massive were its double doors
   that it needed the united strength of twenty men to open and close
   them. This was the Beautiful Gate'; and on its steps had they been wont
   these many years to lay the lame man, just as privileged beggars now
   lie at the entrance to Continental cathedrals. No wonder that all
   Jerusalem knew him; and when on that sunny afternoon Peter and John
   joined the worshippers in the Court of the Women, not alone, but in
   company with the well-known cripple, who, after his healing, was
   walking and leaping and praising God,' universal wonder and amazement'
   must have been aroused. Then, when the lame man, still holding by' the
   apostles, again descended these steps, we can readily understand how
   all the people would crowd around in Solomon's Porch, close by, till
   the sermon of Peter--so fruitful in its spiritual results--was
   interrupted by the Temple police, and the sudden imprisonment of the
   apostles.

    Court of the Women

   The Court of the Women obtained its name, not from its appropriation to
   the exclusive use of women, but because they were not allowed to
   proceed farther, except for sacrificial purposes. Indeed, this was
   probably the common place for worship, the females occupying, according
   to Jewish tradition, only a raised gallery along three sides of the
   court. This court covered a space upwards of 200 feet square. All
   around ran a simple colonnade, and within it, against the wall, the
   thirteen chests, or trumpets,' for charitable contributions were
   placed. These thirteen chests were narrow at the mouth and wide at the
   bottom, shaped like trumpets, whence their name. Their specific objects
   were carefully marked on them. Nine were for the receipt of what was
   legally due by worshippers; the other four for strictly voluntary
   gifts. Trumpets I and II were appropriated to the half-shekel
   Temple-tribute of the current and of the past year. Into Trumpet III
   those women who had to bring turtledoves for a burnt- and a
   sin-offering dropped their equivalent in money, which was daily taken
   out and a corresponding number of turtledoves offered. This not only
   saved the labour of so many separate sacrifices, but spared the modesty
   of those who might not wish to have the occasion or the circumstances
   of their offering to be publicly known. Into this trumpet Mary the
   mother of Jesus must have dropped the value of her offering (Luke 2:22,
   24) when the aged Simeon took the infant Saviour in his arms, and
   blessed God.' Trumpet IV similarly received the value of the offerings
   of young pigeons. In Trumpet V contributions for the wood used in the
   Temple; in Trumpet VI for the incense, and in Trumpet VII for the
   golden vessels for the ministry were deposited. If a man had put aside
   a certain sum for a sin-offering, and any money was left over after its
   purchase, it was cast into Trumpet VIII. Similarly, Trumpets IX, X, XI,
   XII, and XIII were destined for what was left over from
   trespass-offerings, offerings of birds, the offering of the Nazarite,
   of the cleansed leper, and voluntary offerings. In all probability this
   space where the thirteen Trumpets were placed was the treasury,' where
   Jesus taught on that memorable Feast of Tabernacles (John 7 and 8; see
   specially 8:20). We can also understand how, from the peculiar and
   known destination of each of these thirteen trumpets,' the Lord could
   distinguish the contributions of the rich who cast in of their
   abundance' from that of the poor widow who of her penury' had given all
   the living' that she had (Mark 12:41; Luke 21:1). But there was also a
   special treasury-chamber, into which at certain times they carried the
   contents of the thirteen chests; and, besides, what was called a
   chamber of the silent,' where devout persons secretly deposited money,
   afterwards secretly employed for educating children of the pious poor.

   It is probably in ironical allusion to the form and name of these
   treasure-chests that the Lord, making use of the word trumpet,'
   describes the conduct of those who, in their almsgiving, sought glory
   from men as 'sounding a trumpet' before them (Matt 6:2)--that is,
   carrying before them, as it were, in full display one of these
   trumpet-shaped alms-boxes (literally called in the Talmud, trumpets'),
   and, as it were, sounding it. [14]

    The Chambers

   In each of the four corners of the Court of the Women were chambers, or
   rather unroofed courts, each said to have been 60 feet long. In that at
   the right hand (on the north-east), the priests who were unfit for
   other than menial services on account of bodily blemishes, picked the
   worm-eaten wood from that destined for the altar. In the court at the
   farther angle (north-west) the purified lepers washed before presenting
   themselves to the priests at the Gate of Nicanor. At the left
   (south-east) the Nazarites polled their hair, and cooked their
   peace-offerings; while in a fourth court (at the south-west) the oil
   and wine were kept for the drink-offerings. The musical instruments
   used by the Levites were deposited in two rooms under the Court of the
   Israelites, to which the access was from the Court of the Women.

   Of course the western colonnade of this court was open. Thence fifteen
   easy steps led through the so-called Gate of Nicanor into the Court of
   Israel. On these steps the Levites were wont on the Feast of
   Tabernacles to sing the fifteen Psalms of Degrees,' or ascent (Psalms
   120 to 134), whence some have derived their name. Here, or, rather, in
   the Gate of Nicanor, all that was ordered to be done before the Lord'
   took place. There the cleansed leper and the women coming for
   purification presented themselves to the priests, and there also the
   water of jealousy' was given to the suspected wife.

    Court of Israel

   Perhaps it will be most convenient for practical purposes to regard the
   two Courts of Israel and of the Priests as in reality forming only one,
   divided into two parts by a low balustrade 1 1/2 feet high. Thus
   viewed, this large double court, inclusive of the Sanctuary itself,
   would measure 280 1/2 feet in length by 202 1/2 feet in breadth. Of
   this a narrow strip, 16 1/2 feet long, formed the Court of Israel. Two
   steps led up from it to the Court of the Priests. Here you mounted
   again by three low semicircular steps to a kind of pulpit or platform,
   where, as well as on the fifteen steps,' the Levites sang and played
   during the ordinary service. The priests, on the other hand, occupied,
   while pronouncing the blessing, the steps at the other end of the court
   which led up to the Temple porch. A similar arrangement existed in the
   great court as in that of the Women. Right and left of the Nicanor Gate
   were receptacles for the priestly vestments (one for each of the four
   kinds, and for the twenty-four courses of priests: 4 x 24 = 96).

   Next came the chamber of the high-priest's meat-offering (Lev 6:20),
   where each morning before going to their duties the officiating
   priesthood gathered from the so-called Beth-ha-Moked,' or house of
   stoves.' The latter was built on arches, and contained a large
   dining-hall that communicated with four other chambers. One of these
   was a large apartment where fires were continually burning for the use
   of the priests who ministered barefoot. There also the heads of the
   ministering courses slept, and here, in a special receptacle under the
   pavement, the keys of the Temple were hung up at night. Of the other
   three chambers of the Beth-Moked, one was appropriated to the various
   counterfoils given as a warrant when a person had paid his due for a
   drink-offering. In another the shewbread was prepared, while yet a
   third served for the lambs (at least six in number) that were always
   kept ready for the regular sacrifice. Here also a passage led to the
   well-lit subterranean bath for the use of the priests. Besides the
   Beth-Moked there were, north and south of the court, rooms for storing
   the salt for the altar, for salting the skins of sacrifices, for
   washing their inwards,' for storing the clean' wood, for the machinery
   by which the laver was supplied with water, and finally the chamber
   Gazith,' or Hall of Hewn Stones, where the Sanhedrim was wont to meet.
   Above some of these chambers were other apartments, such as those in
   which the high-priest spent the week before the Day of Atonement in
   study and meditation.

    The Chambers

   The account which Jewish tradition gives of these gates and chambers
   around the Court of the Priests is somewhat conflicting, perhaps
   because the same chambers and gates may have borne different names. It
   may, however, be thus summarised. Entering the Great Court by the
   Nicanor Gate, there was at the right hand the Chamber of Phinehas with
   its 96 receptacles for priests' vestments, and at the left the place
   where the high-priest's daily meat-offering was prepared, and where
   every morning before daybreak all the ministering priests met, after
   their inspection of the Temple and before being told off to duty. Along
   the southern side of the court were the Water-gate, through which at
   the Feast of Tabernacles the pitcher with water was brought from the
   Pool of Siloam, with a chamber above it, called Abtinas, where the
   priests kept guard at night; then the Gate of the Firstlings, through
   which the firstlings fit to be offered were brought; and the Wood-gate,
   through which the altar-wood was carried. Alongside these gates were
   Gazith, the hall of square polished stones, where the Sanhedrim sat;
   the chamber Golah, for the water apparatus which emptied and filled the
   laver; and the wood-chamber. Above and beyond it were the apartments of
   the high-priest and the council-chamber of the honourable councillors,'
   or priestly council for affairs strictly connected with the Temple. On
   the northern side of the Priests' Court were the gate Nitzutz (Spark
   Gate), with a guard-chamber above for the priests, the Gate of
   Sacrifices, and the Gate of the Beth-Moked. Alongside these gates were
   the chamber for salting the sacrifices; that for salting the skins
   (named Parvah from its builder), with bathrooms for the high-priest
   above it; and finally the Beth-Moked with its apartments. The two
   largest of these buildings--the council-chamber of the Sanhedrim at the
   south-eastern, [15] and the Beth-Moked at the north-western angle of
   the court--were partly built into the court and partly out on the
   terrace.'

   This, because none other than a prince of the house of David might sit
   down within the sacred enclosure of the Priests' Court. Probably there
   was a similar arrangement for the high-priest's apartments and the
   priests' council-chamber, as well as for the guard-chambers of the
   priests, so that at each of the four corners of the court the
   apartments would abut upon the terrace.' [16]

   All along the colonnades, both around the Court of the Gentiles and
   that of the Women, there were seats and benches for the accommodation
   of the worshippers.

    The Altar

   The most prominent object in the Court of the Priests was the immense
   altar of unhewn stones, [17] a square of not less than 48 feet, and,
   inclusive of the horns,' 15 feet high.

   All around it a circuit' ran for the use of the ministering priests,
   who, as a rule, always passed round by the right, and retired by the
   left. [18]

   As this circuit' was raised 9 feet from the ground, and 1 1/2 feet
   high, while the horns' measured 1 1/2 feet in height, the priests would
   have only to reach 3 feet to the top of the altar, and 4 1/2 feet to
   that of each horn.' An inclined plane, 48 feet long by 24 wide, into
   which about the middle two smaller descents' merged, led up to the
   circuit' from the south. Close by was the great heap of salt, from
   which every sacrifice must be salted with salt. [19]

   On the altar, which at the top was only 36 feet wide, three fires
   burned, one (east) for the offerings, the second (south) for the
   incense, the third (north) to supply the means for kindling the other
   two. The four horns' of the altar were straight, square, hollow
   prominences, that at the south-west with two openings, into whose
   silver funnels the drink-offerings, and, at the Feast of Tabernacles,
   the water from the Pool of Siloam, were poured. A red line all round
   the middle of the altar marked that above it the blood of sacrifices
   intended to be eaten, below it that of sacrifices wholly consumed, was
   to be sprinkled. The system of drainage into chambers below and canals,
   all of which could be flushed at will, was perfect; the blood and
   refuse being swept down into Kedron and towards the royal gardens.
   Finally, north of the altar were all requisites for the sacrifices--six
   rows, with four rings each, of ingenious mechanism, for fastening the
   sacrifices; eight marble tables for the flesh, fat, and cleaned
   inwards'; eight low columns, each with three hooks, for hanging up the
   pieces; a marble table for laying them out, and one of silver for the
   gold and silver vessels of the service.

    The Laver

   Between the altar and porch of the Temple, but placed towards the
   south, was the immense laver of brass, supported by twelve colossal
   lions, which was drained every evening, and filled every morning by
   machinery, and where twelve priests could wash at the same time.
   Indeed, the water supply to the Sanctuary is among the most wonderful
   of its arrangements. That of the Temple is designated by Captain Wilson
   as the low-level supply,' in contradistinction to the high-level
   aqueduct,' which collected the water in a rock-hewn tunnel four miles
   long, on the road to Hebron, and then wound along so as to deliver
   water to the upper portion of the city. The low-level' aqueduct, which
   supplied the Temple, derived its waters from three sources--from the
   hills about Hebron, from Etham, and from the three pools of Solomon.
   Its total length was over forty miles. The amount of water it conveyed
   may be gathered from the fact that the surplusage of the waters of
   Etham is calculated, when drained into the lower pool of Gihon, to have
   presented when full, an area of nearly four acres of water.' And, as if
   this had not been sufficient, the ground is perfectly honeycombed with
   a series of remarkable rock-hewn cisterns, in which the water brought
   by an aqueduct form Solomon's Pools, near Bethlehem, was stored. The
   cisterns appear to have been connected by a system of channels cut out
   of the rock; so that when one was full the surplus water ran into the
   next, and so on, till the final overflow was carried off by a channel
   into the Kedron. One of the cisterns--that known as the Great
   Sea--would contain two million gallons; and the total number of gallons
   which could be stored probably exceeded ten millions.' There seems
   little doubt that the drainage of Jerusalem was as well managed as the
   water supply; the mouth of the main drain being in the valley of the
   Kedron, where the sewerage was probably used as manure for the
   gardens.'

    The Great Stones

   The mind becomes bewildered at numbers, the accuracy of which we should
   hesitate to receive if they were not confirmed by modern
   investigations. We feel almost the same in speaking of the proportions
   of the Holy House itself. It was built on immense foundations of solid
   blocks of white marble covered with gold, each block measuring,
   according to Josephus, 67 1/2 by 9 feet. Mounting by a flight of twelve
   steps to the Porch,' we notice that it projected 30 feet on each side
   beyond the Temple itself. Including these projections, the buildings of
   the Temple were 150 feet long, and as many broad. Without them the
   breadth was only 90, and the length 120 feet. Of these 60 feet in
   length, from east to west, and 30 feet in breadth, belonged to the Holy
   Place; while the Most Holy was 30 feet long, and as many broad. There
   were, therefore, on either side of the Sanctuary, as well as behind it,
   30 feet to spare, which were occupied by side buildings three stories
   high, each containing five rooms, while that at the back had eight.
   These side-buildings, however, were lower than the Sanctuary itself,
   over which also super-structures had been reared. A gabled cedar roof,
   with golden spikes on it, and surrounded by an elegant balustrade,
   surmounted the whole.

    The Veil

   The entrance to the Porch,' which was curiously roofed, was covered by
   a splendid veil. Right and left were depositories for the sacrificial
   knives. Within the Porch' a number of dedicated' gifts were kept, such
   as the golden candelabra of the proselyte queen of Adiabene, two golden
   crowns presented by the Maccabees, etc. Here were also two tables--one
   of marble, on which they deposited the new shewbread; the other of
   gold, on which they laid the old as it was removed from the Holy Place.
   Two-leaved doors, [20] with gold plating, and covered by a rich
   Babylonian curtain of the four colours of the Temple (fine linen, blue,
   scarlet, and purple'), formed the entrance into the Holy Place.

   Above it hung that symbol of Israel (Psa 80:8; Jer 2:21, Eze 19:10;
   Joel 1:7) a gigantic vine of pure gold, and made of votive
   offerings--each cluster the height of a man. In the Holy Place were, to
   the south, the golden candlestick; to the north, the table of
   shewbread; and beyond them the altar of incense, near the entrance to
   the Most Holy. The latter was now quite empty, a large stone, on which
   the high-priest sprinkled the blood on the Day of Atonement, occupying
   the place where the ark with the mercy-seat had stood. A wooden
   partition separated the Most Holy from the Holy Place; and over the
   door hung the veil which was rent in twain from the top to the bottom'
   when the way into the holiest of all was opened on Golgotha (Matt
   27:51). [21]

   Such was the Temple as restored by Herod--a work which occupied
   forty-six years to its completion. Yet, though the Rabbis never weary
   praising its splendour, not with one word do any of those who were
   contemporary indicate that its restoration was carried out by Herod the
   Great. So memorable an event in their history is passed over with the
   most absolute silence. What a complete answer does this afford to the
   objection sometimes raised from the silence of Josephus about the
   person and mission of Jesus!

    Our Lord's Prediction

   With what reverence the Rabbis guarded their Temple will be described
   in the sequel. The readers of the New Testament know how readily any
   supposed infringement of its sanctity led to summary popular vengeance.
   To the disciples of Jesus it seemed difficult to realise that such
   utter ruin as their Master foretold could so soon come over that
   beautiful and glorious house. It was the evening of the day in which He
   had predicted the utter desolation of Jerusalem. All that day He had
   taught in the Temple, and what He had said, not only there, but when,
   on beholding the city, He wept over it, seems to have filled their
   minds alike with awe and with doubt. And now He, with His disciples,
   had departed from the Temple.' Once more they lingered in sweet
   retirement on the Mount of Olives' (Matt 24:1, 3). The purple light on
   the mountains of Moab was fast fading out. Across the city the sinking
   sun cast a rich glow over the pillared cloisters of the Temple, and
   over the silent courts as they rose terrace upon terrace. From where
   they stood they could see over the closed Beautiful Gate, and right to
   the entrance to the Holy Place, which now glittered with gold; while
   the eastern walls and the deep valley below were thrown into a solemn
   shadow, creeping, as the orb sunk lower, further and further towards
   the summit of Olivet, irradiated with one parting gleam of roseate
   light, after all below was sunk in obscurity' (Bartlett, Jerusalem
   Revisited, p. 115).

   Then it was and there that the disciples, looking down upon the Temple,
   pointed out to the Master: What manner of stones and what buildings are
   here.' The view from that site must have rendered belief in the
   Master's prediction even more difficult and more sad. A few years more,
   and it was all literally fulfilled! It may be, as Jewish tradition has
   it, that ever since the Babylonish captivity the Ark of the Covenant'
   lies buried and concealed underneath the wood-court at the
   north-eastern angle of the Court of the Women. And it may be that some
   at least of the spoils which Titus carried with him from Jerusalem--the
   seven-branched candlestick, the table of shewbread, the priests'
   trumpets, and the identical golden mitre which Aaron had worn on his
   forehead--are hidden somewhere in the vaults beneath the site of the
   Temple, after having successively gone to Rome, to Carthage, to
   Byzantium, to Ravenna, and thence to Jerusalem. But of those great
   buildings' that once stood there, there is not left one stone upon
   another' that has not been thrown down.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [12] According to Mr. Lewin, however (Siege of Jerusalem, p. 270), this
   celebrated ascent' to the house of the Lord went up by a double
   subterranean passage, 250 feet long and 62 feet wide, by a flight of
   steps from the new palace of Solomon, afterwards occupied by the Royal
   Porch,' right into the inner court of the Temple.

   [13] We have adopted this name as in common use, though Relandus
   (Antiq. p. 78) rightly objects that the only term for it used in Jewish
   writings is the mountain of the house.'

   [14] The allusion is all the more pointed, when we bear in mind that
   each of these trumpets had a mark to tell its special object. It seems
   strange that this interpretation should not have occurred to any of the
   commentators, who have always found the allusion such a crux
   interpretum. An article in the Bible Educator has since substantially
   adopted this view, adding that trumpets were blown when the alms were
   collected. But for the latter statement there is no historical
   authority whatever, and it would contravene the religious spirit of the
   times.

   [15] It is very strange what mistakes are made about the localisation
   of the rooms and courts connected with the Temple. Thus the writer of
   the article Sanhedrim' in Kitto's Encycl., vol. iii. p. 766, says that
   the hall of the Sanhedrim was situate in the centre of the south side
   of the Temple-court, the northern part extending to the Court of the
   Priests, and the southern part to the Court of the Israelites.' But the
   Court of Israel and that of the Priests did not lie north and south,
   but east and west, as a glance at the Temple plan will show! The hall
   of the Sanhedrim extended indeed south, though certainly not to the
   Court of Israel, but to the Chel or terrace. The authorities quoted in
   the article Sanhedrim' do not bear out the writer's conclusions. It
   ought to be remarked that about the time of Christ the Sanhedrim
   removed its sittings from the Hall of Square Stones to another on the
   east of the Temple-court.

   [16] We know that the two priestly guard-chambers above the Water-gate
   and Nitzutz opened also upon the terrace. This may explain how the
   Talmud sometimes speaks of six and sometimes of eight gates opening
   from the Priests' Court upon the terrace, or else gates 7 and 8 may
   have been those which opened from the terrace north and south into the
   Court of the Women.

   [17] They were whitened' twice a year. Once in seven years the
   high-priest was to inspect the Most Holy Place, through an opening made
   from the room above. If repairs were required, the workmen were let
   down through the ceiling in a sort of cage, so as not to see anything
   but what they were to work at.

   [18] The three exceptions to this are specially mentioned in the
   Talmud. The high-priest both ascended and descended by the right.

   [19] Also a receptacle for such sin-offerings of birds as had become
   spoiled. This inclined plane was kept covered with salt, to prevent the
   priests, who were barefooted, from slipping.

   [20] There was also a small wicket gate by which he entered who opened
   the large doors from within.

   [21] The Rabbis speak of two veils, and say that the high-priest went
   in by the southern edge of the first veil, then walked along till he
   reached the northern corner of the second veil, by which he entered the
   Most Holy Place.

Chapter 3

  Temple Order, Revenues, and Music

   For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the
   sanctuary by the high-priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
   Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own
   blood, suffered without the gate.'--Hebrews 13:11, 12

    Second Temple Inferior in Glory

   To the devout and earnest Jew the second Temple must, in comparison of'
   the house in her first glory,' have indeed appeared as nothing' (Hagg
   2:3). True, in architectural splendour the second, as restored by
   Herod, far surpassed the first Temple. [22]

   But, unless faith had recognised in Jesus of Nazareth the Desire of all
   nations,' who should fill this house with glory' (Hagg 2:7), it would
   have been difficult to draw other than sad comparisons. Confessedly,
   the real elements of Temple-glory no longer existed. The Holy of Holies
   was quite empty, the ark of the covenant, with the cherubim, the tables
   of the law, the book of the covenant, Aaron's rod that budded, and the
   pot of manna, were no longer in the sanctuary. The fire that had
   descended from heaven upon the altar was extinct. What was far more
   solemn, the visible presence of God in the Shechinah was wanting. [23]

   Nor could the will of God be now ascertained through the Urim and
   Thummim, nor even the high-priest be anointed with the holy oil, its
   very composition being unknown. Yet all the more jealously did the
   Rabbis draw lines of fictitious sanctity, and guard them against all
   infringement.

    Lines of Sanctity

   In general, as the camp in the wilderness had really consisted of three
   parts--the camp of Israel, that of the Levites, and that of God--so
   they reckoned three corresponding divisions of the Holy City. From the
   gates to the Temple Mount was regarded as the camp of Israel; thence to
   the gate of Nicanor represented the camp of Levi; while the rest of the
   sanctuary was the camp of God.' It is in allusion to this that the
   writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews compares Christ's suffering
   without the gate' of Jerusalem to the burning of the sin-offerings
   without the camp.' According to another Rabbinical arrangement
   different degrees of sanctity attached to different localities. The
   first, or lowest degree, belonged to the land of Israel, whence alone
   the first sheaf at the Passover, the firstfruits, and the two
   wave-loaves at Pentecost might be brought; the next degree to walled
   cities in Palestine, where no leper nor dead body (Luke 7:12) might
   remain; the third to Jerusalem itself since, besides many prohibitions
   to guard its purity, it was only there lawful to partake of
   peace-offerings, of the firstfruits, and of the second tithes.' Next
   came, successively, the Temple Mount, from which all who were in a
   state of Levitical uncleanness were excluded; the Terrace,' or Chel,'
   from which, besides Gentiles, those who had become defiled by contact
   with a dead body were shut out; the Court of the Women, into which
   those who had been polluted might not come, even if they had washed,'
   till after they were also Levitically fit to eat of things sacred,'
   that is, after sunset of the day on which they had washed; the Court of
   Israel, into which those might not enter who, though delivered from
   their uncleanness, had not yet brought the offering for their
   purification; [24] the Court of the Priests, ordinarily accessible only
   to the latter; the space between the altar and the Temple itself, from
   which even priests were excluded if their bearing showed that they did
   not realise the solemnity of the place; the Temple, into which the
   priests might only enter after washing their hands and feet; and,
   lastly, the Most Holy Place, into which the high-priest alone was
   allowed to go, and that only once a year.

    Rules of the Rabbis

   From these views of the sanctity of the place, it will readily be
   understood how sufficient outward reverence should have been expected
   of all who entered upon the Temple Mount. The Rabbis here also lay down
   certain rules, of which some are such as a sense of propriety would
   naturally suggest, while others strangely remind us of the words of our
   Saviour. Thus no one was to come to it except for strictly religious
   purposes, and neither to make the Temple Mount a place of thoroughfare,
   nor use it to shorten the road. Ordinarily the worshippers were to
   enter by the right and to withdraw by the left, avoiding both the
   direction and the gate by which they had come. But mourners and those
   under ecclesiastical discipline were to do the reverse, so as to meet
   the stream of worshippers, who might address to them either words of
   sympathy (He who dwelleth in this house grant thee comfort!'), or else
   of admonition (He who dwelleth in this house put it into thy mind to
   give heed to those who would restore thee again!'). As already stated,
   it was expressly prohibited to sit down in the Court of the Priests, an
   exception being only made in favour of princes of the house of David,
   probably to vindicate their consistency, as such instances were
   recorded in the past history of Israel. Alike the ministering priests
   and the worshippers were to walk backwards when leaving the immediate
   neighbourhood where the holy service was performed, and at the gate of
   Nicanor each one was to stand with his head bent. It need scarcely be
   said that reverence in gesture and deportment was enjoined while on the
   Temple Mount. But even when at a distance from Jerusalem and the
   Temple, its direction was to be noted, so as to avoid in every-day life
   anything that might seem incongruous with the reverence due to the
   place of which God had said, Mine eyes and mine heart shall be there
   perpetually' (1 Kings 9:3). Probably from a similar feeling of
   reverence, it was ordered, that when once a week the sanctuary was
   thoroughly cleaned, any repairs found needful should be executed if
   possible by priests or else by Levites, or at least by Israelites, and
   only in case of extreme necessity by workmen not Levitically clean.'

   Other Rabbinical ordinances, however, are not so easily explained,
   unless on the ground of the avoidance of every occupation and
   undertaking other than worship. Thus no man might go on the Temple
   Mount with his staff,' as if on business or pleasure; nor yet with
   shoes on his feet'--sandals only being allowed; nor with the dust upon
   his feet'; nor with his scrip,' nor with money tied to him in his
   purse.' Whatever he might wish to contribute either to the Temple, or
   for offerings, or for the poor must be carried by each in his hand,'
   possibly to indicate that the money about him was exclusively for an
   immediate sacred purpose. It was probably for similar reasons that
   Jesus transferred these very ordinances to the disciples when engaged
   in the service of the real Temple. The direction, Provide neither gold,
   nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip for your journey,
   neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves,' must mean, Go out in
   the same spirit and manner as you would to the Temple services, and
   fear not--'for the workman is worthy of his meat' (Matt 10:9, 10). In
   other words: Let this new Temple service be your only thought,
   undertaking and care.

    Wilful Profanity

   But, guard it as they might, it was impossible wholly to preserve the
   sanctuary from profanation. For wilful, conscious, high-handed
   profanity, whether in reference to the Temple or to God, the law does
   not appear to have provided any atonement or offering. To this the
   Epistle to the Hebrews alludes in the well-known passage, so often
   misunderstood, For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
   knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but
   a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which
   shall devour the adversaries' (Heb 10:26, 27). In point of fact, these
   terms of threatening correspond to two kinds of Divine punishment
   frequently mentioned in the Old Testament. The one, often referred to
   in the warning that he die not,' is called by the Rabbis, death by the
   hand of Heaven or of God'; the other is that of being cut off.' It is
   difficult to distinguish exactly between these two. Tradition
   enumerates thirty-six offences to which the punishment of cutting off'
   attaches. From their graver nature, as compared with the eleven
   offences on which death by the hand of God' was to follow, we gather
   that cutting off' must have been the severer of the two punishments,
   and it may correspond to the term fiery indignation.' Some Rabbis hold
   that death by the hand of God' was a punishment which ended with this
   life, while cutting off' extended beyond it. But the best authorities
   maintain, that whereas death by the hand of Heaven fell upon the guilty
   individual alone, the cutting off' extended to the children also, so
   that the family would become extinct in Israel. Such Divine punishment
   is alluded to in 1 Corinthians 16:22, under the well-known Jewish
   expression, Anathema Maranatha'--literally, Anathema when the Lord
   cometh!

    Its Penalties

   To these two Divine punishments corresponded other two by the hand of
   man--the forty stripes save one,' and the so-called rebels' beating.'
   The distinction between them is easily explained. The former were only
   inflicted after a regular judicial investigation and sentence, and for
   the breach of some negative precept or prohibition; while the latter
   was, so to speak, in the hands of the people, who might administer it
   on the spot, and without trial, if any one were caught in supposed open
   defiance of some positive precept, whether of the Law of Moses or of
   the traditions of the elders. The reader of the New Testament will
   remember such popular outbursts, when the men of Nazareth would have
   cast Jesus over the brow of the hill on which their city was built
   (Luke 4:29), and when on at least two occasions the people took up
   stones in the Temple to stone Him (John 8:59; 10:31). It is a
   remarkable fact, that when the Lord Jesus and when His martyr Stephen
   were before the Sanhedrim (Matt 26:59, 68; Acts 7:57, 58), the
   procedure was in each case in direct contravention of all the rules of
   the Rabbinical criminal law. In each case the sitting terminated in the
   rebels' beating,' both when they buffeted the Master' and smote Him
   with the palms of their hands,' and when they ran upon' Stephen with
   one accord, and cast him out of the city, and stoned him.' For the
   rebels' beating was really unto death. The same punishment was also to
   have been inflicted upon Paul, when, on the charge of having brought a
   Gentile beyond the enclosure in the court open to such, the people ran
   together, and they took Paul, and drew him out of the Temple,' and went
   about to kill him.' This summary mode of punishing supposed rebellion'
   was probably vindicated by the example of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar
   (Num 25:7, 8). On the other hand, the mildness of the Rabbinical law,
   where religious feelings were not involved, led to modifications of the
   punishment prescribed in Deuteronomy 25:2, 3. Thus because the words
   were, by a certain number, forty stripes he may give him,' instead of a
   simple direction to give the forty stripes, the law was construed as
   meaning a number near to forty, or thirty-nine, which accordingly was
   the severest corporeal punishment awarded at one time. If the number of
   stripes were less than thirty-nine, it must still be some multiple of
   three, since, as the scourge was composed of three separate thongs (the
   middle one of calf's leather, the other two of asses', with a reference
   to Isaiah 1:3), each stroke of the scourge in reality inflicted three
   stripes. Hence the greatest number of strokes administered at one time
   amounted only to thirteen. The law also most particularly defined and
   modified every detail, even to the posture of the criminal. Still this
   punishment, which St. Paul underwent not less than five times at the
   hands of the Jews (2 Cor 11:24), must have been very severe. In
   general, we can only hope that it was not so often administered as
   Rabbinical writings seem to imply. During the scourging, Deuteronomy
   28:58, 59, and at its close Psalm 78:38, were read to the culprit.
   After the punishment he was not to be reproached, but received as a
   brother. [25]

    Necessity for Discipline

   That strict discipline both in regard to priests and worshippers would,
   however, be necessary, may be inferred even from the immense number of
   worshippers which thronged Jerusalem and the Temple. According to a
   late computation, the Temple could have held within its colossal
   girdle' two amphitheatres of the size of the Coliseum.' As the latter
   is reckoned to have been capable, inclusive of its arena and passages,
   of accommodating 109,000 persons, the calculation that the Temple might
   contain at one time about 210,000 persons seems by no means
   exaggerated. [26] It will readily be believed what immense wealth this
   multitude must have brought to the great national sanctuary.

    The Temple Treasury

   Indeed, the Temple treasury had always been an object of cupidity to
   foreigners. It was successively plundered by Syrians and Romans, though
   at the last siege the flames deprived Titus and his soldiers of this
   booty. Even so liberal and enlightened a statesman as Cicero inveighed,
   perhaps on the ground of exaggerated reports, against the enormous
   influx of gold from all lands to Jerusalem. From Biblical history we
   know how liberal were the voluntary contributions at the time of Moses,
   of David, and again of Joash (2 Chron 24) and of Josiah (2 Kings 22).
   Such offerings to the Temple treasury continued to the last a very
   large source of revenue. They might be brought either in the form of
   vows or of free gifts. Any object, or even a person, might be dedicated
   by vow to the altar. If the thing vowed were suitable, it would be
   used; if otherwise, sold, and its value given to the treasury. Readers
   of the New Testament know how fatally such spurious liberality
   interfered with the most sacred duties of life (Matt 15:5). From Jewish
   tradition we gather that there must have been quite a race for
   distinction in this respect. The wood, the incense, the wine, the oil,
   and all other things requisite for the sacred services, as well as
   golden and silver vessels, were contributed with lavish hand. Certain
   families obtained by their zeal special privileges, such as that the
   wood they brought should always be first used for the altar fire; and
   the case of people leaving the whole of their fortune to the Temple is
   so often discussed, that it must have been a by no means uncommon
   occurrence. To this practice Christ may have referred in denouncing the
   Scribes and Pharisees who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence
   make long prayers' (Matt 23:14). For a good deal of this money went in
   the end from the Temple treasury to them, although there is no evidence
   of their intriguing for personal gifts.

    The Tribute Money

   Besides these votive offerings, and the sale of the surplusage of
   incense, flour, etc., the people were wont on the Sabbaths and
   feast-days to bring voluntary contributions in their hand' to the
   Temple. another and very large source of revenue was from the profit
   made by the meat-offerings, which were prepared by the Levites, and
   sold every day to the offerers. But by far the largest sum was derived
   from the half-shekel of Temple tribute, which was incumbent on every
   male Israelite of age, including proselytes and even manumitted slaves.
   As the shekel of the sanctuary was double the ordinary, the half-shekel
   due to the Temple treasury amount to about 1s. 4d. (two denarii or a
   didrachma). Hence, when Christ was challenged at Capernaum (Matt 17:24)
   for this payment, He directed Peter to give the stater, or two
   didrachmas, for them both. This circumstance also enables us to fix the
   exact date of this event. For annually, on the 1st of Adar (the month
   before the Passover), proclamation was made throughout the country by
   messengers sent from Jerusalem of the approaching Temple tribute. On
   the 15th of Adar the money-changers opened stalls throughout the
   country to change the various coins, which Jewish residents at home or
   settlers abroad might bring, into the ancient money of Israel. For
   custom had it that nothing but the regular half-shekel of the sanctuary
   could be received at the treasury. On the 25th of Adar business was
   only transacted within the precincts of Jerusalem and of the Temple,
   and after that date those who had refused to pay the impost could be
   proceeded against at law, and their goods distrained, the only
   exception being in favour of priests, and that for the sake of peace,'
   that is, lest their office should come in disrepute. From heathens or
   Samaritans no tribute money was to be received, the general rule in
   reference to all their offerings being this: A votive and a free-will
   offering they receive at their hands; but whatever is not either a
   votive or a free-will offering (does not come under either category) is
   not received at their hands.' In support, Ezra 4:3 was quoted. The law
   also fixed the rate of discount which the money-changers were allowed
   to charge those who procured from them the Temple coin, perhaps to
   obviate suspicion of, or temptation to usury--a sin regarded as one of
   the most heinous civil offences.

    Annual Sum of Tribute

   The total sum derived annually from the Temple tribute has been
   computed at about 76,000 pounds. As the bankers were allowed to charge
   a silver meah, or about one-fourth of a denar (2d.) on every
   half-shekel, their profits must have amounted to nearly 9, 500 pounds,
   or, deducting a small sum for exceptional cases, in which the meah was
   not to be charged, say about 9,000 pounds--a very large sum,
   considering the value of money in a country where a labourer received a
   denar (8d.) for a day's work (Matt 20:2), and the good Samaritan' left
   only two denars (1s. 4d.) in the inn for the keep of the sick man (Luke
   10:35). It must therefore have been a very powerful interest which
   Jesus attacked, when in the Court of the Temple He poured out the
   changers' money, and overthrew the tables' (John 2:15), while at the
   same time He placed Himself in direct antagonism to the sanctioned
   arrangements of the Sanhedrim, whom He virtually charged with
   profanity.

    Tribute Enforced By Law

   It had only been a century before, during the reign of Salome-
   Alexandra (about 78 B.C.), that the Pharisaical party, being then in
   power, had carried an enactment by which the Temple tribute was to be
   enforced at law. It need scarcely be said that for this there was not
   the slightest Scriptural warrant. Indeed, the Old Testament nowhere
   provided legal means for enforcing any payment for religious purposes.
   The law stated what was due, but left its observance to the piety of
   the people, so that alike the provision for the Temple and for the
   priesthood must have varied with the religious state of the nation (Mal
   3:8-10). But, irrespective of this, it is matter of doubt whether the
   half-shekel had ever been intended as an annual payment. Its first
   enactment was under exceptional circumstances (Exo 30:12), and the mode
   in which, as we are informed, a similar collection was made during the
   reign of Joash, suggest the question whether the original institution
   by Moses was not treated rather as affording a precedent than as laying
   down a binding rule (2 Chron 24:6-11). At the time of Nehemiah (Neh
   10:32-34) we read only of a self-imposed ordinance,' and at the rate of
   a third, not a half-shekel. But long before the coming of Christ very
   different views prevailed. The dispersed abroad' regarded the Temple as
   the one bond of their national as well as their religious life.
   Patriotism and religion swelled their gifts, which far exceeded the
   legal dues. Gradually they came to regard the Temple tribute as, in the
   literal sense of the words, a ransom for their souls' (Exo 30:12). So
   many were the givers and so large their gifts that they were always
   first brought to certain central places, whence the most honourable of
   their number carried them as sacred ambassadors' to Jerusalem. The
   richest contributions came from those crowded Jewish settlements in
   Mesopotamia and Babylon, to which the dispersed' had originally been
   transported. Here special treasuries for their reception had been built
   in the cities of Nisibis and Nehardea, whence a large armed escort
   annually accompanied the ambassadors' to Palestine. Similarly, Asia
   Minor, which at one time contributed nearly 8,000 pounds a year, had
   its central collecting places. In the Temple these moneys were emptied
   into three large chests, which were opened with certain formalities at
   each of the three great feasts. According to tradition these three
   chests held three seahs each (the seah = 1 peck 1 pint), so that on the
   three occasions of their opening twenty-seven seahs of coin were taken.

    How the Money was Spent

   The Temple revenues were in the first place devoted to the purchase of
   all public sacrifices, that is, those offered in the name of the whole
   congregation of Israel, such as the morning and evening sacrifices, the
   festive sacrifices, etc. This payment had been one of the points in
   controversy between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. So great
   importance was attached to it, that all Israel should appear
   represented in the purchase of the public sacrifices, that when the
   three chests were emptied they took expressly from one for the land of
   Israel,' from another for the neighbouring lands' (that is, for the
   Jews there resident), and from the third for distant lands.' Besides,
   the Temple treasury defrayed all else necessary for the services of the
   sanctuary; all Temple repairs, and the salaries of a large staff of
   regular officials, such as those who prepared the shewbread and the
   incense; who saw to the correctness of the copies of the law used in
   the synagogues; who examined into the Levitical fitness of sacrifices;
   who instructed the priests in their various duties; who made the
   curtains, etc.,--not omitting, according to their own testimony, the
   fees of the Rabbis. And after all this lavish expenditure there was not
   only enough to pay for the repairs of the city-walls, the roads, and
   public buildings, etc., about Jerusalem, but sufficient to accumulate
   immense wealth in the treasury!

    The Temple Hymnody

   To the wealth and splendour of the Temple corresponded the character of
   its services. The most important of these, next to the sacrificial
   rites, was the hymnody of the sanctuary. We can conceive what it must
   have been in the days of David and of Solomon. But even in New
   Testament times it was such that St. John could find no more adequate
   imagery to portray heavenly realities and the final triumph of the
   Church than that taken from the service of praise in the Temple. Thus,
   when first the twenty-four elders,' representing the chiefs of the
   twenty-four courses of the priesthood, and afterwards the 144,000,
   representing redeemed Israel in its fulness (12 x 12,000), sing the new
   song'--the former in heaven, the latter on Mount Zion--they appear,
   just as in the Temple services, as harpers, harping with their harps'
   (Rev 5:8; 14:2, 3). Possibly there may also be an analogy between the
   time when these harpers' are introduced and the period in the
   Temple-service when the music began--just as the joyous drink-offering
   was poured out. There is yet a third reference in the Book of
   Revelation to the harps of God' (Rev 15:2), with most pointed allusion,
   not to the ordinary, but to the Sabbath services in the Temple. In this
   case the harpers' are all they that had gotten the victory over the
   beast.' The Church, which has come out of great tribulation, stands
   victorious on the sea of glass'; and the saints, having the harps of
   God,' sing the song of Moses, the servant of God.' It is the Sabbath of
   the Church; and as on the Sabbath, besides the psalm for the day (Psalm
   92) at the ordinary sacrifice, they sung at the additional Sabbatic
   sacrifice (Num 28:9, 10), in the morning, the Song of Moses, in
   Deuteronomy 32, and in the evening that in Exodus 15, so the victorious
   Church celebrates her true Sabbath or rest by singing this same Song of
   Moses and of the Lamb,' only in language that expresses the fullest
   meaning of the Sabbath songs in the Temple.

    Instrumental Music

   Properly speaking, the real service of praise in the Temple was only
   with the voice. This is often laid down as a principle by the Rabbis.
   What instrumental music there was, served only to accompany and sustain
   the song. Accordingly, none other than Levites might act as choristers,
   while other distinguished Israelites were allowed to take part in the
   instrumental music. The blasts of the trumpets, blown by priests only,
   formed--at least in the second Temple--no part of the instrumental
   music of the service, but were intended for quite different purposes.
   Even the posture of the performers showed this, for while the Levites
   stood at their desks facing towards the sanctuary, or westwards, the
   priests, with their silver trumpets, stood exactly in the opposite
   direction, on the west side of the rise of the altar, by the table of
   the fat,' and looking eastwards or down the courts. On ordinary days
   the priests blew seven times, each time three blasts--a short sound, an
   alarm, and again a sharp short sound (Thekiah, Theruah, and Thekiah
   [27] ), or, as the Rabbis express it, An alarm in the midst and a plain
   note before and after it.'

   According to tradition, they were intended symbolically to proclaim the
   kingdom of God, Divine Providence, and the final judgment. The first
   three blasts were blown when the great gates of the Temple--especially
   that of Nicanor--were opened. Then, when the drink-offering was poured
   out, the Levites sung the psalm of the day in three sections. After
   each section there was a pause, when the priests blew three blasts, and
   the people worshipped. This was the practice at the evening, as at the
   morning sacrifice. On the eve of the Sabbath a threefold blast of the
   priests' trumpets summoned the people, far as the sound was carried
   over the city, to prepare for the holy day, while another threefold
   blast announced its actual commencement. On Sabbaths, when, besides the
   ordinary, an additional sacrifice was brought, and the Song of Moses'
   sung--not the whole every Sabbath, but divided in six parts, one for
   every Sabbath, --the priests sounded their trumpets additional three
   times in the pauses of the Sabbath psalm.

    The Influence of David

   The music of the Temple owed its origin to David, who was not only a
   poet and a musical composer, but who also invented musical instruments
   (Amos 6:5; 1 Chron 23:5), especially the ten-stringed Nevel or lute
   (Psa 33:2; 144:9). From the Book of Chronicles we know how fully this
   part of the service was cultivated, although the statement of Josephus
   (Anti. viii. 3, 8.), that Solomon had provided forty thousand harps and
   lutes, and two hundred thousand silver trumpets, is evidently a gross
   exaggeration. The Rabbis enumerate thirty-six different instruments, of
   which only fifteen are mentioned in the Bible, and of these five in the
   Pentateuch. As in early Jewish poetry there was neither definite and
   continued metre (in the modern sense), nor regular and premeditated
   rhyme, so there was neither musical notation, nor yet any artificial
   harmony. The melody was simple, sweet, and sung in unison to the
   accompaniment of instrumental music. Only one pair of brass cymbals
   were allowed to be used. But this sounding brass' and tinkling cymbal'
   formed no part of the Temple music itself, and served only as the
   signal to begin that part of the service. To this the apostle seems to
   refer when, in 1 Corinthians 13:1, he compares the gift of tongues' to
   the sign or signal by which the real music of the Temple was
   introduced.

    The Harp and Lute

   That music was chiefly sustained by the harp (Kinnor) and the lute
   (Nevel). Of the latter (which was probably used for solos) not less
   than two or more than six were to be in the Temple orchestra; of the
   former, or harp, as many as possible, but never less than nine. There
   were, of course, several varieties both of the Nevel and the Kinnor.
   The chief difference between these two kinds of stringed instruments
   lay in this, that in the Nevel (lute or guitar) the strings were drawn
   over the sounding-board, while in the Kinnor they stood out free, as in
   our harps. Of wind-instruments we know that, besides their silver
   trumpets, the priests also blew the Shophar or horn, notably at the new
   moon, on the Feast of the New Year (Psa 81:3), and to proclaim the Year
   of Jubilee (Lev 25:9), which, indeed, thence derived its name.
   Originally the Shophar was probably a ram's horn (Jos., Ant. v. 5, 6.),
   but afterwards it was also made of metal. The Shophar was chiefly used
   for its loud and far-sounding tones (Exo 19:16, 19; 20:18; Isa 58:1).
   At the Feast of the New Year, one priest with a Shophar was placed
   between those who blew the trumpets; while on fast-days a priest with a
   Shophar stood on each side of them--the tones of the Shophar being
   prolonged beyond those of the trumpets. In the synagogues out of
   Jerusalem the Shophar alone was blown at the New Year, and on fast-days
   only trumpets.

    The Flute

   The flute (or reed pipe) was played in the Temple on twelve special
   festivities. [28]

   These were: the day of killing the first, and that of killing the
   second Passover, the first day of unleavened bread, Pentecost, and the
   eight days of the Feast of Tabernacles. Quite in accordance with the
   social character of these feasts, the flute was also used by the
   festive pilgrim-bands on their journey to Jerusalem, to accompany the
   Psalms of Degrees,' or rather of Ascent' (Isa 30:29), sung on such
   occasions. It was also customary to play it at marriage feasts and at
   funerals (Matt 9:23); for according to Rabbinical law every Jew was
   bound to provide at least two flutes and one mourning woman at the
   funeral of his wife. In the Temple, not less than two nor more than
   twelve flutes were allowed, and the melody was on such occasions to
   close with the notes of one flute alone. Lastly, we have sufficient
   evidence that there was a kind of organ used in the Temple (the
   Magrephah), but whether merely for giving signals or not, cannot be
   clearly determined.

    The Human Voice

   As already stated, the service of praise was mainly sustained by the
   human voice. A good voice was the one qualification needful for a
   Levite. In the second Temple female singers seem at one time to have
   been employed (Ezra 2:65; Neh 7:67). In the Temple of Herod their place
   was supplied by Levite boys. Nor did the worshippers any more take part
   in the praise, except by a responsive Amen. It was otherwise in the
   first Temple, as we gather from 1 Chronicles 16:36, from the allusion
   in Jeremiah 33:11, and also from such Psalms as 26:12; 68:26. At the
   laying of the foundation of the second Temple, and at the dedication of
   the wall of Jerusalem, the singing seems to have been antiphonal, or in
   responses (Ezra 3:10, 11; Neh 12:27, 40), the two choirs afterwards
   apparently combining, and singing in unison in the Temple itself.
   Something of the same kind was probably also the practice in the first
   Temple. What the melodies were to which the Psalms had been sung, it
   is, unfortunately, now impossible to ascertain. Some of the music still
   used in the synagogue must date from those times, and there is no
   reason to doubt that in the so-called Gregorian tones we have also
   preserved to us a close approximation to the ancient hymnody of the
   Temple, though certainly not without considerable alterations.

   But how solemn must have been the scene when, at the dedication of
   Solomon's Temple during the service of praise, the house was filled
   with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah; so that the priests could not
   stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Jehovah had
   filled the house of God'! (2 Chron 5:13, 14) Such music, and such
   responsive singing, might well serve, in the Book of Revelation, as
   imagery of heavenly realities (Rev 4:8, 11; 5:9, 12; 7:10-12),
   especially in that description of the final act of worship in
   Revelation 14:1-5, where at the close of their antiphony the two choirs
   combine, as at the dedication of the second Temple, to join in this
   grand unison, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth' (Rev
   19:6, 7; comp. also Rev 5:13).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [22] The Talmud expressly calls attention to this, and mentions as
   another point of pre-eminence, that whereas the first Temple stood 410,
   the second lasted 420 years.

   [23] The following five are mentioned by the Rabbis as wanting in the
   last Temple: the ark, the holy fire, the Shechinah, the spirit of
   prophecy, and the Urim and Thummim.

   [24] This class would include the following four cases: the cleansed
   leper, a person who had had an issue, a woman that had been in her
   separation, and one who had just borne a child. Further explanations of
   each case are given in subsequent chapters.

   another architectural comparison from the same interesting article,
   which, however, is unfortunately defaced by many and serious mistakes
   on other points. The length of the eastern wall of the sanctuary,'
   writes the reviewer, was more than double that of the side of the Great
   Pyramid; its height nearly one-third of the Egyptian structure from the
   foundation. If to this great height of 152 feet of solid wall you add
   the descent of 114 feet to the bed of the Kedron, and the further
   elevation of 160 feet attained by the pinnacle, we have a total of 426
   feet, which is only 59 feet less than the Great Pyramid.'

   love feasts of the early Christians, up to the year 190, when Clement
   of Alexandria introduced the harp in its place.

Chapter 4

  The Officiating Priesthood

   And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the
   same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.'--Hebrews 10:11

    The Priesthood

   Among the most interesting glimpses of early life in the church is that
   afforded by a small piece of rapidly-drawn scenery which presents to
   our view a great company of the priests,' obedient to the faith' (Acts
   6:7). We seem to be carried back in imagination to the time when Levi
   remained faithful amidst the general spiritual defection (Exo 32:26),
   and then through the long vista of devout ministering priests to reach
   the fulfilment of this saying of Malachi--part admonition, and part
   prophecy: For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should
   seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of
   hosts' (Mal 2:7). We can picture to ourselves how they who ministered
   in holy things would at eventide, when the Temple was deserted of its
   worshippers, gather to speak of the spiritual meaning of the services,
   and to consider the wonderful things which had taken place in
   Jerusalem, as some alleged, in fulfilment of those very types that
   formed the essence of their office and ministry. For this thing was not
   done in a corner.' The trial of Jesus, His condemnation by the
   Sanhedrim, and His being delivered up to the Gentiles, must have formed
   the theme of frequent and anxious discussion in the Temple. Were not
   their own chief priests implicated in the matter? Did not Judas on that
   fatal day rush into the Temple, and wildly cast the price of blood'
   into the treasury'? On the other hand, was not one of the principal
   priests and a member of the priestly council, Joseph of Arimathea, an
   adherent of Christ? Did not the Sanhedrist Nicodemus adopt the same
   views, and even Gamaliel advise caution? Besides, in the porches' of
   the Temple, especially in that of Solomon, a notable miracle' had been
   done in that Name,' and there also its all-prevailing power was daily
   proclaimed. It specially behoved the priesthood to inquire well into
   the matter; and the Temple seemed the most appropriate place for its
   discussion.

    The Number of Priests

   The number of priests to be found at all times in Jerusalem must have
   been very great, and Ophel a densely inhabited quarter. According to
   Jewish tradition, half of each of the twenty-four courses,' into which
   the priesthood were divided, were permanently resident in Jerusalem;
   the rest scattered over the land. It is added, that about one half of
   the latter had settled in Jericho, and were in the habit of supplying
   the needful support to their brethren while officiating in Jerusalem.
   Of course such statements must not be taken literally, though no doubt
   they are substantially correct. When a course' was on duty, all its
   members were bound to appear in the Temple. Those who stayed away, with
   such representatives of the people' (or stationary men') as, like them,
   had been prevented from going up' to Jerusalem in their turn, had to
   meet in the synagogues of their district to pray and to fast each day
   of their week of service, except on the sixth, the seventh, and the
   first--that is, neither on the Sabbath, nor on the days preceding and
   succeeding it, as the joy' attaching to the Sabbath rendered a fast
   immediately before or after it inappropriate.

    Symbolism of the Priesthood/Mediation

   It need scarcely be said, that everything connected with the priesthood
   was intended to be symbolical and typical--the office itself, its
   functions, even its dress and outward support. The fundamental design
   of Israel itself was to be unto Jehovah a kingdom of priests and an
   holy nation' (Exo 19:5, 6). This, however, could only be realised in
   the fulness of time.' At the very outset there was the barrier of sin;
   and in order to gain admittance to the ranks of Israel, when the sum of
   the children of Israel was taken after their number,' every man had to
   give the half-shekel, which in after times became the regular Temple
   contribution, as a ransom (covering) for his soul unto Jehovah' (Exo
   30:12, 13). But even so Israel was sinful, and could only approach
   Jehovah in the way which Himself opened, and in the manner which He
   appointed. Direct choice and appointment by God were the conditions
   alike of the priesthood, of sacrifices, feasts, and of every detail of
   service. The fundamental ideas which underlay all and connected it into
   a harmonious whole, were reconciliation and mediation: the one
   expressed by typically atoning sacrifices, the other by a typically
   intervening priesthood. Even the Hebrew term for priest (Cohen) denotes
   in its root-meaning one who stands up for another, and mediates in his
   cause.' [29]

   For this purpose God chose the tribe of Levi, and out of it again the
   family of Aaron, on whom He bestowed the priest's office as a gift'
   (Num 18:7). But the whole characteristics and the functions of the
   priesthood centred in the person of the high-priest. In accordance with
   their Divine calling' (Heb 5:4) was the special and exceptional
   provision made for the support of the priesthood. Its principle was
   thus expressed: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children
   of Israel'; and its joyousness, when realised in its full meaning and
   application, found vent in such words as Psalm 16:5, 6: Jehovah is the
   portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot. The
   lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
   heritage.'

    Holiness

   But there was yet another idea to be expressed by the priesthood. The
   object of reconciliation was holiness. Israel was to be a holy
   nation'--reconciled through the sprinkling of blood'; brought near to,
   and kept in fellowship with God by that means. The priesthood, as the
   representative offerers of that blood and mediators of the people, were
   also to show forth the holiness' of Israel. Every one knows how this
   was symbolised by the gold-plate which the high-priest wore on his
   forehead, and which bore the words: Holiness unto Jehovah.' But though
   the high-priest in this, as in every other respect, was the fullest
   embodiment of the functions and object of the priesthood, the same
   truth was also otherwise shown forth. The bodily qualifications
   required in the priesthood, the kind of defilements which would
   temporarily or wholly interrupt their functions, their mode of
   ordination, and even every portion, material, and colour of their
   distinctive dress were all intended to express in a symbolical manner
   this characteristic of holiness. In all these respects there was a
   difference between Israel and the tribe of Levi; between the tribe of
   Levi and the family of Aaron; and, finally, between an ordinary priest
   and the high-priest, who most fully typified our Great High-priest, in
   whom all these symbols have found their reality.

    The Twenty-four Courses

   This much it seemed necessary to state for the general understanding of
   the matter. Full details belong to the exposition of the meaning and
   object of the Levitical priesthood, as instituted by God, while our
   present task rather is to trace its further development to what it was
   at the time when Jesus was in the Temple. The first peculiarity of
   post-Mosaic times which we here meet, is the arrangement of the
   priesthood into twenty-four courses,' which undoubtedly dates from the
   times of David. But Jewish tradition would make it even much older.
   For, according to the Talmud, it should be traced up to Moses, who is
   variously supposed to have arranged the sons of Aaron into either or
   else sixteen courses (four, or else eight, of Eleazar; and the other
   four, or else eight, of Ithamar), to which, on the one supposition,
   Samuel and David each added other eight courses,' or, on the other,
   Samuel and David, in conjunction, the eight needed to make up the
   twenty-four mentioned in 1 Chronicles 24. It need scarcely be told
   that, like many similar statements, this also is simply an attempt to
   trace up every arrangement to the fountain-head of Jewish history, in
   order to establish its absolute authority. [30]

    The Courses After the Captivity

   The institution of David and of Solomon continued till the Babylonish
   captivity. Thence, however, only four out of the twenty-four courses'
   returned: those of Jedaiah, Immer, Pashur, and Harim (Ezra 2:36-39),
   the course of Jedaiah' being placed first because it was of the
   high-priest's family, of the house of Jeshua,' the son of Jozadak'
   (Ezra 3:2; Hagg 1:1; 1 Chron 6:15). To restore the original number,
   each of these four families was directed to draw five lots for those
   which had not returned, so as to form once more twenty-four courses,
   which were to bear the ancient names. Thus, for example, Zacharias, the
   father of John the Baptist, did not really belong to the family of
   Abijah (1 Chron 24:10), which had not returned from Babylon, but to the
   course of Abia,' which had been formed out of some other family, and
   only bore the ancient name (Luke 1:5). Like the priests, the Levites
   had at the time of King David been arranged into twenty-four courses,'
   which were to act as priests' assistance' (1 Chron 23:4, 28), as
   singers and musicians' (1 Chron 25:6), as gate-keepers and guards' (1
   Chron 26:6 and following), and as officers and judges.' Of these
   various classes, that of the priests' assistants' was by far the most
   numerous, [31] and to them the charge of the Temple had been committed
   in subordination to the priests.

   It had been their duty to look after the sacred vestments and vessels;
   the store-houses and their contents; and the preparation of the
   shewbread, of the meat-offerings, of the spices, etc. They were also
   generally to assist the priests in their work, to see to the cleaning
   of the sanctuary, and to take charge of the treasuries (1 Chron
   23:28-32).

    In the Temple of Herod

   Of course these services, as also those of the singers and musicians,
   and of the porters and guards, were retained in the Temple of Herod.
   But for the employment of Levites as officers and judges' there was no
   further room, not only because such judicial functions as still
   remained to the Jews were in the hands of the Sanhedrim and its
   subordinate authorities, but also because in general the ranks of the
   Levites were so thinned. In point of fact, while no less than 4, 289
   priests had returned from Babylon, the number of Levites was under 400
   (Ezra 2:40-42; Neh 7:43-45), of whom only 74 were priests' assistants.'
   To this the next immigration, under Ezra, added only 38, and that
   though the Levites had been specially searched for (Ezra 8:15, 18, 19).
   According to tradition, Ezra punished them by depriving them of their
   tithes. The gap in their number was filled up by 220 Nethinim (Ezra
   8:20), literally, given ones,' probably originally strangers and
   captives, [32] as in all likelihood the Gibeonites had been the first
   Nethinim' (Josh 9:21, 23, 27).

   Though the Nethinim, like the Levites and priests, were freed from all
   taxation (Ezra 7:24), and perhaps also from military service (Jos.
   Anti. iii. 12; iv. 4, 3.), the Rabbinists held them in the lowest
   repute--beneath a bastard, though above a proselyte--forbade their
   intermarrying with Israelites, and declared them incapable of proper
   membership in the congregation.

    Duties of Priests and Levites

   The duties of priests and Levites in the Temple may be gathered from
   Scripture, and will be further explained in the course of our
   inquiries. Generally, it may here be stated that on the Levites
   devolved the Temple-police, the guard of the gates, and the duty of
   keeping everything about the sanctuary clean and bright. But as at
   night the priests kept watch about the innermost places of the Temple,
   so they also opened and closed all the inner gates, while the Levites
   discharged this duty in reference to the outer gates, which led upon
   the Temple Mount (or Court of the Gentiles), and to the Beautiful
   Gate,' which formed the principal entrance into the Court of the Women.
   The laws of Levitical cleanness, as explained by the Rabbis, were most
   rigidly enforced upon worshippers and priests. If a leper, or any other
   who was defiled,' had ventured into the sanctuary itself, or any priest
   officiated in a state of uncleanness,' he would, if discovered, be
   dragged out and killed, without form of process, by the rebels'
   beating.' Minor punishments were awarded to those guilty of smaller
   offences of the same kind. The Sabbath-rest was strictly enforced, so
   far as consistent with the necessary duties of the Temple service. But
   the latter superseded the Sabbath law (Matt 12:5) and defilement on
   account of death. If the time for offering a sacrifice was not fixed,
   so that it might be brought on one day as well as another, then the
   service did not supersede either the Sabbath or defilement on account
   of death. But where the time was unalterably fixed, there the higher
   duty of obedience to a direct command came in to supersede alike the
   Sabbath and this one (but only this one) ground of defilement. The same
   principle applied to worshippers as well as priests.

    The Week's Service

   Each course' of priests and of Levites (as has already been stated)
   came on duty for a week, from one Sabbath to another. The service of
   the week was subdivided among the various families which constituted a
   course'; so that if it consisted of five houses of fathers,' three
   served each one day, and two each two days; if of six families, five
   served each one day, and one two days; if of eight families, six served
   each one day, and the other two in conjunction on one day; or, lastly,
   if of nine families, five served each one day, and the other four took
   it two in conjunction for two days. These divisions and arrangements
   were made by the chiefs' or heads of the houses of their fathers.' On
   Sabbaths the whole course' was on duty; on feast-days any priest might
   come up and join in the ministrations of the sanctuary; and at the
   Feast of Tabernacles all the twenty-four courses were bound to be
   present and officiate. While actually engaged on service in the Temple,
   the priests were not allowed to drink wine, either by day or by night.
   The other families' or houses' also of the course' who were in
   attendance at Jerusalem, though not on actual duty, were, during their
   week of ministry, prohibited the use of wine, except at night, because
   they might have to be called in to assist their brethren of the
   officiating family,' which they could not do if they had partaken of
   strong drink. The law even made (a somewhat curious) provision to
   secure that the priests should come up to Jerusalem properly trimmed,
   washed, and attired, so as to secure the decorum of the service.

    These Functions Not Sacerdotal

   It would be difficult to conceive arrangements more thoroughly or
   consistently opposed to what are commonly called priestly pretensions,'
   than those of the Old Testament. The fundamental principle, laid down
   at the outset, that all Israel were a kingdom of priests' (Exo 19:5,
   6), made the priesthood only representatives of the people. Their
   income, which even under the most favourable circumstances must have
   been moderate, was, as we have seen, dependent on the varying religious
   state of the nation, since no law existed by which either the payment
   of tithes or any other offerings could be enforced. How little power or
   influence, comparatively speaking, the priesthood wielded, is
   sufficiently known from Jewish history. Out of actual service neither
   the priests nor even the high-priest wore a distinctive dress (comp.
   Acts 23:5; see also chapter 7), and though a number of civil
   restrictions were laid on priests, there were few corresponding
   advantages. It is indeed true that alliances with distinguished
   priestly families were eagerly sought, and that during the troubled
   period of Syrian domination the high-priest for a time held civil as
   well as religious rule. But the latter advantage was dearly bought,
   both as regarded the priests and the nation.

   Nor must we forget the powerful controlling influence which Rabbinism
   exercised. Its tendency, which must never be lost sight of in the study
   of the state of Palestine at the time of our Lord, was steadily against
   all privileges other than those gained by traditionary learning and
   theological ingenuity. The Pharisee, or, rather, the man learned in the
   traditional law, was everything both before God and before man; but
   this people, who knoweth not the law,' were cursed,' plebeians, country
   people, unworthy of any regard or attention. Rabbinism applied these
   principles even in reference to the priesthood. It divided all priests
   into learned' and unlettered,' and excluded the latter from some of the
   privileges of their own order. Thus there were certain priestly dues
   which the people might at will give to any priest they chose. But from
   some of them the unlettered' priests were debarred, on the ostensible
   ground that in their ignorance they might have partaken of them in a
   state of Levitical uncleanness, and so committed mortal sin.

    Training of Priests

   In general, the priests had to undergo a course of instruction, and
   were examined before being allowed to officiate. Similarly, they were
   subject to the ordinary tribunals, composed of men learned in the law,
   without regard to their descent from one or another tribe. The ordained
   rulers' of the synagogues, the teachers of the people, the leaders of
   their devotions, and all other officials were not necessarily priests,'
   but simply chosen for their learning and fitness. Any one whom the
   elders' or rulers' deemed qualified for it might, at their request,
   address to the people on the Sabbath a word of exhortation.' Even the
   high-priest himself was answerable to the Sanhedrim. It is distinctly
   stated, that if he committed an offence which by the law deserved
   whipping, the Great Sanhedrim whipt him, and then had him restored
   again to his office.' Every year a kind of ecclesiastical council was
   appointed to instruct him in his duties for the Day of Atonement, in
   case he were not learned,' or, at any rate, to see to it that he knew
   and remembered them. Nay, the principle was broadly laid down--that a
   scholar, though he were a bastard, was of far higher value than an
   unlearned high-priest.' If, besides all this, it is remembered how the
   political influence of the high-priest had decayed in the days of
   Herod, and how frequently the occupants of that office changed, through
   the caprice of the rulers or through bribery, the state of public
   feeling will be readily understood.

   At the same time, it must be admitted, that generally speaking the
   high-priest would, of necessity, wield very considerable influence, and
   that, ordinarily, those who held the sacred office were not only
   lettered,' but members of the Sanhedrim. According to Jewish tradition,
   the high-priest ought, in every respect, to excel all other priests,
   and if he were poor, the rest were to contribute, so as to secure him
   an independent fortune. Certain marks of outward respect were also
   shown him. When he entered the Temple he was accompanied by three
   persons--one walking at each side, the third behind him. He might,
   without being appointed to it, officiate in any part of the Temple
   services; he had certain exceptional rights; and he possessed a house
   in the Temple, where he lived by day, retiring only at night to his own
   home, which must be within Jerusalem, and to which he was escorted by
   the people after the solemnities of the Day of Atonement, which
   devolved almost exclusively upon him.

    Office Hereditary

   Originally the office of high-priest was regarded as being held for
   life and hereditary; [33] but the troubles of later times made it a
   matter of cabal, crime, or bribery.

   Without here entering into the complicated question of the succession
   to the high-priesthood, the following may be quoted from the Talmud
   (Talmud Jer. Ioma, I.), without, of course, guaranteeing its absolute
   accuracy: In the first Temple, the high-priests served, the son
   succeeding the father, and they were eighteen in number. But in the
   second Temple they got the high-priesthood for money; and there are who
   say they destroyed each other by witchcraft, so that some reckon 80
   high-priests during that period, others 81, others 82, 83, 84, and even
   85.' The Rabbis enumerate 18 high-priests during the first Temple;
   Lightfoot counts 53 from the return from Babylon to Matthias, when the
   last war of the Jews began; while Relandius reckons 57. But there is
   both difficulty and confusion amid the constant changes at the last.

   There was not any fixed age for entering on the office of high-priest,
   any more than on that of an ordinary priest. The Talmudists put it down
   at twenty years. But the unhappy descendant of the Maccabees,
   Aristobulus, was only sixteen years of age when his beauty, as he
   officiated as high-priest in the Temple, roused the jealousy of Herod,
   and procured his death. The entrance of the Levites is fixed, in the
   sacred text, at thirty during the wilderness period, and after that,
   when the work would require less bodily strength, but a larger number
   of ministers, at twenty-five years of age. [34]

    Disqualifications for the Priesthood

   No special disqualifications for the Levitical office existed, though
   the Rabbis insist that a good voice was absolutely necessary. It was
   otherwise with the priest's office. The first inquiry instituted by the
   Sanhedrim, who for the purpose sat daily in the Hall of Polished
   Stones,' was into the genealogy of a candidate. Certain genealogies
   were deemed authoritative. Thus, if his father's name were inscribed in
   the archives of Jeshana at Zipporim, no further inquiry was made.' If
   he failed to satisfy the court about his perfect legitimacy, the
   candidate was dressed and veiled in black, and permanently removed. If
   he passed that ordeal, inquiry was next made as to any physical
   defects, of which Maimonides enumerates a hundred and forty that
   permanently, and twenty-two which temporarily disqualified for the
   exercise of the priestly office. Persons so disqualified were, however,
   admitted to menial offices, such as in the wood-chamber, and entitled
   to Temple support. Those who had stood the twofold test were dressed in
   white raiment, and their names properly inscribed. To this pointed
   allusion is made in Revelation 3:5, He that overcometh, the same shall
   be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of
   the book of life.'

    The Investiture

   Thus received, and afterwards instructed in his duties, the formal
   admission alike of the priest and of the high-priest was not, as of
   old, by anointing, but simply by investiture. For even the composition
   of the sacred oil was no longer known in the second Temple. They were
   called high-priests by investiture,' and regarded as of inferior rank
   to those by anointing.' As for the common priests, the Rabbis held that
   they were not anointed even in the first Temple, the rite which was
   applied to the sons of Aaron being valid also for their descendants. It
   was otherwise in the case of the high-priest. His investiture was
   continued during seven days. In olden days, when he was anointed, the
   sacred oil was not only poured over him,' but also applied to his
   forehead, over the eyes, as tradition has it, after the form of the
   Greek letter X. The coincidence is certainly curious. This sacred oil
   was besides only used for anointing such kings as were of the family of
   David, not other Jewish monarchs, and if their succession had been
   called in question. Otherwise the royal dignity went, as a matter of
   course, by inheritance from father to son.

    The Dress of the High-priest

   The high-priests by investiture' had not any more the real Urim and
   Thummim (their meaning even being unknown), though a breast-plate, with
   twelve stones, was made and worn, in order to complete the eight sacred
   vestments. This was just double the number of those worn by an ordinary
   priest, viz. the linen breeches, the coat, the girdle, and the bonnet.
   To these the high-priest added other four distinctive articles of
   dress, called golden vestments,' because, unlike the robes of the
   ordinary priests, gold, the symbol of splendour, appeard in them. They
   were the Meil, or robe of the ephod, wholly of woven work,' of dark
   blue colour, descending to the knees, and adorned at the hem by
   alternate blossoms of the pomegranate in blue, purple, and scarlet, and
   golden bells, the latter, according to tradition, seventy-two in
   number; the Ephod with the breast-plate, the former of the four colours
   of the sanctuary (white, blue, purple, and scarlet), and inwrought with
   threads of gold; the Mitre; and, lastly, the Ziz, or golden frontlet.
   If either a priest or the high-priest officiated without wearing the
   full number of his vestments, his service would be invalid, as also if
   anything, however trifling (such, for instance, as a plaster), had
   intervened between the body and the dress of the priest. The material
   of which the four vestments of the ordinary priest were made was
   linen,' or, more accurately, byssus,' the white shining cotton-stuff of
   Egypt. These two qualities of the byssus are specially marked as
   characteristic (Rev 15:6, clothed in pure and shining linen.'), and on
   them part of the symbolic meaning depended. Hence we read in Revelation
   19:8, And to her'--the wife of the Lamb made ready--'was granted that
   she should be arrayed in byssus vestments, shining and pure; for the
   byssus vestment is the righteousness of the saints.'

    Allusions to the Dress in the New Testament

   We add some further particulars, chiefly in illustration of allusions
   in the New Testament. The priest's coat' was woven of one piece, like
   the seamless robe of the Saviour (John 19:23). As it was close-fitting,
   the girdle could not, strictly speaking, have been necessary. Besides,
   although the account of the Rabbis, that the priest's girdle was three
   fingers broad and sixteen yards long (!), is exaggerated, no doubt it
   really reached beyond the feet, and required to be thrown over the
   shoulder during ministration. Hence its object must chiefly have been
   symbolical. In point of fact, it may be regarded as the most
   distinctive priestly vestment, since it was only put on during actual
   ministration, and put off immediately afterwards. Accordingly, when in
   Revelation 1:13, the Saviour is seen in the midst of the candlesticks,'
   girt about the paps with a golden girdle,' we are to understand by it
   that our heavenly High-Priest is there engaged in actual ministry for
   us. Similarly, the girdle is described as about the paps,' or (as in
   Rev 15:6) about the breasts,' as both the girdle of the ordinary priest
   and that on the ephod which the high-priest wore were girded there, and
   not round the loins (compare Eze 44:18). Lastly, the expression golden
   girdle' may bear reference to the circumstance that the dress peculiar
   of the high-priest was called his golden vestments,' in
   contradistinction to the linen vestments,' which he wore on the Day of
   Atonement.

    The Breast-plate/Mitre/Phylacteries/The Ziz

   Of the four distinctive articles in the high-priest's dress, the
   breast-plate, alike from its square form and the twelve jewels on it,
   bearing the names of the tribes, suggest the city four-square,' whose
   foundations' are twelve precious stones (Rev 21:16, 19, 20). The mitre'
   of the high-priest differed from the head-gear of the ordinary priest,
   which was shaped like the inverted calyx of a flower, in size and
   probably also somewhat in shape. According to the Rabbis, it was eight
   yards high (!!). Fastened to it by two (according to the Rabbis, by
   three) ribbons of blue lace' was the symbol of royalty--the golden
   plate' (or Ziz), on which, Holiness unto Jehovah' was graven. This
   plate was only two fingers wide, and reached from temple to temple.
   Between this plate and the mitre the high-priest is by some supposed to
   have worn his phylacteries. But this cannot be regarded as by any means
   a settled point. According to the distinct ceremony of the Talmud,
   neither priests, Levites, nor the stationary men' wore phylacteries
   during their actual service in the Temple. This is a strong point urged
   by the modern Karaite Jews against the traditions of the Rabbis. Can it
   be, that the wearing of phylacteries at the time of Christ was not a
   universally acknowledged obligation, but rather the badge of a party?
   This would give additional force to the words in which Christ inveighed
   against those who made broad their phylacteries. According to Josephus,
   the original Ziz of Aaron still existed in his time, and was carried
   with other spoils to Rome. There R. Eliezer saw it in the reign of
   Hadrian. Thence we can trace it, with considerable probability, through
   many vicissitudes, to the time of Belisarius, and to Byzantium. From
   there it was taken by order of the emperor to Jerusalem. What became of
   it afterwards is unknown; possibly it may still be in existence. [35]

   It only requires to be added that the priests' garments, when soiled,
   were not washed, but used as wicks for the lamps in the Temple; those
   of the high-priest were hid away.' The high-priest wore a fresh suit of
   linen vestments' each time on the Day of Atonement.

    The Fourteen Officers

   The priesthood ministering in the Temple were arranged into ordinary'
   priests and various officials. Of the latter there were, besides the
   high-priest, [36] the Sagan,' or suffragan priest; two Katholikin,' or
   chief treasurers and overseers; seven Ammarcalin,' who were subordinate
   to the Katholikin, and had chief charge of all the gates; and three
   Gizbarin,' or under-treasurers.

   These fourteen officers, ranking in the order mentioned, formed the
   standing council of the Temple,' which regulated everything connected
   with the affairs and services of the sanctuary. Its members were also
   called the elders of the priests,' or the counsellors.' This
   judicatory, which ordinarily did not busy itself with criminal
   questions, apparently took a leading part in the condemnation of Jesus.
   But, on the other hand, it is well to remember that they were not all
   of one mind, since Joseph of Arimathea belonged to their number--the
   title by which he is designated in Mark 15:43 being exactly the same
   word as that applied in the Talmud to the members of this priestly
   council.

    Their Duties

   It is difficult to specify the exact duties of each of these classes of
   officials. The Sagan' (or Segen,' or Segan') would officiate for the
   high-priest, when from any cause he was incapacitated; he would act
   generally as his assistance, and take the oversight of all the priests,
   whence he is called in Scripture second priest' (2 Kings 25:18; Jer
   52:24), and in Talmudical writings the Sagan of the priests.' A
   Chananjah' is mentioned in the Talmud as a Sagan, but whether or not he
   was the Annas' of the New Testament must be left undecided. The two
   Katholikin were to the Sagan what he was to the high-priest, though
   their chief duty seems to have been about the treasures of the Temple.
   Similarly, the seven Ammarcalin were assistants of the Katholikin,
   though they had special charge of the gates, the holy vessels, and the
   holy vestments; and again the three (or else seven), Gizbarin'
   assistants of the Ammarcalin. The title Gizbar' occurs so early as Ezra
   1:8; but its exact meaning seems to have been already unknown when the
   LXX translated that book. They appear to have had charge of all
   dedicated and consecrated things, of the Temple tribute, of the
   redemption money, etc., and to have decided all questions connected
   with such matters.

    Lower Officials

   Next in rank to these officials were the heads of each course' on duty
   for a week, and then the heads of families' of every course. After them
   followed fifteen overseers, viz. the overseer concerning the times,'
   who summoned priests and people to their respective duties; the
   overseer for shutting the doors (under the direction, of course, of the
   Ammarcalin); the overseer of the guards, or captain of the Temple; the
   overseer of the singers and of those who blew the trumpets; the
   overseer of the cymbals; the overseer of the lots, which were drawn
   every morning; the overseer of the birds, who had to provide the
   turtledoves and pigeons for those who brought such offerings; the
   overseer of the seals, who dispensed the four counterfoils for the
   various meat-offerings suited for different sacrifices; the overseer of
   the drink-offerings, for a similar purpose to the above; the overseer
   of the sick, or the Temple physician; the overseer of the water, who
   had charge of the water-supply and the drainage; the overseer for
   making the shewbread; for preparing the incense; for making the veils;
   and for providing the priestly garments. All these officers had, of
   course, subordinates, whom they chose and employed, either for the day
   or permanently; and it was their duty to see to all the arrangements
   connected with their respective departments. Thus, not to speak of
   instructors, examiners of sacrifices, and a great variety of
   artificers, there must have been sufficient employment in the Temple
   for a very large number of persons.

    Sources of Support for the Priests

   We must not close without enumerating the twenty-four sources whence,
   according to the Talmud, the priests derived their support. Of these
   ten were only available while in the Temple itself, four in Jerusalem,
   and the remaining ten throughout the Holy Land. Those which might only
   be used in the Temple itself were the priest's part of the
   sin-offering; that of the trespass-offering for a known, and for a
   doubtful trespass; public peace-offerings; the leper's log of oil; the
   two Pentecostal loaves; the shewbread; what was left of meat-offerings,
   and the omer at the Passover. The four which might be used only in
   Jerusalem were the firstlings of beasts, the Biccurim, [37] the portion
   from the thank-offering (Lev 7:12; 22:29, 30), and from the Nazarite's
   goat, and the skins of the holy sacrifices.

   Of the ten which might be used throughout the land, five could be given
   at will to any priest, viz. the tithe of the tithe, the heave-offering
   of the dough (Num 15:20; Rom 11:16), the first of the fleece and the
   priest's due of meat (Deut 18:3). The other five, it was thought,
   should be given to the priests of the special course on duty for the
   week, viz. the redemption-money for a first-born son, that for an ass,
   the sanctified field of possession' (Lev 27:16), what had been
   devoted,' and such possession of a stranger' or proselyte as, having
   been stolen, was restored to the priests after the death of the person
   robbed, with a fifth part additional. Finally, to an unlettered priest
   it was only lawful to give the following from among the various dues:
   things devoted,' the first-born of cattle, the redemption of a son,
   that of an ass, the priest's due (Deut 18:3), the first of the wool,
   the oil of burning' (a term meaning defiled Therumoth.'), the ten
   things which were to be used in the Temple itself, and the Biccurim. On
   the other hand, the high-priest had the right to take what portion of
   the offerings he chose, and one half of the shewbread every Sabbath
   also belonged to him.

   Thus elaborate in every particular was the system which regulated the
   admission, the services, and the privileges of the officiating
   priesthood. Yet it has all vanished, not leaving behind it in the
   synagogue even a single trace of its complicated and perfect
   arrangements. These old things are passed away,' because they were only
   a shadow of good things to come.' But the substance is of Christ,' and
   He abideth an High-Priest for ever.'

   [29] This root-meaning (through the Arabic) of the Hebrew word for
   priest, as one intervening, explains its occasional though very rare
   application to others than priests, as, for example, to the sons of
   David (2 Sam 8:18), a mode of expression which is thus correctly
   paraphrased in 1 Chronicles 18:17: And the sons of David were at the
   hand of the king.'

   [30] Curiously enough, here also the analogy between Rabbinism and
   Roman Catholicism holds good. Each claims for its teaching and
   practices the so-called principle of catholicity--'semper, ubique, ab
   omnibus' (always, everywhere, by all'), and each invents the most
   curious historical fables in support of it!

   [31] Apparently it numbered 24,000, out of a total of 38,000 Levites.

   [32] This is also confirmed by their foreign names (Ezra 2:43-58). The
   total number of Nethinim who returned from Babylon was 612--392 with
   Zerubbabel (Ezra 2:58; Neh 7:60), and 220 with Ezra (Ezra 8:20).

   [33] According to the Rabbis, he was appointed by the Sanhedrim.

   [34] It is thus we reconcile Numbers 4:3 with 8:24, 25. In point of
   fact, these two reasons are expressly mentioned in 1 Chronicles
   23:24-27, as influencing David still further to lower the age of
   entrance to twenty.

   [35] When Josephus speaks of a triple crown worn by the high-priest,
   this may have been introduced by the Asmoneans when they united the
   temporal monarchy with the priesthood. Compare Smith's Dictionary of
   the Bible, i. 807a.

   [36] The Rabbis speak of a high-priest ordained for war,' who
   accompanied the people to battle, but no historical trace of a distinct
   office of this kind can be discovered.

   [37] To prevent mistakes, we may state that the term Therumoth' is, in
   a general way, used to designate the prepared produce, such as oil,
   flour, wine; and Biccurim,' the natural product of the soil, such as
   corn, fruits, etc.

Chapter 5

  Sacrifices: Their Order and Their Meaning

   There are priests that offer gifts according to the law: who serve unto
   the example and shadow of heavenly things.'--Hebrews 8:4, 5.

   It is a curious fact, but sadly significant, that modern Judaism should
   declare neither sacrifices nor a Levitical priesthood to belong to the
   essence of the Old Testament; that, in fact, they had been foreign
   elements imported into it--tolerated, indeed, by Moses, but against
   which the prophets earnestly protested and incessantly laboured. The
   only arguments by which this strange statement is supported are, that
   the Book of Deuteronomy contains merely a brief summary, not a detailed
   repetition, of sacrificial ordinances, and that such passages as Isaiah
   1:11, etc., Micah 6:6, etc., inveigh against sacrifices offered without
   real repentance or change of mind. Yet this anti-sacrificial, or, as we
   may call it, anti-spiritual, tendency is really of much earlier date.
   For the sacrifices of the Old Testament were not merely outward
   observances--a sort of work-righteousness which justified the offerer
   by the mere fact of his obedience--since it is not possible that the
   blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins' (Heb 10:4).

    Symbolism of the Sacrifices

   The sacrifices of the Old Testament were symbolical and typical. An
   outward observance without any real inward meaning is only a ceremony.
   But a rite which has a present spiritual meaning is a symbol; and if,
   besides, it also points to a future reality, conveying at the same
   time, by anticipation, the blessing that is yet to appear, it is a
   type. Thus the Old Testament sacrifices were not only symbols, nor yet
   merely predictions by fact (as prophecy is a prediction by word), but
   they already conveyed to the believing Israelite the blessing that was
   to flow from the future reality to which they pointed. Hence the
   service of the letter and the work-righteousness of the Scribes and
   Pharisees ran directly contrary to this hope of faith and spiritual
   view of sacrifices, which placed all on the level of sinners to be
   saved by the substitution of another, to whom they pointed. Afterwards,
   when the destruction of the Temple rendered its services impossible,
   another and most cogent reason was added for trying to substitute other
   things, such as prayers, fasts, etc., in room of the sacrifices.
   Therefore, although none of the older Rabbis has ventured on such an
   assertion as that of modern Judaism, the tendency must have been
   increasingly in that direction. In fact, it had become a
   necessity--since to declare sacrifices of the essence of Judaism would
   have been to pronounce modern Judaism an impossibility. But thereby
   also the synagogue has given sentence against itself, and by disowning
   sacrifices has placed itself outside the pale of the Old Testament.

    Sacrifices the Centre of the Old Testament

   Every unprejudiced reader of the Bible must feel that sacrifices
   constitute the centre of the Old Testament. Indeed, were this the
   place, we might argue from their universality that, along with the
   acknowledgment of a Divine power, the dim remembrance of a happy past,
   and the hope of a happier future, sacrifices belonged to the primeval
   traditions which mankind inherited from Paradise. To sacrifice seems as
   natural' to man as to pray; the one indicates what he feels about
   himself, the other what he feels about God. The one means a felt need
   of propitiation; the other a felt sense of dependence.

    The Idea of Substitution

   The fundamental idea of sacrifice in the Old Testament is that of
   substitution, which again seems to imply everything else--atonement and
   redemption, vicarious punishment and forgiveness. The firstfruits go
   for the whole products; the firstlings for the flock; the
   redemption-money for that which cannot be offered; and the life of the
   sacrifice, which is in its blood (Lev 17:11), for the life of the
   sacrificer. Hence also the strict prohibition to partake of blood. Even
   in the Korban,' gift (Mark 7:11) or free-will offering, it is still the
   gift for the giver. This idea of substitution, as introduced, adopted,
   and sanctioned by God Himself, is expressed by the sacrificial term
   rendered in our version atonement,' but which really means covering,
   the substitute in the acceptance of God taking the place of, and so
   covering, as it were, the person of the offerer. Hence the Scriptural
   experience: Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
   covered . . . unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity' (Psa 32:1, 2);
   and perhaps also the Scriptural prayer: Behold, O God, our shield, and
   look upon the face of Thine Anointed' (Psa 84:9). Such sacrifices,
   however, necessarily pointed to a mediatorial priesthood, through whom
   alike they and the purified worshippers should be brought near to God,
   and kept in fellowship with Him. Yet these priests themselves
   continually changed; their own persons and services needed
   purification, and their sacrifices required constant renewal, since, in
   the nature of it, such substitution could not be perfect. In short, all
   this was symbolical (of man's need, God's mercy, and His covenant), and
   typical, till He should come to whom it all pointed, and who had all
   along given reality to it; He whose Priesthood was perfect, and who on
   a perfect altar brought a perfect sacrifice, once for all--a perfect
   Substitute, and a perfect Mediator (Heb 10:1-24).

    The Paschal Lamb

   At the very threshold of the Mosaic dispensation stands the sacrifice
   of the Paschal Lamb connected with the redemption of Israel, and which
   in many respects must be regarded as typical, or rather anticipatory,
   of all the others. But there was one sacrifice which, even under the
   Old Testament, required no renewal. It was when God had entered into
   covenant relationship with Israel, and Israel became the people of
   God.' Then Moses sprinkled the blood of the covenant' on the altar and
   on the people (Exo 24). On the ground of this covenant-sacrifice all
   others rested (Psa 50:5). These were, then, either sacrifices of
   communion with God, or else intended to restore that communion when it
   had been disturbed or dimmed through sin and trespass: sacrifices in
   communion, or for communion with God. To the former class belong the
   burnt- and the peace-offerings; to the latter, the sin- and the
   trespass-offerings. But, as without the shedding of blood there is no
   remission of sin, every service and every worshipper had, so to speak,
   to be purified by blood, and the mediatorial agency of the priesthood
   called in to bring near unto God, and to convey the assurance of
   acceptance.

    Bloody and Unbloody Offerings

   The readiest, but perhaps the most superficial, arrangement of
   sacrifices is into bloody and unbloody. The latter, or Minchah,'
   included, besides the meat- and drink-offering, the first sheaf at the
   Passover, the two loaves at Pentecost, and the shewbread. The
   meat-offering was only brought alone in two instance--the priest's
   offering (Lev 7:12) and that of jealousy (Num 5:15), to which Jewish
   tradition adds the meat-offerings mentioned in Leviticus 2. If in
   Leviticus 5:11 a meat-offering is allowed in cases of extreme poverty
   as a substitute for a sin-offering, this only further proves the
   substitutionary character of sacrifices. From all this it will be
   evident that, as a general rule, the meat-offering cannot be regarded
   as separate from the other or bloody sacrifices. In proof of this, it
   always varied in quantity, according to the kind of sacrifice which it
   accompanied (Num 15:1-12; 28:1-12; 39:1, etc.).

    The Requisites of Sacrifice

   The general requisites of all sacrifices were--that they should be
   brought of such things, in such place and manner, and through such
   mediatorial agency, as God had appointed. Thus the choice and the
   appointment of the mode of approaching Him, were to be all of God. Then
   it was a first principle that every sacrifice must be of such things as
   had belonged to the offerer. None other could represent him or take his
   place before God. Hence the Pharisees were right when, in opposition to
   the Sadducees, they carried it that all public sacrifices (which were
   offered for the nation as a whole) should be purchased, not from
   voluntary contributions, but from the regular Temple revenues. Next,
   all animal sacrifices were to be free of blemishes (of which the Rabbis
   enumerate seventy-three), and all unbloody offerings to be without
   admixture of leaven or of honey; the latter probably because, from its
   tendency to fermentation or corruption, it resembled leaven. For a
   similar reason salt, as the symbol of incorruption, was to be added to
   all sacrifices. [38]

   Hence we read in Mark 9:49--'For every one shall be salted with fire,
   and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt'; that is, as the salt is
   added to the sacrifice symbolically to point to its incorruption, so
   the reality and permanence of our Christian lives will be brought out
   by the fire of the great day, when what is wood, hay, and stubble shall
   be consumed; while that which is real shall prove itself incorruptible,
   having had the fire applied to it.

    The Creatures Appointed

   In Scripture three kinds of four-footed beasts--oxen, sheep, and goats;
   and two of birds--turtle-doves and young pigeons--are appointed for
   sacrifices. [39]

   The latter, except in certain purifications, are only allowed as
   substitutes for other sacrifices in case of poverty. Hence also no
   direction is given either as to their age or sex, though the Rabbis
   hold that the turtle-doves (which were the common birds of passage)
   should be fully grown, and the domestic pigeons young birds. But, as in
   the various sacrifices of oxen, sheep, and goats there were differences
   of age and sex, the Jews enumerate twelve sacrifices, to which as many
   terms in Scripture correspond. The Paschal lamb and that for the
   trespass-offerings required to be males, as well as all burnt- and all
   public sacrifices. The latter made void the Sabbath and defilement,'
   i.e. they superseded the law of Sabbath rest (Matt 12:5), and might be
   continued, notwithstanding one kind of Levitical defilement--that by
   death.

    The Eleven Sacrifices of the Rabbis

   The Rabbis, who are very fond of subtle distinctions, also speak of
   public sacrifices that resembled the private, and of private sacrifices
   that resembled the public, in that they also made void the Sabbath and
   defilement.' Altogether they enumerate eleven public sacrifices, viz.
   the daily sacrifices; the additional for the Sabbath; for the New Moon;
   the Passover sacrifices; the lamb when the sheaf was waved; the
   Pentecostal sacrifices; those brought with the two first loaves; New
   Year's; Atonement Day sacrifices; those on the first day of, and those
   on the octave of Tabernacles.' Private sacrifices they classify as
   those on account of sins by word or deed; those on account of what
   concerned the body (such as various defilements); those on account of
   property (firstlings, tithes); those on account of festive seasons; and
   those on account of vows or promises. Yet another division of
   sacrifices was into those due, or prescribed, and those voluntary. For
   the latter nothing could be used that had previously been vowed, since
   it would already belong unto God.

    Holy and Less Holy

   But of far greater importance is the arrangement of sacrifices into the
   most holy and the less holy, which is founded on Scripture (Lev 6:17;
   7:1; 14:13). Certain meat-offerings (Lev 2:3, 10; 6:17; 10:12), and all
   burnt-, sin-, and trespass-sacrifices, as well as all public
   peace-offerings, were most holy. Such were to be offered or sacrificed
   in one of the more holy places; they were slain at the north side of
   the altar [40] (the less holy at the east or south side); and they were
   either not partaken of at all, or else only by the officiating priests,
   and within the court of the Temple.

   The skins of the most holy sacrifices, except such as were wholly
   burnt, belonged to the priests; those of the less holy to the offerers.
   In the latter case they also partook of their flesh, the only exception
   being the firstlings, which were eaten by the priests alone. The Rabbis
   attach ten comparative degrees of sanctity to sacrifices; and it is
   interesting to mark that of these the first belonged to the blood of
   the sin-offering; the second to the burnt-offering; the third to the
   sin-offering itself; and the fourth to the trespass-offering. Lastly,
   all sacrifices had to be brought before actual sunset, although the
   unconsumed flesh might smoulder on the altar till next dawn.

    The Acts of Sacrifice

   The Rabbis mention the following five acts as belonging to the offerer
   of a sacrifice: the laying on of hands, slaying, skinning, cutting up,
   and washing the inwards. These other five were strictly priestly
   functions: catching up the blood, sprinkling it, lighting the altar
   fire, laying on the wood, bringing up the pieces, and all else done at
   the altar itself.

   The whole service must have been exceedingly solemn. Having first been
   duly purified, a man brought his sacrifice himself before the
   Lord'--anciently, to the door of the Tabernacle' (Lev 1:3; 4:4), where
   the altar of burnt-offering was (Exo 40:6), and in the Temple into the
   Great Court. If the sacrifice was most holy, he entered by the
   northern; if less holy, by the southern gate. Next he placed it so as
   to face the west, or the Most Holy Place, in order thus literally to
   bring it before the Lord. To this the apostle refers when, in Romans
   12:1, he beseecheth us to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
   acceptable unto God.'

    Laying on of Hands

   But this was only the commencement of the service. Women might bring
   their sacrifices into the Great Court; but they might not perform the
   second rite--that of laying on of hands. This meant transmission and
   delegation, and implied representation; so that it really pointed to
   the substitution of the sacrifice for the sacrificer. Hence it was
   always accompanied by confession of sin and prayer. It was thus done.
   The sacrifice was so turned that the person confessing looked towards
   the west, while he laid his hands between the horns of the sacrifice,
   [41] and if the sacrifice was brought by more than one, each had to lay
   on his hands.

   It is not quite a settled point whether one or both hands were laid on;
   but all are agreed that it was to be done with one's whole force'--as
   it were, to lay one's whole weight upon the substitute. [42]

   If a person under vow had died, his heir-at-law took his place. The
   only public sacrifices in which hands were laid on were those for sins
   of public ignorance (Lev 4:15; 16:21), when the elders' acted as
   representing the people--to which some Rabbinical authorities add
   public sin-offerings in general (on the ground of 2 Chron 29:23)--and
   the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement, on which the high-priest laid
   his hands. In all private sacrifices, except firstlings, tithes, and
   the Paschal lamb, hands were laid on, and, while doing so, the
   following prayer was repeated: I entreat, O Jehovah: I have sinned, I
   have done perversely, I have rebelled, I have committed (naming the
   sin, trespass, or, in case of a burnt-offering, the breach of positive
   or negative command); but I return in repentance, and let this be for
   my atonement (covering).' According to Maimonides, in peace-offerings a
   record of God's praise, rather than a confession of sins, was spoken.
   But, as the principle prevailed that frequent confession even without
   sacrifice was meritorious, another formula is also recorded, in which
   the allusion to sacrifices is omitted.

   Closely connected with this was the lifting and waving' of certain
   sacrifices. The priest put his hands under those of the offerer, and
   moved the sacrifice upwards and downwards, right and left; according to
   Abarbanel also forwards and backwards.' The lamb of the leper's
   trespass-offering was waved before it was slain (Lev 14:24); private
   peace-offerings, only after they had been slain; while in public
   peace-offerings, the practice varied.

    Sacrifices Slain by Priests Only

   Under ordinary circumstances all public sacrifices, and also always
   that of the leper, were slain by the priests. [43]

   The Talmud declares the offering of birds, so as to secure the blood,
   [44] to have been the most difficult part of a priest's work.

   For the death of the sacrifice was only a means towards an end, that
   end being the shedding and sprinkling of the blood, by which the
   atonement was really made. The Rabbis mention a variety of rules
   observed by the priest who caught up the blood--all designed to make
   the best provision for its proper sprinkling. [45]

   Thus the priest was to catch up the blood in a silver vessel pointed at
   the bottom, so that it could not be put down, and to keep it constantly
   stirred, to preserve the fluidity of the blood. In the sacrifice of the
   red heifer, however, the priest caught the blood directly in his left
   hand, and sprinkled it with his right towards the Holy Place: while in
   that of the leper one of the two priests received the blood in the
   vessel; the other in his hand, from which he anointed the purified
   leper (Lev 4:25).

    The Application of the Blood

   According to the difference of sacrifices, the blood was differently
   applied, and in different places. In all burnt-, trespass-, and
   peace-offerings the blood was thrown directly out of the vessel or
   vessels in which it had been caught, the priest going first to one
   corner of the altar and then to the other, and throwing it in the form
   of the Greek Letter gamma, so that each time two sides of the altar
   were covered. Any blood left after these two gifts,' as they were
   called (which stood for four), was poured out at the base of the altar,
   whence it flowed into the Kedron. In all sin-offerings the blood was
   not thrown, but sprinkled, the priest dipping the forefinger of his
   right hand into the blood, and then sprinkling it from his finger by a
   motion of the thumb. According to the importance of the sin-offering,
   the blood was so applied either to the four horns of the altar of
   burnt-offering, or else it was brought into the Holy Place itself, and
   sprinkled first seven times towards the veil of the Most Holy Place
   (Lev 4:6, 17), and then on the four horns of the golden altar of
   incense, beginning at the north-east. Finally, on the Day of Atonement
   the blood was sprinkled within the Most Holy Place itself. From all
   sin-offerings the blood of which was sprinkled on the horns of the
   altar of burnt-offering certain portions were to be eaten, while those
   whose blood was brought into the Holy Place itself were wholly burnt.
   But in the sacrifices of firstlings, of tithes of animals, and of the
   Paschal lamb, the blood was neither thrown nor sprinkled, and only
   poured out at the base of the altar.

    The Flaying

   On the shedding of blood, which was of the greatest importance--since,
   according to the Talmud, whenever the blood touches the altar the
   offerer is atoned for'--followed the flaying' of the sacrifice and the
   cutting up into his pieces.' All this had to be done in an orderly
   manner, and according to certain rules, the apostle adopting the
   sacrificial term when he speaks of rightly dividing the word of truth'
   (2 Tim 2:15). The inwards' and legs' having been washed (Lev 1:9), and
   dried with sponges, the separate pieces of the sacrifice were brought
   up by various priests: the calculation of the Rabbis being, that in the
   case of a sheep or a she-goat six priests carried the sacrifice, one
   more the meat-, and another the drink-offering (in all eight); while in
   that of a ram twelve, and in that of a bullock four-and-twenty priests
   were needed for the service. Next, the sacrificial salt was applied,
   and then the pieces were first confusedly thrown and then arranged upon
   the fire. [46] This latter part of the service requires explanation.

    The Burning

   The common idea that the burning either of part or the whole of the
   sacrifice pointed to its destruction, and symbolised the wrath of God
   and the punishment due to sin, does not seem to accord with the
   statements of Scripture. The term used is not that commonly employed
   for burning, but means causing to smoke,' and the rite symbolises
   partly the entire surrender of the sacrifice, but chiefly its
   acceptance on the part of God. Thus the sacrifice consumed by a fire
   which had originally come down from God Himself--not by strange
   fire--would ascend for a sweet savour unto the Lord' (Lev 1:9; 4:31).
   Even the circumstance that the fire for the altar of incense was always
   taken from that on the altar of burnt-offering, shows that, while that
   fire might symbolise the presence of a holy Jehovah in His house, it
   could not refer to the fire of wrath or of punishment. [47]

   As already stated, those parts of the sin-, trespass-, [48] and public
   peace-offerings, which were allowed to be eaten, could only be partaken
   of by the priests (not their families) during their actual ministry,
   and within the Temple walls.

   The flesh of these offerings had also to be eaten on the day of the
   sacrifice, or in the night following; while in other offerings the
   permission extended to a second day. The Rabbis, however, restrict the
   eating of the Paschal lamb to midnight. Whatever was left beyond the
   lawful time had to be burned.

    New Testament View of Sacrifice Agrees with the Synagogue

   It is deeply interesting to know that the New Testament view of
   sacrifices is entirely in accordance with that of the ancient
   Synagogue. At the threshold we here meet the principle: There is no
   atonement except by blood.' In accordance with this we quote the
   following from Jewish interpreters. Rashi says (on Lev 17:11): The soul
   of every creature is gave it to atone for the soul of man--that one
   soul should come and atone for the other.' Similarly Aben Ezra writes:
   One soul is a substitute for the other.' And Moses ben Nachmann: I gave
   the soul for you on the altar, that the soul of the animal should be an
   atonement for the soul of the man.' These quotations might be almost
   indefinitely multiplied. Another phase of Scriptural truth appears in
   such Rabbinical statements as that by the imposition of hands: The
   offerer, as it were, puts away his sins from himself, and transfers
   them upon the living animal'; and that, as often as any one sins with
   his soul, whether from hate or malice, he puts away his sin from
   himself, and places it upon the head of his sacrifice, and it is an
   atonement for him.' Hence, also, the principal laid down by Abarbanel,
   that, after the prayer of confession (connected with the imposition of
   hands) the sins of the children of Israel lay on the sacrifice (of the
   Day of Atonement).' This, according to Maimonides, explains why every
   one who had anything to do with the sacrifice of the red heifer or the
   goat on the Day of Atonement, or similar offerings, was rendered
   unclean; since these animals were regarded as actually sin-bearing. In
   fact, according to Rabbinical expression, the sin-bearing animal is on
   that ground expressly designated as something to be rejected and
   abominable. The Christian reader will here be reminded of the
   Scriptural statement: For He has made Him to be sin for us who knew no
   sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.'

   There is yet one other phase on which the Synagogue lays stress. It is
   best expressed in the following quotation, to which many similar might
   be added: Properly speaking, the blood of the sinner should have been
   shed, and his body burned, as those of the sacrifices. But the Holy
   One--blessed be He!--accepted our sacrifice from us as redemption and
   atonement. Behold the full grace which Jehovah--blessed be He!--has
   shown to man! In His compassion and in the fulness of His grace He
   accepted the soul of the animal instead of his soul, that through it
   there might be an atonement.' Hence also the principle, so important as
   an answer to the question, Whether the Israelites of old had understood
   the meaning of sacrifices? He that brought a sacrifice required to come
   to the knowledge that that sacrifice was his redemption.'

    Jewish Liturgies

   In view of all this, the deep-felt want so often expressed by the
   Synagogue is most touching. In the liturgy for the Day of Atonement we
   read: While the altar and the sanctuary were still in their places, we
   were atoned for by the goats, designated by lot. But now for our guilt,
   if Jehovah be pleased to destroy us, He takes from our hand neither
   burnt-offering nor sacrifice.' We add only one more out of many similar
   passages in the Jewish prayer-book: We have spoken violence and
   rebellion; we have walked in a way that is not right . . . Behold, our
   transgressions have increased upon us; they press upon us like a
   burden; they have gone over our heads; we have forsaken Thy
   commandments, which are excellent. And wherewith shall we appear before
   Thee, the mighty God, to atone for our transgressions, and to put away
   our trespasses, and to remove sin, and to magnify Thy grace? Sacrifices
   and offerings are no more; sin- and trespass-offerings have ceased; the
   blood of sacrifices is no longer sprinkled; destroyed is Thy holy
   house, and fallen the gates of Thy sanctuary; Thy holy city lies
   desolate; Thou hast slain, sent from Thy presence; they have gone,
   driven forth from before Thy face, the priests who brought Thy
   sacrifices!' Accordingly, also, the petition frequently recurs: Raise
   up for us a right Intercessor (that it may be true), I have found a
   ransom (an atonement, or covering).' And on the Day of Atonement, as in
   substance frequently on other occasions, they pray: Bring us back in
   jubilee to Zion, Thy city, and in joy as of old to Jerusalem, the house
   of Thy holiness! Then shall we bring before Thy face the sacrifices
   that are due.'

    The Eve of Day of Atonement

   Who shall make answer to this deep lament of exiled Judah? Where shall
   a ransom be found to take the place of their sacrifices? In their
   despair some appeal to the merits of the fathers or of the pious;
   others to their own or to Israel's sufferings, or to death, which is
   regarded as the last expiation. But the most melancholy exhibition,
   perhaps, is that of an attempted sacrifice by each pious Israelite on
   the eve of the Day of Atonement. Taking for males a white cock, [49]
   and for females a hen, the head of the house prays: The children of men
   who dwell in darkness and in the shadow of death, bound in misery and
   iron--them will He bring forth from darkness and the shadow of death,
   and break their bonds asunder. Fools, because of their transgressions
   and because of their iniquities, are afflicted; their soul abhorreth
   all manner of meat, and they draw near unto the gates of death. Then
   they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, that He save them out of their
   distresses. He sends His word and heals them, and delivers them from
   their destruction. Then they praise the Lord for His goodness, and for
   His marvellous works to the children of men. If there be an angel with
   Him, an intercessor, one among a thousand, to show unto men his
   righteousness, then He is gracious unto him, and saith, Let him go,
   that he may not go down into the pit; I have found an atonement (a
   covering).'

   Next, the head of the house swings the sacrifice round his head,
   saying, This is my substitute; this is in exchange for me; this is my
   atonement. This cock goes into death, but may I enter into a long and
   happy life, and into peace!' Then he repeats this prayer three times,
   and lays his hands on the sacrifice, which is now slain.

   This offering up of an animal not sanctioned by the law, in a place, in
   a manner, and by hands not authorised by God, is it not a terrible
   phantom of Israel's dark and dreary night? and does it not seem
   strangely to remind us of that other terrible night, when the threefold
   crowing of a cock awakened Peter to the fact of his denial of the Lamb
   of God which taketh away the sin of the world'?

   And still the cry of the Synagogue comes to us through these many
   centuries of past unbelief and ignorance: Let one innocent come and
   make atonement for the guilty!' To which no other response can ever be
   made than that of the apostle: Such an High-Priest became us, who is
   holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than
   the heavens'! (Heb 7:26)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38] The Rabbis speak of the so-called salt of Sodom,' probably rock
   salt from the southern end of the Dead Sea, as used in the sacrifices.

   [39] The birds' used at the purification of the leper (Lev 14:4) cannot
   be regarded as sacrifices.

   [40] The reason of this is obscure. Was it that the north was regarded
   as the symbolical region of cold and darkness? Or was it because during
   the wilderness-journey the Most Holy Place probably faced
   north--towards Palestine?

   [41] If the offerer stood outside the Court of the Priests, on the
   topmost of the fifteen Levitical steps, or within the gate of Nicanor,
   his hands at least must be within the Great Court, or the rite was not
   valid.

   [42] Children, the blind, the deaf, those out of their minds, and
   non-Israelites, were not allowed to lay on hands.'

   [43] The Hebrew term used for sacrificial slaying is never applied to
   the ordinary killing of animals.

   [44] In the case of birds there was no laying on of hands.

   [45] The Rabbis mention five mistakes which might render a sacrifice
   invalid, none of them the least interesting, except, perhaps, that the
   gullet might never be wholly severed.

   [46] Whatever was laid upon the altar was regarded as sanctified' by
   it, and could not be again removed, even though it should have become
   defiled. This explains the words of Christ in Matthew 23:19.

   [47] Compare the article in Herzog's Encyc. vol. x. p. 633. Some of the
   sacrifices were burned on the altar of burnt-offering, and some outside
   the gate; while in certain less holy sacrifices it was allowed to burn
   what was left anywhere within the city.

   [48] Except those for the whole people and for the high-priest, which
   had to be burned outside the gate.

   a cock,' and white,' with reference to Isaiah 1:18.

Chapter 6

  The Burnt-Offering, the Sin- and Trespass-Offering, and the Peace-Offering

   And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the
   same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: but this Man, after He
   had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand
   of God.'--Hebrews 10:11, 12.

    The Idea of Substitution

   The question whether or not sacrifices were to cease after the coming
   of the Messiah is differently answered in the Jewish synagogue, some
   arguing that only thank- and peace-offerings would then be brought,
   while the majority expect a revival of the regular sacrificial worship.
   [50]

   But on one point the authorities of the old synagogue, previous to
   their controversy with Christianity, are agreed. As the Old Testament
   and Jewish tradition taught that the object of a sacrifice was its
   substitution for the offender, so Scripture and the Jewish fathers also
   teach that the substitute to whom all these types pointed was none
   other than the Messiah.

   It has been well remarked, that the difficulties of modern interpreters
   of the Messianic prophecies arise chiefly from their not perceiving the
   unity of the Old Testament in its progressive unfolding of the plan of
   salvation. Moses must not be read independently of the Psalms, nor yet
   the Psalms independently of the Prophets. Theirs are not so many
   unconnected writings of different authorship and age, only held
   together by the boards of one volume. They form integral parts of one
   whole, the object of which is to point to the goal of all revelation in
   the appearing of the Christ. Accordingly, we recognize in the prophetic
   word, not a change nor a difference, but three well-marked progressive
   stages, leading up to the sufferings and the glory of Messiah. In the
   Proto-Evangel, as Genesis 3:15 has been called, and in what follows it,
   we have as yet only the grand general outlines of the figure. Thus we
   see a Person in the Seed of the woman; suffering, in the prediction
   that His heel would be bruised; and victory, in that He would bruise
   the serpent's head. These merely general outlines are wonderfully
   filled up in the Book of Psalms. The Person' is now the Son of David';
   while alike the sufferings and the victory are sketched in vivid detail
   in such Psalms as 22, 35, 49, and 102; or else in Psalms 2, 72, 89,
   110, and 118--not to speak of other almost innumerable allusions.

    Christ our Substitute

   One element only was still wanting--that this Son of David, this
   Sufferer and Conqueror, should be shown to be our Substitute, to whom
   also the sacrificial types had pointed. This is added in the writings
   of the prophets, especially in those of Isaiah, culminating, as it
   were, in Isaiah 53, around which the details furnished by the other
   prophets naturally group themselves. The picture is now completed, and
   so true to the original that, when compared with the reality in the
   Person and Work of the Lord Jesus Christ, we can have no difficulty in
   recognising it; and this not so much from one or other outline in
   prophecy or type, as from their combination and progressive development
   throughout the Scriptures of the Old Testament, considered as a
   connected whole.

   As already stated, such early works as the Targum Jonathan and the
   Jerusalem Targum frankly adopt the Messianic interpretation of these
   prophecies. The later Rabbis also admit that this had been the common
   view of the Jewish fathers; but, on account of the sages of the
   Nazarenes, who apply it to that man whom they hanged in Jerusalem
   towards the close of the second Temple, and who, according to their
   opinion, was the Son of the Most Blessed, and had taken human nature in
   the womb of the Virgin,' they reject that interpretation, and refer the
   prediction of suffering either to some individual, or mostly to Israel
   as a nation. But so difficult is it to weaken the language in which the
   Messiah's vicarious sufferings are described--not less than twelve
   times in Isaiah 52:13 to 53--that some of their commentators have been
   forced to admit it, sometimes almost unconsciously. The language of
   Isaiah has even crept into the following Messianic hymnal prayer for
   the Passover:


   Haste, my Beloved; come, ere ends the vision's day;

   Make haste, and chase Thyself the shadows all away!

   "Despised" is He, but yet "extolled" and "high" shall be;

   "Deal prudently, " "sprinkle nations, " and "judge" shall He.'

   Thus, if by the universal consent of all who are unprejudiced
   sacrifices point to substitution, substitution in its turn points to
   the Person and Work of the Messiah.

   It has already been explained that all sacrifices were either such as
   were offered on the ground of communion with God--the burnt- and the
   peace-offering; or else such as were intended to restore that communion
   when it had been dimmed or disturbed--the sin- and the
   trespass-offering. Each of these four kinds of sacrifices will now have
   to be separately considered.

    Symbolism of the Burnt-offering

   I. The burnt-offering--Olah, or also Chalil (Deut 33:10; in Psalm 51:19
   literally rendered whole burnt-offering).--The derivation of the term
   Olah, as wholly ascending' unto God, indicates alike the mode of the
   sacrifice and its meaning. It symbolised the entire surrender unto God,
   whether of the individual or of the congregation, and His acceptance
   thereof. Hence, also, it could not be offered without shedding of
   blood.' Where other sacrifices were brought, it followed the sin- but
   preceded the peace-offering. In fact, it meant general acceptance on
   the ground of previous special acceptance, and it has rightly been
   called the sacrificium latreuticum, or sacrifice of devotion and
   service. [51]

   Thus day by day it formed the regular morning and evening service in
   the Temple, while on sabbaths, new moons, and festivals additional
   burnt-offerings followed the ordinary worship. There the
   covenant-people brought the covenant-sacrifice, and the multitude of
   offerings indicated, as it were, the fulness, richness, and joyousness
   of their self-surrender. Accordingly, although we can understand how
   this sacrifice might be said to make atonement' for an individual in
   the sense of assuring him of his acceptance, we cannot agree with the
   Rabbis that it was intended to atone for evil thoughts and purposes,
   and for breaches of positive commands, or of such negative as involved
   also a positive command.

   The burnt-offering was always to be a male animal, as the more noble,
   and as indicating strength and energy. The blood was thrown on the
   angles of the altar below the red line that ran round it. Then the
   sinew of the thigh' (Gen 32:32), [52] the stomach and the entrails,
   etc., having been removed (in the case of birds also the feathers and
   the wings), and the sacrifice having been duly salted, it was wholly
   burned.

   The skins belonged to the ministering priests, who derived a
   considerable revenue from this source. The burnt-offering was the only
   sacrifice which non-Israelites were allowed to bring. [53]

   The Emperor Augustus had a daily burnt-offering brought for him of two
   lambs and a bullock; and ever afterwards this sacrifice was regarded as
   indicating that the Jewish nation recognised the Roman emperor as their
   ruler. Hence at the commencement of the Jewish war Eleazar carried its
   rejection, and this became, as it were, the open mark of the rebellion.

    Symbolism of the Sin-offering

   II. The sin-offering.--This is the most important of all sacrifices. It
   made atonement for the person of the offender, whereas the
   trespass-offering only atoned for one special offence. Hence
   sin-offerings were brought on festive occasions for the whole people,
   but never trespass-offerings (comp. Num 28, 29). In fact, the
   trespass-offering may be regarded as representing ransom for a special
   wrong, while the sin-offering symbolised general redemption. Both
   sacrifices applied only to sins through ignorance,' in opposition to
   those done presumptuously' (or with a high hand'). For the latter the
   law provided no atonement, but held out a certain fearful looking for
   of judgment and fiery indignation.' By sins through ignorance,'
   however, we are to understand, according to the Rabbis, not only such
   as were committed strictly through want of knowledge, but also those
   which had been unintentional, or through weakness, or where the
   offender at the time realised not his guilt. The fundamental difference
   between the two sacrifices appears also in this--that sin-offerings,
   having a retrospective effect on the worshippers, were brought at the
   various festivals, and also for purification in such defilements of the
   body as symbolically pointed to the sinfulness of our nature (sexual
   defilement, those connected with leprosy, and with death). On the other
   hand, the animal brought for a trespass-offering was to be always a
   male (generally a ram, which was never used as a sin-offering); nor was
   it lawful, as in the sin-offering, to make substitution of something
   else in case of poverty. These two particulars indicate that the
   trespass-offering contemplated chiefly a wrong, for which decided
   satisfaction was to be made by offering a male animal, and for which a
   definite, unvarying ransom was to be given.

    In All Cases Repentance Was Necessary

   However, in reference both to sin- and to trespass-offerings, the
   Rabbinical principle must be kept in view--that they only atoned in
   case of real repentance. Indeed, their first effect would be a
   remembrance of sins' before God (Heb 10:3). All sin-offerings were
   either public or private (congregational or individual). The former
   were always males; the latter always females, except the bullock for
   the high-priest's sin of ignorance (Lev 4:3), and the kid for the same
   offence of a ruler' (Lev 4:22). They were further divided into fixed,
   which were the same in the case of rich and poor, and varying, which
   ascended and descended' according to the circumstances of the offerer.
   Fixed' sacrifices were all those for sins through ignorance' against
   any of the prohibitory commands (of which the Rabbis enumerate 365);
   [54] for sins of deed, not of word; or else for such which, if they had
   been high-handed, would have carried the Divine punishment of being cut
   off' (of which the Rabbis enumerate 36).

   The varying' sacrifices were those for lepers (Lev 14:21); for women
   after childbirth (of which concession to poverty Mary, the mother of
   Jesus, availed herself) (Luke 2:24; Lev 12:8); for having concealed a
   thing known' (Lev 5:1); for having unwittingly sworn falsely; and for
   having either unwittingly eaten of what had been consecrated, or gone
   into the Temple in a state of defilement. Lastly, there were outer' and
   inner' sin-offerings, according as the blood was applied to the altar
   of burnt-offering or brought into the inner sanctuary. In the former
   case the flesh was to be eaten only by the officiating priest and
   within the sanctuary; the latter were to be wholly burnt without the
   camp or city. [55]

   In both cases, however, the inwards,' as enumerated in Leviticus 4:8,
   were always first burned on the altar of burnt-offering. Neither oil
   nor frankincense were to be brought with a sin-offering. There was
   nothing joyous about it. It represented a terrible necessity, for which
   God, in His wondrous grace, had made provision.

    The Sin-offering Differed with the Rank of the Offerer

   It only remains to explain in detail two peculiarities connected with
   the sin-offering. First, it differed according to the theocratic
   position of him who brought the sacrifice. For the high-priest on the
   Day of Atonement (Lev 16:3), or when he had sinned, to the rendering
   guilty of the people' (Lev 4:3), that is, in his official capacity as
   representing the people; or if the whole congregation had sinned
   through ignorance (Lev 4:13); and at the consecration of the priests
   and Levites a bullock was to be brought. This was the highest kind of
   sin-offering. Next in order was that of the kid of the goats,' offered
   for the people on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:5), and on the other
   festivals and New Moons (Num 28:15, etc.; 29:5, etc.); also for the
   ruler who had sinned through ignorance (Lev 4:23); for the congregation
   if aught had been committted by any individual without the knowledge of
   the congregation' (Num 15:24); and, lastly, at the consecration of the
   Tabernacle (Lev 9:3, 15). The third kind of sin-offering consisted of a
   female kid of the goats [56] for individual Israelites (Lev 4:28, etc.;
   5:6), and of a ewe lamb for a Nazarite (Num 6:14) and a leper (Lev
   14:10).

   The lowest grade of sin-offering was that of turtle-doves or young
   pigeons offered at certain purifications (Lev 12:6; 15:14, 29; Num
   6:10); or else as a substitute for other sacrifices in case of
   poverty--in extreme cases something resembling to, or as a
   meat-offering' being even allowed (Lev 5:11-13).

    The Blood to be Sprinkled

   Secondly, the blood of the sin-offering was sprinkled, not thrown. In
   the case of a private Israelite, it was sprinkled, that is, either
   jerked or dropped successively on each of the four horns [57] of the
   altar of burnt-offering--beginning at the south-east, thence going to
   the north-east, then the north-west, and finishing at the south-west,
   where the rest of the blood was poured at the bottom of the altar
   through two funnels that conducted into the Kedron.

   On the other hand, when offering bullocks and goats, whose carcases
   were to be burned without the camp, the officiating priest stood in the
   Holy Place, between the golden altar and the candlestick, and sprinkled
   of the blood seven times [58] towards the Most Holy Place, to indicate
   that the covenant-relationship itself had been endangered and was to be
   re-established, and afterwards touched with it the horns of the altar
   of incense.

   The most solemn of all sacrifices were those of the Day of Atonement,
   when the high-priest, arrayed in his linen garments, stood before the
   Lord Himself within the Most Holy Place to make an atonement. Every
   spot of blood from a sin-offering on a garment conveyed defilement, as
   being loaded with sin, and all vessels used for such sacrifices had
   either to be broken or scoured.

   Quite another phase of symbolic meaning was intended to be conveyed by
   the sacrificial meal which the priests were to make of the flesh of
   such sin-offerings as were not wholly burnt without the camp.
   Unquestionably Philo was right in suggesting, that one of the main
   objects of this meal was to carry to the offerer assurance of his
   acceptance, since God would never have allowed His servants to partake
   of it, had there not been a complete removal and forgetting of the sin'
   atoned for. This view entirely accords with the statement in Leviticus
   10:17, where the purpose of this meal by the priests is said to be to
   bear the iniquity of the congregation.' Hence, also, the flesh of all
   sacrifices, either for the high-priest, as representing the priesthood,
   or for the whole people, had to be burnt; because those who, as God's
   representatives, were alone allowed to eat the sacrificial meal were
   themselves among the offerers of the sacrifice.

    Symbolism of the Trespass-offering

   III. The trespass-offering was provided for certain transgressions
   committed through ignorance, or else, according to Jewish tradition,
   where a man afterwards voluntarily confessed himself guilty. The Rabbis
   arrange this class into those for a doubtful and for a certain
   trespass. The former were offered by the more scrupulous, when,
   uncertain whether they might not have committed an offence which, if
   done high-handed, would have implied being cut off,' or, if in
   ignorance, necessitated a sin-offering. Accordingly, the extreme party,
   or Chassidim, were wont to bring such a sacrifice every day! On the
   other hand, the offering for certain trespasses covered five distinct
   cases, [59] which had all this in common, that they represented a wrong
   for which a special ransom was to be given.

   It forms no exception to this principle, that a trespass-offering was
   also prescribed in the case of a healed leper (Lev 14:12), and in that
   of a Nazarite, whose vow had been interrupted by sudden defilement with
   the dead (Num 6:10-12), since leprosy was also symbolically regarded as
   a wrong to the congregation as a whole, [60] while the interruption of
   the vow was a kind of wrong directly towards the Lord.

   But that this last was, at the same time, considered the lightest kind
   of trespass appears even from this--that, while ordinarily the flesh of
   the trespass-offering, after burning the inwards on the altar of (Lev
   7:3), was only to be eaten by the officiating priests within the Holy
   Place, the lamb offered for such a Nazarite might be eaten by others
   also, and anywhere within Jerusalem. The blood of the trespass-offering
   (like that of the burnt-offering) was thrown on the corners of the
   altar below the red line.

    The Peace-offering

   IV. The most joyous of all sacrifices was the peace-offering, or, as
   from its derivation it might also be rendered, the offering of
   completion. [61]

   This was, indeed, a season of happy fellowship with the Covenant God,
   in which He condescended to become Israel's Guest at the sacrificial
   meal, even as He was always their Host. Thus it symbolised the
   spiritual truth expressed in Revelation 3:20, Behold, I stand at the
   door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will
   come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.' In
   peace-offerings the sacrificial meal was the point of main importance.
   Hence the name Sevach,' by which it is designated in the Pentateuch,
   and which means slaying,' in reference to a meal. It is this sacrifice
   which is so frequently referred to in the Book of Psalms as the
   grateful homage of a soul justified and accepted before God (Psa 51:17;
   54:6; 56:12; 116:17, 18). If, on the one hand, then, the offering of
   completion' indicated that there was complete peace with God, on the
   other, it was also literally the offering of completeness. The
   peace-offerings were either public or private. The two lambs offered
   every year at Pentecost (Lev 23:19) were a public peace-offering, and
   the only one which was regarded as most holy.' As such they were
   sacrificed at the north side of the altar, and their flesh eaten only
   by the officiating priests, and within the Holy Place. The other public
   peace-offerings were slain at the south side, and their inwards' burnt
   on the altar (Lev 3:4, 5). Then, after the priests had received their
   due, the rest was to be eaten by the offerers themselves, either within
   the courts of the Temple or in Jerusalem (Deut 27:7). On one occasion
   (1 Kings 8:63) no less than 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep were so
   offered. Private peace-offerings were of a threefold kind (Lev 7:11):
   sacrifices of thanksgiving' (Lev 7:12), vows,' and strictly voluntary
   offerings' (Lev 7:16). The first were in general acknowledgment of
   mercies received; the last, the free gift of loving hearts, as even the
   use of the same term in Exodus 25:2, 35:29 implies. Exceptionally in
   this last case, an animal that had anything either defective' or
   superfluous' might be offered (Lev 22:23).

    What Constituted Peace-offerings

   Peace-offerings were brought either of male or of female animals
   (chiefly of the former), but not of pigeons, the sacrifice being, of
   course, always accompanied by a meat- and a drink offering (Lev 7:11,
   etc.). As every other sacrifice, they needed imposition of hands,
   confession, and sprinkling of blood, the latter being done as in the
   burnt-offering. Then the inwards' were taken out and waved' before the
   Lord, along with the breast' and the right shoulder' (or, perhaps more
   correctly, the right leg). In reference to these two wave-offerings we
   remark, that the breast properly belonged to the Lord, and that He gave
   it to His priests (Lev 7:30), while Israel gave the right shoulder'
   directly to the priests (Lev 7:32). The ritual of waving has already
   been described, [62] the meaning of the movement being to present the
   sacrifice, as it were, to the Lord, and then to receive it back from
   Him.

   The Rabbinical suggestion, that there was a distinct rite of heaving'
   besides that of waving,' seems only to rest on a misunderstanding of
   such passages as Leviticus 2:2, 9; 7:32; 10:15, etc. [63]

   The following were to be waved' before the Lord: the breast of the
   peace-offering (Lev 7:30); the parts mentioned at the consecration of
   the priests (Lev 8:25-29); the first omer at the Passover (Lev 23:11);
   the jealousy-offering (Num 5:25); the offering at the close of a
   Nazarite's vow (Num 6:20); the offering of a cleansed leper (Lev
   14:12); and the two lambs' presented with the bread of the
   firstfruits,' at the Feast of Tabernacles (Lev 23:20). The two
   last-mentioned offerings were waved' before being sacrificed. After the
   waving,' the inwards' (Lev 3:3-5, etc.) were burnt on the altar of
   burnt-offering, and the rest eaten either by priests or worshippers,
   the longest term allowed in any case for the purpose being two days and
   a night from the time of sacrifice. Of course, the guests, among whom
   were to be the Levites and the poor, must all be in a state of
   Levitical purity, symbolical of the wedding garment' needful at the
   better gospel-feast.

    Meat-offerings

   We close with a few particulars about meat-offerings. These were either
   brought in conjunction with burnt- and peace-offerings (but never with
   sin- or with trespass-offerings) or else by themselves. The latter were
   either public or private meat-offerings. The three public
   meat-offerings were: the twelve loaves of shewbread, renewed every
   Sabbath, and afterwards eaten by the priests; the omer, or sheaf of the
   harvest, on the second day of the Passover; and the two wave-loaves at
   Pentecost. Four of the private meat-offerings were enjoined by the law,
   viz: (1) the daily meat-offering of the high-priest, according to the
   Jewish interpretation of Leviticus 6:20; (2) that at the consecration
   of priests (Lev 6:20); (3) that in substitution for a sin-offering, in
   case of poverty (Lev 5:11, 12); and that of jealousy (Num 5:15). The
   following five were purely voluntary, viz. that of fine flour with oil,
   unbaken (Lev 2:1); that baken in a pan'; in a frying-pan'; in the
   oven'; and the wafers' (Lev 2:4-7). All these offerings were to consist
   of at least one omer of corn (which was the tenth part of an ephah)
   (Exo 16:36). But any larger number under 61 omers might be offered, the
   reason of the limitation being, that as the public meat- offerings
   enjoined on the feast of Tabernacles amounted to 61, [64] all private
   offerings must be less than that number.

   In all baken meat-offerings, an omer' was always made into ten
   cakes--the symbolical number of completeness--except in that of the
   high-priest's daily meat-offering, of which twelve cakes were baken, as
   representative of Israel. Finally, as the Rabbis express it, every
   meat-offering prepared in a vessel had three pourings of oil'--first
   into the vessel, then to mingle with the flour, and lastly, after it
   was ready--the frankincense being then put upon it. The wafers' were
   anointed' with oil, after the form of the Hebrew letter caph, or the
   Greek letter kappa, as they explain, to run down in two parts.' [65]

   When presenting a meat-offering, the priest first brought it in the
   golden or silver dish in which it had been prepared, and then
   transferred it to a holy vessel, putting oil and frankincense upon it.
   Taking his stand at the south-eastern corner of the altar, he next took
   the handful' that was actually to be burnt, put it in another vessel,
   laid some of the frankincense on it, carried it to the top of the
   altar, salted it, and then placed it on the fire. The rest of the
   meat-offering belonged to the priests. [66] Every meat-offering was
   accompanied by a drink-offering of wine, which was poured at the base
   of the altar.

    Large Number of Priests Needed

   So complicated a service, and one which enjoined such frequent
   sacrifices, must always have kept a large number of priests busy in the
   courts of the Temple. This was especially the case on the great
   festivals; and if the magnificent Temple could hold its 210,000
   worshippers--if the liturgy, music, and ritual were equally
   gorgeous--we cannot wonder that it required, multitudes of white-robed
   priests properly to discharge its ministry. Tradition has it, that on
   the Day of Atonement no less than five hundred priests were wont to
   assist in the services. On other feast-days even more must have been
   engaged, as it was a Rabbinical principle, that a man should bring all
   his offerings, that were either due from him or voluntarily dedicated,
   at the solemn festival that cometh next.' In other words, if a man
   incurred a sacrifice, or voluntarily promised one, he was to bring it
   when next he came to Jerusalem. But even this provision showed the
   weakness and unprofitableness thereof,' since in all ordinary cases a
   long time must have elapsed before the stain of guilt could be
   consciously removed by an atoning sacrifice, or a vow performed.
   Blessed be God, the reality in Christ Jesus in this, as in all other
   things, far out-distances the type! For we have always liberty to enter
   into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus'; and if the blood of bulls and
   of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean,
   sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the
   blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit offered Himself without
   spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living
   God!'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [50] It has been matter of controversy whether or not, in the first
   years after the destruction of the Temple, solitary attempts were made
   by enthusiasts to offer sacrifices. My own conviction is, that no such
   instance can be historically established.

   [51] In the historical books the term Olah is, however, used in a more
   general sense to denote other sacrifices also.

   [52] The sinew of the thigh' was neither allowed to be eaten nor to be
   sacrificed.

   [53] If they brought a peace-offering,' it was to be treated as a
   burnt-offering, and that for the obvious reason that there was no one
   to eat the sacrificial meal. Of course, there was no imposition of
   hands in that case.

   [54] They also mention 248 affirmative precepts, or in all 613,
   according to the supposed number of members in the human body.

   [55] According to the Talmud, if doves were brought as a sin-offering,
   the carcases were not burned, but went to the priests.

   [56] It is not very easy to understand why goats should have been
   chosen in preference for sin-offerings, unless it were that their flesh
   was the most unpalatable of meat.

   [57] The horns' symbolized, as it were, the outstanding height and
   strength of the altar.

   [58] Seven was the symbolical number of the covenant.

   [59] Leviticus 5:15; 6:2; 19:20 (in these three cases the offering was
   a ram); and Leviticus 14:12 and Numbers 6:12 (where the offering was a
   he-lamb). The Word of God considers every wrong done to another, as
   also a wrong done against the Lord (Psa 51:4), and hence, as needing a
   trespass-offering.

   [60] Hence the leper was banished from the congregation.

   [61] It always followed all the other sacrifices.

   [62] The pieces were laid on the hands as follows: the feet, and then
   the breast, the right shoulder, the kidneys, the caul of the liver,
   and, in the case of a thank-offering, the bread upon it all.

   [63] The heave' is, in reality, only the technical term for the
   priest's taking' his portion.

   [64] See Relandus, p. 353. This, however, only when the feast fell on a
   Sabbath.

   [65] The subjoined Rabbinical table may be of use: Meat-Offerings--

   Requiring the addition of oil and frankincense: Of fine flour unbaken;
   baken in a pan; baken in a frying-pan; baken in the oven; the wafers';
   the high-priest's daily and the priest's consecration offering; the
   flour from the 'sheaf' offered on the second day of the Passover.

   Requiring oil without frankincense: all meat-offerings, accompanying a
   burnt- or a peace-offering.

   Requiring frankincense without oil: The shew bread.

   Requiring neither oil nor frankincense: The two loaves at Pentecost;
   the jealousy-offering; and that in substitution for a sin-offering.

   [66] Except in the meat-offering of the high-priest, and of priests at
   their consecration; the exception in both cases for the obvious reason
   already referred to in explaining sacrificial meals. Similarly, the
   meat-offerings connected with burnt-sacrifices were wholly consumed on
   the altar.

Chapter 7

  At Night in the Temple

   Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments.'--Revelation
   16:15.

    Allusions to the Temple in New Testament

   There is a marked peculiarity and also a special charm about the
   allusions of the beloved disciple' to the Temple and its services.' The
   other New Testament writers refer to them in their narratives, or else
   explain their types, in such language as any well-informed worshipper
   at Jerusalem might have employed. But John writes not like an ordinary
   Israelite. He has eyes and ears for details which others would have
   left unnoticed. As, according to a Jewish tradition, the high-priest
   read the Divine answer of the Urim and Thummim by a heavenly light cast
   upon special letters in the names of the tribes grave upon his
   breast-plate, so to John the presence and the words of Jesus seem to
   render luminous the well-remembered services of the Temple. This, as we
   shall have frequent occasion to show, appears in his Gospel, but much
   more in the Book of Revelation. Indeed, the Apocalypse, as a whole, may
   be likened to the Temple services in its mingling of prophetic symbols
   with worship and praise. But it is specially remarkable, that the
   Temple-references with which the Book of Revelation abounds are
   generally to minutiae, which a writer who had not been as familiar with
   such details, as only personal contact and engagement with them could
   have rendered him, would scarcely have even noticed, certainly not
   employed as part of his imagery. They come in naturally, spontaneously,
   and so unexpectedly, that the reader is occasionally in danger of
   overlooking them altogether; and in language such as a professional man
   would employ, which would come to him from the previous exercise of his
   calling. Indeed, some of the most striking of these references could
   not have been understood at all without the professional treatises of
   the Rabbis on the Temple and its services. Only the studied minuteness
   of Rabbinical descriptions, derived from the tradition of
   eye-witnesses, does not leave the same impression as the unstudied
   illustrations of St. John.

    Fourth Gospel and Apocalypse Written Before Temple Services Ceased

   These naturally suggest the twofold inference that the Book of
   Revelation and the Fourth Gospel must have been written before the
   Temple services had actually ceased, and by one who had not merely been
   intimately acquainted with, but probably at one time an actor in them.
   [67]

   The argument may be illustrated by an analogous case. Quite lately,
   they who have dug under the ruins of the Temple have discovered one of
   those tablets in the Court of the Temple which warned Gentiles, on pain
   of death, not to advance farther into the sanctuary. The tablet answers
   exactly to the description of Josephus, and its inscription is almost
   literally as he gives it. This tablet seems like a witness suddenly
   appearing, after eighteen centuries, to bear testimony to the narrative
   of Josephus as that of a contemporary writer. Much the same
   instantaneous conviction, only greatly stronger, is carried to our
   minds, when, in the midst of some dry account of what went on in the
   Temple, we suddenly come upon the very words which St. John had
   employed to describe heavenly realities. Perhaps one of the most
   striking instances of this kind is afforded by the words quoted at the
   head of this chapter--'Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his
   garments.' They literally describe, as we learn from the Rabbis, the
   punishment awarded to the Temple-guards if found asleep at their posts;
   and the Rabbinical account of it is curiously confirmed by the somewhat
   naive confession of one of their number, [68] that on a certain
   occasion his own maternal uncle had actually undergone the punishment
   of having his clothes set on fire by the captain of the Temple as he
   went his rounds at night.

    Night in the Temple

   For the service of the officiating ministers was not only by day, but
   also at night in the Temple.' From Scripture we know that the ordinary
   services of the sanctuary consisted of the morning and evening
   sacrifices. To these the Rabbis add another evening service, probably
   to account for their own transference of the evening service to a much
   later hour than that of the sacrifice. [69]

   There is, however, some difficulty about the exact time when each of
   the sacrifices was offered. According to general agreement, the morning
   sacrifice was brought at the third hour,' corresponding to our nine
   o'clock. But the preparations for it must have commenced more than two
   hours earlier. Few, if any, worshippers could have witnessed the actual
   slaying of the lamb, which took place immediately on opening the great
   Temple-gate. Possibly they may have gathered chiefly to join in the
   prayer at the time of incense' (Luke 1:10). In the modified sense,
   then, of understanding by the morning sacrifice the whole service, it
   no doubt coincided with the third hour of the day, or 9 a.m. This may
   explain how on the day of Pentecost such a multitude could so readily
   come together,' to hear in their various tongues the wonderful works of
   God'--seeing it was the third hour (Acts 2:15), when they would all be
   in the Temple. The evening sacrifice was fixed by the Law (Num 28:4, 8)
   as between the evenings,' that is, between the darkness of the gloaming
   and that of the night. [70]

   Such admonitions as to show forth thy faithfulness every night upon an
   instrument of ten strings and on the psaltery' (Psa 92:2, 3), and the
   call to those who by night stand in the house of the Lord,' to lift up
   their hands in the sanctuary and bless the Lord' (Psa 134), seem indeed
   to imply an evening service--an impression confirmed by the appointment
   of Levite singers for night service in 1 Chronicles 9:33; 23:30. But at
   the time of our Lord the evening sacrifice certainly commenced much
   earlier. Josephus puts it down (Ant. xiv. 4, 3) as at the ninth hour.
   According to the Rabbis the lamb was slain at the eighth hour and
   a-half, or about 2:30 p.m., and the pieces laid on he altar an hour
   later--about 3:30 p.m. Hence, when Peter and John went up together into
   the Temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour' (Acts 3:1) it
   must have been for the evening sacrifice, or rather half an hour later,
   and, as the words indicate, for the prayer' that accompanied the
   offering of incense. The evening service was somewhat shorter than that
   of the morning, and would last, at any rate, about an hour and a-half,
   say till about four o'clock, thus well meeting the original requirement
   in Numbers 28:4. After that no other offering might be brought except
   on the eve of the Passover, when the ordinary evening sacrifice took
   place two hours earlier, or at 12:30 p.m. [71]

    Change of Priests

   We can conceive the laborious work of the day over, and the rest and
   solemnity of night in the Temple' begun. The last notes of the Temple
   music have died out, and the worshippers slowly retired, some after
   lingering for private prayer, or else tarrying in one of the marble
   porches. Already the short Eastern day is fading out in the west. Far
   over the mountains of Gibeon the sun is sinking in that ocean across
   which the better light is so soon to shine. The new company of priests
   and Levites who are to conduct the services of the morrow are coming up
   from Ophel under the leadership of their heads of houses, their elders.
   Those who have officiated during the day are preparing to leave by
   another gate. They have put off their priestly dress, depositing it in
   the appointed chambers, and resumed that of ordinary laymen, and their
   sandals. For such, although not shoes, might be worn in the Temple, the
   priests being barefoot only during their actual ministry. Nor did they
   otherwise wear any distinctive dress, not even the high-priest himself,
   nor yet those who performed in the Temple other than strictly
   sacrificial services. [72]

   As for the Levites, they had no clerical dress at all, but only wore
   the white linen (2 Chron 5:12), till they obtained from Agrippa II
   permission to wear priestly garments--as Josephus rightly remarks,
   contrary to the laws of our country' (Ant. xx. 9, 6).

    The Farewell on the Sabbath

   We know that on Sabbaths at least, when one company gave place to
   another, or, rather, as the outgoing course left the Temple precincts,
   they parted from each other with a farewell, reminding us of St. Paul's
   to the Corinthians (2 Cor 13:11), He that has caused His name to dwell
   in this house cause love, brotherhood, peace, and friendship to dwell
   among you.' Each of the twenty-four courses' into which not only the
   priests and Levites, but also all Israel, by means of representatives,
   were divided, served for one week, from Sabbath to Sabbath,
   distributing the daily service among their respective families' or
   houses.' For the Sabbath the new ministrants came earlier than on
   week-days. [73]

   As the family' whose daily ministration was accomplished' left the
   Temple, the massive gates were closed by priests or Levites, some
   requiring the united strength of twenty men. Then the Temple keys were
   hung up in a hollow square, under a marble slab in the fire-room'
   (Beth-ha-Moked), which may also be designated as the chief guard-room
   of the priests. Now, as the stars were shining out on the deep blue
   Eastern sky, the priests would gather for converse or the evening meal.
   [74]

   Pieces of the sacrifices and the prepared' first-fruits (the Therumoth)
   supplied the needful refreshments. [75]

   Though the work of the day was over, certain arrangements had yet to be
   made. For the Levites in charge of collecting the tithes and other
   business details were wont to purchase in large quantities what each
   who brought any sacrifice needed for meat- and drink-offerings, and to
   sell it to the offerers. This was a great accommodation to the
   worshipper, and a source of daily profit to the Temple. On payment of a
   price, fixed by tariff every month, the offerer received his proper
   counterfoil, [76] in exchange for which a Temple official gave him what
   he needed for his sacrifice. Now, the accounts of these transactions
   had to be made up and checked every evening.

    The Night-watches

   But already the night-watches had been set in the Temple. By day and
   night it was the duty of the Levites to keep guard at the gates, to
   prevent, so far as possible, the unclean from entering. To them the
   duties of the Temple police were also entrusted, under the command of
   an official known to us in the New Testament as the captain of the
   Temple' (Acts 4:1, etc.), but in Jewish writings chiefly as the man of
   the Temple Mount.' The office must have been of considerable
   responsibility, considering the multitude on feast-days, their keen
   national susceptibilities, and the close proximity of the hated Romans
   in Fort Antonia. At night guards were placed in twenty-four stations
   about the gates and courts. Of these twenty-one were occupied by
   Levites alone; the other innermost three jointly by priests and
   Levites. [77]

   Each guard consisted of ten men; so that in all two hundred and forty
   Levites and thirty priests were on duty every night. The Temple guards
   were relieved by day, but not during the night, which the Romans
   divided into four, but the Jews, properly, into three watches, the
   fourth being really the morning watch. [78]

   Hence, when the Lord saith, Blessed are those servants whom the lord
   when he cometh shall find watching,' He expressly refers to the second
   and third watches as those of deepest sleep (Luke 12:38).

    The Rounds of the Captain

   During the night the captain of the Temple' made his rounds. On his
   approach the guards had to rise and salute him in a particular manner.
   Any guard found asleep when on duty was beaten, or his garments were
   set on fire--a punishment, as we know, actually awarded. Hence the
   admonition to us who, as it were, are here on Temple guard, Blessed is
   he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments' (Rev 16:15). But, indeed,
   there could have been little inclination to sleep within the Temple,
   even had the deep emotion natural in the circumstances allowed it.
   True, the chief of the course and the heads of families' reclined on
   couches along that part of the Beth-Moked in which it was lawful to sit
   down, [79] and the older priests might lie on the floor, having wrapped
   their priestly garments beside them, while the younger men kept watch.

   But then the preparations for the service of the morning required each
   to be early astir. The priest whose duty it was to superintend the
   arrangements might any moment knock at the door and demand entrance. He
   came suddenly and unexpectedly, no one knew when. The Rabbis use almost
   the very words in which Scripture describes the unexpected coming of
   the Master (Mark 13:35), when they say, Sometimes he came at the
   cock-crowing, sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little later. He
   came and knocked, and they opened to him. Then said he unto them, All
   ye who have washed, come and cast lots' (Mishnah, Tamid. i. 1, 2). For
   the customary bath required to have been taken before the
   superintending priest came round, since it was a principle that none
   might go into the court to serve, although he were clean, unless he had
   bathed. A subterranean passage, lit on both sides, led to the
   well-appointed bath-rooms where the priests immersed themselves. After
   that they needed not (except under one circumstance) all that day to
   wash again, save their hands and feet, which they had to do each time,
   however often, they came for service into the Temple. It was, no doubt,
   to this that our Lord referred in His reply to Peter: He that is washed
   needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit' (John
   13:10).

    Casting Lots for the Services

   Those who were prepared now followed the superintending priest through
   a wicket into the court. Here they divided into two companies, each
   carrying a torch, except on the Sabbaths, when the Temple itself was
   lit up. One company passed eastwards, the other westwards, till, having
   made their circuit of inspection, they met at the chamber where the
   high-priest's daily meat-offering was prepared (Lev 6:12-16, according
   to the Rabbinical interpretation of the law), and reported, It is well!
   All is well!' Thereupon those who were to prepare the high-priest's
   offering were set to their work, and the priests passed into the Hall
   of Polished Stones,' [80] to cast lots for the services of the day.

   This arrangement had been rendered necessary by certain painful scenes
   to which the eagerness of the priests for service had led. Altogether
   the lot was cast four times, though at different periods of the
   service. It was done in this manner. The priests stood in a circle
   around the president, who for a moment removed the head-gear of one of
   their number, to show that he would begin counting at him. Then all
   held up one, two, or more fingers--since it was not lawful in Israel to
   count persons--when the president named some number, say seventy, and
   began counting the fingers till he reached the number named, which
   marked that the lot had fallen on that priest. The first lot was for
   cleansing the altar and preparing it; the second, for those who were to
   offer the sacrifice, and for those who were to cleanse the candlestick
   and the altar of incense in the Holy Place. The third lot was the most
   important. It determined who was to offer the incense. If possible,
   none was to take part in it who had at any previous time officiated in
   the same capacity. The fourth lot, which followed close on the third,
   fixed those who were to burn the pieces of the sacrifice on the altar,
   and to perform the concluding portions of the service. The morning lot
   held good also for the same offices at the evening sacrifice, save that
   the lot was cast anew for the burning of the incense.

    The First Lot

   When the priests were gathered for the first lot' in the Hall of
   Polished Stones,' as yet only the earliest glow of morning light
   streaked the Eastern sky. Much had to be done before the lamb itself
   could be slain. It was a law that, as no sacrifice might be brought
   after that of the evening, nor after the sun had set, so, on the other
   hand, the morning sacrifice was only to be slain after the morning
   light had lit up the whole sky as far as Hebron,' yet before the sun
   had actually risen upon the horizon. The only exception was on the
   great festivals, when the altar was cleansed much earlier, [81] to
   afford time for examining before actual sunrise the very numerous
   sacrifices which were to be brought during the day.

   Perhaps it was on this ground that, on the morning of the Passover,
   they who led Jesus from Caiaphas thronged so early' the judgment-hall
   of Pilate.' Thus, while some of them would be preparing in the Temple
   to offer the morning sacrifice, others were at the same moment
   unwittingly fulfilling the meaning of that very type, when He on whom
   was laid the iniquity of us all' was brought as a lamb to the
   slaughter' (Isa 53:7).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] This is not the place for further critical discussions. Though the
   arguments in support of our view are only inferential, they seem to us
   none the less conclusive. It is not only that the name of John (given
   also to the son of the priest Zacharias) reappears among the kindred of
   the high-priest (Acts 4:6), nor that his priestly descent would account
   for that acquaintance with the high-priest (John 18:15, 16) which gave
   him access apparently into the council-chamber itself, while Peter, for
   whom he had gained admittance to the palace, was in the porch'; nor yet
   that, though residing in Galilee, the house of his own' to which he
   took the mother of Jesus (John 19:27) was probably at Jerusalem, like
   that of other priests--notably of the Levite family of Barnabas (Acts
   12:12)--a supposition confirmed by his apparent entertainment of Peter,
   when Mary Magdalene found them together on the morning of the
   resurrection (John 20:2). But it seems highly improbable that a book so
   full of liturgical allusions as the Book of Revelation--and these, many
   of them, not to great or important points, but to minutia--could have
   been written by any other than a priest, and one who had at one time
   been in actual service in the Temple itself, and thus become so
   intimately conversant with its details, that they came to him
   naturally, as part of the imagery he employed.

   [68] Rabbi Elieser ben Jacob. See Middoth, i. 2.

   [69] The Rabbinical statement about a correspondence between that
   service and the burning of the yet unconsumed fat and flesh' of the
   sacrifices (which must have lasted all night) is so far-fetched that we
   wonder to see it in Kitto's Cyclopaedia, third edition (art.
   Synagogue), while Gratz's assertion that it corresponded to the closing
   of the Temple gates (Gesch, vol. iii. p. 97) is quite unsupported.

   [70] Sunset was calculated as on an average at 6 o'clock p.m. For a
   full discussion and many speculations on the whole subject, see
   Herzfeld, Gesch. d. V. Is, vol, iii. Excurs&lt; xxiv. par. 2.

   [71] Accordingly the Rabbis laid down the principle that evening
   prayers (of course, out of the Temple) might be lawfully said at any
   time after 12:30 p.m. This explains how Peter went up upon the
   house-top to pray about the sixth hour,' or about 12 o'clock (Acts
   10:9)--or to what was really evening prayer.' Comp. Kitto's Cycl. iii.
   p. 904.

   [72] Those who, being declared physically unfit, discharged only menial
   functions, wore not the priestly dress. They on whom no lot had fallen
   for daily ministration put off their priestly garments--all save the
   linen breeches--and also performed subordinate functions. But,
   according to some, it was lawful for priests while in the Temple to
   wear their peculiar dress--all but the girdle, worn always and only on
   sacrificial duty.

   [73] Probably this had also been the arrangement in the first Temple.
   See 2 Kings 11:9; 2 Chronicles 23:8. Herzfeld, u.s. p. 185.

   [74] The partaking of sacred things by priests who had been
   ceremonially unclean is expressly stated by the Rabbis as when the
   stars shone out.'

   [75] The Therumoth, such as oil, flour, etc., in opposition to those au
   naturel, such as corn, fruits, etc., called the Biccurim.

   [76] Of these there were four kinds, respectively bearing the words
   male,' when the sacrifice was a ram; 'sinner,' when it was a
   sin-offering; and for other offerings, calf,' or kid.'

   [77] The watch at some of the gates seems at one time to have been
   hereditary in certain families. For this, see Herzfeld, vol. i. p. 419;
   ii. p. 57.

   [78] Compare Matthew 14:25. See, however, the discussion in Jer. Ber.
   i. 1.

   [79] The part built out on the Chel; for it was not lawful for any but
   the king to sit down anywhere within the enclosure of the Priests'
   Court.'

   [80] Or Gazith, where also the Sanhedrim met. The sittings were, in
   that part, built out on the Chel.

   Atonement, at midnight. See also Lightfoot, Hor. Heb. p. 1135.

Chapter 8

  The Morning and the Evening Sacrifice [82]

   And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before
   God in the order of his course, according to the custom of the priest's
   office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the
   Lord. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
   time of incense.'--Luke 1:8-10.

    Public Prayer

   Before proceeding to describe the morning sacrifice,' it is necessary
   to advert to a point of considerable interest and importance. There can
   be no doubt that, at the time of Christ, public prayer occupied a very
   prominent place in the ordinary daily services of the Temple. Yet the
   original institution in the law of Moses contains no mention of it; and
   such later instances as the prayer of Hannah, or that of Solomon at the
   dedication of the Temple, afford neither indication nor precedent as
   regards the ordinary public services. The confession of the high-priest
   over the scape-goat (Lev 16:21) cannot be regarded as public prayer.
   Perhaps the nearest approach to it was on occasion of offering the
   firstfruits, especially in that concluding entreaty (Deut 26:15): Look
   down from Thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Thy people
   Israel, and the land which Thou hast given us, as Thou swarest unto our
   fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.' But, after all, this
   was again private, not public prayer, and offered on a private
   occasion, far different form the morning and evening sacrifices. The
   wording of King Solomon's prayer (1 Kings 8) implies indeed an act of
   united and congregational worship, but strictly speaking, it conveys no
   more than that public supplication was wont to be offered in times of
   public necessity (1 Kings 8:30-52). Nor can anything definite be
   inferred from the allusions of Isaiah to the hypocrisy of his
   contemporaries (Isa 1:15) in spreading forth their hands and making
   many prayers. [83]

    Regulations of the Rabbis

   It was otherwise after the return from Babylon. With the institution
   and spread of synagogues--designed for the twofold purpose, that in
   every place Moses should be read every Sabbath day, and to provide a
   place where prayer was wont to be made'--the practice of public worship
   soon became general. In Nehemiah 11:17 we find already a special
   appointment to begin the thanksgiving in prayer.' Afterwards progress
   in this direction was rapid. The Apocrypha afford painful evidence how
   soon all degenerated into a mere form, and how prayer became a work of
   self-righteousness, by which merit might be obtained. This brings us to
   the Pharisees of the New Testament, with their ostentatious displays of
   devotion, and the hypocrisy of their endless prayers, full of needless
   repetitions and odious self-assertion. At the outset we here meet, as
   usual, at least seeming contradictions. On the one hand, the Rabbis
   define every attitude and gesture in prayer, fix the most rigid
   formulas, trace each of them up to one of the patriarchs, [84] and
   would have us believe that the pious have their nine hours of devotion,
   laying down this curious principle, suited to both worlds--'Prolix
   prayer protracts life.'

   On the other hand, they also tell us that prayer may be contracted
   within the narrowest limits, and that a mere summary of the prescribed
   formulas is sufficient; while some of their number go the length of
   strenuously contending for free prayer. In fact, free prayer,
   liturgical formulas, and special prayers taught by celebrated Rabbis,
   were alike in use. Free prayer would find its place in such private
   devotions as are described in the parable of the Publican and the
   Pharisee. It also mingled with the prescribed liturgical formulas. It
   may be questioned whether, even in reference to the latter, the words
   were always rigidly adhered to, perhaps even accurately remembered.
   Hence the Talmud lays it down (in the treatise Berachoth), that in such
   cases it sufficed to say the substance of the prescribed prayers.

    Liturgical Forms

   That liturgical formulas were used not only in the Temple, but in the
   daily private devotions, cannot be doubted. The first trace of them
   appears so early as in the arrangement of the Psalter, each of its
   first four books closing with a eulogy,' or benediction (Psa 41; 72;
   89; 106), and the fifth book with a psalm which may be designated as
   one grand doxology (Psa 150). Although it is a task of no small
   difficulty to separate the ancient prayers of Temple-times from the
   later additions, which have gradually swelled into the present Jewish
   prayer-book, it has, in great measure, successfully been accomplished.
   Besides such liturgical formulas, some prayers taught by celebrated
   Rabbis have been preserved. It was in accordance with this practice
   that John the Baptist seems to have given forms of prayer to his
   followers, and that the disciples asked the Saviour to teach them to
   pray (Luke 11:1).

    The Lord's Prayer

   The prayer spoken by the Lord far transcended any that Jewish Rabbis
   ever conceived, even where its wording most nearly approaches theirs.
   [85]

   It is characteristic that two of its petitions find no real counterpart
   in the prayers of the Rabbis. These are: Forgive us our trespasses,'
   and Lead us not into temptation.' In the Temple the people never
   responded to the prayers by an Amen, but always with this benediction,
   Blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom for ever!' [86]

   This formula was traced up to the patriarch Jacob, on his death-bed. In
   regard to the kingdom,' whatever the Rabbis understood by it, the
   feeling was so strong, that it was said: Any prayer which makes not
   mention of the kingdom, is not a prayer at all.'

    Attitude in Prayer

   The attitude to be observed during prayer is very accurately defined by
   the Rabbis. The worshipper was to stand, turning towards the Holy
   Place; he was to compose his body and his clothes, to draw his feet
   close together, to cast down his eyes, at least at the beginning of his
   prayer, to cross his hands over his breast, and to stand as a servant
   before his master, with all reverence and fear.' Even the priests,
   while pronouncing the priestly blessing, were to look to the ground. In
   regard to the special manner of bowing before the Lord, a distinction
   was made between bending the knees, bending the head, and falling
   prostrate on the ground. The latter was not deemed fit for every man,
   but only for such as knew themselves righteous men, like Joshua.

    The Two Elements in Prayer

   In general the Rabbis distinguish two elements in prayer, on the ground
   of the two terms used by Solomon (1 Kings 8:28), --thanksgiving and
   petition. To these correspond the two kinds of early Jewish prayer: the
   Eulogies and the Tephillah. And thus far correctly, as the two Hebrew
   words for prayer indicate, the one adoration, the other supplication,
   or, rather, intercession. Both kinds of prayer found expression in the
   Temple services. But only after the manifestation of Him, who in His
   person united the Divine with the human nature, could adoration and
   supplication be fully called out. Nay, the idea of supplication would
   only be properly realised after the outpouring of the Spirit of
   adoption, whereby the people of God also became the children of God.
   Hence it is not correct to designate sacrifices as prayers without
   words.' The sacrifices were in no sense prayers, but rather the
   preparation for prayer. The Tabernacle was, as its Hebrew designation
   shows, the place of meeting' between God and Israel; the sacrificial
   service, that which made such meeting possible; and the priest (as the
   root of the word implies), he who brought Israel near to God. Hence
   prayer could only follow after the sacrifice; and its appropriate
   symbol and time was the burning of incense. This view is expressed in
   the words: Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense' (Psa
   141:2), and authoritatively confirmed in Revelation 5:8, where we read
   of the golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of saints.'

    Burning the Incense

   It is this burning of incense which in the Gospel is alluded to in
   connection with the birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:9). Zacharias had
   come up from the hill country of Judea, from the neighbourhood of
   priestly Hebron, to minister in the Temple. His course--that of
   Abia--was on duty for the week, and the house of his fathers' for that
   special day. More than that, the lot had fallen on Zacharias for the
   most honourable service in the daily ministry--that of burning the
   incense on the golden altar within the Holy Place. For the first time
   in his life, and for the last, would this service devolve on him. As
   the pious old priest ministered within the Holy Place, he saw with such
   distinctness that he could afterwards describe the very spot, Gabriel
   standing, as if he had just come out from the Most Holy Place, between
   the altar and the table of shewbread, on the right side of the altar.'
   So far as we know, this was the first and only angelic appearance in
   the Temple. For we cannot attach serious importance to the tradition
   that, during the forty years of his pontificate, an angel always
   accompanied Simeon the Just, when on the Day of Atonement he entered
   and left the Most Holy Place, except the last year, when the angel left
   him in the Sanctuary, to show that this was to be the end of his
   ministry. What passed between Gabriel and Zacharias is beside our
   present purpose. Suffice it to notice several details incidentally
   mentioned in this narrative, such as that a special lot was cast for
   this ministry; that the priest was alone in the Holy Place while
   burning the incense; and that the whole multitude of the people were
   praying without at the time of incense.'

    Filling the Laver

   The lot for burning the incense was, as we have seen, the third by
   which the order of the ministry for the day was determined. The first
   lot, which in reality had been cast before the actual break of day, was
   that to designate the various priests who were to cleanse the altar and
   to prepare its fires. The first of the priests on whom this lot had
   fallen immediately went out. His brethren reminded him where the silver
   chafing-dish was deposited, and not to touch any sacred vessel till he
   had washed his hands and feet. He took no light with him; the fire of
   the altar was sufficient for his office. Hands and feet were washed by
   laying the right hand on the right foot, and the left hand on the left.
   [87]

   The sound of the machinery, as it filled the laver with water,
   admonished the others to be in readiness. This machinery had been made
   by Ben Catin, who also altered the laver so that twelve priests could
   at the same time perform their ablutions. Otherwise the laver resembled
   that in the Temple of Solomon. It was of brass. All the vessels in the
   Sanctuary were of metal, the only exception being the altar of
   burnt-offering, which was solid, and wholly of stones taken from virgin
   soil, that had not been defiled by any tool of iron. The stones were
   fastened together by mortar, pitch, and molten lead. The measurement of
   the altar is differently given by Josephus and the Rabbis. It seems to
   have consisted of three sections, each narrower than the former: the
   base being thirty-two cubits wide, the middle twenty-eight, and the
   top, where the fire was laid (of course, not including the horns of the
   altar nor the space where the priests moved), only twenty-four cubits.
   With the exception of some parts of the altar, in which the cubit was
   calculated at five hand-breadths, the sacred cubit of the Temple was
   always reckoned at six hand-breadths. Lastly, as readers of the New
   Testament know, whatever touched the altar, or, indeed, any sacred
   vessel, was regarded as sanctified' (Matt 23:19), but no vessel could
   be dedicated to the use of the Temple which had not been originally
   destined for it.

    Preparing the Altar

   But to return. While the assistant priests were waiting, the first
   priest had taken the silver chafing-dish, and scraped the fire on the
   altar, removing the burnt coals, and depositing them at a little
   distance north of the altar. As he descended, the other priests quickly
   washed hands and feet, and took shovels and prongs, with which they
   moved aside what of the sacrifices had been left unburned from the
   previous evening, then cleaned out the ashes, laying part on the great
   heap in the middle of the altar, and the rest in a place whence it was
   afterwards carried out of the Temple. The next duty was to lay on the
   altar fresh wood, which, however, might be neither from the olive nor
   the vine. For the fire destined to feed the altar of incense the wood
   of the fig-tree was exclusively used, so as to secure good and
   sufficient charcoal. The hitherto unconsumed pieces of the sacrifice
   were now again laid upon the fire.

    The Second Lot

   These preliminaries finished, the priests gathered once more for the
   second lot. The priest on whom it fell was designated, along with the
   twelve who stood nearest to him, for offering the sacrifice and
   cleansing the candlestick and the altar of incense. Immediately after
   casting this second lot, the president directed one to ascend some
   pinnacle,' and see whether it was time to kill the daily sacrifice. If
   the priest reported, The morning shineth already,' he was again asked,
   Is the sky lit up as far as Hebron?' If so, the president ordered the
   lamb to be brought from the chamber by the Beth-Moked, where it had
   been kept in readiness for four days. Others fetched the gold and
   silver vessels of service, of which the Rabbis enumerate ninety-three.
   The sacrificial lamb was now watered out of a golden bowl, and anew
   examined by torch-light, though its Levitical fitness had been already
   ascertained the evening before. Then the sacrificing priest, surrounded
   by his assistants, fastened the lamb to the second of the rings on the
   north side of the altar--in the morning in the western, in the evening
   in the eastern corner. [88]

   The sacrifice was held together by its feet, the fore and hind feet of
   each side being tied together; its head was laid towards the south and
   fastened through a ring, and its face turned to the west, while the
   sacrificing priest stood on the east side. The elders who carried the
   keys now gave the order for opening the Temple gates. As the last great
   gate slowly moved on its hinges, the priests, on a signal given, blew
   three blasts on their silver trumpets, summoning the Levites and the
   representatives' of the people (the so-called stationary men') to their
   duties, and announcing to the city that the morning sacrifice was about
   to be offered. Immediately upon this the great gates which led into the
   Holy Place itself were opened to admit the priests who were to cleanse
   the candlestick and the altar of incense.

    The Slaying of the Lamb

   The opening of these gates was the signal for actually slaying the
   sacrificial lamb. The sacrifice was offered in the following manner.
   One priest drew forward the windpipe and gullet of the sacrifice, and
   quickly thrust upwards the knife, while another caught the blood in a
   golden bowel. Standing at the east side of the altar, he sprinkled it,
   first at the north-east, and then at the south-west corner, below the
   red line which ran round the middle of the altar, in each case in such
   manner as to cover two sides of the altar, or, as it is described, in
   the form of the Greek letter (gamma). The rest of the blood was poured
   out at the base of the altar. Ordinarily, the whole of this service
   would of course be performed by priests. But it was valid even if the
   sacrifice had been killed by a layman, or with an ordinary knife. Not
   so if the blood were caught up in any but a consecrated vessel, or
   sprinkled by other than the hands of a priest who at the time was
   Levitically fit for the service.

    The Altar of Incense and the Candlestick

   We proceed to describe the service of those whose duty it was to
   cleanse the altar of incense and to dress the golden candlestick in the
   Holy Place. A few particulars as to each of these will not be out of
   place. The triumphal Arch of Titus in Rome bears a representation of
   the golden mortars in which the incense was bruised, and of the golden
   candlestick, but not the altar of incense. Still, we can form a
   sufficiently accurate idea of its appearance. It was square, one cubit
   long and broad, and two cubits high, that is, half a cubit higher than
   the table of shewbread, but one cubit lower than the candlestick, and
   it had horns' at each of its four corners. It was probably hollow, and
   its top covered with a golden plate, and like an Eastern roof,
   surrounded by what resembled a balustrade, to prevent the coals and
   incense from falling off. Below this balustrade was a massive crown of
   gold. The incense burned upon this altar was prepared of the four
   ingredients mentioned in Exodus 30:34, with which, according to the
   Rabbis, seven others were mixed, besides a small quantity of Ambra,'
   and of a herb which gave out a dense smoke. To these thirteen
   substances (Jos. Wars, v. 5. s.) salt was of course added. The mode of
   preparing the incense had been preserved in the family of Abtinas. The
   greatest care was taken to have the incense thoroughly bruised and
   mixed. Altogether 368 pounds were made for the year's consumption,
   about half a pound being used every morning and evening in the service.
   The censer for the Day of Atonement was different in size and
   appearance from that for ordinary days. The golden candlestick was like
   that delineated in Exodus 25:31, etc., and is sufficiently known from
   its representation on the Arch of Titus.

   Now, while one set of priests were busy in the Court of the Priests
   offering the sacrifice, the two on whom it devolved to trim the lamps
   of the candlestick and to prepare the altar of incense had gone into
   the Holy Place. As nearly as possible while the lamb was being slain
   without, the first of these priests took with his hands the burnt coals
   and ashes from the golden altar, and put them into a golden
   vessel--called teni'--and withdrew, leaving it in the sanctuary.
   Similarly, as the blood of the lamb was being sprinkled on the altar of
   burnt-offering, the second priest ascended the three steps, hewn in
   stone, which led up to the candlestick. He trimmed and refilled the
   lamps that were still burning, removed the wick and old oil from those
   which had become extinguished, supplied fresh, and re-lit them from one
   of the other lamps. But the large central lamp, towards which all the
   others bent, and which was called the western, because it inclined
   westward towards the Most Holy Place, might only be re-lit by fire from
   the altar itself. Only five, however, of the lamps were then trimmed;
   the other two were reserved to a later period of the service.

    Salting the Sacrifice

   Meantime in the Court of the Priests the sacrifice had been hung on one
   of the hooks, flayed, cut up according to rules, cleaned, and handed to
   the six priests who were successively to carry up the pieces to the
   rise of the altar, where they were salted and deposited. For every
   sacrifice must be salted with salt'--nay, everything that was laid on
   the altar, except the drink-offering. At the same time, three other
   priests carried up to the rise of the altar the daily meat-offering,
   that of the high-priest, and the drink-offering. The skins of the
   sacrifices were salted, and on the eve of each Sabbath distributed
   among the course' of priests that had been on ministry. [89]

    Prayer Before the Third Lot

   And now the most solemn part of the service was about to begin. For the
   third time the priests assembled in the Hall of Polished Stones,' to
   draw the third and the fourth lots. But before doing so the president
   called on them to join in the prescribed prayers. Tradition has
   preserved these to us. Subjecting them to the severest criticism, so as
   to eliminate all later details, the words used by the priests before
   the third and fourth lots were as follows:

   With great love hast Thou loved us, O Lord our God, and with much
   overflowing pity hast Thou pitied us. Our Father and our King, for the
   sake of our fathers who trusted in Thee, and Thou taughtest them the
   statutes of life, have mercy upon us, and enlighten our eyes [90] [in
   Thy law; cause our hearts to cleave to Thy commandments; unite our
   hearts to love and to fear Thy name, and we shall not be put to shame,
   world without end. For Thou art a God who preparest salvation, and us
   hast Thou chosen from among all nations and tongues, and hast, in
   truth, brought us near to Thy great name, Selah, in order] that we in
   love may praise Thee and Thy Unity. Blessed be the Lord, who in love
   chose His people Israel.'

   After this prayer the ten commandments were (at one time) wont to be
   repeated, a practice discontinued, however, lest the Sadducees should
   declare them to be the only essential part of the law. Then all
   assembled said the so-called Shema' [91] which may be designated as a
   sort of credo' or belief.' It consisted of these three
   passages--Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21; and Numbers 15:37-41.

    The Lot for Incense

   After this the lot was cast for burning the incense. No one might take
   part in it who had ministered in that office before, unless in the very
   rare case that all present had previously so officiated. Hence, while
   the other three lots held good for the evening service, that for the
   incense required to be repeated. He on whom this lot fell chose from
   among his friends his two assistants. Finally, the third was succeeded
   by the fourth lot, which designated those who were to lay on the altar
   the sacrifice and the meat-offerings, and to pour out the
   drink-offering.

    Offering the Incense

   The incensing priest and his assistance now approached first the altar
   of burnt-offering. One filled with incense a golden censer held in a
   silver vessel, while another placed in a golden bowl burning coals from
   the altar. As they passed from the court into the Holy Place, they
   struck a large instrument (called the Magrephah'), at sound of which
   the priests hastened from all parts to worship, and the Levites to
   occupy their places in the service of song; while the chief of the
   stationary men' ranged at the Gate of Nicanor such of the people as
   were to be purified that day. Slowly the incensing priest and his
   assistants ascended the steps to the Holy Place, preceded by the two
   priests who had formerly dressed the altar and the candlestick, and who
   now removed the vessels they had left behind, and, worshipping,
   withdrew. Next, one of the assistants reverently spread the coals on
   the golden altar; the other arranged the incense; and then the chief
   officiating priest was left alone within the Holy Place, to await the
   signal of the president before burning the incense. It was probably
   while thus expectant that the angel Gabriel appeared to Zacharias. As
   the president gave the word of command, which marked that the time of
   incense had come,' the whole multitude of the people without' withdrew
   from the inner court, and fell down before the Lord, spreading their
   hands [92] in silent prayer.

    Imagery in the Apocalypse

   It is this most solemn period, when throughout the vast Temple
   buildings deep silence rested on the worshipping multitude, while
   within the sanctuary itself the priest laid the incense on the golden
   altar, and the cloud of odours' (Rev 5:8) rose up before the Lord,
   which serves as the image of heavenly things in this description (Rev
   8:1, 3, 4): [93] and when He had opened the seventh seal, there was
   silence in heaven about the space of half an hour . . . And another
   angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there
   was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the
   prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the
   throne. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of
   the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.'

    Prayers with the Incense

   The prayers offered by priests and people at this part of the service
   are recorded by tradition as follows: [94] True it is that Thou art
   Jehovah our God, and the God of our fathers; our King and the King of
   our fathers; our Saviour and the Saviour of our fathers; our Maker and
   the Rock of our salvation; our Help and our Deliverer. Thy name is from
   everlasting, and there is no God beside Thee. A new song did they that
   were delivered sing to Thy name by the sea-shore; together did all
   praise and own Thee as King, and say, Jehovah shall reign who saveth
   Israel. [95]

   Be graciously pleased, Jehovah our God, with Thy people Israel, and
   with their prayer. Restore the service to the oracle of Thy house; and
   the burnt-offerings of Israel and their prayer accept graciously and in
   love; and let the service of Thy people Israel be ever well-pleasing
   unto Thee.

   We praise Thee, who art Jehovah our God, and the God of our fathers,
   the God of all flesh, our Creator, and the Creator from the beginning!
   Blessing and praise be to Thy great and holy name, that Thou hast
   preserved us in life and kept us. So preserve us and keep us, and
   gather the scattered ones into Thy holy courts, to keep Thy statutes,
   and to do Thy good pleasure, and to serve Thee with our whole heart, as
   this day we confess unto Thee. Blessed be the Lord, unto whom belongeth
   praise.

   Appoint peace, goodness, and blessing; grace, mercy, and compassion for
   us, and for all Israel Thy people. Bless us, O our Father, all of us as
   one, with the light of Thy countenance. For in the light of Thy
   countenance hast Thou, Jehovah, our God, given us the law of life, and
   loving mercy, and righteousness, and blessing, and compassion, and
   life, and peace. And may it please Thee to bless Thy people Israel at
   all times, and at every hour with Thy peace. [May we and all Thy people
   Israel be remembered and written before Thee in the book of life, with
   blessing and peace and support.] Blessed be Thou, Jehovah, who blessest
   Thy people Israel with peace.'

   These prayers ended, he who had formerly trimmed the candlestick once
   more entered the Holy Place, to kindle the two lamps that had been left
   unlit; and then, in company with the incensing priest, took his stand
   on the top of the steps which led down to the Court of the Priests.
   [96]

   The other three who had also ministered within the Holy Place gathered
   beside him, still carrying the vessels of their ministry; while the
   rest of the priests grouped themselves on the steps beneath. Meanwhile
   he on whom the fourth lot had fallen had ascended to the altar. They
   whose duty it was handed to him, one by one, the pieces of the
   sacrifice. Upon each he pressed his hands, and next flung them
   confusedly upon the fire, that so the flesh of the sacrifice might be
   scattered as well as its blood sprinkled. After that he ranged them in
   order, to imitate as nearly as possible the natural shape of the
   animal. This part of the service was not unfrequently performed by the
   high-priest himself.

    The Blessing

   The priests, who were ranged on the steps to the Holy Place, now lifted
   their hands above their heads, spreading and joining their fingers in a
   peculiar mystical manner. [97]

   One of their number, probably the incensing priest, repeated in audible
   voice, followed by the others, the blessing in Numbers 6:24-26: Jehovah
   bless thee, and keep thee: Jehovah make His face shine upon thee, and
   be gracious unto thee: Jehovah lift up His countenance upon thee, and
   give thee peace.' To this the people responded, Blessed be the Lord
   God, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.' In the modern
   synagogues the priestly blessing is divided into three parts; it is
   pronounced with a disguised voice and veiled faces, while the word
   Lord' is substituted for the name of Jehovah.' [98]

   Of course all this was not the case in the Temple. But if it had been
   the duty of Zacharias, as incensing priest for the day, to lead in the
   priestly blessing, we can all the better understand the wonder of the
   people as he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless' (Luke 1:22)
   while they waited for his benediction.

   After the priestly blessing the meat-offering was brought, and, as
   prescribed in the law, oil added to it. Having been salted, it was laid
   on the fire. Next the high-priest's daily meat-offering was presented,
   consisting of twelve cakes broken in halves--twelve half-cakes being
   presented in the morning, and the other twelve in the evening. Finally,
   the appropriate drink-offering was poured out upon the foundation of
   the altar (perhaps there may be an allusion to this in Revelation 6:9,
   10).

    The Temple Music

   Upon this the Temple music began. It was the duty of the priests, who
   stood on the right and the left of the marble table on which the fat of
   the sacrifices was laid, at the proper time to blow the blasts on their
   silver trumpets. There might not be less than two nor more than 120 in
   this service; the former in accordance with the original institution
   (Num 10:2), the latter not to exceed the number at the dedication of
   the first Temple (2 Chron 5:12). The priests faced the people, looking
   eastwards, while the Levites, who crowded the fifteen steps which led
   from the Court of Israel to that of the Priests, turned westwards to
   the sanctuary. On a signal given by the president, the priests moved
   forward to each side of him who struck the cymbals. Immediately the
   choir of the Levites, accompanied by instrumental music, began the
   Psalm of the day. It was sustained by not less than twelve voices, with
   which mingled the delicious treble from selected voices of young sons
   of the Levites, who, standing by their fathers, might take part in this
   service alone. The number of instrumental performers was not limited,
   nor yet confined to the Levites, some of the distinguished families
   which had intermarried with the priests being admitted to this service.
   [99]

   The Psalm of the day was always sung in three sections. At the close of
   each the priests drew three blasts from their silver trumpets, and the
   people bowed down and worshipped. This closed the morning service. It
   was immediately followed by the sacrifices and offerings which private
   Israelites might have to bring, and which would occasionally continue
   till near the time for the evening service. The latter resembled in all
   respects that of the morning, except that the lot was only cast for the
   incense; that the incense was burned, not, as in the morning, before,
   but after the pieces of the sacrifice had been laid on the fire of the
   altar, and that the priestly blessing was generally admitted.

    The Order of Psalms

   The following was the order of the Psalms in the daily service of the
   Temple (Tamid, sect. vii, and Maimonides in Tamid). On the first day of
   the week they sang Psalm 24, The earth is the Lord's,' etc., in
   commemoration of the first day of creation, when God possessed the
   world, and ruled in it.' On the second day they sang Psalm 48, Great is
   the Lord, and greatly to be praised,' etc., because on the second day
   of creation the Lord divided His works, and reigned over them.' On the
   third day they sang Psalm 82, God standeth in the congregation of the
   mighty,' etc., because on that day the earth appeared, on which are the
   Judge and the judged.' On the fourth day Psalm 94 was sung, O Lord God,
   to whom vengeance belongeth,' etc., because on the fourth day God made
   the sun, moon, and stars, and will be avenged on those that worship
   them.' On the fifth day they sang Psalm 81, Sing aloud unto God our
   strength,' etc., because of the variety of creatures made that day to
   praise His name.' On the sixth day Psalm 93 was sung, The Lord
   reigneth,' etc., because on that day God finished His works and made
   man, and the Lord ruled over all His works.' Lastly, on the Sabbath day
   they sang Psalm 92, It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord,'
   etc., because the Sabbath was symbolical of the millennial kingdom at
   the end of the six thousand years' dispensation, when the Lord would
   reign over all, and His glory and service fill the earth with
   thanksgiving.'

   [82] In Hebrew, Tamid, the constant sacrifice, sacrificium juge.

   [83] Such language as that of Psalm 27:4 seems also to point to the
   absence of any liturgy: to behold the beauty of the Lord.'

   [84] The Rabbis ascribe the origin of the morning prayers to Abraham,
   that of the afternoon prayers to Isaac, and of the evening prayers to
   Jacob. In each case supposed Scriptural evidence for it is dragged in
   by some artificial mode of interpretation.

   [85] It must always be kept in mind that such expressions as Our
   Father,' Thy kingdom come,' and others like them, meant in the mouth of
   the Rabbis a predominance of the narrowest Judaism; in fact, the
   subjection of all the world to Rabbinical ordinances, and the carnal
   glory of Israel.

   [86] Thus the words in our Authorised Version, Matthew 6:13, For Thine
   is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen,' which
   are wanting in all the most ancient MSS, are only the common
   Temple-formula of response, and as such may have found their way into
   the text. The word Amen' was in reality a solemn asseveration or a mode
   of oath.

   [87] Perhaps this might therefore be appropriately described as washing
   the feet only,' (John 13:10).

   [88] The sacrifice was always offered against the sun.

   [89] This in the case of burnt-, sin-, or trespass-offerings. The skins
   of the other offerings belonged to the offerers themselves.

   [90] The words here and afterwards within square brackets are regarded
   by Jost (Gesch. d. Jud.) as a later addition.

   [91] So named from the first word, Shema, Hear,' viz. O Israel,' etc.
   By one of the strangest mistakes, Lightfoot confounds the contents of
   the Shema' with those of the phylacteries.

   [92] The practice of folding the hands together in prayer dates from
   the fifth century of our era, and is of purely Saxon origin. See
   Holemann, Bibel St. i. p. 150, quoted by Delitzsch, u.s.

   [93] According to Tamid, vi. 3, the incensing priest bowed down,' or
   prayed, on withdrawing backwards from the Holy Place.

   [94] A few details for those who wish fuller information. Tradition has
   preserved two kinds of fragments from the ancient Jewish liturgy in the
   times of the Temple. The one is called the Tephillah,' or Prayer, the
   other the Eulogies,' or Benedictions. Of the latter there are eighteen,
   of which the three first and the three last are the oldest, though
   four, five, six, eight, and nine are also of considerable antiquity. Of
   the ancient Tephilloth four have been preserved--two used before and
   two (in the morning, one) after the Shema. The first morning and the
   last evening Tephillah are strictly morning and evening prayers. They
   were not used in the Temple service. The second Tephillah before the
   Shema was said by the priests in the Hall of Polished Stones,' and the
   first Tephillah after the Shema by priests and people during the
   burning of incense. This was followed by the three last of the eighteen
   Eulogies. Is it not a fair inference, then, that while the priests said
   their prayers in the hall,' the people repeated the three first
   Eulogies, which are of equal antiquity with the three last, which we
   know to have been repeated during the burning of incense?

   [95] Now follow in the text the three last Eulogies.'

   [96] According to Maimonides, it was at this part of the service, and
   not before, that the sound of the Magrephah summoned the priests to
   worship, the Levites to their song, and the 'stationary men' to their
   duties.

   [97] The high-priest lifted his hands no higher than the golden plate
   on his mitre. It is well know that, in pronouncing the priestly
   blessing in the synagogue, the priests join their two outspread hands,
   by making the tip of the first fingers touch each other. At the same
   time, the first and second, and the third and fourth fingers in each
   hand are knit together, while a division is made between those fingers
   by spreading them apart. A rude representation of this may be seen in
   Jewish cemeteries on the gravestones of priests.

   [98] Dr. Geiger has an interesting argument to show that in olden times
   the pronunciation of the so-called ineffable name Jehovah,' which now
   is never spoken, was allowed even in ordinary life. See Urschrift u.
   Uebers d. Bibel, p. 259, etc.

   [99] It is a curious coincidence that of the two families named in the
   Talmud as admitted to this service, one--that of Tsippariah--should
   have been from Emmaus' (Luke 24:13).

Chapter 9

  Sabbath in the Temple

   The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath: therefore
   the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.'--Mark 2:27, 28.

    The Law Not A Burden, But A Gift

   It is a beautifully significant practice of the modern Jews, that,
   before fulfilling any special observance directed in their Law, they
   always first bless God for the giving of it. One might almost compare
   the idea underlying this, and much else of a similar character in the
   present religious life of Israel, to the good fruits which the soil of
   Palestine bore even during the Sabbatical years, when it lay untilled.
   For it is intended to express that the Law is felt not a burden, but a
   gift of God in which to rejoice. And this holds specially true of the
   Sabbath in its Divine institution, of which it was distinctly said, I
   gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they
   might know that I, Jehovah, sanctify them' (Eze 20:12). In the same
   sense, the Sabbath is called a delight, the holy of Jehovah,
   honourable' (Isa 58:13); and the great burden of the Sabbath-Psalm (Psa
   92) [100] is that of joyous thanksgiving unto God.

   The term Sabbath, resting,' points to the origin and meaning of the
   weekly festival. The Rabbis hold that it was not intended for the
   Gentiles, and most of them trace the obligation of its observance only
   to the legislation on Mount Sinai. Nor is another Rabbinical saying,
   that circumcision and the Sabbath preceded the law,' inconsistent with
   this. For even if the duty of Sabbath-observance had only commenced
   with the promulgation of the law on Mount Sinai, yet the Sabbath-law
   itself rested on the original hallowing' of the seventh day, when God
   rested from all His works (Gen 2:3). But this was not the only rest to
   which the Sabbath pointed. There is also a rest of redemption, and the
   Sabbath was expressly connected with the deliverance of Israel from
   Egypt. Remember that thou was a servant in the land of Egypt, and that
   Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a
   stretched out arm: therefore Jehovah thy God commanded thee to keep the
   Sabbath-day' (Deut 5:15). At the close of the work-a-day week, holy
   rest in the Lord; at the end of the labour and sorrow of Egypt,
   redemption and rest; and both pointing forward to the better rest (Heb
   4:9), and ultimately to the eternal Sabbath of completed work, of
   completed redemption, and completed hallowing' (Rev 11)--such was the
   meaning of the weekly Sabbath. It was because this idea of festive rest
   and sanctification was so closely connected with the weekly festival
   that the term Sabbath was also applied to the great festivals (as Lev
   23:15, 24, 32, 39). For a similar reason, the number seven, which was
   that of the weekly Sabbath (the first seven that had appeared in time),
   became in Scripture-symbolism the sacred or covenant number. [101]

    Later Perversion of the Sabbath

   It is necessary to bear all this in remembrance when thinking of what
   the perverted ingenuity of the Rabbis made the Sabbath at the time of
   Christ, and probably even more in the generations following. For there
   is evidence that the Sabbath-law has become stricter than it had been,
   since, for instance, the practice of taking an ox or an ass out of a
   pit, to which our Saviour alludes (Luke 14:5) as uncontroverted, would
   now no longer be lawful, unless, indeed, the animal were in actual
   danger of life; otherwise, it is to receive food and water in the pit.
   This actual danger to life,' whether to beast or to man (at any rate,
   to Israelites), determined the only cases in which a breach of the law
   of Sabbath-observance was allowed. At the outset, indeed, it must be
   admitted that the whole social Rabbinical legislation on the subject
   seems to rest on two sound underlying principles: negatively, the
   avoidance of all that might become work; and, positively, the doing of
   all which, in the opinion of the Rabbis, might tend to make the Sabbath
   a delight.' Hence, not only were fasting and mourning strictly
   prohibited, but food, dress, and every manner of enjoyment, not
   incompatible with abstinence from work, were prescribed to render the
   day pleasurable. All the days of the week,' the Rabbis say, has God
   paired, except the Sabbath, which is alone, that it may be wedded to
   Israel.' Israel was to welcome the Sabbath as a bride; its advent as
   that of a king. But in practice all this terribly degenerated. Readers
   of the New Testament know how entirely, and even cruelly, the spirit
   and object of the Sabbath were perverted by the traditions of the
   elders.' But those only who have studied the Jewish law on the subject
   can form any adequate conception of the state of matters. Not to speak
   of the folly of attempting to produce joy by prescribed means, nor of
   the incongruousness of those means, considering the sacred character of
   the day, the almost numberless directions about avoiding work must have
   made a due observance of the Sabbath-rest the greatest labour of all.
   All work was arranged under thirty-nine chief classes, or fathers,'
   each of them having ever so many descendants,' or subordinate
   divisions. Thus, reaping' was one of the fathers,' or chief classes,
   and plucking ears of corn' one of its descendants. So far did this
   punctiliousness go that it became necessary to devise ingenious means
   to render the ordinary intercourse of life possible, and to evade the
   inconvenient strictness of the law which regulated a Sabbath-day's
   journey.' [102]

    The Schools of Shammai and Hillel

   The school of Shammai, the sect of the Essenes, and strange to say, the
   Samaritans, were the most stringent in their Sabbath-observance. The
   school of Shammai held that the duty of Sabbath-rest extended not only
   to men and to beasts, but even to inanimate objects, so that no process
   might be commenced on the Friday which would go on of itself during the
   Sabbath, such as laying out flax to dry, or putting wool into dye. The
   school of Hillel excluded inanimate things from the Sabbath-rest, and
   also allowed work to be given on a Friday to Gentiles, irrespective of
   the question whether they could complete it before the Sabbath began.
   Both schools allowed the preparation of the Passover-meal on the
   Sabbath, and also priests, while on their ministry in the Temple, to
   keep up the fire in the Beth Moked.' But this punctilious enforcement
   of the Sabbath-rest became occasionally dangerous to the nation. For at
   one time the Jews would not even defend themselves on the Sabbath
   against hostile attacks of armies, till the Maccabees laid down the
   principle, which ever afterwards continued in force (Jos. Anti. xii. 6,
   2; xiv. 4, 2.), that defensive, though not offensive, warfare was
   lawful on the holy day. Even as thus modified, the principle involved
   peril, and during the last siege of Jerusalem it was not uniformly
   carried out (compare Jewish Wars, ii. 19, 2, but, on the other hand,
   Antiq, xiv. 4, 2.). Nor was it, so far as we can judge from analogy
   (Josh 6:15, etc), sanctioned by Scripture precedent. But this is not
   the place further to explain either the Scripture or the Rabbinical law
   of Sabbath-observance, as it affected the individual, the home, and the
   social life, nor yet to describe the Sabbath-worship in the ancient
   synagogues of Palestine. We confine our attention to what passed in the
   Temple itself.

    Scripture Rules for the Sabbath

   The only directions given in Scripture for the celebration of the
   Sabbath in the sanctuary are those which enjoin a holy convocation,' or
   a sacred assembly (Lev 23:3); the weekly renewal of the shewbread (Lev
   24:8; Num 4:7); and an additional burnt-offering of two lambs, with the
   appropriate meat- and drink-offerings, beside the continual' (that is,
   the ordinary daily) burnt-offering and his drink-offering' (Num 28:9,
   10). But the ancient records of tradition enable us to form a very
   vivid conception of Sabbath-worship in the Temple at the time of
   Christ. Formally, the Sabbath commenced at sunset on Friday, the day
   being reckoned by the Hebrews from sunset to sunset. As no special hour
   for this was fixed, it must, of course, have varied not only at
   different seasons, but in different localities. Thus, the Rabbis
   mention that the inhabitants of a low-lying city, like Tiberias,
   commenced the observance of the Sabbath half an hour earlier, while
   those who lived on an eminence, such as at Sepphoris, [103] continued
   it half an hour later than their brethren.

   If the sun were not visible, sunset was to be reckoned from when the
   fowls went to roost. But long before that the preparations for the
   Sabbath had commenced. Accordingly, Friday is called by the Rabbis the
   eve of the Sabbath,' and in the Gospels the preparation' [104] (Mark
   15:42; John 19:31)

   No fresh business was then undertaken; no journey of any distance
   commenced; but everything purchased and made ready against the feast,
   the victuals being placed in a heated oven, and surrounded by dry
   substances to keep them warm. Early on Friday afternoon, the new
   course' of priests, of Levites, and of the stationary men,' who were to
   be the representatives of all Israel, arrived in Jerusalem, and having
   prepared themselves for the festive season, went up to the Temple. The
   approach of the Sabbath, and then its actual commencement, were
   announced by threefold blasts from the priests' trumpets. The first
   three blasts were drawn when one-third of the evening sacrifice service
   was over'; or, as we gather from the decree by which the Emperor
   Augustus set the Jews free from attendance in courts of law (Jos. Ant.
   xvi. 6, 2.), about the ninth hour, that is, about three p.m. on Friday.
   This, as we remember, was the hour when Jesus gave up the ghost (Matt
   27:45; Mark 15:34; Luke 23:44). When the priests for the first time
   sounded their trumpets, all business was to cease, and every kind of
   work to be stopped. Next, the Sabbath-lamp, of which even heathen
   writers knew (Seneca, ep. 95.), was lit, and the festive garments put
   on. A second time the priests drew a threefold blast, to indicate that
   the Sabbath had actually begun. But the service of the new course' of
   priests had commenced before that. After the Friday evening service,
   the altar of burnt-offering was cleansed from its stains of blood.
   [105]

   Then the outgoing course' handed over to the incoming the keys of the
   sanctuary, the holy vessels, and all else of which they had had charge.
   Next the heads of the houses' or families of the incoming course'
   determined by lot which of the families were to serve on each special
   day of their week of ministry, and also who were to discharge the
   various priestly functions on the Sabbath.

    The Shewbread

   The first of these functions, immediately on the commencement of the
   Sabbath, was the renewal of the shewbread.' It had been prepared by the
   incoming course before the Sabbath itself, and--we might almost say,
   invariably--in one of the chambers of the Temple, though, in theory, it
   was held lawful to prepare it also at Bethphage. For, although it was a
   principle that there is no Sabbath in the sanctuary,' yet no work was
   allowed which might have been done on any other day. Even circumcision,
   which, like the Temple services, according to the Rabbis, superseded
   the Sabbath, was deferred by some to the close of the festive day.
   Hence, also, if Friday, on the afternoon of which the shewbread was
   ordinarily prepared, fell on a feast day that required Sabbatical rest,
   the shewbread was prepared on the Thursday afternoon. [106] The Rabbis
   are at pains to explain the particular care with which it was made and
   baked, so that in appearance and colour the lower should be exactly the
   same as the upper part of it.

   But this subject is too important to be thus briefly treated. Our term
   shewbread' is a translation of that used by Luther (Schaubrod), which,
   in turn, may have been taken from the Vulgate (panes praepositionis).
   The Scriptural name is Bread of the Face' (Exo 25:30; 35:13; 39:36);
   that is, of the presence of God,' just as the similar expression, Angel
   of the Face' (Isa 63:9) means the Angel of His Presence.' From its
   constant presence and disposition in the sanctuary, it is also called
   perpetual bread' (Num 4:7) and bread of laying out' (set in order),
   which latter most nearly corresponds to the term used in the New
   Testament (Matt 12:4; Luke 6:4; Heb 9:2). The placing and weekly
   renewal of the Bread of the Presence' was evidently among the principal
   Temple services (2 Chron 13:10, 11). The table of shewbread' stood
   along the northern, or most sacred side of the Holy Place, being ranged
   lengthways of the Temple, as all its furniture was, except the Ark of
   the Covenant, which stood broadways.

    The Table on the Arch of Titus

   As described by the Rabbis, and represented on the triumphal Arch of
   Titus at Rome, the table of shewbread was two cubits long (two cubits =
   three feet), one cubit broad, and one and a half high. [107]

   It was made of pure gold, the feet being turned out and shaped to
   represent those of animals, and the legs connected, about the middle,
   by a golden plate, which was surrounded by a crown,' or wreath, while
   another wreath ran round the top of the table. Thus far its form was
   the same as that made at the first for the tabernacle (Exo 25:23,
   etc.), which was of shittim-wood, overlaid with gold. The table'
   originally provided for the second Temple had been taken away by
   Antiochus Epiphanes (about 170 BC); but another was supplied by the
   Maccabees. Josephus tells a story (Anti. xii. 2, 8) about the gift of
   yet another and most splendid one by Ptolemy Philadelphus. But as its
   description does not tally with the delineations on the Arch of Titus,
   we infer that at the time of Christ the table' of the Maccabees stood
   in the Holy Place.

    The Vessels of the Table

   Considerable doubt exists as to the precise meaning of the terms used
   in Scripture to describe the golden vessels connected with the table of
   shewbread' (Exo 25:29). The dishes' are generally regarded as those on
   which the shewbread' was either carried or placed, the spoons' as
   destined for the incense, and the covers,' or rather flagons,' and the
   bowls' for the wine of the drink-offering. On the Arch of Titus there
   are also two urns. But all this does not prove, in the silence of
   Scripture, and against the unanimous testimony of tradition, that
   either flagons, or bowls, or urns were placed on the table of
   shewbread, nor that drink-offerings were ever brought into the Holy
   Place.' On the other hand, the Rabbis regard the Hebrew terms, rendered
   covers' and bowls,' as referring to hollow golden tubes which were
   placed between the shewbread so as to allow the air to circulate
   between them; three of these tubes being always put under each, except
   the highest, under which there were only two, while the lowest rested
   on the table itself, or, rather, on a golden dish upon it. Thus they
   calculate that there were, in all, twenty-eight of these tubes to
   support the twelve loaves. The tubes' were drawn out each Friday, and
   again inserted between the new shewbread each Sunday, since the task of
   removing and reinserting them was not among those labours which made
   void the Sabbath.' Golden dishes, in which the shewbread was carried,
   and golden lateral plates, further to protect it on the stand, are also
   mentioned by the Rabbis.

    The Shewbread Itself

   The shewbread' was made of the finest wheaten flour, that had been
   passed through eleven sieves. There were twelve of these cakes,
   according to the number of the tribes of Israel, ranged in two piles,
   each of six cakes. Each cake was made of two omers of wheat (the omer =
   about five pints). Between the two rows, not upon them (as according to
   the Rabbis) (Menach. xi. 5), two bowls with pure incense were placed,
   and, according to Egyptian tradition (LXX Lev 24:7; Philo ii. 151),
   also salt. The cakes were anointed in the middle with oil, in the form
   of a cross. As described by Jewish tradition, they were each five
   handbreadths broad and ten handbreadths long, but turned up at either
   end, two handbreadths on each side, to resemble in outline the Ark of
   the Covenant. Thus, as each cake, after being turned up,' reached six
   handbreadths and was placed lengthwise on the breadth of the table, it
   would exactly cover it (the one cubit of the table being reckoned at
   six handbreadths); while, as the two rows of six cakes stood broadwise
   against each other (2 x 5 handbreadths), it would leave between them
   two handbreadths vacant on the length of the table (2 cubits = 12
   handbreadths), on which the two bowls with the incense were placed.
   [108]

   The preparation of the shewbread seems to have been hereditarily
   preserved as a secret family tradition in the house of Garmu,' a family
   of the Kohathites (1 Chron 9:32; Mish. Shekal. v. 1). The fresh cakes
   of shewbread were deposited in a golden dish on the marble table in the
   porch of the sanctuary, where they remained till the Sabbath actually
   commenced.

    The Mode of Changing

   The mode of changing the shewbread may be given in the words of the
   Mishnah (Men. xi. 7): Four priests enter (the Holy Place), two
   carrying, each, one of the piles (of six shewbread), the other two the
   two dishes (of incense). Four priests had preceded them--two to take
   off the two (old) piles of shewbread, and two the two (old) dishes of
   incense. Those who brought in (the bread and incense) stood at the
   north side (of the table), facing southwards; they who took away at the
   south side, facing north: these lifted off, and those replaced; the
   hands of these being right over against the hands of those (so as to
   lift off and put on exactly at the same moment), as it is written:
   "Thou shalt set upon the table bread of the Presence before Me alway."'
   The shewbread which had been taken off was then deposited on the golden
   table in the porch of the sanctuary, the incense burnt on that heap on
   the altar of burnt-offering from which the coals were taken for the
   altar of incense, after which the shewbread was distributed among the
   outgoing and the incoming course of priests. [109]

   The incoming priests stood at the north side, the outgoing at the south
   side, and each course gave to the high-priest half of their portion.
   The shewbread was eaten during the Sabbath, and in the Temple itself,
   but only by such priests as were in a state of Levitical purity.

    The Symbolism of the Shewbread

   The importance of the service which has just been described depended,
   of course, on its meaning. Ancient symbolism, both Jewish and
   Christian, regarded the bread of the Presence' as an emblem of the
   Messiah. This view is substantially, though not literally, correct.
   Jehovah, who dwelt in the Most Holy Place between the Cherubim, was the
   God manifest and worshipped in the Holy Place. There the mediatorial
   ministry, in the name of, and representing Israel, laid before' Him the
   bread of the Presence, kindled the seven-lamped candlestick, and burnt
   incense on the golden altar. The bread' laid before Him' in the
   northern or most sacred part of the Holy Place was that of His
   Presence, and meant that the Covenant-people owned His Presence' as
   their bread and their life; the candlestick, that He was their
   Light-giver and Light; while between the table of shewbread and the
   candlestick burned the incense on the golden altar, to show that life
   and light are joined together, and come to us in fellowship with God
   and prayer. For a similar reason, pure incense was placed between the
   shewbread--for, the life which is in His Presence is one of praise;
   while the incense was burned before the shewbread was eaten by the
   priests, to indicate God's acceptance and ratification of Israel's
   dependence upon Him, as also to betoken praise to God while living upon
   His Presence. That this Presence' meant the special manifestation of
   God, as afterwards fully vouchsafed in Christ, the Angel of His
   Presence,' it is scarcely necessary to explain at length in this place.

    The Courses on the Sabbath

   But although the service of the incoming course' of priests had begun
   with the renewal of the shewbread,' that of the outgoing had not yet
   completely ceased. In point of fact, the outgoing course' of priests
   offered the morning sacrifice on the Sabbath, and the incoming the
   evening sacrifice, both spending the Sabbath in the sanctuary. The
   inspection of the Temple before the Sabbath morning service differed
   from that on ordinary days, inasmuch as the Temple itself was lit up,
   to obviate the necessity of the priests carrying torches on the holy
   day. The altar of burnt-offering was cleansed before the usual hour;
   but the morning service commenced later, so as to give an opportunity
   of attending to as many as possible. All appeared in their festive
   garments, and each carried in his hand some contribution for religious
   purposes. It was no doubt from this that the practice was derived of
   laying by in store upon the first day of the week,' which St. Paul
   recommended to the Corinthians (1 Cor 16:1, 2). Similarly, the
   apostolic practice of partaking the Lord's Supper every Lord's-day may
   have been in imitation of the priests eating the shewbread every
   Sabbath. The Sabbath service was in every respect the same as on other
   days, except that at the close of the ordinary morning sacrifice the
   additional offering of two lambs, with its appropriate meat- and
   drink-offerings, was brought (Num 28:9, 10). When the drink-offering of
   the ordinary morning sacrifice was poured out, the Levites sang Psalm
   92 in three sections, the priests drawing, at the close of each, three
   blasts from their trumpets, and the people worshipping. At the close of
   the additional Sabbath sacrifice, when its drink-offering was brought,
   the Levites sang the Song of Moses' in Deuteronomy 32. This hymn' was
   divided into six portions, for as many Sabbaths (v 1-6; 7-12; 13-18;
   19-28; 29-39; 40-end). Each portion was sung in three sections with
   threefold blasts of the priests' trumpets, the people worshipping at
   each pause. If a Sabbath and a new moon' fell on the same day, the
   Sabbath hymn was sung in preference to that for the new moon; if a
   feast day fell on the Sabbath, the Sabbath sacrifice was offered before
   that prescribed for the day. At the evening sacrifice on the Sabbath
   the song of Moses in Exodus 15 was sung.

    The Sabbatical Year

   Though not strictly connected with the Temple services, it may be
   desirable briefly to refer to the observance of the Sabbatical year, as
   it was strictly enforced at the time of Christ. It was otherwise with
   the year of Jubilee. Strangely, there are traces of the latter during
   the period before the return from Babylon (1 Kings 21:3; Isa 5:8;
   37:30; 61:1-3, Eze 1:1; 7:12; Micah 2:2), while the Sabbatical year
   seems to have been systematically neglected. Hence Jewish tradition
   explains, in accordance with 2 Chronicles 36:21, that the seventy
   years' captivity were intended to make up the neglected Sabbatical
   years--commencing the calculation, if it be taken literally, from about
   the accession of King Solomon. But while, after the return from
   Babylon, the year of Jubilee was no longer kept, at least, as a
   religious ordinance, the Sabbatical year was most strictly observed,
   not only by the Jews (Neh 10:31; 1 Macc vi. 49, 53; Jos. Antiq. xiii.
   8, 1; xiv. 10, 6; xv. 1, 2; Jew. Wars, , i. 2-4), but also by the
   Samaritans (Antiq xi. 8, 6). Jewish tradition has it, that as it took
   seven years for the first conquest, and other seven for the proper
   division of the Holy Land, tithes' were for the first time paid
   fourteen years after the entrance of Israel into Canaan; and the first
   Sabbatical year fell seven years later, or in the twenty-first year of
   their possession of Palestine. The Sabbatical law extended only to the
   soil of Palestine itself, which, however, included certain surrounding
   districts. The Rabbis add this curious proviso, that it was lawful to
   use (though not to store or sell) the spontaneous produce of the land
   throughout the extent originally possessed by Israel, but that even the
   use of these products was prohibited in such districts as having
   originally belonged to, were again occupied by Israel after their
   return from Babylon. But this, as other rules laid down by the Rabbis,
   had many exceptions (Mish. Shev. vi. 1).

    Scripture References To It/The Prosbul'

   As Divinely enjoined, the soil was to be left uncultivated at the end
   of every period of six years, beginning, as the Jews argue, after the
   Passover for the barley, after Pentecost for the wheat, and after the
   Feast of Tabernacles for all fruit-trees. The Sabbatical year itself
   commenced, as most of them hold, on New Year's Day, which fell on the
   new moon of the tenth month, or Tishri. [110]

   Whatever grew of itself during the year was to belong to the poor (Exo
   23:10, 11), which, however, as Leviticus 25:6 shows, did not exclude
   its use as meat' only its storage and sale, by the family to which the
   land belonged. Yet a third Scriptural notice constitutes the Sabbatical
   year that of the Lord's release,' when no debt might be claimed from an
   Israelite (Deut 15:1-6); while a fourth enjoins, that in the solemnity
   of the year of release, in the Feast of Tabernacles,' the law was to be
   read before all Israel in their hearing' (Deut 31:10, 11). It has been
   strangely overlooked that these four ordinances, instead of being
   separate and distinct, are in reality closely connected. As the
   assignment of what grew of itself did not exclude the usufruct by the
   owners, so it also followed of necessity that, in a year when all
   agricultural labour ceased, debts should not be claimed from an
   agricultural population. Similarly, it was quite in accordance with the
   idea of the Sabbath and the Sabbatical year that the law should be
   publicly read, to indicate that the rest' was not to be one of
   idleness, but of meditation on the Word of God. [111]

   It will be gathered that in this view the Divine law had not intended
   the absolute remission of debts, but only their release' during the
   Sabbatical year. [112]

   Jewish tradition, indeed, holds the opposite; but, by its ordinances,
   it rendered the law itself void. For, as explained by the Rabbis, the
   release from debt did not include debts for things purchased in a shop,
   nor judicial fines, nor yet money lent on a pledge. But, as the great
   Rabbi Hillel found that even these exceptions were not sufficient to
   insure the loan of money in view of the Sabbatical year, he devised a
   formula called Prosbul' (probably addition,' from a Greek word to the
   same effect), by which the rights of a creditor were fully secured. The
   Prosbul' ran thus: I, A.B., hand to you, the judges of C.D. (a
   declaration), to the effect that I may claim any debt due to me at
   whatever time I please.'

    The Effect Of It

   This Prosbul,' signed by the judges or by witnesses, enabled a creditor
   to claim money lent even in the Sabbatical year; and though professedly
   applying only to debts on real property, was so worded as to cover
   every case (Mish. Shev., sec x). But even this was not all, and the
   following legal fiction was suggested as highly meritorious to all
   concerned. The debtor was to offer payment, and the creditor to reply,
   I remit'; upon which the debtor was to insist that nevertheless' the
   creditor was to accept the repayment. In general, money owing to Jewish
   proselytes was to be repaid to them, but not to their heirs, even
   though they also had turned Jews, as by becoming a proselyte a man had
   separated himself from his kin, who therefore were no longer, strictly
   speaking, his natural heirs. Still, to make payment in such a case was
   deemed specially meritorious. The Rabbinical evasions of the law, which
   forbade the use of that which had grown spontaneously on the soil, are
   not so numerous nor so irrational. It was ruled that part of such
   products might be laid by in the house, provided sufficient of the same
   kind were left in the field for cattle and beasts to feed upon. Again,
   as much land might be tilled as was necessary to make payment of
   tributes or taxes. The omer (or wave-sheaf') at the Passover, and the
   two wave-loaves at Pentecost, were also to be made from the barley and
   wheat grown that year in the field. Lastly, Rabbinical ordinance fixed
   the following portions as being the law' which was to be publicly read
   in the Temple by the king or the high-priest at the Feast of
   Tabernacles in the Sabbatical year, viz., Deuteronomy 1:1-6; 6:4-8;
   11:13-22; 14:22; 15:23; 17:14; 26:12-19; 27; 28 (Mish. Sotah, vii. 8).
   This service concluded with a benediction, which resembled that of the
   high-priest on the Day of Atonement, except that it referred not to the
   remission of sins.

    Rabbinical Perversion of the Sabbatical Year

   The account just given proves that there was scarcely any Divine
   ordinance, which the Rabbis, by their traditions, rendered more fully
   void, and converted into a yoke which neither our fathers nor we were
   able to bear,' than the Sabbath law. On the other hand, the Gospels
   bring before us Christ more frequently on the Sabbath than on any other
   festive occasion. It seemed to be His special day for working the work
   of His Father. On the Sabbath He preached in the synagogues; He taught
   in the Temple; He healed the sick; He came to the joyous meal with
   which the Jews were wont to close the day (Luke 14:1). Yet their
   opposition broke out most fiercely in proportion as He exhibited the
   true meaning and object of the Sabbath. Never did the antagonism
   between the spirit and the letter more clearly appear. And if in their
   worship of the letter they crushed out the spirit of the Sabbath law,
   we can scarcely wonder that they so overlaid with their ordinances the
   appointment of the Sabbatical year as well-nigh to extinguish its
   meaning. That evidently was, that the earth, and all that is upon it,
   belongeth to the Lord; that the eyes of all wait upon Him, that He may
   give them their meat in due season' (Psa 104:27; 145:16); that the land
   of Israel was His special possession; that man liveth not by bread
   alone, but by every word which proceedeth from the mouth of the Lord;
   and that He giveth us our daily bread, so that it is vain to rise up
   early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows (Psa 127:2). Beyond
   it all, it pointed to the fact of sin and redemption: the whole
   creation which groaneth and travaileth in pain together unto now,'
   waiting for and expecting that blessed Sabbath, when creation itself
   shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
   liberty of the children of God' (Rom 8:21, 22). Thus, as the Sabbath
   itself, so the Sabbatical year pointed forward to the rest which
   remaineth to the people of God,' when, contest and labour completed,
   they sing, on the other side of the flood,' the song of Moses and of
   the Lamb (Rev 15:3, 4): Great and marvellous are Thy works, Lord God
   Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints. Who shall
   not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? for Thou only are holy:
   for all nations shall come and worship before Thee; for Thy judgments
   are made manifest.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [100] The Talmud discusses the question whether Psalm 92 bears
   reference to the Sabbath of creation, or to that final Messianic
   Sabbath of the Kingdom--according to Rabbi Akibah, the day which is
   wholly a Sabbath.' (See Delitzsch on the Psalm.) It is a curiously
   uncritical remark of some Rabbis to ascribe the authorship of this
   Psalm to Adam, and its composition to the beginning of the first
   Sabbath--Adam having fallen just before its commencement, and been
   driven from Paradise, but not killed, because God would not execute the
   punishment of death on the Sabbath.

   [101] The term Sabbath' is also applied to a week,' as in Leviticus
   23:15; 25:8; and, for example, in Matthew 28:1; Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1;
   John 20:1. This seems to indicate that the Sabbath was not to be
   regarded as separate from, but as giving its character to the rest of
   the week, and to its secular engagements. So to speak, the week closes
   and is completed in the Sabbath.

   [102] By depositing a meal of meat at the end of a Sabbath-day's
   journey to make it, by a legal fiction, a man's domicile, from which he
   might start on a fresh Sabbath-day's journey. The Mishnic tractate
   Eruvin treats of the connecting of houses, courts, etc., to render
   lawful the carrying out of food, etc. On the other hand, such an
   isolated expression occurs (Mechilta, ed. Weiss, p. 110 a): The Sabbath
   is given to you, not you to the Sabbath.' If we might regard this as a
   current theological saying, it would give a fresh meaning to the words
   of our Lord, Mark 2:27.

   [103] Sepphoris, the Dio-Caesarea of the Romans, was near Nazareth. It
   is often referred to by Josephus, and, after the destruction of
   Jerusalem, became for a time the seat of the Sanhedrim. (See Robinson's
   Researches in Pal. vol. ii. p. 345.)

   [104] The expression, Luke 6:1, rendered in our version the second
   Sabbath after the first,' really means, the first Sabbath after the
   second' day of the Passover, on which the first ripe sheaf was
   presented, the Jews calculating the weeks from that day to Pentecost.

   [105] The altar was whitened twice a year, before the Passover and the
   Feast of Tabernacles. But no tool of iron was used in this.

   [106] This must have been the case on the Thursday of Christ's
   betrayal.

   [107] The table on the Arch of Titus seems only one cubit high. We know
   that it was placed by the victor in the Temple of Peace; was carried
   about the middle of the fifth century to Africa, by the Vandals under
   Genseric, and that Belisarius brought it back in 520 to Constantinople,
   whence it was sent to Jerusalem.

   [108] We have been thus particular on account of the inaccuracies in so
   many articles on this subject. It ought to be stated that another
   Mishnic authority than that we have followed seems to have calculated
   the cubit at ten handbreadths, and accordingly gives different
   measurements for the shewbread'; but the result is substantially the
   same.

   [109] According to other authorities, however, the incense of the
   shewbread was burned along with the morning sacrifice on the Sabbath.

   [110] The year of Jubilee began on the 10th of Tishri, being the Day of
   Atonement.

   [111] Idleness is quite as much contrary to the Sabbath law as labour:
   not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking
   thine own words' (Isa 58:13).

   [112] The manumission of Jewish slaves took place in the seventh year
   of their bondage, whenever that might be, and bears no reference to the
   Sabbatical year, with which, indeed, some of its provisions could not
   easily have been compatible (Deut 15:14).

Chapter 10

  Festive Cycles and Arrangement of the Calendar

   Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood
   in the temple, What think ye, that He will not come to the
   feast?'--John 11:56.

    The Number Seven

   The symbolical character which is to be traced in all the institutions
   of the Old Testament, appears also in the arrangement of its festive
   calendar. Whatever classification of the festivals may be proposed, one
   general characteristic pervades the whole. Unquestionably, the number
   seven marks in Scripture the sacred measurement of time. The Sabbath is
   the seventh of days; seven weeks after the commencement of the
   ecclesiastical year is the Feast of Pentecost; the seventh month is
   more sacred than the rest, its firstborn' or New Moon' being not only
   devoted to the Lord like those of the other months, but specially
   celebrated as the Feast of Trumpets,' while three other festivals occur
   within its course--the Day of Atonement, the Feast of Tabernacles, and
   its Octave. Similarly, each seventh year is Sabbatical, and after seven
   times seven years comes that of Jubilee. Nor is this all. Seven days in
   the year may be designated as the most festive, since in them alone no
   servile work' was to be done, [113] while on the so-called minor
   festivals (Moed Katon), that is, on the days following the first of the
   Passover week and of that of Tabernacles, the diminution of festive
   observances and of restrictions on labour marks their less sacred
   character.

    The Three Cycles

   Besides this general division of time by the sacred number seven,
   certain general ideas probably underlay the festive cycles. Thus we may
   mark two, or else three, such cycles; the one commencing with the
   Paschal sacrifice and ending on the Day of Pentecost, to perpetuate the
   memory of Israel's calling and wilderness life; the other, which occurs
   in the seventh month (of rest), marking Israel's possession of the land
   and grateful homage to Jehovah. From these two cycles the Day of
   Atonement may have to be distinguished, as intermediate between,
   applying to both, and yet possessing a character of its own, as
   Scripture calls it, a Sabbath of Sabbatism,' [114] in which not only
   servile work,' but as on the weekly Sabbath, labour of any kind was
   prohibited.

   In Hebrew two terms are employed--the one, Moed, or appointed meeting,
   applied to all festive seasons, including Sabbaths and New Moons; the
   other, Chag, from a root which means to dance,' or to be joyous,'
   applying exclusively to the three festivals of Easter, Pentecost, and
   Tabernacles, in which all males were to appear before the Lord in His
   sanctuary. If we might venture to render the general term Moadim by
   trystings' of Jehovah with His people, the other would be intended to
   express the joyousness which was to be a leading characteristic of the
   pilgrim-feasts.' Indeed, the Rabbis expressly mention these three as
   marking the great festivals: Reiyah, Chagigah, and Simchah; that is,
   presence, or appearance at Jerusalem; the appointed festive offerings
   of the worshippers, which are not to be confounded with the public
   sacrifices offered on these occasions in the name of the whole
   congregation; and joyousness, with which they connect the freewill
   offerings that each brought, as the Lord had blessed him, and which
   afterwards were shared with the poor, the desolate, and the Levite, in
   the joyous meal that followed the public services of the Temple. To
   these general characteristics of the three great feasts we ought,
   perhaps, to add in regard to all festive seasons, that each was to be a
   holy convocation,' or gathering for sacred purposes; the injunction of
   rest' from servile,' or else from all work; and, lastly, certain
   special sacrifices which were to be brought in the name of the whole
   congregation. Besides the Mosaic festivals, the Jews celebrated at the
   time of Christ two other feasts--that of Esther, or Purim, and that of
   the Dedication of the Temple, on its restoration by Judas the Maccabee.
   Certain minor observances, and the public fasts in memory of the great
   national calamities, will be noticed in the sequel. Private fasts
   would, of course, depend on individuals, but the strict Pharisees were
   wont to fast every Monday and Thursday [115] during the weeks
   intervening between the Passover and Pentecost, and again, between the
   Feast of Tabernacles and that of the Dedication of the Temple. It is to
   this practice that the Pharisee in the parable refers (Luke 18:12) when
   boasting: I fast twice in the week.'

    Three Annual Visits to Temple

   The duty of appearing three times a year in the Temple applied to all
   male Israelites--bondsmen, the deaf, dumb, and lame, those whom
   sickness, infirmity, or age rendered incapable of going on foot up the
   mountain of the house, and, of course, all in a state of Levitical
   uncleanness, being excepted. In general, the duty of appearing before
   the Lord at the services of His house was deemed paramount. Here an
   important Rabbinical principle came in, which, although not expressed
   in Scripture, seems clearly founded upon it, that a sacrifice could not
   be offered for any one unless he himself were present,' to present and
   to lay his hand upon it (Lev 1:3, 3:2, 8). It followed that, as the
   morning and evening sacrifices, and those on feast-days were purchased
   with money contributed by all, and offered on behalf of the whole
   congregation, all Israel should have attended these services. This was
   manifestly impossible, but to represent the people twenty-four courses
   of lay attendants were appointed, corresponding to those of the priests
   and the Levites. These were the 'stationary men,' or men of the
   station,' or standing men,' from their standing there in the Temple as
   Israel's representatives.' For clearness sake, we repeat that each of
   these courses' had its head,' and served for one week; those of the
   station on service, who did not appear in Jerusalem, meeting in a
   central synagogue of their district, and spending the time in fasting
   and prayer for their brethren. On the day before the Sabbath, on the
   Sabbath itself, and on the day following, they did not fast, on account
   of the joy of the Sabbath. Each day they read a portion of Scripture,
   the first and second chapters of Genesis being for this purpose
   arranged into sections for the week. This practice, which tradition
   traced up to Samuel and David (Taan. iv. 2), was of ancient date. But
   the men of the station' did not impose hands on either the morning or
   evening sacrifice, nor on any other public offering. [116]

   Their duty was twofold: to represent all Israel in the services of the
   sanctuary, and to act as a sort of guide to those who had business in
   the Temple. Thus, at a certain part of the service, the head of the
   course brought up those who had come to make an atonement on being
   cleansed from any impurity, and ranged them along the Gate of Nicanor,'
   in readiness for the ministry of the officiating priests. The men of
   the station' were dispensed from attendance in the Temple on all
   occasions when the Hallel' was chanted, [117] possibly because the
   responses of the people when the hymn was sung showed that they needed
   no formal representatives.

    Difficulties of the Calendar

   Hitherto we have not adverted to the difficulties which those who
   intended to appear in Jerusalem at the feasts would experience from the
   want of any fixed calendar. As the year of the Hebrews was lunar, not
   solar, it consisted of only 354 days 8 hours 48' 38". This, distributed
   among twelve months, would in the course of years have completely
   disordered the months, so that the first month, or Nisan (corresponding
   to the end of March or the beginning of April), in the middle of which
   the first ripe barley was to be presented to the Lord, might have
   fallen in the middle of winter. Accordingly, the Sanhedrim appointed a
   Committee of three, of which the chief of the Sanhedrim was always
   president, and which, if not unanimous, might be increased to seven,
   when a majority of voices would suffice, to determine which year was to
   be made a leap-year by the insertion of a thirteenth month. Their
   resolution [118] was generally taken in the twelfth month (Adar), the
   additional, or thirteenth month (Ve-Adar), being inserted between the
   twelfth and the first.

   A Sabbatical year could not be a leap-year, but that preceding it was
   always such. Sometimes two, but never three, leap-years succeeded each
   other. Commonly, every third year required the addition of a month. The
   mean duration of the Jewish month being 29 days 12 hours 44' 3 1/3", it
   required, during a period of nineteen years, the insertion of seven
   months to bring the lunar era in accordance with the Julian.

    The New Moon

   And this brings up yet another difficulty. The Jews calculated the
   month according to the phases of the moon, each month consisting of
   either twenty-nine or thirty days, and beginning with the appearance of
   the new moon. But this opened a fresh field of uncertainty. It is quite
   true that every one might observe for himself the appearance of a new
   moon. But this would again partly depend on the state of the weather.
   Besides, it left an authoritative declaration of the commencement of a
   month unsupplied. And yet not only was the first of every month to be
   observed as New Moon's Day,' but the feasts took place on the 10th,
   15th, or other day of the month, which could not be accurately
   determined without a certain knowledge of its beginning. To supply this
   want the Sanhedrim sat in the Hall of Polished Stones' to receive the
   testimony of credible witnesses that they had seen the new moon. To
   encourage as many as possible to come forward on so important a
   testimony, these witnesses were handsomely entertained at the public
   expense. If the new moon had appeared at the commencement of the 30th
   day--which would correspond to our evening of the 29th, as the Jews
   reckoned the day from evening to evening--the Sanhedrim declared the
   previous month to have been one of twenty-nine days, or imperfect.'
   Immediately thereon men were sent to a signal-station on the Mount of
   Olives, where beacon-fires were lit and torches waved, till a kindling
   flame on a hill in the distance indicated that the signal had been
   perceived. Thus the tidings, that this was the new moon, would be
   carried from hill to hill, far beyond the boundaries of Palestine, to
   those of the dispersion, beyond the river.' Again, if credible
   witnesses had not appeared to testify to the appearance of the new moon
   on the evening of the 29th, the next evening, or that of the 30th,
   according to our reckoning, was taken as the commencement of the new
   month, in which case the previous month was declared to have been one
   of thirty days, or full.' It was ruled that a year should neither have
   less than four nor more than eight such full months of thirty days.

    The Seven Messengers of the New Moon

   But these early fire-signals opened the way for serious inconvenience.
   The enemies of the Jews lit beacons to deceive those at a distance, and
   it became necessary to send special messengers to announce the new
   moon. These were, however, despatched only seven times in the year,
   just in time for the various feasts--in Nisan, for the Passover on the
   15th, and in the month following, Iyar, for the Second Passover,' kept
   by those who had been debarred from the first (Num 9:9-11); in Ab (the
   fifth month), for the fast on the 9th, on account of the destruction of
   Jerusalem; in Elul (the sixth month), on account of the approaching
   solemnities of Tishri; in Tishri (the seventh month), for its
   festivals; in Kislev (the ninth month), for the Feast of the Dedication
   of the Temple; and in Adar, for Purim. Thus, practically, all
   difficulties were removed, except in reference to the month Elul,
   since, as the new moon of the following month, or Tishri, was the Feast
   of Trumpets,' it would be exceedingly important to know in time whether
   Elul had twenty-nine or thirty days. But here the Rabbis ruled that
   Elul should be regarded as a month of twenty-nine days, unless a
   message to the contrary were received--that, indeed, since the days of
   Ezra it had always been so, and that accordingly New Year's Day would
   be the day after the 29th of Elul. To make, however, assurance doubly
   sure, it soon became the practice to keep New Year's Day on two
   successive days, and this has since been extended into a duplication of
   all the great feast days (of course, with the exception of fasts), and
   that, although the calendar has long been fixed, and error is therefore
   no more possible.

    Names of the Hebrew Months

   The present Hebrew names of the months are variously supposed to be
   derived from the Chaldee, or from the Persian language. They certainly
   do not appear before the return from Babylon. Before that, the months
   were named only after their numbers, or else from the natural phenomena
   characteristic of the seasons, as Abib, sprouting,' green ears,' for
   the first (Exo 13:4; 23:15; Deut 16:1); Ziv, splendour,' flowering,'
   for the second (1 Kings 6:1); Bul, rain,' for the eighth (1 Kings
   6:38); and Ethanim, flowing rivers,' for the seventh (1 Kings 8:2). The
   division of the year into ecclesiastical, which commenced with the
   month Nisan (the end of March or beginning of April), or about the
   spring equinox, and civil, which commenced with the seventh month, or
   Tishri, corresponding to the autumn equinox, has by many likewise been
   supposed to have only originated after the return from Babylon. But the
   analogy of the twofold arrangement of weights, measures, and money into
   civil and sacred, and other notices seem against this view, and it is
   more likely that from the first the Jews distinguished the civil year,
   which began in Tishri, from the ecclesiastical, which commenced in
   Nisan, from which month, as the first, all the others were counted. To
   this twofold division the Rabbis add, that for tithing the herds and
   flocks the year was reckoned from Elul to Elul, and for taxing fruits
   often from Shebat to Shebat.

    The Eras Used By the Jews

   The earliest era adopted by the Jews was that which was reckoned to
   commence with the deliverance from Egypt. During the reigns of the
   Jewish kings, time was computed from the year of their accession to the
   throne. After their return from exile, the Jews dated their years
   according to the Seleucidic era, which began 312 BC, or 3, 450 from the
   creation of the world. For a short time after the war of independence,
   it became customary to reckon dates from the year of the liberation of
   Palestine. However, for a very long period after the destruction of
   Jerusalem (probably, till the twelfth century AD), the Seleucidic era
   remained in common use, when it finally gave place to the present mode
   of reckoning among the Jews, which dates from the creation of the
   world. To commute the Jewish year into that of our common era we have
   to add to the latter 3, 761, always bearing in mind, however, that the
   common or civil Jewish year commences in the month of Tishri, i.e. in
   autumn.

    The Week

   The week was divided into seven days, of which, however, only the
   seventh--the Sabbath--had a name assigned to it, the rest being merely
   noted by numerals. The day was computed from sunset to sunset, or
   rather to the appearance of the first three stars with which a new day
   commenced. Before the Babylonish captivity, it was divided into
   morning, mid-day, evening, and night; but during the residence in
   Babylon, the Hebrews adopted the division of the day into twelve hours,
   whose duration varied with the length of the day. The longest day
   consisted of fourteen hours and twelve minutes; the shortest, of nine
   hours forty-eight minutes; the difference between the two being thus
   more than four hours. On an average, the first hour of the day
   corresponded nearly to our 6 a.m.; the third hour (when, according to
   Matthew 20:3, the market-place was full), to our 9 a.m.; the close of
   the sixth hour, to our mid-day; while at the eleventh, the day neared
   its close. The Romans reckoned the hours from midnight, a fact which
   explains the apparent discrepancy between John 19:14, where, at the
   sixth hour (of Roman calculation), Pilate brings Jesus out to the Jews,
   while at the third hour of the Jewish, and hence the ninth of the Roman
   and of our calculation (Mark 15:25), He was led forth to be crucified.
   The night was divided by the Romans into four, by the Jews into three
   watches. The Jews subdivided the hour into 1, 080 parts (chlakim), and
   again each part into seventy-six moments.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [113] These are: the first and the seventh days of the Feast of
   Unleavened Bread,' Pentecost, New Year's Day, the Day of Atonement, the
   first day of the Feast of Tabernacles, and its Octave.

   [114] The term is rendered in the Authorised Version, Sabbath of rest,'
   Leviticus 16:31; 23:32.

   [115] Because on a Thursday Moses had gone up to Mount Sinai, and came
   down on a Monday, when he received for the second time the Tables of
   the Law.

   [116] The only public offerings, with imposition of hands,' were the
   scapegoat on the Day of Atonement, and the bullock when the
   congregation had sinned through ignorance.

   [117] This happened therefore on eighteen days of the year. These will
   be specified in a subsequent chapter.

   [118] Tradition has it, that neither high-priest nor king ever took
   part in these deliberations, the former because he might object to a
   leap-year as throwing the Day of Atonement later into the cold season;
   the king, because he might wish for thirteen months, in order to get
   thirteen months' revenue in one year!

   [119] The Megillath Taanith (roll of fasts'), probably the oldest
   Aramean post-biblical record preserved (though containing later
   admixtures), enumerates thirty-five days in the year when fasting, and
   mostly also public mourning, are not allowed. One of these is the day
   of Herod's death! This interesting historical relic has been critically
   examined of late by such writers as Derenbourg and Gratz. After their
   exile the ten tribes, or at least their descendants, seem to have dated
   from that event (696 BC). This appears from inscriptions on tombstones
   of the Crimean Jews, who have been shown to have descended from the ten
   tribes. (Comp. Davidson in Kitto's Cycl. iii. 1173.)

Chapter 11

  The Passover

   Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye
   are unleavened. For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us.'--1
   Corinthians 5:7.

    The Passover

   The cycle of Temple-festivals appropriately opens with the Passover'
   and Feast of Unleavened Bread.' For, properly speaking, these two are
   quite distinct (Lev 23:5, 6; Num 28:16, 17; 2 Chron 30:15, 21; Ezra
   6:19, 22; Mark 14:1), the Passover' taking place on the 14th of Nisan,
   and the Feast of Unleavened Bread' commencing on the 15th, and lasting
   for seven days, to the 21st of the month (Exo 12:15). But from their
   close connection they are generally treated as one, both in the Old and
   in the New Testament (Matt 26:17; Mark 14:12; Luke 22:1); and Josephus,
   on one occasion, even describes it as a feast for eight days' (Antiq.
   ii. 15, 1; but comp. iii. 10, 5; ix. 13, 3).

    Its Peculiarities

   There are peculiarities about the Passover which mark it as the most
   important, and, indeed, take it out of the rank of the other festivals.
   It was the first of the three feasts on which all males in Israel were
   bound to appear before the Lord in the place which He would choose (the
   two others being the Feast of Weeks and that of Tabernacles [Exo 23:14;
   34:18-23; Lev 23:4-22; Deut 16:16]). All the three great festivals bore
   a threefold reference. They pointed, first, to the season of the year,
   or rather to the enjoyment of the fruits of the good land which the
   Lord had given to His people in possession, but of which He claimed for
   Himself the real ownership (Lev 25:23; Psa 85:1; Isa 8:8; 14:2; Hosea
   9:3). This reference to nature is expressly stated in regard to the
   Feast of Weeks and that of Tabernacles (Exo 23:14-16; 34:22), but,
   though not less distinct, it is omitted in connection with the feast of
   unleavened bread. On the other hand, great prominence is given to the
   historical bearing of the Passover, while it is not mentioned in the
   other two festivals, although it could not have been wholly wanting.
   But the feast of unleavened bread celebrated the one grand event which
   underlay the whole history of Israel, and marked alike their miraculous
   deliverance from destruction and from bondage, and the commencement of
   their existence as a nation. For in the night of the Passover the
   children of Israel, miraculously preserved and set free, for the first
   time became a people, and that by the direct interposition of God. The
   third bearing of all the festivals, but especially of the Passover, is
   typical. Every reader of the New Testament knows how frequent are such
   allusions to the Exodus, the Paschal Lamb, the Paschal Supper, and the
   feast of unleavened bread. And that this meaning was intended from the
   first, not only in reference to the Passover, but to all the feasts,
   appears from the whole design of the Old Testament, and from the exact
   correspondence between the types and the antitypes. Indeed, it is, so
   to speak, impressed upon the Old Testament by a law of internal
   necessity. For when God bound up the future of all nations in the
   history of Abraham and his seed (Gen 12:3), He made that history
   prophetic; and each event and every rite became, as it were, a bud,
   destined to open in blossom and ripen into fruit on that tree under the
   shadow of which all nations were to be gathered.

    Special Nature of the Passover

   Thus nature, history, and grace combined to give a special meaning to
   the festivals, but chiefly to the Passover. It was the feast of spring;
   the spring-time of nature, when, after the death of winter, the
   scattered seeds were born into a new harvest, and the first ripe sheaf
   could be presented to the Lord; the spring-time of Israel's history,
   too, when each year the people celebrated anew their national birthday;
   and the spring-time of grace, their grand national deliverance pointing
   forward to the birth of the true Israel, and the Passover sacrifice to
   that Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.' Accordingly,
   the month of the Passover, Abib, or, as it was called in later times,
   Nisan, [120] was to be unto them the beginning of months'--the
   birth-month of the sacred, and at the same time the seventh in the
   civil year.

   Here we mark again the significance of seven as the sacred or covenant
   number. On the other hand, the Feast of Tabernacles, which closed the
   festive cycle, took place on the 15th of the seventh month of the
   sacred, which was also the first in the civil, year. Nor is it less
   significant that both the Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles fell
   upon the 15th day of the month; that is, at full moon, or when the
   month had, so to speak, attained its full strength.

    Origin of the Name

   The name of the Passover, in Hebrew Pesach, and in Aramean and Greek
   Pascha, is derived from a root which means to step over,' or to
   overleap,' and thus points back to the historical origin of the
   festival (Exo 12). But the circumstances in which the people were
   placed necessarily rendered its first celebration, in some particulars,
   different from its later observance, which, so far as possible, was
   brought into harmony with the general Temple practice. Accordingly,
   Jewish authorities rightly distinguish between the Egyptian' and the
   Permanent Passover.' On its first institution it was ordained that the
   head of every house should, on the 10th of Nisan, select either a lamb
   or a kid of the goats, of the first year, and without blemish. Later
   Jewish ordinances, dating after the return from Babylon, limit it to a
   lamb; and it is explained that the four days previous to the slaying of
   the lamb referred to the four generations that had passed after the
   children of Israel went down into Egypt. The lamb was to be killed on
   the eve of the 14th, or rather, as the phrase, is, between the two
   evenings' (Exo 12:6; Lev 23:5; Num 9:3, 5). According to the
   Samaritans, the Karaite Jews, and many modern interpreters, this means
   between actual sunset and complete darkness (or, say, between six and
   seven p.m.); but from the contemporary testimony of Josephus (Jew.
   Wars, vi. 9, 3), and from Talmudical authorities, there cannot be a
   doubt that, at the time of our Lord, it was regarded as the interval
   between the sun's commencing to decline and his actual disappearance.
   This allows a sufficient period for the numerous lambs which had to be
   killed, and agrees with the traditional account that on the eve of the
   Passover the daily evening sacrifice was offered an hour, or, if it
   fell on a Friday, two hours, before the usual time.

    Institution of the Passover

   In the original institution the blood of the sacrifice was to be
   sprinkled with hyssop on the lintel and the two doorposts of the house,
   probably as being the most prominent place of entrance. Then the whole
   animal, without breaking a bone of it, was to be roasted, and eaten by
   each family--or, if the number of its members were too small, by two
   neighbouring families--along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, to
   symbolise the bitterness of their bondage and the haste of their
   deliverance, and also to point forward to the manner in which the true
   Israel were in all time to have fellowship in the Paschal Lamb (1 Cor
   5:7, 8). All who were circumcised were to partake of this meal, and
   that arrayed as for a journey; and whatsoever was not consumed was to
   be burnt on the spot. These ordinances in regard to the Passover were
   afterwards modified during the journey in the wilderness to the effect,
   that all males were to appear in the place which the Lord shall
   choose,' and there alike to sacrifice and to eat the lamb or kid,
   bringing at the same time also another offering with them (Exo
   34:18-20; Deut 16:2, 16, 17). Lastly, it was also ordered that if any
   man were unclean at the time of the regular Passover, or in a journey
   afar off,' he should celebrate it a month later (Num 9:9-11).

    Directions in the Mishnah

   The Mishnah (Pes. ix. 5) contains the following, as the distinctions
   between the Egyptian' and the Permanent' Passover: The Egyptian
   Passover was selected on the 10th, and the blood was to be sprinkled
   with a sprig of hyssop on the lintel and the two door-posts, and it was
   to be eaten in haste in the first night; but the Permanent Passover is
   observed all the seven days'; i.e. the use of unleavened cakes was, on
   its first observance, enjoined only for that one night, though, from
   Israel's haste, it must, for several days, have been the only available
   bread; while afterwards its exclusive use was ordered during the whole
   week. Similarly, also, the journey of the children of Israel commenced
   on the 15th of Nisan, while in after-times that day as observed as a
   festival like a Sabbath (Exo 12:16; Lev 23:7; Num 28:18). To these
   distinctions the following are also added (Tos. Pes. viii): In Egypt
   the Passover was selected on the 10th, and killed on the 14th, and they
   did not, on account of the Passover, incur the penalty of cutting off,'
   as in later generations; of the Egyptian Passover it was said, Let him
   and his neighbour next unto his house take it,' while afterwards the
   Passover-companies might be indiscriminately chosen; in Egypt it was
   not ordered to sprinkle the blood and burn the fat on the altar, as
   afterwards; at the first Passover it was said, None of you shall go out
   of the door of his house until the morning,' which did not apply to
   later times; in Egypt it was slain by every one in his own house, while
   afterwards it was slain by all Israel in one place; lastly, formerly
   where they ate the Passover, there they lodged, but afterwards they
   might eat it in one, and lodge in another place.

    Scripture Records of the Feast

   Scripture records that the Passover was kept the second year after the
   Exodus (Num 9:1-5), and then not again till the Israelites actually
   reached the promised land (Josh 5:10); but, as the Jewish commentators
   rightly observe, this intermission was directed by God Himself (Exo
   12:25; 13:5). After that, public celebrations of the Passover are only
   mentioned once during the reign of Solomon (2 Chron 8:13), again under
   that of Hezekiah (2 Chron 30:15), at the time of Josiah (2 Kings
   23:21), and once more after the return from Babylon under Ezra (Ezra
   6:19). On the other hand, a most significant allusion to the typical
   meaning of the Passover-blood, as securing immunity from destruction,
   occurs in the prophecies of Ezekiel (Eze 9:4-6), where the man clothed
   with linen' is directed to set a mark upon the foreheads' of the godly
   (like the first Passover-mark), so that they who were to 'slay utterly
   old and young' might not come near any' of them. The same symbolic
   reference and command occur in the Book of Revelation (Rev 7:2, 3;
   9:4), in regard to those who have been sealed as the servants of our
   God in their foreheads.'

    Later Celebrations

   But the inference that the Passover was only celebrated on the
   occasions actually mentioned in Scripture seems the less warranted,
   that in later times it was so punctiliously and universally observed.
   We can form a sufficiently accurate idea of all the circumstances
   attending it at the time of our Lord. On the 14th of Nisan every
   Israelite who was physically able, not in a state of Levitical
   uncleanness, nor further distant from the city than fifteen miles, was
   to appear in Jerusalem. Though women were not legally obliged to go up,
   we know from Scripture (1 Sam 1:3-7; Luke 2:41, 42), and from the rules
   laid down by Jewish authorities (Jos. Wars, vi. 9-3; and Mishnah Pes.
   ix. 4, for ex.), that such was the common practice. Indeed, it was a
   joyous time for all Israel. From all parts of the land and from foreign
   countries the festive pilgrims had come up in bands, singing their
   pilgrim psalms, and bringing with them burnt- and peace-offerings,
   according as the Lord had blessed them; for none might appear empty
   before Him (Exo 23:15; Deut 16:16, 17). How large the number of
   worshippers was, may be gathered from Josephus, who records that, when
   Cestius requested the high-priest to make a census, in order to
   convince Nero of the importance of Jerusalem and of the Jewish nation,
   the number of lambs slain was found to be 256,500, which, at the lowest
   computation of ten persons to every sacrificial lamb, would give a
   population of 2,565,000, or, as Josephus himself puts it, 2,700,200
   persons, while on an earlier occasion (AD 65) he computes the number
   present at not fewer than three millions (Jew. Wars, vi. 9, 3; ii. 14,
   3). [121]

   Of course, many of these pilgrims must have camped outside the city
   walls. [122]

   Those who lodged within the walls were gratuitously accommodated, and
   in return left to their hosts the skins of the Passover lambs and the
   vessels which they had used in their sacred services. In such festive
   company' the parents of Jesus went to, and returned from this feast
   every year,' taking their holy child' with them, after He had attained
   the age of twelve--strictly in accordance with Rabbinical law (Yoma,
   82a)--when He remained behind, sitting in the midst of the doctors,
   both hearing them and asking them questions' (Luke 2:41-49). We know
   that the Lord Himself afterwards attended the Paschal feast, and that
   on the last occasion He was hospitably entertained in Jerusalem,
   apparently by a disciple (Matt 26:18; Mark 14:12-16; Luke 22:7-13),
   although he seems to have intended spending the night outside the city
   walls (Matt 26:30, 36; Mark 14:26, 32: Luke 22:39; John 18:1).

    The Preparations for the Passover

   But the preparations for the Passover had begun long before the 14th of
   Nisan. Already a month previously (on the 15th of Adar), bridges and
   roads had been repaired for the use of the pilgrims. That was also the
   time for administering the testing draught to women suspected of
   adultery, for burning the red heifer, and for boring the ears of those
   who wished to remain in servitude--in short, for making all kinds of
   preliminary arrangements before the festive season began. One of these
   is specially interesting as recalling the words of the Saviour. In
   general, cemeteries were outside the cities; but any dead body found in
   the field was (according to an ordinance which tradition traces up to
   Joshua) to be buried on the spot where it had been discovered. Now, as
   the festive pilgrims might have contracted uncleanness' by unwitting
   contact with such graves, it was ordered that all sepulchres' should be
   whitened' a month before the Passover. It was, therefore, evidently in
   reference to what He actually saw going on around Him at the time He
   spoke, that Jesus compared the Pharisees unto whited sepulchres, which
   indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's
   bones, and of all uncleanness' (Matt 23:27). Then, two weeks before
   Pesach, and at the corresponding time before the other two great
   festivals, the flocks and herds were to be tithed, and also the Temple
   treasury-chests publicly opened and emptied. Lastly, we know that many
   went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify
   themselves' (John 11:55). It is this practice which finds its spiritual
   application in regard to the better Passover, when, in the words of St.
   Paul (1 Cor 11:27, 28), whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this
   cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of
   the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
   bread, and drink of that cup.'

    The Custom of Modern Days

   The modern synagogue designates the Sabbath before the Passover as the
   Great Sabbath,' and prescribes particular prayers and special
   instruction with a view to the coming festival. For, according to
   Jewish tradition, at the original institution of the Passover (Exo
   12:3), the 10th of Nisan, on which the sacrifice was to be selected,
   had fallen on a Sabbath. But there is no evidence that either the name
   or the observance of this Great Sabbath' had been in use at the time of
   our Lord, although it was enjoined to teach the people in the various
   synagogues about the Passover during the month which preceded the
   festival. There is also a significant tradition that some were wont to
   select their sacrificial lamb four days before the Passover, and to
   keep it tied in a prominent place within view, so as constantly to
   remind them of the coming service.

    The Three Things

   We have already explained that according to the Rabbis (Chag. ii, 1;
   vi. 2), three things were implied in the festive command to appear
   before the Lord'--'Presence,' the Chagigah,' and Joyousness.' As
   specially applied to the Passover, the first of these terms meant, that
   every one was to come up to Jerusalem and to offer a burnt-offering, if
   possible on the first, or else on one of the other six days of the
   feast. This burnt-offering was to be taken only from Cholin' (or
   profane substance), that is, from such as did not otherwise belong to
   the Lord, either as tithes, firstlings, or things devoted, etc. The
   Chagigah, which was strictly a peace-offering, might be twofold. This
   first Chagigah was offered on the 14th of Nisan, the day of the Paschal
   sacrifice, and formed afterwards part of the Paschal Supper. The second
   Chagigah was offered on the 15th of Nisan, or the first day of the
   feast of unleavened bread. It is this second Chagigah which the Jews
   were afraid they might be unable to eat, if they contracted defilement
   in the judgment-hall of Pilate (John 18:28). In reference to the first
   Chagigah, the Mishnah lays down the rule, that it was only to be
   offered if the Paschal day fell on a week-day, not on a Sabbath, and if
   the Paschal lamb alone would not have been sufficient to give a
   satisfying supper to the company which gathered around it (Pes. vi. 4).
   As in the case of all other peace-offerings, part of this Chagigah
   might be kept, though not for longer than one night and two days from
   its sacrifice. Being a voluntary offering, it was lawful to bring it
   from sacred things (such as tithes of the flock). But the Chagigah for
   the 15th of Nisan was obligatory, and had therefore to be brought from
   Cholin.' The third duty incumbent on those who appeared at the feast
   was joyousness.' This expression, as we have seen, simply referred to
   the fact that, according to their means, all Israel were, during the
   course of this festival, with joyous heart to offer peace-offerings,
   which might be chosen from sacred things (Deut 27:7). Thus the
   sacrifices which every Israelite was to offer at the Passover were,
   besides his share in the Paschal lamb, a burnt-offering, the Chagigah
   (one or two), and offerings of joyousness--all as God had blessed each
   household. As stated in a previous chapter, all the twenty-four
   courses, into which the priests were arranged, ministered in the temple
   on this, as on the other great festivals, and they distributed among
   themselves alike what fell to them of the festive sacrifices and the
   shewbread. But the course which, in its proper order, was on duty for
   the week, alone offered all votive, and voluntary, and the public
   sacrifices for the whole congregation, such as those of the morning and
   the evening (Succah v. 7).

    Special Preparations

   The special preparations for the Passover commenced on the evening of
   the 13th of Nisan, with which, according to Jewish reckoning, the 14th
   began, the day being always computed from evening to evening. [123]

   Then the head of the house was to search with a lighted candle all
   places where leaven was usually kept, and to put what of it he found in
   the house in a safe place, whence no portion could be carried away by
   any accident. Before doing this, he prayed: Blessed art Thou, Jehovah,
   our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us by Thy
   commandments, and commanded us to remove the leaven.' And after it he
   said: All the leaven that is in my possession, that which I have seen
   and that which I have not seen, be it null, be it accounted as the dust
   of the earth.' The search itself was to be accomplished in perfect
   silence and with a lighted candle. To this search the apostle may have
   referred in the admonition to purge out the old leaven' (1 Cor 5:7).
   Jewish tradition sees a reference to this search with candles in
   Zephaniah 1:12: And it shall come to pass at that time that I will
   search Jerusalem with candles.' If the leaven had not been removed on
   the evening of the 13th, it might still be done on the forenoon of the
   14th of Nisan. The question what substances constituted leaven was thus
   solved. The unleavened cakes, which were to be the only bread used
   during the feast, might be made of these five kinds of grain--wheat,
   barley, spelt, oats, and rye--the cakes being prepared before
   fermentation had begun. Anything prepared of these five kinds of
   grain--but only of these--would come within range of the term leaven,'
   that is, if kneaded with water, but not if made with any other fluid,
   such as fruit-liquor, etc.

    Time of its Commencement

   Early on the forenoon of the 14th of Nisan the feast of the Passover
   may be said to have begun. In Galilee, no work was done all that day;
   in Judea it was continued till mid-day; the rule, however, being that
   no new work was to be commenced, though that which was in hand might be
   carried on. The only exception to this was in the case of tailors,
   barbers, and those engaged in the laundry. Even earlier than mid-day of
   the 14th it was no longer lawful to eat leaven. The strictest opinion
   fixes ten o'clock as the latest hour when leaven might be eaten, the
   more lax eleven. From that hour to twelve o'clock it was required to
   abstain from leaven, while at twelve it was to be solemnly destroyed,
   either by burning, immersing it in water, or scattering it to the
   winds. To secure strict obedience and uniformity, the exact time for
   abstaining from and for destroying the leaven was thus made known: They
   laid two desecrated cakes of a thank-offering on a bench in the porch
   (of the Temple). So long as they lay there, all the people might eat
   (leavened); when one of them was removed, they abstained from eating,
   but they did not burn (the leaven); when both were removed, all the
   people burnt (the leaven)' (Pes. i. 5).

    Choice of the Lamb

   The next care was to select a proper Paschal lamb which, of course,
   must be free from all blemish, and neither less than eight days, nor
   more than exactly one year, old. Each Paschal lamb was to serve for a
   company,' which was to consist of not less than ten, nor of more than
   twenty persons. The company at the Lord's Passover Supper' consisted of
   Himself and His disciples. Two of them, Peter and John, the Master had
   sent early forward to prepare the Passover,' that is, to see to all
   that was needful for the due observance of the Paschal Supper,
   especially the purchase and sacrifice of the Paschal lamb. Probably
   they may have purchased it in the Holy City, though not, as in the
   majority of cases, within the Temple-court itself, where a brisk and
   very profitable traffic in all such offerings was carried on by the
   priests. For against this the Lord Jesus had inveighed only a few days
   before, when He cast out all them that sold and bought in the Temple,
   and overthrew the tables of the money-changers' (Matt 21:12, 13), to
   the astonishment and indignation of those who would intensely resent
   His interference with their authority and gains (John 2:13-18).

    Slaying of the Lamb

   While the Saviour still tarried with the other disciples outside the
   city, Peter and John were completing their preparations. They followed
   the motley crowd, all leading their sacrificial lambs up the
   Temple-mount. Here they were grouped into three divisions. Already the
   evening sacrifice had been offered. Ordinarily it was slain at 2:30
   p.m., and offered at about 3:30. But on the eve of the Passover, as we
   have seen, it was killed an hour earlier; and if the 14th of Nisan fell
   on a Friday--or rather from Thursday at eve to Friday at eve--two `63
   hours earlier, so as to avoid any needless breach of the Sabbath. On
   the occasion to which we refer the evening sacrifice had been slain at
   1:30, and offered at 2:30. But before the incense was burned or the
   lamps were trimmed, the Paschal sacrifice had to be offered. [124]

   It was done on this wise:--The First of the three festive divisions,
   with their Paschal lambs, was admitted within the Court of the Priests.
   Each division must consist of not less than thirty persons (3 x 10, the
   symbolical number of the Divine and of completeness). Immediately the
   massive gates were closed behind them. The priests drew a threefold
   blast from their silver trumpets when the Passover was slain.
   Altogether the scene was most impressive. All along the Court up to the
   altar of burnt-offering priests stood in two rows, the one holding
   golden, the other silver bowls. In these the blood of the Paschal
   lambs, which each Israelite slew for himself (as representative of his
   company at the Paschal Supper), was caught up by a priest, who handed
   it to his colleague, receiving back an empty bowl, and so the bowls
   with the blood were passed up to the priest at the altar, who jerked it
   in one jet at the base of the altar. While this was going on, a most
   solemn hymn' of praise was raised, the Levites leading in song, and the
   offerers either repeating after them or merely responding. Every first
   line of a Psalm was repeated by the people, while to each of the others
   they responded by a Hallelujah,' or Praise ye the Lord.' This service
   of song consisted of the so-called Hallel,' which comprised Psalms 113
   to 118. Thus--

   The Levites began: Hallelu Jah' (Praise ye the Lord).

   The people repeated: Hallelu Jah.'

   The Levites: Praise (Hallelu), O ye servants of Jehovah.'

   The people responded: Hallelu Jah.'

   The Levites: Praise (Hallelu) the name of Jehovah.'

   The people responded: Hallelu Jah.'

   Similarly, when Psalm 113 had been finished--Psalm 114:

   The Levites: When Israel went out of Egypt.'

   The people repeated: When Israel went out of Egypt.

   The Levites: The house of Jacob from a people of strange language.'

   The people responded: Hallelu Jah.'

   And in the same manner, repeating each first line and responding at the
   rest, till they came to Psalm 118, when, besides the first, these three
   lines were also repeated by the people (vv 25, 26):

   Save now, I beseech Thee, Jehovah.'

   O Jehovah, I beseech Thee, send now prosperity'; and

   Blessed be He that cometh in the name of Jehovah.'

   May it not be that to this solemn and impressive hymn' corresponds the
   Alleluia song of the redeemed Church in heaven, as described in
   Revelation 19:1, 3, 4, 6?

    The Hallel'

   The singing of the Hallel' at the Passover dates from very remote
   antiquity. The Talmud dwells on its peculiar suitableness for the
   purpose, since it not only recorded the goodness of God towards Israel,
   but especially their deliverance from Egypt, and therefore
   appropriately opened (Psa 113) with Praise ye Jehovah, ye servants of
   Jehovah'--and no longer of Pharaoh. Hence also this Hallel' is called
   the Egyptian, or the Common,' to distinguish it from the great Hallel,'
   sung on very rare occasions, which comprised Psalms 120 to 136.
   According to the Talmud, the Hallel' recorded five things: The coming
   out of Egypt, the dividing of the sea, the giving of the law, the
   resurrection of the dead, and the lot of the Messiah.' The Egyptian
   Hallel,' it may here be added, was altogether sung on eighteen days and
   on one night in the year. These eighteen days were, that of the
   Passover sacrifice, the Feast of Pentecost, and each of the eight days
   of the Feasts of Tabernacles and of the Dedication of the Temple. The
   only night in which it was recited was that of the Paschal Supper, when
   it was sung by every Paschal company in their houses, in a manner which
   will hereafter be explained.

    Completion of the Sacrifice

   If the Hallel' had been finished before the service of one division was
   completed, it was repeated a second and, if needful, even a third time.
   The Mishnah remarks, that as the Great Court was crowded by the first
   two divisions, it rarely happened that they got further than Psalm 116
   before the services of the third division were completed. Next, the
   sacrifices were hung up on hooks along the Court, or laid on staves
   which rested on the shoulders of two men (on Sabbaths they were not
   laid on staves), then flayed, the entrails taken out and cleansed, and
   the inside fat separated, put in a dish, salted, and placed on the fire
   of the altar of burnt-offering. This completed the sacrifice. The first
   division of offerers being dismissed, the second entered, and finally
   the third, the service being in each case conducted in precisely the
   same manner. Then the whole service concluded by burning the incense
   and trimming the lamps for the night.

   When all had been finished in the Temple, the priests washed the Great
   Court, in which so much sacrificial blood had been shed. But this was
   not done if the Passover had been slain on the Sabbath. In that case,
   also, the three divisions waited--the first in the Court of the
   Gentiles, the second on the Chel, and the third in the Great Court--so
   as not needlessly to carry their burdens on the Sabbath.

   But, as a general rule, the religious services of the Passover, like
   all positive religious injunctions, made void the Sabbath.' In other
   respects the Passover, or rather the 15th of Nisan, was to be observed
   like a Sabbath, no manner of work being allowed. There was, however,
   one most important exception to this rule. It was permitted to prepare
   the necessary articles of food on the 15th of Nisan. This explains how
   the words of Jesus to Judas during the Paschal (not the Lord's) Supper
   could be misunderstood by the disciples as implying that Judas, who had
   the bag,' was to buy those things' that they had need of against the
   feast' (John 13:29).

    Our Lord's Celebration of the Feast

   It was probably as the sun was beginning to decline in the horizon that
   Jesus and the other ten disciples descended once more over the Mount of
   Olives into the Holy City. Before them lay Jerusalem in her festive
   attire. All around pilgrims were hastening towards it. White tents
   dotted the sward, gay with the bright flowers of early spring, or
   peered out from the gardens and the darker foliage of the olive
   plantations. From the gorgeous Temple buildings, dazzling in their
   snow-white marble and gold, on which the slanting rays of the sun were
   reflected, rose the smoke of the altar of burnt-offering. These courts
   were now crowded with eager worshippers, offering for the last time, in
   the real sense, their Paschal lambs. The streets must have been
   thronged with strangers, and the flat roofs covered with eager gazers,
   who either feasted their eyes with a first sight of the Sacred City for
   which they had so often longed, or else once more rejoiced in view of
   the well-remembered localities. It was the last day-view which the Lord
   had of the Holy City--till His resurrection! Only once more in the
   approaching night of His betrayal was He to look upon it in the pale
   light of the full moon. He was going forward to accomplish His death'
   in Jerusalem; to fulfil type and prophecy, and to offer Himself up as
   the true Passover Lamb--'the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of
   the world.' They who followed Him were busy with many thoughts. They
   knew that terrible events awaited them, and they had only a few days
   before been told that these glorious Temple-buildings, to which, with a
   national pride not unnatural, they had directed the attention of their
   Master, were to become desolate, not one stone being left upon the
   other. Among them, revolving his dark plans, and goaded on by the great
   Enemy, moved the betrayer. And now they were within the city. Its
   Temple, its royal bridge, its splendid palaces, its busy marts, its
   streets filled with festive pilgrims, were well known to them, as they
   made their way to the house where the guest-chamber had been prepared
   for them. Meanwhile the crowd came down from the Temple-mount, each
   bearing on his shoulders the sacrificial lamb, to make ready for the
   Paschal Supper.

   Nehemiah 2:1.

   [121] These computations, being derived from official documents, can
   scarcely have been much exaggerated. Indeed, Josephus expressly guards
   himself against this charge.

   [122] It is deeply interesting that the Talmud (Pes. 53) specially
   mentions Bethphage and Bethany as celebrated for their hospitality
   towards the festive pilgrims.

   [123] The article in Kitto's Cyc. (3rd edition), vol. iii. p. 425,
   calls this day, the preparation for the Passover,' and confounds it
   with John 19:14. But from the evening of the 14th to that of the 15th
   is never called in Jewish writings the preparation for,' but the eve
   of, the Passover.' Moreover, the period described in John 19:14 was
   after, not before, the Passover. Dean Alford's notes on this passage,
   and on Matthew 26:17, suggest a number of needless difficulties, and
   contain inaccuracies, due to a want of sufficient knowledge of Hebrew
   authorities. In attempting an accurate chronology of these days, it
   must always be remembered that the Passover was sacrificed between the
   evenings of the 14th and the 15th of Nisan; that is, before the close
   of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th. The Paschal Supper, however,
   took place on the 15th itself (that is, according to Jewish
   reckoning--the day beginning as the first stars became visible). The
   preparation' in John 19:14 means, as in verse 31, the preparation-day
   for the Sabbath, and the Passover,' as in 18:39, the whole Paschal
   week.

   [124] According to the Talmud, the daily (evening) sacrifice precedes
   that of the Paschal lamb; the Paschal lamb the burning of the incense,
   the incense the trimming of the lamps' (for the night).

Chapter 12

  The Paschal Feast and the Lord's Supper

   And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake, and
   gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My Body. And He
   took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all
   of it; for this is My blood of the New Testament, which is shed for
   many for the remission of sins.'--Matthew 26:26-28.

    Jewish Traditions about the Passover

   Jewish tradition has this curious conceit: that the most important
   events in Israel's history were connected with the Paschal season. Thus
   it is said to have been on the present Paschal night that, after his
   sacrifice, the horror of great darkness' fell upon Abraham when God
   revealed to him the future of his race (Gen 15). Similarly, it is
   supposed to have been at Passover time that the patriarch entertained
   his heavenly guests, that Sodom was destroyed and Lot escaped, and that
   the walls of Jericho fell before the Lord. More than that--the cake of
   barley bread' seen in the dream, which led to the destruction of
   Midian's host, had been prepared from the Omer, presented on the second
   day of the feast of unleavened bread; just as at a later period alike
   the captains of Sennacherib and the King of Assyria, who tarried at
   Nob, were overtaken by the hand of God at the Passover season. It was
   at the Paschal time also that the mysterious handwriting appeared on
   the wall to declare Babylon's doom, and again at the Passover that
   Esther and the Jews fasted, and that wicked Haman perished. And so also
   in the last days it would be the Paschal night when the final judgments
   should come upon Edom,' and the glorious deliverance of Israel take
   place. Hence to this day, in every Jewish home, at a certain part of
   the Paschal service--just after the third cup,' or the cup of
   blessing,' has been drunk--the door is opened to admit Elijah the
   prophet as forerunner of the Messiah, while appropriate passages are at
   the same time read which foretell the destruction of all heathen
   nations (Psa 79:6; 69:25; Lam 3:66). It is a remarkable coincidence
   that, in instituting His own Supper, the Lord Jesus connected the
   symbol, not of judgment, but of His dying love, with this third cup.'
   But, in general, it may be interesting to know that no other service
   contains within the same space the like ardent aspirations after a
   return to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple, nor so many
   allusions to the Messianic hope, as the liturgy for the night of the
   Passover now in use among the Jews.

   If we could only believe that the prayers and ceremonies which it
   embodies were the same as those at the time of our Lord, we should have
   it in our power to picture in minutest detail all that took place when
   He instituted his own Supper. We should see the Master as He presided
   among the festive company of His disciples, know what prayers He
   uttered, and at what special parts of the service, and be able to
   reproduce the arrangement of the Paschal table around which they sat.

    The Modern Ceremonies

   At present and for many centuries back the Paschal Supper has been thus
   laid out: three large unleavened cakes, wrapped in the folds of a
   napkin, are placed on a salver, and on them the seven articles
   necessary for the Passover Supper' are ranged in this manner:

   A roasted Egg                             Roasted Shankbone of a Lamb
   (Instead of the 14th day Chagigah)        (Instead of the Paschal Lamb)

   Charoseth                          Bitter Lettuce
   (To represent the mortar of Egypt) Herbs

   Salt Water                                Chervil and Parsley

    Present Ritual not the Same as the New Testament Times

   But, unfortunately, the analogy does not hold good. As the present
   Passover liturgy contains comparatively very few relics from New
   Testament times, so also the present arrangement of the Paschal table
   evidently dates from a time when sacrifices had ceased. On the other
   hand, however, by far the greater number of the usages observed in our
   own days are precisely the same as eighteen hundred years ago. A
   feeling, not of gratified curiosity, but of holy awe, comes over us, as
   thus we are able to pass back through those many centuries into the
   upper chamber where the Lord Jesus partook of that Passover which, with
   the loving desire of a Saviour's heart, He had desired to eat with His
   disciples. The leading incidents of the feast are all vividly before
   us--the handling of the sop dipped in the dish,' the breaking of
   bread,' the giving thanks,' the distributing of the cup,' and the
   concluding hymn.' Even the exact posture at the Supper is known to us.
   But the words associated with those sacred memories come with a strange
   sound when we find in Rabbinical writings the Passover lamb' [125]
   designated as His body,' or when our special attention is called to the
   cup known as the cup of blessing, which we bless'; nay, when the very
   term for the Passover liturgy itself, the Haggadah,' [126] which means
   'showing forth,' is exactly the same as that used by St. Paul in
   describing the service of the Lord's Supper! (1 Cor 11:23-29)

    The Roasting of the Lamb

   Before proceeding further we may state that, according to Jewish
   ordinance, the Paschal lamb was roasted on a spit made of pomegranate
   wood, the spit passing right through from mouth to vent. Special care
   was to be taken that in roasting the lamb did not touch the oven,
   otherwise the part touched had to be cut away. This can scarcely be
   regarded as an instance of Rabbinical punctiliousness. It was intended
   to carry out the idea that the lamb was to be undefiled by any contact
   with foreign matter, which might otherwise have adhered to it. For
   everything here was significant, and the slightest deviation would mar
   the harmony of the whole. If it had been said, that not a bone of the
   Paschal lamb was to be broken, that it was not to be sodden at all with
   water, but roast with fire--his head with his legs, and with the
   purtenance thereof,' and that none of it was to remain until the
   morning,' all that had not been eaten being burnt with fire (Exo
   12:8-10)--such ordinances had each a typical object. Of all other
   sacrifices, even the most holy (Lev 6:21), it alone was not to be
   sodden,' because the flesh must remain pure, without the admixture even
   of water. Then, no bone of the lamb was to be broken: it was to be
   served up entire--none of it was to be left over; and those who
   gathered around it were to form one family. All this was intended to
   express that it was to be a complete and unbroken sacrifice, on the
   ground of which there was complete and unbroken fellowship with the God
   who had passed by the blood-sprinkled doors, and with those who
   together formed but one family and one body. The cup of blessing which
   we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread
   which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we,
   being many, are one bread and one body; for we are all partakers of
   that one bread' (1 Cor 10:16, 17).

    Distinct From All Levitical Sacrifices

   Such views and feelings, which, no doubt, all truly spiritual
   Israelites shared, gave its meaning to the Paschal feast at which Jesus
   sat down with His disciples, and which He transformed into the Lord's
   Supper by linking it to His Person and Work. Every sacrifice, indeed,
   had prefigured His Work; but none other could so suitably commemorate
   His death, nor yet the great deliverance connected with it, and the
   great union and fellowship flowing from it. For other reasons also it
   was specially suited to be typical of Christ. It was a sacrifice, and
   yet quite out of the order of all Levitical sacrifices. For it had been
   instituted and observed before Levitical sacrifices existed; before the
   Law was given; nay, before the Covenant was ratified by blood (Exo 24).
   In a sense, it may be said to have been the cause of all the later
   sacrifices of the Law, and of the Covenant itself. Lastly, it belonged
   neither to one nor to another class of sacrifices; it was neither
   exactly a sin-offering nor a peace-offering, but combined them both.
   And yet in many respects it quite differed from them. In short, just as
   the priesthood of Christ was a real Old Testament priesthood, yet not
   after the order of Aaron, but after the earlier, prophetic, and royal
   order of Melchisedek, so the sacrifice also of Christ was a real Old
   Testament sacrifice, yet not after the order of Levitical sacrifices,
   but after that of the earlier prophetic Passover sacrifice, by which
   Israel had become a royal nation.

    Guests of the Paschal Table

   As the guests [127] gathered around the Paschal table, they came no
   longer, as at the first celebration, with their loins girded,' with
   shoes on their feet, and a staff in their hand--that is, as travellers
   waiting to take their departure.

   On the contrary, they were arrayed in their best festive garments,
   joyous and at rest, as became the children of a king. To express this
   idea the Rabbis also insisted that the Paschal Supper--or at least part
   of it--must be eaten in that recumbent position with which we are
   familiar from the New Testament. For,' say they, they use this leaning
   posture, as free men do, in memorial of their freedom.' And, again,
   Because it is the manner of slaves to eat standing, therefore now they
   eat sitting and leaning, in order to show that they have been delivered
   from bondage into freedom.' And, finally: No, not the poorest in Israel
   may eat till he has sat down, leaning.' But, though it was deemed
   desirable to sit leaning' during the whole Paschal Supper, it was only
   absolutely enjoined while partaking of the bread and the wine. This
   recumbent posture so far resembled that still common in the East, that
   the body rested on the feet. Hence, also, the penitent woman at the
   feast given by Simon is said to have stood at His feet, behind,'
   weeping' (Luke 7:38). At the same time, the left elbow was placed on
   the table, and the head rested on the hand, sufficient room being of
   course left between each guest for the free movements of the right
   hand. This explains in what sense John was leaning on Jesus' bosom,'
   and afterwards lying on Jesus' breast,' when he bent back to speak to
   Him (John 13:23, 25).

    The Use of Wine

   The use of wine in the Paschal Supper, [128] though not mentioned in
   the Law, was strictly enjoined by tradition.

   According to the Jerusalem Talmud, it was intended to express Israel's
   joy on the Paschal night, and even the poorest must have at least four
   cups, though he were to receive the money for it from the poor's box'
   (Pes. x. 1). If he cannot otherwise obtain it, the Talmud adds, he must
   sell or pawn his coat, or hire himself out for these four cups of
   wine.' The same authority variously accounts for the number four as
   either corresponding to the four words used about Israel's redemption
   (bringing out, delivering, redeeming, taking), or to the fourfold
   mention of the cup in connection with the chief butler's dream (Gen
   40:9-15), or to the four cups of vengeance which God would in the
   future give the nations to drink (Jer 25:15; 51:7; Psa 75:8; 11:6),
   while four cups of consolation would be handed to Israel, as it is
   written: The Lord is the portion of my cup' (Psa 16:5); My cup runneth
   over' (Psa 23:5); I will take the cup of salvation' (Psa 116:13),
   which,' it is added, was two'--perhaps from a second allusion to it in
   verse 17. In connection with this the following parabolic story from
   the Talmud may possess some interest: The holy and blessed God will
   make a feast for the righteous in the day that His mercy shall be shown
   to the seed of Israel. After they have eaten and drunk, they give the
   cup of blessing to Abraham our father. But he saith: I cannot bless it,
   because Ishmael came from me. Then he gives it to Isaac. But he saith:
   I cannot bless it, because Esau came from me. Then he hands it to
   Jacob. But he saith: I cannot take it, because I married two sisters,
   which is forbidden in the Law. He saith to Moses: Take it and bless it.
   But he replies: I cannot, because I was not counted worthy to come into
   the land of Israel, either alive or dead. He saith to Joshua: Take it
   and bless it. But he answers: I cannot, because I have no son. He saith
   to David: Take it and bless it. And he replies: I will bless it, and it
   is fit for me so to do, as it is written, "I will take the cup of
   salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord."'

    The Mishnah Account

   As detailed in the earliest Jewish record of ordinances--the
   Mishnah--the service of the Paschal Supper was exceedingly simple.
   Indeed, the impression left on the mind is, that, while all the
   observances were fixed, the prayers, with some exceptions preserved to
   us, were free. Rabbi Gamaliel, the teacher of St. Paul, said (Pes. x.
   15): Whoever does not explain three things in the Passover has not
   fulfilled the duty incumbent on him. These three things are: the
   Passover lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. The Passover
   lamb means that God passed over the blood-sprinkled place on the houses
   of our fathers in Egypt; the unleavened bread means that our fathers
   were delivered out of Egypt (in haste); and the bitter herbs mean that
   the Egyptians made bitter the lives of our fathers in Egypt.' A few
   additional particulars are necessary to enable the reader to understand
   all the arrangements of the Paschal Supper. From the time of the
   evening-sacrifice nothing was to be eaten till the Paschal Supper, so
   that all might come to it with relish (Pes, x. 1). It is a moot point,
   whether at the time of our Lord two, or, as at present, three, large
   cakes of unleavened bread were used in the service. The Mishnah
   mentions (Pes. ii. 6) these five kinds as falling within the
   designation of bitter herbs,' viz. lettuce, endive, succory (garden
   endive?), what is called Charchavina' (urtica, beets?), and horehound
   (bitter coriander?). The bitter herbs' seem to have been twice partaken
   of during the service, once dipped in salt water or vinegar, and a
   second time with Charoseth, a compound of dates, raisins, etc., and
   vinegar, though the Mishnah expressly declares (Pes. x. 3) that
   Charoseth was not obligatory. Red wine alone was to be used at the
   Paschal Supper, and always mixed with water. [129]

   Each of the four cups must contain at least the fourth of a quarter of
   an hin (the hin = one gallon two pints). Lastly, it was a principle
   that, after the Paschal meal, they had no Aphikomen (after-dish), an
   expression which may perhaps best be rendered by dessert.'

    The Giving Thanks'

   The Paschal Supper itself commenced by the head of the company' taking
   the first cup of wine in his hand, and giving thanks' over it in these
   words: Blessed art Thou, Jehovah our God, who has created the fruit of
   the vine! Blessed art Thou, Jehovah our God King of the Universe, who
   hast chosen us from among all people, and exalted us from among all
   languages, and sanctified us with Thy commandments! And Thou hast given
   us, O Jehovah our God, in love, the solemn days for joy, and the
   festivals and appointed seasons for gladness; and this the day of the
   feast of unleavened bread, the season of our freedom, a holy
   convocation, the memorial of our departure from Egypt. For us hast Thou
   chosen; and us hast Thou sanctified from among all nations, and Thy
   holy festivals with joy and with gladness hast Thou caused us to
   inherit. Blessed art Thou, O Jehovah, who sanctifiest Israel and the
   appointed seasons! Blessed art Thou, Jehovah, King of the Universe, who
   hast preserved us alive and sustained us and brought us to this
   season!' [130]

    The First Cup

   The first cup of wine was then drunk, and each washed his hands. [131]

   It was evidently at this time that the Saviour in His self-humiliation
   proceeded also to wash the disciples' feet (John 13:5). Our Authorised
   Version wrongly translates verse 2 by, and supper being ended,' instead
   of and when supper had come,' or was begun.' Similarly, it was, in all
   probability, in reference to the first cup that Luke gives the
   following account (Luke 22:17): And He took the cup, and gave thanks,
   and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves'--the cup of
   blessing,' which was the third, and formed part of the new institution
   of the Lord's Supper, being afterwards mentioned in verse 20. In
   washing their hands this customary prayer was repeated: Blessed art
   Thou, Jehovah our God, who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments,
   and hast enjoined us concerning the washing of our hands.' Two
   different kinds of washing' were prescribed by tradition--'dipping' and
   pouring.' At the Paschal Supper the hands were to be dipped' in water.
   [132]

    The Herbs

   These preliminaries ended, the Paschal table was brought forward. The
   president of the feast first took some of the herbs, dipped them in
   salt water, ate of them, and gave to the others. Immediately after it,
   all the dishes were removed from the table (as it was thought so
   strange a proceeding would tend to excite the more curiosity), and then
   the second cup was filled. A very interesting ceremony now took place,
   It had been enjoined in the law that at each Paschal Supper the father
   was to show his son the import of this festival. By way of carrying out
   this duty, the son (or else the youngest) was directed at this
   particular part of the service to make inquiry; and, if the child were
   too young or incapable, the father would do it for him.

    The Son's Question

   The son asks: Why is this night distinguished from all other nights?
   For on all other nights we eat leavened or unleavened bread, but on
   this night only unleavened bread? On all other nights we eat any kind
   of herbs, but on this night only bitter herbs? On all other nights we
   eat meat roasted, stewed, or boiled, but on this night only roasted? On
   all other nights we dip (the herbs) only once, but on this night
   twice?' Thus far according to the earliest and most trustworthy
   tradition. It is added (Mishnah, Pes. x. 4): Then the father instructs
   his child according to the capacity of his knowledge, beginning with
   our disgrace and ending with our glory, and expounding to him from, "A
   Syrian, ready to perish, was my father, " till he has explained all
   through, to the end of the whole section' (Deut 26:5-11). In other
   words, the head of the house was to relate the whole national history,
   commencing with Terah, Abraham's father, and telling of his idolatry,
   and continuing, in due order, the story of Israel up to their
   deliverance from Egypt and the giving of the Law; and the more fully he
   explained it all, the better.

    The Dishes

   This done, the Paschal dishes were brought back on the table. The
   president now took up in succession the dish with the Passover lamb,
   that with the bitter herbs, and that with the unleavened bread, and
   briefly explained the import of each; for, according to Rabbi Gamaliel:
   From generation to generation every man is bound to look upon himself
   not otherwise than if he had himself come forth out of Egypt. For so it
   is written (Exo 13:8), "And thou shalt show thy son in that day,
   saying, This is done because of that which Jehovah did unto me when I
   cam forth out of Egypt." Therefore,' continues the Mishnah, giving the
   very words of the prayer used, we are bound to thank, praise, laud,
   glorify, extol, honour, bless, exalt, and reverence Him, because He
   hath wrought for our fathers, and for us all these miracles. He brought
   us forth from bondage into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from mourning
   to a festival, from darkness to a great light, and from slavery to
   redemption. Therefore let us sing before Him: Hallelujah!' Then the
   first part of the Hallel' was sung, comprising Psalms 113 and 114, with
   this brief thanksgiving at the close: Blessed art Thou, Jehovah our
   God, King of the Universe, who hast redeemed us and redeemed our
   fathers from Egypt.' Upon this the second cup was drunk. Hands were now
   washed a second time, with the same prayer as before, and one of the
   two unleavened cakes broken and thanks given.'

    The Breaking of the Bread

   Rabbinical authorities distinctly state that this thanksgiving was to
   follow not to precede, the breaking of the bread, because it was the
   bread of poverty, and the poor have not whole cakes, but broken
   pieces.' The distinction is important, as proving that since the Lord
   in instituting His Supper, according to the uniform testimony of the
   three Gospels and of St. Paul (Matt 26:26; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19; 1
   Cor 11:24), first gave thanks and then brake the bread (having given
   thanks, He brake it'), it must have been at a later period of the
   service.

   Pieces of the broken cake with bitter herbs' between them, and dipped'
   in the Charoseth, were next handed to each in the company. This, in all
   probability, was the sop' which, in answer to John's inquiry about the
   betrayer, the Lord gave' to Judas (John 13:25, etc.; compare Matt
   26:21, etc.; Mark 14:18, etc.). The unleavened bread with bitter herbs
   constituted, in reality, the beginning of the Paschal Supper, to which
   the first part of the service had only served as a kind of
   introduction. But as Judas, after having received the sop, went
   immediately out,' he could not even have partaken of the Paschal lamb,
   far less of the Lord's Supper. The solemn discourses of the Lord
   recorded by St. John (John 13:31; 16) may therefore be regarded as His
   last table-talk,' and the intercessory prayer that followed (John 17)
   as His grace after meat.'

    The Three Elements of the Feast

   The Paschal Supper itself consisted of the unleavened bread with bitter
   herbs, of the so-called Chagigah, or festive offering (when brought),
   and, lastly, of the Paschal lamb itself. After that nothing more was to
   be eaten, so that the flesh of the Paschal Sacrifice might be the last
   meat partaken of. But since the cessation of the Paschal Sacrifice the
   Jews conclude the Supper with a piece of unleavened cake, which they
   call the Aphikomen, or after-dish. Then, having again washed hands, the
   third cup is filled, and grace after meat said. Now, it is very
   remarkable that our Lord seems so far to have anticipated the present
   Jewish practice that He brake the bread when He had given thanks,'
   instead of adhering to the old injunction of not eating anything after
   the Passover lamb. And yet in so doing He only carried out the spirit
   of the Paschal feast. For, as we have already explained, it was
   commemorative and typical. It commemorated an event which pointed to
   and merged in another event--even the offering of the better Lamb, and
   the better freedom connected with that sacrifice. Hence, after the
   night of His betrayal, the Paschal lamb could have no further meaning,
   and it was right that the commemorative Aphikomen should take its
   place. The symbolical cord, if the figure may be allowed, had stretched
   to its goal--the offering up of the Lamb of God; and though again
   continued from that point onwards till His second coming, yet it was,
   in a sense, as from a new beginning.

    The Third Cup

   Immediately afterwards the third cup was drunk, a special blessing
   having been spoken over it. There cannot be any reasonable doubt that
   this was the cup which our Lord connected with His own Supper. It is
   called in Jewish writings, just as by St. Paul (1 Cor 10:16), the cup
   of blessing,' partly because it and the first cup required a special
   blessing,' and partly because it followed on the grace after meat.'
   Indeed, such importance attached to it, that the Talmud (Berac. 51, 1)
   notes ten peculiarities, too minute indeed for our present
   consideration, but sufficient to show the special value set upon it.
   [133]

   The service concluded with the fourth cup, over which the second
   portion of the Hallel' was sung, consisting of Psalms 115, 116, 117,
   and 118, the whole ending with the so-called blessing of the song,'
   which comprised these two brief prayers: All Thy works shall praise
   Thee, Jehovah our God. And Thy saints, the righteous, who do Thy good
   pleasure, and all Thy people, the house of Israel, with joyous song let
   them praise, and bless, and magnify, and glorify, and exalt, and
   reverence, and sanctify, and ascribe the kingdom to Thy name, O our
   King! For it is good to praise Thee, and pleasure to sing praises unto
   Thy name, for from everlasting to everlasting Thou art God.'

   The breath of all that lives shall praise Thy name, Jehovah our God.
   And the spirit of all flesh shall continually glorify and exalt Thy
   memorial, O our King! For from everlasting to everlasting Thou art God,
   and besides Thee we have no King, Redeemer, or Saviour,' etc. [134]

    The Supper in Our Lord's Time

   In this manner was the Paschal Supper celebrated by the Jews at the
   time when our Lord for the last time sat down to it with His disciples.
   So important is it to have a clear understanding of all that passed on
   that occasion, that, at the risk of some repetition, we shall now
   attempt to piece together the notices in the various Gospels, adding to
   them again those explanations which have just been given in detail. At
   the outset we may dismiss, as unworthy of serious discussion, the
   theory, either that our Lord had observed the Paschal Supper at another
   than the regular time for it, or that St. John meant to intimate that
   He had partaken of it on the 13th instead of the 14th of Nisan. To such
   violent hypotheses, which are wholly uncalled for, there is this one
   conclusive answer, that, except on the evening of the 14th of Nisan, no
   Paschal lamb could have been offered in the Temple, and therefore no
   Paschal Supper celebrated in Jerusalem. But abiding by the simple text
   of Scripture, we have the following narrative of events:--Early on the
   forenoon of the 14th of Nisan, the Lord Jesus having sent Peter and
   John before Him to prepare the Passover,' in the evening He cometh with
   the twelve' (Mark 14:17) to the guest-chamber,' the large upper room
   furnished' (Luke 22:11, 12) for the Supper, although He seems to have
   intended after Supper' to spend the night outside the city. Hence Judas
   and the band from the chief priests do not seek for Him where He had
   eaten the Passover, but go at once to the garden into which He had
   entered, and His disciples'; for Judas knew the place,' (John 18:1, 2)
   and it was one to which Jesus ofttimes resorted with His disciples.'
   When the hour was come' for the commencement of the Paschal Supper,
   Jesus sat down, and the twelve apostles with Him,' all, as usual at the
   feast, leaning' (John 13:23), John on Jesus' bosom,' being placed next
   before Him, and Judas apparently next behind, while Simon Peter faced
   John, and was thus able to beckon unto him' when he wished inquiry to
   be made of the Lord. The disciples being thus ranged, the Lord Jesus
   took the cup and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among
   yourselves' (Luke 22:17). This was the first cup, over which the first
   prayer in the service was spoken. Next, as in duty bound, all washed
   their hands, only that the Lord here also gave meaning to the
   observance, when, expanding the service into Christian fellowship over
   His broken body, He riseth from Supper,' and began to wash the
   disciples' feet' (John 13:4, 5). It is thus we explain how this
   ministry, though calling forth Peter's resistance to the position which
   the Master took, did not evoke any question as to its singularity. As
   the service proceeded, the Lord mingled teaching for the present with
   the customary lessons of the past (John 13:12-20); for, as we have seen
   considerable freedom was allowed, provided the instruction proper at
   the feast were given. The first part of the Hallel' had been sung, and
   in due order He had taken the bread of poverty' and the bitter herbs,'
   commemorative of the sorrow and the bitterness of Egypt, when He was
   troubled in spirit' about the root of bitterness' about to spring up
   among, and to trouble' them, by which many would be defiled.' The
   general concern of the disciples as to which of their number should
   betray Him, found expression in the gesture of Peter. His friend John
   understood its meaning, and lying back on Jesus' breast,' he put the
   whispered question, to which the Lord replied by giving the sop' of
   unleavened bread with bitter herbs, when He had dipped' it, to Judas
   Iscariot.

    Judas Iscariot

   And after the sop Satan entered into him,' and he went out
   immediately.' It was an unusual time to leave the Paschal table, for
   with the sop dipped' into the Charoseth' the Paschal Supper itself had
   only just begun. But then some of them thought'--perhaps without fully
   considering it in their excitement--that Judas, who had the bag,' and
   on whom, therefore, the care of such things devolved, had only gone to
   see after those things that they had need of against the feast,' or to
   give something to the poor'--applying some of the common stock of money
   in helping to provide peace-offerings' for the poor. This would have
   been quite in accordance with the spirit of the ordinance, while
   neither supposition necessarily involved a breach of the law, since it
   was permitted to prepare all needful provision for the feast, and of
   course also for the Sabbath, which in this instance followed it. For,
   as we have seen, the festive observance of the 15th of Nisan differed
   in this from the ordinary Sabbath-law, although there is evidence that
   even the latter was at that time by no means so strict as later Jewish
   tradition has made it. And then it was, after the regular Paschal meal,
   that the Lord instituted His own Supper, for the first time using the
   Aphikomen when He had given thanks' (after meat), to symbolise His
   body, and the third cup, or cup of blessing which we bless' (1 Cor
   10:16)--being the cup after supper' (Luke 22:20)--to symbolise His
   blood. And when they had sung an hymn' (Psa 115-118) they went out into
   the mount of Olives' (Matt 26:30).

    Our Lord's Agony

   Then it was that the Lord's great heaviness and loneliness came upon
   Him; when all around seemed to give way, as if crushed under the
   terrible burden about to be lifted; when His disciples could not watch
   with Him even one hour; when in the agony of His soul His sweat was as
   it were great drops of blood, falling down to the ground'; and when He
   prayed, saying: O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
   Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.' But the cup which
   the Father' had given Him, He drank to the bitter dregs; and when He
   had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears
   unto Him that was able to save Him from death, and was heard in that He
   feared; though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things
   which He suffered; and being made perfect, He became the author of
   eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him' (Heb 5:7-9).

   Thus the Lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was
   foreordained before the foundation of the world' (1 Peter 1:20)--and,
   indeed, slain from the foundation of the world' (Rev 13:8)--was
   selected, ready, willing, and waiting. It only remained, that it should
   be actually offered up as the propitiation for our sins: and not for
   ours only, but also for the whole world' (1 John 2:2).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [125] The words of the Mishnah (Pes. x. 3) are: While the Sanctuary
   stood, they brought before him his body of (or for) the Passover.' The
   term body' also sometimes means substance.'

   [126] The same root as employed in Exodus 13:8--'And thou shalt show
   thy son in that day,' and from this the term Haggadah' has
   unquestionably been derived.

   [127] The Karaites are alone in not admitting women to the Paschal
   Supper.

   [128] Every reader of the Bible knows how symbolically significant
   alike the vine and its fruit are throughout Scripture. Over the
   entrance to the Sanctuary a golden vine of immense proportions was
   suspended.

   [129] Of this there cannot be the slightest doubt. Indeed, the
   following quotation from the Mishnah (Pes. vii. 13) might even induce
   one to believe that warm water was mixed with the wine: If two
   companies eat (the Passover) in the same house, the one turns its face
   to one side, the other to the other, and the kettle (warming kettle)
   stands between them.'

   [130] Such, according to the best criticism, were the words of this
   prayer at the time of Christ. But I must repeat that in regard to many
   of these prayers I cannot help suspecting that they rather indicate the
   spirit and direction of a prayer than embody the ipsissima verba.

   [131] The modern practice of the Jews slightly differs form the ancient
   here, and in some other little matters of detail.

   [132] The distinction is also interesting as explaining Mark 7:3. For
   when water was poured on the hands, they had to be lifted, yet so that
   the water should neither run up above the wrist, nor back again upon
   the hand; best, therefore, by doubling the fingers into a fist. Hence
   (as Lightfoot rightly remarks) Mark 7:3, which should be translated:
   For the Pharisees . . . except they wash their hands with the fist, eat
   not, holding the tradition of the elders.' The rendering of our
   Authorised Version, except they wash oft,' has evidently no meaning.

   [133] It is a curious circumstance that the Mishnah seems to
   contemplate the same painful case of drunkenness at the Paschal Supper,
   which, as we know, actually occurred in the church at Corinth, that so
   closely imitated the Jewish practice. The Mishnah does not, indeed,
   speak in so many words of drunkenness, but it lays down this rule: Does
   any one sleep at the Passover meal and wake again, he may not eat again
   after he is awaked.'

   [134] Exceptionally a fifth cup was drunk, and over it the great
   Hallel' was said, comprising Psalms 120-137.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 13

  The Feast of Unleavened Bread and the Day of Pentecost

   And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
   accord in one place.'--Acts 2:1.

    The Feast of Unleavened Bread

   The Feast of Unleavened Bread,' which commenced in the Paschal night
   itself and lasted for seven days, derived its name from the Mazzoth, or
   unleavened cakes, which were the only bread allowed during that week.
   This is called in Scripture the bread of affliction' (Deut 16:3), as is
   commonly supposed, because its insipid and disagreeable taste
   symbolised the hardship and affliction of Egypt. But this explanation
   must be erroneous. It would convert one of the most joyous festivals
   into an annual season of mourning. The idea intended to be conveyed by
   the Scriptural term is quite different. For, just as we should ever
   remember the death of our Saviour in connection with His resurrection,
   so were Israel always to remember their bondage in connection with
   their deliverance. Besides, the bread of the Paschal night was not that
   of affliction because it was unleavened; it was unleavened because it
   had been that of affliction. For it had been Israel's affliction,' and
   a mark of their bondage and subjection to the Egyptians, to be driven
   forth in such haste' (Deut 16:3; Exo 12:33, 39) as not even to have
   time for leavening their bread. Hence also the prophet, when predicting
   another and far more glorious deliverance, represents Israel, in
   contrast to the past, as too holy to seek enrichment by the
   possessions, and as too secure to be driven forth in haste by the fear
   of those who had held them captives:


   Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, --touch no unclean thing;

   Go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean that bear the vessels of
   Jehovah.

   For ye shall not go out with haste, --nor go by flight:

   For Jehovah will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your
   reward' (Isa 52:11, 12).

   The Passover, therefore, was not so much the remembrance of Israel's
   bondage as of Israel's deliverance from that bondage, and the bread
   which had originally been that of affliction, because that of haste,
   now became, as it were, the bread of a new state of existence. None of
   Egypt's leaven was to pervade it; nay, all the old leaven, which served
   as the symbol of corruption and of death, was to be wholly banished
   from their homes. They were to be a new lump,' as they were unleavened'
   (1 Cor 5:7). Thus what had originally been the necessity of one day,
   became the ordinance of a feast, bearing the sacred number of seven
   days. As the cross has become to us the tree of life; as death hath
   been abolished by death, and captivity been led captive by the
   voluntary servitude (Psa 40:6, 7) of the Lord of glory, so to Israel
   the badge of former affliction became the symbol of a new and joyous
   life, in which they were to devote themselves and all that they had
   unto the Lord.

    The First Day of the Feast

   The same truth is fully symbolised in the sacrifices of this feast, and
   especially in the presentation of the first ripe sheaf on the second
   day of the Passover. The first day of unleavened bread,' or the 15th of
   Nisan, was a holy convocation,' when neither servile nor needless work
   was to be done, that only being allowed which was necessary for the
   joyous observance of the festival. After the regular morning sacrifice
   the public offerings were brought. These consisted, on each of the
   seven days of the festive week, of two young bullocks, one ram, and
   seven lambs for a burnt-offering, with their appropriate
   meat-offerings; and of one goat for a sin-offering, to make an
   atonement for you' (Num 28:19-24). After these public sacrifices (for
   the whole congregation), the private offerings of each individual were
   brought, commonly on the first day of the feast (the 15th of Nisan),
   but if this had been neglected, on any of the other days. These
   sacrifices were a burnt-offering, of the value of at least one meah of
   silver [135] (= 1/3 denar, or about 2 1/2 d.); then, the 15th day
   Chagigah (literally, festivity), of the value of at least two meahs of
   silver (= 5d.); and lastly, the so-called sacrifices of joyousness'
   (Deut 27:7), in which every one was left at liberty to offer, according
   to the blessing which the Lord had given' to each (Deut 16:17).

   Both the Chagigah and the offerings of joyousness' were
   peace-offerings.' They required imposition of hands, sprinkling of
   blood, burning of the inside fat and kidneys on the altar, and the
   proper setting aside of what went to the priest, viz. the breast as a
   wave- and the right shoulder as a heave-offering (Lev 3:1-5; 7:29-34);
   the difference, as we have seen, being, that the wave-offering belonged
   originally to Jehovah, who gave His portion to the priests, while the
   heave-offering came to them directly from the people. The rest was used
   by the offerers in their festive meals (but only during two days and
   one night from the time of sacrifice). Tradition allowed the poor, who
   might have many to share at their board, to spend even less than one
   meah on their burnt-offerings, if they added what had been saved to
   their peace-offerings. Things devoted to God, such as tithes,
   firstlings, etc., might be used for this purpose, and it was even
   lawful for priests to offer what had come to them as priestly dues
   (Mishnah, Chag. i. 3, 4). In short, it was not to be a heavy yoke of
   bondage, but a joyous festival. But on one point the law was quite
   explicit--the Chagigah might not be offered by any person who had
   contracted Levitical defilement (Pes. vi. 3). It was on this ground
   that, when the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment,'
   they themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be
   defiled, but that they might eat the Passover' (John 18:28). And this
   brings us once more to the history of the last real Passover.

    The Day of Our Lord's Betrayal

   It was early' on the 15th day of Nisan when the Lord was delivered into
   the hands of the Gentiles. In the previous night He and His disciples
   had partaken of the Paschal Supper. The betrayer alone was too busy
   with his plans to finish the meal. He had, so to speak, separated from
   the fellowship of Israel before he excommunicated himself from that of
   Christ. While the Paschal services in the guest-chamber' were prolonged
   by the teaching and the intercession of the Master, and when the
   concluding rites of that night merged in the institution of the Lord's
   Supper, Judas was completing, with the chief priests and elders, the
   betrayal of Jesus, and received the reward of iniquity' (Acts 1:18).
   Either the impetuosity of the traitor, or, more probably, the thought
   that such an opportunity might never come to them again, decided the
   elders, who, till then, had intended to delay the capture of Jesus till
   after the Feast, for fear of the multitude.' It was necessary to put
   aside, not only considerations of truth and of conscience, but to
   violate almost every fundamental principle of their own judicial
   administration. In such a cause, however, the end would sanctify any
   means.

    The Arrest of Our Lord

   Some of their number hastily gathered the Temple guard under its
   captains. A detachment of Roman soldiers under an officer [136] would
   readily be granted from the neighbouring fortress, Antonia, when the
   avowed object was to secure a dangerous leader of rebellion and to
   prevent the possibility of a popular tumult in his favour.

   A number of trusty fanatics from the populace accompanied the band.'
   They were all armed with clubs and swords, as against a murderer'; and
   though the dazzling light of a full moon shone on the scene, they
   carried torches and lamps, in case He or His followers should hide in
   the recesses of the garden or escape observation. But far other than
   they had expected awaited them in the garden.' He whom they had come to
   take prisoner by violent means first overcame, and then willingly
   surrendered to them, only stipulating for the freedom of His followers.
   They led Him back into the city, to the Palace of the High Priest, on
   the slope of Mount Zion, almost opposite to the Temple. What passed
   there need not be further described, except to say, that, in their
   treatment of Jesus, the Sanhedrim violated not only the law of God, but
   grossly outraged every ordinance of their own traditions. [137]

   Possibly the consciousness of this, almost as much as political
   motives, may have influenced them in handing over the matter to Pilate.
   The mere fact that they possessed not the power of capital punishment
   would scarcely have restrained them from killing Jesus, as they
   afterwards stoned Stephen, and would have murdered Paul but for the
   intervention of the Roman garrison from Fort Antonia. On the other
   hand, if it was, at the same time, their object to secure a public
   condemnation and execution, and to awaken the susceptibilities of the
   civil power against the movement which Christ had initiated, it was
   necessary to carry the case to Pilate. And so in that grey morning
   light of the first day of unleavened bread the saddest and strangest
   scene in Jewish history was enacted. The chief priests and elders, and
   the most fanatical of the people were gathered in Fort Antonia. From
   where they stood outside the Praetorium they would, in all probability,
   have a full view of the Temple buildings, just below the rocky fort;
   they could see the morning sacrifice offered, and the column of
   sacrificial smoke and of incense rise from the great altar towards
   heaven. At any rate, even if they had not seen the multitude that
   thronged the sacred buildings, they could hear the Levites' song and
   the blasts of the priests' trumpets. and now the ordinary morning
   service was over, and the festive sacrifices were offered. It only
   remained to bring the private burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice the
   Chagigah, [138] which they must offer undefiled, if they were to bring
   it at all, or to share in the festive meal that would afterwards ensue.

   And so the strangest contradiction was enacted. They who had not
   hesitated to break every law of God's and of their own making, would
   not enter the Praetorium, lest they should be defiled and prevented
   from the Chagigah! Surely, the logic of inconsistency could go no
   further in punctiliously observing the letter and violating the spirit
   of the law.

    The Darkness

   That same afternoon of the first Passover day, when the sixth hour was
   come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And
   at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi,
   lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast
   Thou forsake Me? . . . And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up
   the ghost. And the veil of the Temple was rent in twain, from the top
   to the bottom.' This, just about the time when the evening sacrifice
   had been offered, so that the incensing priest standing in the Holy
   Place must have witnessed the awful sight. [139]

    The Sheaf of Firstfruits

   A little later on in the evening of that same day, just as it was
   growing dark, a noisy throng followed delegates from the Sanhedrim
   outside the city and across the brook Kedron. It was a very different
   procession, and for a very different purpose, from the small band of
   mourners which, just about the same time, carried the body of the dead
   Saviour from the cross to the rock-hewn tomb wherein no man had yet
   been laid. While the one turned into the garden' (John 20:15), perhaps
   to one side, the other emerged, amidst loud demonstrations, in a field
   across Kedron, which had been marked out for the purpose. They were to
   be engaged in a service most important to them. It was probably to this
   circumstance that Joseph of Arimathea owed their non-interference with
   his request for the body of Jesus, and Nicodemus and the women, that
   they could go undisturbed about the last sad offices of loving
   mourners. The law had it, Ye shall bring a sheaf [literally the omer]
   of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest; and he shall wave
   the omer before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after
   the Sabbath the priest shall wave it' (Lev 23:10, 11). This
   Passover-sheaf, or rather omer, was to be accompanied by a
   burnt-offering of a he lamb, without blemish, of the first year,' with
   its appropriate meat- and drink-offering, and after it had been
   brought, but not till then, fresh barley might be used and sold in the
   land. Now, this Passover-sheaf was reaped in public the evening before
   it was offered, and it was to witness this ceremony that the crowd
   gathered around the elders,' who took care that all was done according
   to traditionary ordinance.

    The Morrow After the Sabbath'

   The expression, the morrow after the Sabbath' (Lev 23:11), has
   sometimes been misunderstood as implying that the presentation of the
   so-called first sheaf' was to be always made on the day following the
   weekly Sabbath of the Passover-week. This view, adopted by the
   Boethusians' and the Sadducees in the time of Christ, and by the
   Karaite Jews and certain modern interpreters, rests on a
   misinterpretation of the word Sabbath' (Lev 23:24, 32, 39). As in
   analogous allusions to other feasts in the same chapter, it means not
   the weekly Sabbath, but the day of the festival. The testimony of
   Josephus (Antiq. iii. 10, 5, 6), or Philo (Op. ii. 294), and of Jewish
   tradition, leaves no room to doubt that in this instance we are to
   understand by the Sabbath' the 15th of Nisan, on whatever day of the
   week it might fall. Already, on the 14th of Nisan, the spot whence the
   first sheaf was to be reaped had been marked out by delegates from the
   Sanhedrim, by tying together in bundles, while still standing, the
   barley that was to be cut down. Though, for obvious reasons, it was
   customary to choose for this purpose the sheltered Ashes-valley across
   Kedron, there was no restriction on that point, provided the barley had
   grown in an ordinary field--of course in Palestine itself--and not in
   garden or orchard land, and that the soil had not been manured nor yet
   artificially watered (Mishnah, Menach. viii. 1, 2). [140]

   When the time for cutting the sheaf had arrived, that is, on the
   evening of the 15th of Nisan (even though it were a Sabbath [141] ),
   just as the sun went down, three men, each with a sickle and basket,
   formally set to work.

   But in order clearly to bring out all that was distinctive in the
   ceremony, they first asked of the bystanders three times each of these
   questions: Has the sun gone down?' With this sickle?' Into this
   basket?' On this Sabbath (or first Passover-day)?'--and, lastly, Shall
   I reap?' Having each time been answered in the affirmative, they cut
   down barley to the amount of one ephah, or ten omers, or three seahs,
   which is equal to about three pecks and three pints of our English
   measure. The ears were brought into the Court of the Temple, and
   thrashed out with canes or stalks, so as not to injure the corn; then
   parched' on a pan perforated with holes, so that each grain might be
   touched by the fire, and finally exposed to the wind. The corn thus
   prepared was ground in a barley-mill, which left the hulls whole.
   According to some, the flour was always successfully passed through
   thirteen sieves, each closer than the other. The statement of a rival
   authority, however, seems more rational--that it was only done till the
   flour was sufficiently fine (Men. vi. 6, 7), which was ascertained by
   one of the Gizbarim' (treasurers) plunging his hands into it, the
   sifting process being continued so long as any of the flour adhered to
   the hands (Men. viii. 2). Though one ephah, or ten omers, of barley was
   cut down, only one omer of flour, or about 5 1 pints of our measure,
   was offered in the Temple on the second Paschal, or 16th day of Nisan.
   The rest of the flour might be redeemed, and used for any purpose. The
   omer of flour was mixed with a log,' or very nearly three-fourths of a
   pint of oil, and a handful [142] of frankincense put upon it, then
   waved before the Lord, and a handful taken out and burned on the altar.

   The remainder belonged to the priest. This was what is popularly,
   though not very correctly, called the presentation of the first or
   wave-sheaf' on the second day of the Passover-feast, of the 16th of
   Nisan.

    The Last Day of the Passover

   Thus far the two first days. The last day of the Passover, as the
   first, was a holy convocation,' and observed like a Sabbath. The
   intervening days were minor festivals,' or Moed Katon. The Mishnah
   (Tract. Moed Katon) lays down precise rules as to the kind of work
   allowed on such days. As a general principle, all that was necessary
   either for the public interest or to prevent private loss was allowed;
   but no new work of any kind for private or public purposes might be
   begun. Thus you might irrigate dry soil, or repair works for
   irrigation, but not make new ones, nor dig canals, etc. It only remains
   to add, that any one prevented by Levitical defilement, disability, or
   distance from keeping the regular Passover, might observe what was
   called the second,' or the little Passover,' exactly a month later (Num
   9:9-12). The Mishnah has it (Pes. ix. 3) that the second differed from
   the first Passover in this--that leaven might be kept in the house
   along with the unleavened bread, that the Hallel was not sung at the
   Paschal Supper, and that no Chagigah was offered.

    Pentecost

   The Feast of Unleavened Bread' may be said not to have quite passed
   till fifty-days after its commencement, when it merged in that of
   Pentecost, or of Weeks.' According to unanimous Jewish tradition, which
   was universally received at the time of Christ, the day of Pentecost
   was the anniversary of the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai, which the
   Feast of Weeks was intended to commemorate. Thus, as the dedication of
   the harvest, commencing with the presentation of the first omer on the
   Passover, was completed in the thank-offering of the two wave-loaves at
   Pentecost, so the memorial of Israel's deliverance appropriately
   terminated in that of the giving of the Law--just as, making the
   highest application of it, the Passover sacrifice of the Lord Jesus may
   be said to have been completed in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on
   the day of Pentecost (Acts 2). Jewish tradition has it, that on the 2nd
   of the third month, or Sivan, Moses had ascended the Mount (Exo
   19:1-3), that he communicated with the people on the 3rd (Exo 19:7),
   reascended the Mount on the 4th (Exo 19:8), and that then the people
   sanctified themselves on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of Sivan, on which
   latter day the ten commandments were actually given them (Exo
   19:10-16). [143]

   Accordingly the days before Pentecost were always reckoned as the
   first, second, third, etc., since the presentation of the omer. Thus
   Maimonides beautifully observes: Just as one who is expecting the most
   faithful of his friends is wont to count the days and hours to his
   arrival, so we also count from the omer of the day of our Exodus from
   Egypt to that of the giving of the law, which was the object of our
   Exodus, as it is said: "I bare you on eagle's wings, and brought you
   unto Myself." And because this great manifestation did not last more
   than one day, therefore we annually commemorate it only one day.'

   Full seven weeks after the Paschal day, counting from the presentation
   of the omer on the 16th of Nisan, or exactly on the fiftieth day (Lev
   23:15, 16), was the Feast of Weeks, or Pentecost, a holy convocation,'
   in which no servile work' was to be done (Lev 23:21; Num 28:26), when
   all males' were to appear before Jehovah' in His sanctuary (Exo
   23:14-17), and the appointed sacrifices and offerings to be brought.
   The names, Feast of Weeks' (Exo 34:22; Deut 16:10, 16; 2 Chron 8:13)
   and Feast of the Fiftieth Day,' or Day of Pentecost' (Jos. Jew. Wars,
   ii. e, 1; Acts 2:1; 20:16; 1 Cor 16:8), bear reference to this interval
   from the Passover. Its character is expressed by the terms feast of
   harvest' (Exo 23:16) and day of firstfruits' (Num 28:26), while Jewish
   tradition designates it as Chag ha Azereth,' or simply Azereth' (the
   feast of the conclusion,' or simply conclusion'), and the Season of the
   giving our our Law.'

   The festive sacrifices for the day of Pentecost were, according to
   Numbers 28:26-31, two young bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs of the
   first year' for a burnt-offering, along with their appropriate
   meat-offerings; and one kid of the goats' for a sin-offering--all
   these, of course, irrespective of the usual morning sacrifice. But what
   gave to the feast its distinctive peculiarity was the presentation of
   the two loaves, and the sacrifices which accompanied them. Though the
   attendance of worshippers at the Temple may not have been so large as
   at the Passover, yet tens of thousands crowded to it (Jos. Antiq. xiv.
   13, 4; xvii. 10, 2). From the narrative in Acts 2 we also infer that
   perhaps, more than at any of the other great festivals, Jews from
   distant countries came to Jerusalem, possibly from the greater
   facilities for travelling which the season afforded. On the day before
   Pentecost the pilgrim bands entered the Holy City, which just then lay
   in the full glory of early summer. Most of the harvest all over the
   country had already been reaped, [144] and a period of rest and
   enjoyment seemed before them.

   As the stars shone out in the deep blue sky with the brilliancy
   peculiar to an Eastern clime, the blasts of the priests' trumpets,
   announcing the commencement of the feast, sounded from the Temple mount
   through the delicious stillness of the summer night. Already in the
   first watch the great altar was cleansed, and immediately after
   midnight the Temple gates were thrown open. For before the morning
   sacrifice all burnt- and peace-offerings which the people proposed to
   bring at the feast had to be examined by the officiating priesthood.
   Great as their number was, it must have been a busy time, till the
   announcement that the morning glow extended to Hebron put an end to all
   such preparations, by giving the signal for the regular morning
   sacrifice. After that the festive offerings prescribed in Numbers
   28:26-30 were brought--first, the sin-offering, with proper imposition
   of hands, confession of sin, and sprinkling of blood; and similarly the
   burnt-offerings, with their meat-offerings. The Levites were now
   chanting the Hallel' to the accompanying music of a single flute, which
   began and ended the song, so as to give it a sort of soft sweetness.
   The round, ringing treble of selected voices from the children of
   Levites, who stood below their fathers, gave richness and melody to the
   hymn, while the people either repeated or responded, as on the evening
   of the Passover sacrifice.

    The Two Wave-loaves

   Then came the peculiar offering of the day--that of the two
   wave-loaves, with their accompanying sacrifices. These consisted of
   seven lambs of the first year, without blemish, one young bullock, and
   two rams for a burnt-offering, with their appropriate meat-offerings;
   and then one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and two lambs of the
   first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings' (Lev 23:19). [145]

   As the omer for the 16th of Nisan was of barley, being the first ripe
   corn in the land, so the two wave-loaves' were prepared from wheat
   grown in the best district of the country--under conditions similar to
   those already noticed about the Passover-sheaf. Similarly, three seahs,
   or about three pecks and three pints of wheat, were cut down, brought
   to the Temple, thrashed like other meat-offerings, ground, and passed
   through twelve sieves. [146]

   From the flour thus obtained two omers (or double the quantity of that
   at the Passover) were used for the two loaves'; the rest might be
   redeemed and used for any purpose. Care was taken that the flour for
   each loaf should be taken separately from one and a half seah, that it
   should be separately kneaded with lukewarm water (like all
   thank-offerings), and separately baked--the latter in the Temple
   itself. The loaves were made the evening preceding the festival; or, if
   that fell on the Sabbath, two evenings before. In shape they were long
   and flat, and turned up, either at the edges or at the corners.
   According to the Mishnah, each loaf was four handbreadths wide, seven
   long, and four fingers high, and as it contained one omer of flour (5 1
   pints, or rather less than four pounds' weight), the dough would weigh
   about five pounds and three-quarters, yielding, say, five pounds and a
   quarter of bread, or ten and a half for the two wave-loaves.' [147]

    The Wave-loaves Were Leavened

   Contrary to the common rule of the Sanctuary, these loaves were
   leavened, which, as the Mishnah, informs us (Men. v. 1), was the case
   in all thank-offerings. The common explanation--that the wave-loaves
   were leavened because they represented the ordinary food of the
   people--only partially accounts for this. No doubt these wave-loaves
   expressed the Old Testament acknowledgment of the truth which our Lord
   embodied in the prayer, Give us this day our daily bread.' But this is
   not all. Let it be remembered that these two loaves, with the two lambs
   that formed part of the same wave-offering, were the only public peace-
   and thank-offerings of Israel; that they were accompanied by burnt- and
   sin-offerings; and that, unlike ordinary peace-offerings, they were
   considered as most holy.' Hence they were leavened, because Israel's
   public thank-offerings, even the most holy, are leavened by
   imperfectness and sin, and they need a sin-offering. This idea of a
   public thank-offering was further borne out by all the services of the
   day. First, the two lambs were waved' while yet alive; that is, before
   being made ready for use. Then, after their sacrifice, the breast and
   shoulder, or principal parts of each, were laid beside the two loaves,
   and waved' (generally towards the east) forwards and back wards, and up
   and down. [148]

   After burning the fat, the flesh belonged, not to the offerers, but to
   the priests. As in the case of the most holy sacrifices, the
   sacrificial meal was to take place within the Temple itself, nor was
   any part of it to be kept beyond midnight. One of the wave-loaves and
   of the lambs went to the high-priest; the other belonged to all the
   officiating priesthood. Lastly, after the ceremony of the wave-loaves,
   the people brought their own freewill-offerings, each as the Lord had
   prospered him--the afternoon and evening being spent in the festive
   meal, to which the stranger, the poor, and the Levite were bidden as
   the Lord's welcome guests. On account of the number of such sacrifices,
   the Feast of Weeks was generally protracted for the greater part of a
   week; and this the more readily that the offering of firstfruits also
   began at this time. Lastly, as the bringing of the omer at the Passover
   marked the period when new corn might be used in the land, so the
   presentation of the wave-loaves that when new flour might be brought
   for meat-offerings in the Sanctuary.

    The Later Significance of Pentecost

   If Jewish tradition connected the Feast of Firstfruits' with the Mount
   that might be touched,' and the voice of words which they that heard
   entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more,' we have
   in this respect also come unto Mount Zion,' and to the better things of
   the New Covenant. To us the Day of Pentecost is, indeed, the feast of
   firstfruits,' and that of the giving of the better law, written not in
   tables of stone, but on the fleshy tables of the heart,' with the
   Spirit of the living God.' For, as the worshippers were in the Temple,
   probably just as they were offering the wave-lambs and the wave-bread,
   the multitude heard that sound from heaven, as of a mighty rushing
   wind,' which drew them to the house where the apostles were gathered,
   there to hear every man in his own language' the wonderful works of
   God.' And on that Pentecost day, from the harvest of firstfruits, not
   less than three thousand souls added to the Church were presented as a
   wave-offering to the Lord. The cloven tongues of fire and the apostolic
   gifts of that day of firstfruits have, indeed, long since disappeared.
   But the mighty rushing sound of the Presence and Power of the Holy
   Ghost has gone forth into all the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [135] In this, as in many other particulars, the teaching of Shammai
   differed from that of Hillel. We have followed Hillel, whose authority
   is generally recognised.

   [136] We derive our account from all the four Gospels. The language of
   St. John (18:3, 12) leaves no doubt that a detachment of Roman soldiers
   accompanied such of the elders and priests as went out with the Temple
   guard to take Jesus. Thee was no need to apply for Pilate's permission
   (as Lange supposes) before securing the aid of the soldiers.

   [137] We cannot here enter on the evidence; the fact is generally
   admitted even by Jewish writers.

   [138] The evidence that the expression in John 18:28, They went not
   into the judgment-hall . . . that they might eat the Passover,' refers
   not to the Paschal lamb, but to the Chagigah, is exceedingly strong, in
   fact, such as to have even convinced an eminent but impartial Jewish
   writer (Saalschutz, Mos. Recht, p. 414). It does seem strange that it
   should be either unknown to, or ignored by, Christian' writers.

   [139] This would not necessarily disclose a view of the Most Holy Place
   if, as the Rabbis assert, there were two veils between the Holy and the
   Most Holy Place.

   [140] The field was to be ploughed in the autumn, and sowed seventy
   days before the Passover.

   [141] There was a controversy on this point between the Pharisees and
   the Sadducees. The article in Kitto's Cycl. erroneously names the
   afternoon of the 16th of Nisan as that on which the sheaf was cut. It
   was really done after sunset on the 15th, which was the beginning of
   the 16th of Nisan.

   [142] The term is difficult to define. The Mishnah (Men. ii. 2) says,
   He stretcheth the fingers over the flat of the hand.' I suppose,
   bending them inwards.

   [143] Owing to the peculiarity of the Jewish calendar, Pentecost did
   not always take place exactly on the 6th Sivan. Care was taken that it
   should not occur on a Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. (Reland. p. 430.)

   [144] The completion of the wheat harvest throughout the land is
   computed by the Rabbis at about a month later. See Relandus, Antiq. p.
   428.

   [145] This offering, accompanying the wave-loaves, has by some been
   confounded with the festive sacrifices of the day, as enumerated in
   Numbers 28:27. But the two are manifestly quite distinct.

   [146] In the case of the first omer it had been thirteen sieves; but
   both specifications may be regarded as Rabbinical fancifulness.

   [147] These numbers are sufficiently accurate for general computation.
   By actual experiment I find that a pint of flour weighs about
   three-quarters of a pound and two ounces, and that 3 3/4 lbs. of flour,
   with half a teacup of barm and an ounce of salt, yield 5 3/4 pounds of
   dough and 5 1/4 lbs. of bread.

   [148] The Rabbinical statement is, that the whole offering was to be
   waved together by a priest; but that if each loaf, with one breast and
   shoulder of lamb, was waved separately, it was valid. From the weight
   of the mass, this must have been the common practice.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 14

  The Feast of Tabernacles

   In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
   saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.'--John
   7:37.

    The Feast of Tabernacles

   The most joyous of all festive seasons in Israel was that of the Feast
   of Tabernacles.' It fell on a time of year when the hearts of the
   people would naturally be full of thankfulness, gladness, and
   expectancy. All the crops had been long stored; and now all fruits were
   also gathered, the vintage past, and the land only awaited the
   softening and refreshment of the latter rain,' to prepare it for a new
   crop. It was appropriate that, when the commencement of the harvest had
   been consecrated by offering the first ripe sheaf of barley, and the
   full ingathering of the corn by the two wave-loaves, there should now
   be a harvest feast of thankfulness and of gladness unto the Lord. But
   that was not all. As they looked around on the goodly land, the fruits
   of which had just enriched them, they must have remembered that by
   miraculous interposition the Lord their God had brought them to this
   land and given it them, and that He ever claimed it as peculiarly His
   own. For the land was strictly connected with the history of the
   people; and both the land and the history were linked with the mission
   of Israel. If the beginning of the harvest had pointed back to the
   birth of Israel in their Exodus from Egypt, and forward to the true
   Passover-sacrifice in the future; if the corn-harvest was connected
   with the giving of the law on Mount Sinai in the past, and the
   outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost; the
   harvest-thanksgiving of the Feast of Tabernacles reminded Israel, on
   the one hand, of their dwelling in booths in the wilderness, while, on
   the other hand, it pointed to the final harvest when Israel's mission
   should be completed, and all nations gathered unto the Lord. Thus the
   first of the three great annual feasts spoke, in the presentation of
   the first sheaf, of the founding of the Church; the second of its
   harvesting, when the Church in its present state should be presented as
   two leavened wave-loaves; while the third pointed forward to the full
   harvest in the end, when in this mountain shall the Lord of Hosts make
   unto all people a feast of fat things . . . And He will destroy in this
   mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil
   that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up death in victory;
   and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the
   rebuke of His people (Israel) shall He take away from all the earth'
   (Isa 25:6-8; comp.. Rev 21:4, etc.)

    The Names of the Feast

   That these are not ideal comparisons, but the very design of the Feast
   of Tabernacles, appears not only from the language of the prophets and
   the peculiar services of the feast, but also from its position in the
   Calendar, and even from the names by which it is designated in
   Scripture. Thus in its reference to the harvest it is called the feast
   of ingathering' (Exo 23:16; 34:22); in that to the history of Israel in
   the past, the Feast of Tabernacles' (Lev 23:34; and specially v 43;
   Deut 16:13, 16; 31:10; 2 Chron 8:13; Ezra 3:4); while its symbolical
   bearing on the future is brought out in its designation as emphatically
   the feast' (1 Kings 8:2; 2 Chron 5:3; 7:8, 9); and the Feast of
   Jehovah' (Lev 23:39). In this sense also Josephus, Philo, and the
   Rabbis (in many passages of the Mishnah) single it out from all the
   other feasts. And quite decisive on the point is the description of the
   latter-day' glory at the close of the prophecies of Zechariah, where
   the conversion of all nations is distinctly connected with the Feast of
   Tabernacles' (Zech 14:16-21). That this reference is by no means
   isolated will appear in the sequel.

    The Time of the Feast

   The Feast of Tabernacles was the third of the great annual festivals,
   at which every male in Israel was to appear before the Lord in the
   place which He should choose. It fell on the 15th of the seventh month,
   or Tishri (corresponding to September or the beginning of October), as
   the Passover had fallen on the 15th of the first month. The
   significance of these numbers in themselves and relatively will not
   escape attention, the more so that this feast closed the original
   festive calendar; for Purim and the feast of the dedication of the
   Temple,' which both occurred later in the season, were of post-Mosaic
   origin. The Feast of Tabernacles, or, rather (as it should be called),
   of booths,' lasted for seven days--from the 15th to the 21st
   Tishri--and was followed by an Octave on the 22nd Tishri. But this
   eighth day, though closely connected with the Feast of Tabernacles,
   formed no part of that feast, as clearly shown by the difference in the
   sacrifices and the ritual, and by the circumstance that the people no
   longer lived in booths.' The first day of the feast, and also its
   Octave, or Azereth (clausura, conclusio), were to be days of holy
   convocation' (Lev 23:35, 36), and each a Sabbath' (Lev 23:39), not in
   the sense of the weekly Sabbath, but of festive rest in the Lord (Lev
   23:25, 32), when no servile work of any kind might be done.

    It Followed Close Upon the Day of Atonement

   There is yet another important point to be noticed. The Feast of
   Tabernacles' followed closely on the Day of Atonement. Both took place
   in the seventh month; the one on the 10th, the other on the 15th of
   Tishri. What the seventh day, or Sabbath, was in reference to the week,
   the seventh month seems to have been in reference to the year. It
   closed not only the sacred cycle, but also the agricultural or working
   year. It also marked the change of seasons, the approach of rain and of
   the winter equinox, and determined alike the commencement and the close
   of a sabbatical year (Deut 31:10). Coming on the 15th of this seventh
   month--that is, at full moon, when the sacred' month had, so to speak,
   attained its full strength--the Feast of Tabernacles appropriately
   followed five days after the Day of Atonement, in which the sin of
   Israel had been removed, and its covenant relation to God restored.
   Thus a sanctified nation could keep a holy feast of harvest joy unto
   the Lord, just as in the truest sense it will be in that day' (Zech
   14:20) when the meaning of the Feast of Tabernacles shall be really
   fulfilled. [149]

    The Three Chief Features of the Feast

   Three things specially marked the Feast of Tabernacles: its joyous
   festivities, the dwelling in booths,' and the peculiar sacrifices and
   rites of the week. The first of these was simply characteristic of a
   feast of ingathering': Because the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all
   thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou
   shalt surely rejoice--thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy
   manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the
   fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.' Nor were any in
   Israel to appear before the Lord empty: every man shall give as he is
   able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which He hath given
   thee' (Deut 16:13-17). Votive, freewill, and peace-offerings would mark
   their gratitude to God, and at the meal which ensued the poor, the
   stranger, the Levite, and the homeless would be welcome guests, for the
   Lord's sake. Moreover, when the people saw the treasury chests opened
   and emptied at this feast for the last time in the year, they would
   remember their brethren at a distance, in whose name, as well as their
   own, the daily and festive sacrifices were offered. Thus their
   liberality would not only be stimulated, but all Israel, however widely
   dispersed, would feel itself anew one before the Lord their God and in
   the courts of His House. There was, besides, something about this feast
   which would peculiarly remind them, if not of their dispersion, yet of
   their being 'strangers and pilgrims in the earth.' For its second
   characteristic was, that during the seven days of its continuance all
   that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths; that your generations
   may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I
   brought them out of the land of Egypt' (Lev 23:42, 43).

    The Booths

   As usual, we are met at the outset by a controversy between the
   Pharisees and the Sadducees. The law had it (Lev 23:40): Ye shall take
   you on the first day the fruit (so correctly in the margin) of goodly
   trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and
   willows of the brook,' which the Sadducees understood (as do the modern
   Karaite Jews) to refer to the materials whence the booths were to be
   constructed, while the Pharisees applied it to what the worshippers
   were to carry in their hands. The latter interpretation is, in all
   likelihood, the correct one; it seems borne out by the account of the
   festival at the time of Nehemiah (Neh 8:15, 18), when the booths were
   constructed of branches of other trees than those mentioned in
   Leviticus 23; and it was universally adopted in practice at the time of
   Christ. The Mishnah gives most minute details as to the height and
   construction of these booths,' the main object being to prevent any
   invasion of the law. Thus it must be a real booth, and constructed of
   boughs of living trees, and solely for the purposes of this festival.
   Hence it must be high enough, yet not too high--at least ten
   handbreadths, but not more than thirty feet; three of its walls must be
   of boughs; it must be fairly covered with boughs, yet not so shaded as
   not to admit sunshine, nor yet so open as to have not sufficient shade,
   the object in each case being neither sunshine nor shade, but that it
   should be a real booth of boughs of trees. It is needless to enter into
   further details, except to say that these booths, and not their houses,
   were to be the regular dwelling of all in Israel during the week, and
   that, except in very heavy rain, they were to eat, sleep, pray,
   study--in short, entirely to live in them. The only exceptions were in
   favour of those absent on some pious duty, the sick, and their
   attendants, women, slaves, and infants who were still depending on
   their mothers. Finally, the rule was that, whatever might contract
   Levitical defilement (such as boards, cloth, etc.), or whatever did not
   grow out of the earth, might not be used' in constructing the booths.'

    The Fruit and Palm Branches

   It has already been noticed that, according to the view universally
   prevalent at the time of Christ, the direction on the first day of the
   feast to take the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and
   the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook,' was applied to
   what the worshippers were to carry in their hands. The Rabbis ruled,
   that the fruit of the goodly trees' meant the aethrog, or citron, and
   the boughs of thick trees' the myrtle, provided it had not more berries
   than leaves.' The aethrogs must be without blemish or deficiency of any
   kind; the palm branches at least three handbreadths high, and fit to be
   shaken; and each branch fresh, entire, unpolluted, and not taken from
   any idolatrous grove. Every worshipper carried the aethrog in his left
   hand, and in his right the lulav, or palm, with myrtle and willow
   branch on either side of it, tied together on the outside with its own
   kind, though in the inside it might be fastened even with gold thread.
   There can be no doubt that the lulav was intended to remind Israel of
   the different stages of their wilderness journey, as represented by the
   different vegetation--the palm branches recalling the valleys and
   plains, the boughs of thick trees,' the bushes on the mountain heights,
   and the willows those brooks from which God had given His people drink;
   while the aethrog was to remind them of the fruits of the good land
   which the Lord had given them. The lulav was used in the Temple on each
   of the seven festive days, even children, if they were able to shake
   it, being bound to carry one. If the first day of the feast fell on a
   Sabbath, the people brought their lulavs on the previous day into the
   synagogue on the Temple Mount, and fetched them in the morning, so as
   not needlessly to break the Sabbath rest.

    The Offerings

   The third characteristic of the Feast of Tabernacles was its offerings.
   These were altogether peculiar. The sin-offering for each of the seven
   days was one kid of the goats.' The burnt-offerings consisted of
   bullocks, rams, and lambs, with their appropriate meat- and
   drink-offerings. But, whereas the number of the rams and lambs remained
   the same on each day of the festival, that of the bullocks decreased
   every day by one--from thirteen on the first to seven bullocks on the
   last day, that great day of the feast.' As no special injunctions are
   given about the drink-offering, we infer that it was, as usually (Num
   15:1-10), 1/4 of a hin of wine for each lamb, 1/3 for each ram, and 1/2
   for each bullock (the hin = 1 gallon 2 pints). The meat-offering' is
   expressly fixed (Num 19:12, etc.) at 1/10 of an ephah of flour, mixed
   with 1/4 of a hin of oil, for each lamb; 2/10 of an ephah with 1/3 hin
   of oil, for each ram; and 3/10 of an ephah, with 1/2 hin of oil, for
   each bullock. Three things are remarkable about these burnt-offerings.
   First, they are evidently the characteristic sacrifice of the Feast of
   Tabernacles. As compared with the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the number
   of the rams and lambs is double, while that of the bullocks is fivefold
   (14 during the Passover week, 5 x 14 during that of Tabernacles).
   Secondly, the number of the burnt-sacrifices, whether taking each kind
   by itself or all of them together, is always divisible by the sacred
   number seven. We have for the week 70 bullocks, 14 rams, and 98 lambs,
   or altogether 182 sacrifices (26 x 7), to which must be added 336 (48 x
   7) tenths of ephahs of flour for the meat-offering. We will not pursue
   the tempting subject of this symbolism of numbers further than to point
   out that, whereas the sacred number 7 appeared at the Feast of
   Unleavened Bread only in the number of its days, and at Pentecost in
   the period of its observance (7 x 7 days after Passover), the Feast of
   Tabernacles lasted seven days, took place when the seventh month was at
   its full height, and had the number 7 impressed on its characteristic
   sacrifices. It is not so easy to account for the third peculiarity of
   these sacrifices--that of the daily diminution in the number of
   bullocks offered. The common explanation, that it was intended to
   indicate the decreasing sanctity of each successive day of the feast,
   while the sacred number 7 was still to be reserved for the last day, is
   not more satisfactory than the view propounded in the Talmud, that
   these sacrifices were offered, not for Israel, but for the nations of
   the world: There were seventy bullocks, to correspond to the number of
   the seventy nations in the world.' But did the Rabbis understand the
   prophetic character of this feast? An attentive consideration of its
   peculiar ceremonial will convince that it must have been exceedingly
   difficult to ignore it entirely.

   On the day before the Feast of Tabernacles--the 14th Tishri--the
   festive pilgrims had all arrived in Jerusalem. The booths' on the
   roofs, in the courtyards, in streets and squares, as well as roads and
   gardens, within a Sabbath day's journey, must have given the city and
   neighbourhood an unusually picturesque appearance. The preparation of
   all that was needed for the festival--purification, the care of the
   offerings that each would bring, and friendly communications between
   those who were to be invited to the sacrificial meal--no doubt
   sufficiently occupied their time. When the early autumn evening set in,
   the blasts of the priests' trumpets on the Temple Mount announced to
   Israel the advent of the feast.

    Special Service at the Temple

   As at the Passover and at Pentecost, the altar of burnt-offering was
   cleansed during the first night-watch, and the gates of the Temple were
   thrown open immediately after midnight. The time till the beginning of
   the ordinary morning sacrifice was occupied in examining the various
   sacrifices and offerings that were to be brought during the day. While
   the morning sacrifice was being prepared, a priest, accompanied by a
   joyous procession with music, went down to the Pool of Siloam, whence
   he drew water into a golden pitcher, capable of holding three log
   (rather more than two pints). But on the Sabbaths they fetched the
   water from a golden vessel in the Temple itself, into which it had been
   carried from Siloam on the preceding day. At the same time that the
   procession started for Siloam, another went to a place in the Kedron
   valley, close by, called Motza, whence they brought willow branches,
   which, amidst the blasts of the priests' trumpets, they stuck on either
   side of the altar of burnt-offering, bending them over towards it, so
   as to form a kind of leafy canopy. Then the ordinary sacrifice
   proceeded, the priest who had gone to Siloam so timing it, that he
   returned just as his brethren carried up the pieces of the sacrifice to
   lay them on the altar. As he entered by the Water-gate,' which obtained
   its name from this ceremony, he was received by a threefold blast from
   the priests' trumpets. The priest then went up the rise of the altar
   and turned to the left, where there were two silver basins with narrow
   holes--the eastern a little wider for the wine, and the western
   somewhat narrower for the water. Into these the wine of the
   drink-offering was poured, and at the same time the water from Siloam,
   the people shouting to the priest, Raise thy hand,' to show that he
   really poured the water into the basin which led to the base of the
   altar. For, sharing the objections of the Sadducees, Alexander
   Jannaeus, the Maccabean king-priest (about 95 BC), had shown his
   contempt for the Pharisees by pouring the water at this feast upon the
   ground, on which the people pelted him with their aethrogs, and would
   have murdered him, if his foreign body-guard had not interfered, on
   which occasion no less than six thousand Jews were killed in the
   Temple.

    The Music of the Feast

   As soon as the wine and the water were being poured out, the Temple
   music began, and the Hallel' (Psa 113-118) was sung in the manner
   previously prescribed, and to the accompaniment of flutes, except on
   the Sabbath and on the first day of the feast, when flute-playing was
   not allowed, on account of the sanctity of the days. When the choir
   came to these words (Psa 118:1), O give thanks to the Lord,' and again
   when they sang (Psa 118:25), O work then now salvation, Jehovah'; and
   once more at the close (Psa 118:29), O give thanks unto the Lord,' all
   the worshippers shook their lulavs towards the altar. When, therefore,
   the multitudes from Jerusalem, on meeting Jesus, cut down branches from
   the trees, and strewed them in the way, and . . . cried, saying, O
   then, work now salvation to the Son of David'! (Matt 21:8, 9; John
   12:12, 13) they applied, in reference to Christ, what was regarded as
   one of the chief ceremonies of the Feast of Tabernacles, praying that
   God would now from the highest' heavens manifest and send that
   salvation in connection with the Son of David, which was symbolised by
   the pouring out of water. For though that ceremony was considered by
   the Rabbis as bearing a subordinate reference to the dispensation of
   the rain, the annual fall of which they imagined was determined by God
   at that feast, its main and real application was to the future
   outpouring of the Holy Spirit, as predicted--probably in allusion to
   this very rite--by Isaiah the prophet (Isa 12:3). [150]

   Thus the Talmud says distinctly: Why is the name of it called, The
   drawing out of water? Because of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit,
   according to what is said: "With joy shall ye draw water out of the
   wells of salvation."' Hence, also, the feast and the peculiar
   joyousness of it are alike designated as those of the drawing out of
   water'; for, according to the same Rabbinical authorities, the Holy
   Spirit dwells in many only through joy.

    The Daily Circuit of the Altar

   A similar symbolism was expressed by another ceremony which took place
   at the close, not of the daily, but of the festive sacrifices. On every
   one of the seven days the priests formed in procession, and made the
   circuit of the altar, singing: O then, now work salvation, Jehovah! O
   Jehovah, give prosperity'! (Psa 118:25). But on the seventh, that great
   day of the feast,' they made the circuit of the altar seven times,
   remembering how the walls of Jericho had fallen in similar
   circumstances, and anticipating how, by the direct interposition of
   God, the walls of heathenism would fall before Jehovah, and the land
   lie open for His people to go in and possess it.

    The References in John 7:37

   We can now in some measure realise the event recorded in John 7:37. The
   festivities of the Week of Tabernacles were drawing to a close. It was
   the last day, that great day of the feast.' It obtained this name,
   although it was not one of holy convocation,' partly because it closed
   the feast, and partly from the circumstances which procured it in
   Rabbinical writings the designations of Day of the Great Hosannah,' on
   account of the sevenfold circuit of the altar with Hosannah'; and Day
   of Willows,' and Day of Beating the Branches,' because all the leaves
   were shaken off the willow boughs, and the palm branches beaten in
   pieces by the side of the altar. It was on that day, after the priest
   had returned from Siloam with his golden pitcher, and for the last time
   poured its contents to the base of the altar; after the Hallel' had
   been sung to the sound of the flute, the people responding and
   worshipping as the priests three times drew the threefold blasts from
   their silver trumpets--just when the interest of the people had been
   raised to its highest pitch, that, from amidst the mass of worshippers,
   who were waving towards the altar quite a forest of leafy branches as
   the last words of Psalm 118 were chanted--a voice was raised which
   resounded through the temple, startled the multitude, and carried fear
   and hatred to the hearts of their leaders. It was Jesus, who stood and
   cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.'
   Then by faith in Him should each one truly become like the Pool of
   Siloam, and from his inmost being rivers of living waters flow' (John
   7:38). This spake He of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him
   should receive.' Thus the significance of the rite, in which they had
   just taken part, was not only fully explained, but the mode of its
   fulfilment pointed out. The effect was instantaneous. It could not but
   be, that in that vast assembly, so suddenly roused by being brought
   face to face with Him in whom every type and prophecy is fulfilled,
   there would be many who, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth
   this is the Prophet. Others said, This is the Christ.' Even the
   Temple-guard, whose duty it would have been in such circumstances to
   arrest one who had so interrupted the services of the day, and
   presented himself to the people in such a light, owned the spell of His
   words, and dared not to lay hands on Him. Never man spake like this
   man,' was the only account they could give of their unusual weakness,
   in answer to the reproaches of the chief priests and Pharisees. The
   rebuke of the Jewish authorities, which followed, is too characteristic
   to require comment. One only of their number had been deeply moved by
   the scene just witnessed in the Temple. Yet, timid as usually,
   Nicodemus only laid hold of this one point, that the Pharisees had
   traced the popular confession of Jesus to their ignorance of the law,
   to which he replied, in the genuine Rabbinical manner of arguing,
   without meeting one's opponent face to face: Doth our law judge any man
   before it hear him, and know what he doeth?'

    The Man Born Blind

   But matters were not to end with the wrangling of priests and
   Pharisees. The proof which Nicodemus had invited them to seek from the
   teaching and the miracles of Christ was about to be displayed both
   before the people and their rulers in the healing of the blind man.
   Here also it was in allusion to the ceremonial of the Feast of
   Tabernacles that Jesus, when He saw the man blind from his birth,' said
   (John 9:5): As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world';
   having anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,' just as He
   told him, Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam (which is, by interpretation,
   Sent).' For the words, I am the light of the world,' are the same which
   He had just spoken in the Temple (John 8:12), and they had in all
   probability been intended to point to another very peculiar ceremony
   which took place at the Feast of Tabernacles. In the words of the
   Mishnah (Succah v. 2, 3, 4), the order of the services for the feast
   was as follows: They went first to offer the daily sacrifice in the
   morning, then the additional sacrifices; after that the votive and
   freewill-offerings; from thence to the festive meal; from thence to the
   study of the law; and after that to offer the evening sacrifice; and
   from thence they went to the joy of the pouring out of the water.' It
   is this joy of the pouring out of the water' which we are about to
   describe.

    The Ceremonies in the Court of the Women

   At the close of the first day of the feast the worshippers descended to
   the Court of the Women, where great preparations had been made. Four
   golden candelabras were there, each with four golden bowls, and against
   them rested four ladders; and four youths of priestly descent held,
   each a pitcher of oil, capable of holding one hundred and twenty log,
   from which they filled each bowl. The old, worn breeches and girdles of
   the priests served for wicks to these lamps. There was not a court in
   Jerusalem that was not lit up by the light of the house of
   water-pouring.' The Chassidim' and the men of Deed' danced before the
   people with flaming torches in their hands, and sang before them hymns
   and songs of praise; and the Levites, with harps, and lutes, and
   cymbals, and trumpets, and instruments of music without number, stood
   upon the fifteen steps which led down from the Court of Israel to that
   of the Women, according to the number of the fifteen Songs of Degrees
   in the Book of Psalms. They stood with their instruments of music, and
   sang hymns. Two priests, with trumpets in their hands, were at the
   upper gate (that of Nicanor), which led from the Court of Israel to
   that of the Women. At cock-crowing they drew a threefold blast. As they
   reached the tenth step, they drew another threefold blast; as they
   entered the court itself, they drew yet another threefold blast; and so
   they blew as they advanced, till they reached the gate which opens upon
   the east (the Beautiful Gate). As they came to the eastern gate, they
   turned round towards the west (to face the Holy Place), and said: Our
   fathers who were in this place, they turned their back upon the
   Sanctuary of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east, and they
   worshipped towards the rising sun; but as for us, our eyes are towards
   the Lord.'

   A fragment of one of the hymns sung that night has been preserved. It
   was sung by the Chassidim' and men of Deed,' and by those who did
   penance in their old age for the sins of their youth:

   The Chassidim and Men of Deed.

   Oh joy, that our youth, devoted, sage,

   Doth bring no shame upon our old age!'

   The Penitents.

   Oh joy, we can in our old age

   Repair the sins of youth not sage!'

   Both in unison.

   Yes, happy he on whom no early guilt doth rest,

   And he who, having sinned, is now with pardon blest.

    Significance of the Illumination

   It seems clear that this illumination of the Temple was regarded as
   forming part of, and having the same symbolical meaning as, the pouring
   out of water.' The light shining out of the Temple into the darkness
   around, and lighting up every court in Jerusalem, must have been
   intended as a symbol not only of the Shechinah which once filled the
   Temple, but of that great light' which the people that walked in
   darkness' were to see, and which was to shine upon them that dwell in
   the land of the shadow of death' (Isa 9:2). May it not be, that such
   prophecies as Isaiah 9 and 60 were connected with this symbolism? At
   any rate, it seems most probable that Jesus had referred to this
   ceremony in the words spoken by Him in the Temple at that very Feast of
   Tabernacles: I am the light of the world; he that followeth Me shall
   not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life' (John 8:12).

    The Six Minor Days

   Only the first of the seven days of this feast was a holy convocation';
   the other six were minor festivals.' On each day, besides the ordinary
   morning and evening sacrifices, the festive offerings prescribed in
   Numbers 29:12-38 were brought. The Psalms sung at the drink-offering
   after the festive sacrifices (or Musaph, as they are called), were, for
   the first day of the feast, Psalm 105; for the second, Psalm 29; for
   the third, Psalm 50, from verse 16; for the fourth, Psalm 94, from
   verse 16; for the fifth, Psalm 94, from verse 8; for the sixth, Psalm
   81, from verse 6; for the last day of the feast, Psalm 82, from verse
   5. As the people retired from the altar at the close of each day's
   service, they exclaimed, How beautiful art thou, O altar!'--or,
   according to a later version, We give thanks to Jehovah and to thee, O
   altar!' All the four-and-twenty orders of the priesthood were engaged
   in the festive offerings, which were apportioned among them according
   to definite rules, which also fixed how the priestly dues were to be
   divided among them. Lastly, in every sabbatical year the Law was to be
   publicly read on the first day of the feast (Deut 31:10-13). [151]

   On the afternoon of the seventh day of the feast the people began to
   remove from the booths.' For at the Octave, on the 22nd of Tishri, they
   lived no longer in booths, nor did they use the lulav. But it was
   observed as a holy convocation'; and the festive sacrifices prescribed
   in Numbers 29:36-38 were offered, although no more by all the
   twenty-four courses of priests, and finally the Hallel' sung at the
   drink-offering.

    The Pouring and Lighting Post-Mosaic

   It will have been observed that the two most important ceremonies of
   the Feast of Tabernacles--the pouring out of water and the illumination
   of the Temple--were of post-Mosaic origin. According to Jewish
   tradition, the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night had first
   appeared to Israel on the 15th of Tishri, the first day of the feast.
   On that day also Moses was said to have come down from the Mount, and
   accounted to the people that the Tabernacle of God was to be reared
   among them. We know that the dedication of Solomon's Temple and the
   descent of the Shechinah took place at this feast (1 Kings 8; 2 Chron
   7). Nor can we greatly err in finding an allusion to it in this
   description of heavenly things: After this I beheld, and, lo, a great
   multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and
   people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb,
   clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a
   loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God, which sitteth upon the
   throne, and unto the Lamb' (Rev 7:9, 10).

   Whether or not our suggestions be adopted as to the typical meaning of
   the two great ceremonies of the pouring out of the water' and the
   Temple illumination, the fact remains, that the Feast of Tabernacles is
   the one only type in the Old Testament which has not yet been
   fulfilled.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [149] Quite another picture is drawn in Hosea 9, which seems also to
   refer to the Feast of Tabernacles (see specially verse 5). Indeed, it
   is remarkable how many allusions to this feast occur in the writings of
   the prophets, as if its types were the goal of all their desires.

   [150] Of course, one or other of these two views is open, either, that
   the words of Isaiah were based on the ceremony of water-pouring, or
   that this ceremony was derived from the words of Isaiah. In either
   case, however, our inference from it holds good. It is only fair to
   add, that by some the expression water' in Isaiah 12:3 is applied to
   the law.' But this in no way vitiates our conclusion, as the Jews
   expected the general conversion of the Gentiles to be a conversion to
   Judaism.

   [151] In later times only certain portions were read, the law as a
   whole being sufficiently known from the weekly prelections in the
   synagogues.

Chapter 15

  The New Moons: The Feast of the Seventh New Moon, or of Trumpets, or New
  Year's Day

   Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
   an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath: which are a shadow
   of things to come; but the body is of Christ.'--Colossians 2:16, 17.

    The New Moons

   Scarcely any other festive season could have left so continuous an
   impress on the religious life of Israel as the New Moons.' Recurring at
   the beginning of every month, and marking it, the solemn proclamation
   of the day, by--'It is sanctified,' was intended to give a hallowed
   character to each month, while the blowing of the priests' trumpets and
   the special sacrifices brought, would summon, as it were, the Lord's
   host to offer their tribute unto their exalted King, and thus bring
   themselves into remembrance' before Him. Besides, it was also a popular
   feast, when families, like that of David, might celebrate their special
   annual sacrifice (1 Sam 20:6, 29); when the king gave a state-banquet
   (1 Sam 20:5, 24); and those who sought for instruction and edification
   resorted to religious meetings, such as Elisha seems to have held (2
   Kings 4:23). And so we trace its observance onwards through the history
   of Israel; marking in Scripture a special Psalm for the New Moon (in
   Tishri) (Psa 81:3); noting how from month to month the day was kept as
   an outward ordinance, even in the decay of religious life (Isa 1:13;
   Hosea 2:11), apparently all the more rigidly, with abstinence from
   work, not enjoined in the law, that its spirit was no longer understood
   (Amos 8:5); and finally learning from the prophecies of Isaiah and
   Ezekiel that it also had a higher meaning, and was destined to find a
   better fulfilment in another dispensation, when the New Moon trumpet
   should summon all flesh to worship before Jehovah' (Isa 66:23), and the
   closed eastern gate to the inner court of the new Temple be opened once
   more to believing Israel (Eze 46:1). And in New Testament times we
   still find the New Moon' kept as an outward observance by Jews and
   Judaising Christians, yet expressly characterised as a shadow of things
   to come; but the body is of Christ' (Col 2:16, 17).

    The Determination of the New Moon

   We have already shown of what importance the right determination of the
   new moon was in fixing the various festivals of the year, and with what
   care and anxiety its appearance was ascertained from witnesses who had
   actually seen it; also how the tidings were afterwards communicated to
   those at a distance. For the new moon was reckoned by actual personal
   observation, not by astronomical calculation, with which, however, as
   we know, many of the Rabbis must have been familiar, since we read of
   astronomical pictures, by which they were wont to test the veracity of
   witnesses. So important was it deemed to have faithful witnesses, that
   they were even allowed, in order to reach Jerusalem in time, to travel
   on the Sabbath, and, if necessary, to make use of horse or mule (Mish.
   Rosh ha Sh. i. 9; iii. 2). While strict rules determined who were not
   to be admitted as witnesses, every encouragement was given to
   trustworthy persons, and the Sanhedrim provided for them a banquet in a
   large building specially destined for that purpose, and known as the
   Beth Yaazek.

    The Blowing of Trumpets

   In the law of God only these two things are enjoined in the observance
   of the New Moon'--the blowing of trumpets' (Num 10:10) and special
   festive sacrifices (Num 28:11-15). Of old the blowing of trumpets' had
   been the signal for Israel's host on their march through the
   wilderness, as it afterwards summoned them to warfare, and proclaimed
   or marked days of public rejoicing, and feasts, as well as the
   beginning of their months' (Num 10:1-10). The object of it is expressly
   stated to have been for a memorial,' that they might be remembered
   before Jehovah,' it being specially added: I am Jehovah your God.' It
   was, so to speak, the host of God assembled, waiting for their Leader;
   the people of God united to proclaim their King. At the blast of the
   priests' trumpets they ranged themselves, as it were, under His banner
   and before His throne, and this symbolical confession and proclamation
   of Him as Jehovah their God,' brought them before Him to be remembered'
   and saved.' And so every season of blowing the trumpets,' whether at
   New Moons, at the Feast of Trumpets or New Year's Day, at other
   festivals, in the Sabbatical and Year of Jubilee, or in the time of
   war, was a public acknowledgment of Jehovah as King. Accordingly we
   find the same symbols adopted in the figurative language of the New
   Testament. As of old the sound of the trumpet summoned the congregation
   before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle, so His elect' shall be
   summoned by the sound of the trumpet in the day of Christ's coming
   (Matt 24:31), and not only the living, but those also who had slept' (1
   Cor 15:52)--'the dead in Christ' (1 Thess 4:16). Similarly, the
   heavenly hosts are marshalled to the war of successive judgments (Rev
   8:2; 10:7), till, as the seventh angel sounded,' Christ is proclaimed
   King Universal: The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of
   our Lord, and of His Christ, and He shall reign for ever and ever' (Rev
   11:15).

    The Sacrifices of the New Moon

   Besides the blowing of trumpets,' certain festive sacrifices were
   ordered to be offered on the New Moon (Num 28:11-15). These most
   appropriately mark the beginnings of months' (Num 28:11). For it is a
   universal principle in the Old Testament, that the first' always stands
   for the whole--the firstfruits for the whole harvest, the firstborn and
   the firstlings for all the rest; and that if the firstfruit be holy,
   the lump is also holy.' And so the burnt-offerings and the
   sin-offerings at the beginning' of each month consecrated the whole.
   These festive sacrifices consisted of two young bullocks, one ram, and
   seven lambs of the first year for a burnt-offering, with their
   appropriate meat- and drink-offerings, and also of one kid of the goats
   for a sin-offering unto Jehovah.' [152]

   When we pass from these simple Scriptural directions to what tradition
   records of the actual observance of New Moons' in the Temple, our
   difficulties increase. For this and New Year's Day are just such
   feasts, in connection with which superstition would most readily grow
   up, from the notions which the Rabbis had, that at changes of seasons
   Divine judgments were initiated, modified, or finally fixed.

    Necessity for Distinguishing the Temple and Synagogue Use

   Modern critics have not been sufficiently careful in distinguishing
   what had been done in the Temple from what was introduced into the
   synagogue, gradually and at much later periods. Thus, prayers which
   date long after the destruction of Jerusalem have been represented as
   offered in the Temple, and the custom of chanting the Hallel' (Psa
   113-118) on New Moons in the synagogue has been erroneously traced to
   Biblical times. So far as we can gather, the following was the order of
   service on New Moon's Day. The Council sat from early morning to just
   before the evening sacrifice, to determine the appearance of the new
   moon. The proclamation of the Council--'It is sanctified!'--and not the
   actual appearance of the new moon, determined the commencement of the
   feast. Immediately afterwards, the priests blew the trumpets which
   marked the feast. After the ordinary morning sacrifice, the prescribed
   festive offerings were brought, the blood of the burnt-offerings being
   thrown round the base of the altar below the red line, and the rest
   poured out into the channel at the south side of the altar; while the
   blood of the sin-offering was sprinkled or dropped from the finger on
   the horns of the altar of burnt-offering, beginning from the east, the
   rest being poured out, as that of the burnt-offerings. The two bullocks
   of the burnt-offerings were hung up and flayed on the uppermost of the
   three rows of hooks in the court, the rams on the middle, and the lambs
   on the lowest hooks. In all no less than 107 priests officiated at this
   burnt-offering--20 with every bullock, 11 with every ram, and 8 with
   every lamb, including, of course, those who carried the appropriate
   meat- and drink-offerings. At the offering of these sacrifices the
   trumpets were again blown. All of them were slain at the north side of
   the altar, while the peace- and freewill-offerings, which private
   Israelites were wont at such seasons to bring, were sacrificed at the
   south side. The flesh of the sin-offering and what of the meat-offering
   came to them, was eaten by the priests in the Temple itself; their
   portion of the private thank-offerings might be taken by them to their
   homes in Jerusalem, and there eaten with their households.

    A Prayer of the Third Century, AD

   If any special prayers were said in the Temple on New Moons' Days,
   tradition has not preserved them, the only formula dating from that
   period being that used on first seeing the moon--'Blessed be He who
   reneweth the months.' To this the synagogue, towards the close of the
   third century, added the following: Blessed be He by whose word the
   heavens were created, and by the breath of whose mouth all the hosts
   thereof were formed! He appointed them a law and time, that they should
   not overstep their course. They rejoice and are glad to perform the
   will of their Creator, Author of truth; their operations are truth! He
   spoke to the moon, Be thou renewed, and be the beautiful diadem (i.e.
   the hope) of man (i.e. Israel), who shall one day be quickened again
   like the moon (i.e. at the coming of Messiah), and praise their Creator
   for His glorious kingdom. Blessed be He who reneweth the moons.' At a
   yet much later period, a very superstitious prayer was next inserted,
   its repetition being accompanied by leaping towards the moon! New
   Moon's Day, though apparently observed in the time of Amos as a day of
   rest (Amos 8:5), is not so kept by the Jews in our days, nor, indeed,
   was abstinence from work enjoined in the Divine Law. [153]

    The Moon of the Seventh Month

   Quite distinct from the other new moons, and more sacred than they, was
   that of the seventh month, or Tishri, partly on account of the
   symbolical meaning of the seventh or sabbatical month, in which the
   great feasts of the Day of Atonement and of Tabernacles occurred, and
   partly, perhaps, because it also marked the commencement of the civil
   year, always supposing that, as Josephus and most Jewish writers
   maintain, the distinction between the sacred and civil year dates from
   the time of Moses. [154]

   In Scripture this feast is designated as the memorial blowing' (Lev
   23:24), or the day of blowing' (Num 29:1), because on that day the
   trumpets, or rather, as we shall see, the horns were blown all day long
   in Jerusalem. It was to be observed as a Sabbath,' and a holy
   convocation,' in which no servile work' might be done. The prescribed
   offerings for the day consisted, besides the ordinary morning and
   evening sacrifices, first, of the burnt-offerings, but not the
   sin-offering, of ordinary new moons, with their meat- and
   drink-offerings, and after that, of another festive burnt-offering of
   one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs, with their appropriate
   meat- and drink-offerings, together with one kid of the goats for a
   sin-offering, to make an atonement for you.' While the drink-offering
   of the festive sacrifice was poured out, the priests and Levites
   chanted Psalm 81, and if the feast fell on a Thursday, for which that
   Psalm was, at any rate, prescribed, it was sung twice, beginning the
   second time at verse 7 in the Hebrew text, or verse 6 of our Authorised
   Version. At the evening sacrifice Psalm 29 was sung. For reasons
   previously explained (chiefly to prevent possible mistakes), it became
   early common to observe the New Year's Feast on two successive days,
   and the practice may have been introduced in Temple times.

    The Mishnah on New Year's Day

   The Mishnah, which devotes a special tractate to this feast, remarks
   that a year may be arranged according to four different periods; the
   first, beginning with the 1st of Nisan, being for kings' (to compute
   taxation) and for computing the feasts; the second, on the 1st of Elul
   (the sixth month), for tithing flocks and herds, any animal born after
   that not being reckoned within the previous year; the third, on the 1st
   of Tishri (the seventh month), for the Civil, the Sabbatical, and the
   Jubilee year, also for trees and herbs; and lastly, that on the 1st of
   Shebat (the eleventh month), for all fruits of trees. Similarly,
   continues the Mishnah, there are four seasons when judgment is
   pronounced upon the world: at the Passover, in regard to the harvest;
   at Pentecost, in regard to the fruits of trees; on the Feast of
   Tabernacles, in regard to the dispensation of rain; while on New Year's
   Day all the children of men pass before Him like lambs (when they are
   counted for the tithing), as it is written (Psa 33:15), "He fashioneth
   their hearts alike; He considereth all their works."'

    The Talmud on the New Year

   To this we may add, as a comment of the Talmud, that on New Year's Day
   three books were opened--that of life, for those whose works had been
   good; another of death, for those who had been thoroughly evil; and a
   third, intermediate, for those whose case was to be decided on the Day
   of Atonement (ten days after New Year), the delay being granted for
   repentance, or otherwise, after which their names would be finally
   entered, either in the book of life, or in that of death. By these
   terms, however, eternal life or death are not necessarily meant; rather
   earthly well-being, and, perhaps, temporal life, or the opposite. It is
   not necessary to explain at length on what Scriptural passages this
   curious view about the three books is supposed to rest. [155]

   But so deep and earnest are the feelings of the Rabbis on this matter,
   that by universal consent the ten days intervening between New Year and
   the Day of Atonement are regarded as days of repentance.' Indeed, from
   a misunderstanding of a passage in the Mishnah (Sheb. i. 4, 5), a
   similar superstition attaches to every new moon, the day preceding it
   being kept by rigid Jews as one of fasting and repentance, and called
   the Lesser Day of Atonement.' In accordance with this, the Rabbis hold
   that the blowing of the trumpets is intended, first, to bring Israel,
   or rather the merits of the patriarchs and God's covenant with them, in
   remembrance before the Lord; secondly, to be a means of confounding
   Satan, who appears on that day specially to accuse Israel; and, lastly,
   as a call to repentance--as it were, a blast to wake men from their
   sleep of sin (Maimonides, Moreh Nev. iii. 43). [156]

    New Year's Day in Jerusalem

   During the whole of New Year's Day, trumpets and horns were blown in
   Jerusalem from morning to evening. In the Temple it was done, even on a
   Sabbath, but not outside its walls. Since the destruction of Jerusalem
   this restriction has been removed, and the horn is blown in every
   synagogue, even though the feast fall upon a Sabbath. It has already
   been hinted that the instruments used were not the ordinary priests'
   trumpets, but horns. The Mishnah holds that any kind of horns may be
   blown except those of oxen or calves, in order not to remind God of the
   sin of the golden calf! The Mishnah, however, specially mentions the
   straight horn of the antelope and the bent horn of the ram; the latter
   with special allusion to the sacrifice in substitution of Isaac, it
   being a tradition that New Year's Day was that in which Abraham,
   despite Satan's wiles to prevent or retard him, had offered up his son
   Isaac on Mount Moriah. The mouthpiece of the horns for New Year's Day
   were fitted with gold--those used on fast days with silver. Another
   distinction was this--on New Year's Day those who blew the horn were
   placed between others who blew the trumpets, and the sound of the horn
   was prolonged beyond that of the trumpets; but on fast days those who
   sounded the trumpets stood in the middle, and their blast was prolonged
   beyond that of the horn. For the proper observance of these solemn
   seasons, it was deemed necessary not only to hear but to listen to the
   sound of the horns, since, as the Mishnah adds, everything depends on
   the intent of the heart, not on the mere outward deed, just as it was
   not Moses lifting up his hands that gave Israel the victory, nor yet
   the lifting up of the brazen serpent which healed, but the upturning of
   the heart of Israel to their Father who is in heaven'--or faith (Rosh
   ha Sh. iii. 8). We quote the remark, not only as one of the
   comparatively few passages in the Mishnah which turn on the essence of
   religion, but as giving an insight into the most ancient views of the
   Rabbis on these types, and as reminding us of the memorable teaching of
   our Lord to one of those very Rabbis (John 3:14, 15).

    The New Year's Blessings

   The Mishnah (Rosh ha Sh. iv. 5, etc.) mentions various Berachoth' or
   benedictions' as having been repeated on New Year's Day. These, with
   many others of later date, still form part of the liturgy in the
   synagogue for that day. But there is internal evidence that the
   prayers, at any rate in their present form, could not have been used,
   at least, in the Temple. [157]

   Besides, the Rabbis themselves differ as to their exact amount and
   contents, and finally satisfy themselves by indicating that the titles
   of these benedictions are rather intended as headings, to show their
   contents, and what special direction their prayers had taken. One set
   of them bore on the kingdom' of God, and is accordingly called
   Malchiyoth; another, the Sichronoth, referred to the various kinds of
   remembrance' on the part of God; while a third, called Shopharoth,
   consisted of benedictions, connected with the blowing of the horn.' It
   is said that any one who simply repeated ten passages from
   Scripture--according to another authority, three--bearing on the
   kingdom of God,' the remembrance of God,' and the blowing of horns,'
   had fulfilled his duty in regard to these benedictions.'

    The First Day of the Seventh Month

   From Scripture we know with what solemnity the first day of the seventh
   month as observed at the time of Ezra, and how deeply moved the people
   were by the public reading and explanation of the law, which to so many
   of them came like a strange sound, all the more solemn, that after so
   long a period they heard it again on that soil which, as it were, bore
   witness to its truth (Neh 8:1-12). In the New Testament there is no
   reference to our Lord having ever attended this feast in Jerusalem. Nor
   was this necessary, as it was equally celebrated in all the synagogues
   of Israel. [158]

   Yet there seems some allusion to the blowing of the horn in the
   writings of St. Paul. We have already stated that, according to
   Maimonides (Moreh Nev. iii. c. 43), one of its main purposes was to
   rouse men to repentance. In fact, the commentator of Maimonides makes
   use of the following words to denote the meaning of the blowing of
   trumpets: Rouse ye, rouse ye from your slumber; awake, awake from your
   sleep, you who mind vanity, for slumber most heavy has fallen upon you.
   Take it to heart, before Whom you are to give an account in the
   judgment.' May not some such formula also have been anciently used in
   the synagogue; and may not the remembrance of it have been present to
   the mind of the apostle, when he wrote (Eph 5:14): Wherefore it is
   said, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ
   shall give thee light'! If so, we may possibly find an allusion to the
   appearance of the new moon, specially to that of the seventh month, in
   these words of one of the preceding verses (Eph 5:8): For ye were
   sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children
   of light'!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [152] There is a curious and somewhat blasphemous Haggadah, or story,
   in the Talmud on this subject. It appears that at first the sun and
   moon had been created of equal size, but that when the moon wished to
   be sole ruler' to the exclusion of the sun, her jealousy was punished
   by diminution. In reply to her arguments and importunity, God had then
   tried to comfort the moon, that the three righteous men, Jacob, Samuel,
   and David, were likewise to be small--and when even thus the moon had
   the better of the reasoning, God had directed that a sin-offering'
   should be brought on the new moon, because He had made the moon smaller
   and less important than the sun!

   [153] The Talmud has this curious story in explanation of the custom
   that women abstain from work on New Moons--that the women had refused
   to give their earrings for the golden calf, while the men gave theirs,
   whereas, on the other hand, the Jewish females contributed their
   ornaments for the Tabernacle.

   [154] In another place we have adopted the common, modern view, that
   this distinction only dates from the return from Babylon. But it must
   be admitted that the weight of authority is all on the other side. The
   Jews hold that the world was created in the month Tishri.

   [155] The two principal passages are Psalm 69:28, and Exodus 32:32; the
   former is thus explained: Let them be blotted out of the book,' which
   means the book of the wicked, while the expression of the living'
   refers to that of the righteous, so that the next clause, and not be
   written with the righteous,' is supposed to indicate the existence of a
   third or intermediate book!

   [156] In opposition to this, Luther annotates as follows: They were to
   blow with the horn in order to call God and His wondrous works to
   remembrance; how He had redeemed them--as it were to preach about it,
   and to thank Him for it, just as among us Christ and His redemption is
   remembered and preached by the Gospel'; to which the Weimar Glossary
   adds: Instead of the horn and trumpets we have bells.' See Lundius,
   Jud. Heiligth. p. 1024, col. ii. Buxtorf applies Amos 3:16 to the
   blowing of the horn.

   [157] From the text of Rosh ha Sh. iv. 7, it distinctly appears that
   they were intended to be used in the synagogues. Of course, this leaves
   the question open, whether or not something like them was also said in
   the Temple. The Mishnah mentions altogether nine of these
   benedictions.'

   [158] But in the synagogues out of Jerusalem, the horn, not trumpets,
   was blown on New Year's Day.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 16

  The Day of Atonement

   But into the second (tabernacle) went the high-priest alone once every
   year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the
   errors of the people . . . But Christ being come an high-priest of good
   things to come . . . by His own blood He entered in once into the holy
   place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.'--Hebrews 9:7, 11,
   12.

    Weakness of the Law

   It may sound strange, and yet it is true, that the clearest testimony
   to the weakness and unprofitableness' of the commandment' is that given
   by the commandment' itself. The Levitical arrangements for the removal
   of sin bear on their forefront, as it were, this inscription: The law
   made nothing perfect'--having neither a perfect mediatorship in the
   priesthood, nor a perfect atonement' in the sacrifices, nor yet a
   perfect forgiveness as the result of both. For the law having a shadow
   of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never
   with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make
   the comers thereunto perfect' (Heb 10:1). And this appears, first, from
   the continual recurrence and the multiplicity of these sacrifices,
   which are intended the one to supplement the other, and yet always
   leave something to be still supplemented; and, secondly, from the broad
   fact that, in general, it is not possible that the blood of bulls and
   of goats should take away sins' (Heb 10:4). It is therefore evident
   that the Levitical dispensation, being stamped with imperfectness alike
   in the means which it employed for the taking away' of sin, and in the
   results which it obtained by these means, declared itself, like John
   the Baptist, only a forerunner,' the breaker up and preparer of the
   way--not the satisfying, but, on the contrary, the calling forth and
   the bringing in of a better hope' (Heb 7:19; see marginal rendering).

    The Day of Atonement

   As might have been expected, this weakness and unprofitableness of the
   commandment' became most apparent in the services of the day in which
   the Old Testament provision for pardon and acceptance attained, so to
   speak, its climax. On the Day of Atonement, not ordinary priests, but
   the high-priest alone officiated, and that not in his ordinary dress,
   nor yet in that of the ordinary priesthood, but in one peculiar to the
   day, and peculiarly expressive of purity. The worshippers also appeared
   in circumstances different from those on any other occasion, since they
   were to fast and to afflict their souls'; the day itself was to be a
   Sabbath of Sabbatism' (rendered Sabbath of rest' in Authorised
   Version), while its central services consisted of a series of grand
   expiatory sacrifices, unique in their character, purpose, and results,
   as described in these words: He shall make an atonement for the holy
   sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
   congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the
   priests, and for all the people of the congregation' (Lev 16:33). But
   even the need of such a Day of Atonement, after the daily offerings,
   the various festive sacrifices, and the private and public
   sin-offerings all the year round, showed the insufficiency of all such
   sacrifices, while the very offerings of the Day of Atonement proclaimed
   themselves to be only temporary and provisional, imposed until the time
   of reformation.' We specially allude here to the mysterious appearance
   of the so-called scape-goat,' of which we shall, in the sequel, have to
   give an account differing from that of previous writers.

    Its Names

   The names Day of Atonement,' or in the Talmud, which devotes to it a
   special tractate, simply the day' (perhaps also in Hebrews 7:27 [159]
   ), and in the Book of Acts the fast' (Acts 27:9), sufficiently
   designate its general object.

   It took place on the tenth day of the seventh month (Tishri), that is,
   symbolically, when the sacred or Sabbath of months had just attained
   its completeness. Nor must we overlook the position of that day
   relatively to the other festivals. The seventh or sabbatical month
   closed the festive cycle, the Feast of Tabernacles on the 15th of that
   month being the last in the year. But, as already stated, before that
   grand festival of harvesting and thanksgiving Israel must, as a nation,
   be reconciled unto God, for only a people at peace with God might
   rejoice before Him in the blessing with which He had crowned the year.
   And the import of the Day of Atonement, as preceding the Feast of
   Tabernacles, becomes only more striking, when we remember how that
   feast of harvesting prefigured the final ingathering of all nations. In
   connection with this point it may also be well to remember that the
   Jubilee Year was always proclaimed on the Day of Atonement (Lev 25:9).
   [160]

    The Teaching of Scripture about the Day

   In briefly reviewing the Divine ordinances about this day (Lev 16;
   23:26-32; Num 29:11), we find that only on that one day in every year
   the high-priest was allowed to go into the Most Holy Place, and then
   arrayed in a peculiar white dress, which differed from that of the
   ordinary priests, in that its girdle also was white, and not of the
   Temple colours, while the bonnet' was of the same shape, though not the
   same material as the mitre,' which the high-priest ordinarily wore. The
   simple white of his array, in distinction to the golden garments' which
   he otherwise wore, pointed to the fact that on that day the high-priest
   appeared, not as the bridegroom of Jehovah,' but as bearing in his
   official capacity the emblem of that perfect purity which was sought by
   the expiations of that day. Thus in the prophecies of Zechariah the
   removal of Joshua's filthy garments' and the clothing him with change
   of raiment,' symbolically denoted--'I have caused thine iniquity to
   pass from thee' (Zech 3:3, 4). Similarly those who stand nearest to God
   are always described as arrayed in white' (see Eze 9:2, etc.; Dan 10:5;
   12:6). And because these were emphatically the holy garments,'
   therefore' the high-priest had to wash his flesh in water, and so put
   them on' (Lev 16:4), that is, he was not merely to wash his hands and
   feet, as before ordinary ministrations, but to bathe his whole body.

    Numbers 29:7-11

   From Numbers 29:7-11 it appears that the offerings on the Day of
   Atonement were really of a threefold kind--'the continual
   burnt-offering,' that is, the daily morning and evening sacrifices,
   with their meat- and drink-offerings; the festive sacrifices of the
   day, consisting for the high-priest and the priesthood, of a ram for a
   burnt-offering' (Lev 16:3), and for the people of one young bullock,
   one ram, and seven lambs of the first year (with their meat-offerings)
   for a burnt-sacrifice, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering;
   and, thirdly, and chiefly, the peculiar expiatory sacrifices of the
   day, which were a young bullock as a sin-offering for the high-priest,
   his house, and the sons of Aaron, and another sin-offering for the
   people, consisting of two goats, one of which was to be killed and its
   blood sprinkled, as directed, while the other was to be sent away into
   the wilderness, bearing all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
   and all their transgressions in all their sins' which had been
   confessed over him,' and laid upon him by the high-priest. Before
   proceeding further, we note the following as the order of these
   sacrifices--first, the ordinary morning sacrifice; next the expiatory
   sacrifices for the high-priest, the priesthood, and the people (one
   bullock, and one of the two goats, the other being the so-called
   scape-goat); then the festive burnt-offerings of the priests and the
   people (Num 29:7-11), and with them another sin-offering; and, lastly,
   the ordinary evening sacrifice, being, as Maimonides observes, in all
   fifteen sacrificial animals. According to Jewish tradition, the whole
   of the services of that day were performed by the high-priest himself,
   of course with the assistance of others, for which purpose more than
   500 priests were said to have been employed. Of course, if the Day of
   Atonement fell on a Sabbath, besides all these, the ordinary Sabbath
   sacrifices were also offered. On a principle previously explained, the
   high-priest purchased from his own funds the sacrifices brought for
   himself and his house, the priesthood, however, contributing, in order
   to make them sharers in the offering, while the public sacrifices for
   the whole people were paid for from the Temple treasury. Only while
   officiating in the distinctly expiatory services of the day did the
   high-priest wear his linen garments'; in all the others he was arrayed
   in his golden vestments.' This necessitated a frequent change of dress,
   and before each he bathed his whole body. All this will be best
   understood by a more detailed account of the order of service, as given
   in the Scriptures and by tradition.

    The Duties of the High-priest

   Seven days before the Day of Atonement the high-priest left his own
   house in Jerusalem, and took up his abode in his chambers in the
   Temple. A substitute was appointed for him, in case he should die or
   become Levitically unfit for his duties. Rabbinical punctiliousness
   went so far as to have him twice sprinkled with the ashes of the red
   heifer--on the 3rd and the 7th day of his week of separation--in case
   he had unwittingly to himself, been defiled by a dead body (Num 19:13).
   [161]

   During the whole of that week, also, he had to practise the various
   priestly rites, such as sprinkling the blood, burning the incense,
   lighting the lamp, offering the daily sacrifice, etc. For, as already
   stated, every part of that day's services devolved on the high-priest,
   and he must not commit any mistake. Some of the elders of the Sanhedrim
   were appointed to see to it, that the high-priest fully understood, and
   knew the meaning of the service, otherwise they were to instruct him in
   it. On the eve of the Day of Atonement the various sacrifices were
   brought before him, that there might be nothing strange about the
   services of the morrow. Finally, they bound him by a solemn oath not to
   change anything in the rites of the day. This was chiefly for fear of
   the Sadducean notion, that the incense should be lighted before the
   high-priest actually entered into the Most Holy Place; while the
   Pharisees held that this was to be done only within the Most Holy Place
   itself. [162]

   The evening meal of the high-priest before the great day was to be
   scanty. All night long he was to be hearing and expounding the Holy
   Scriptures, or otherwise kept employed, so that he might not fall
   asleep (for special Levitical reasons). At midnight the lot was cast
   for removing the ashes and preparing the altar; and to distinguish the
   Day of Atonement from all others, four, instead of the usual three,
   fires were arranged on the great altar of burnt-offering.

    The Morning Service

   The services of the day began with the first streak of morning light.
   Already the people had been admitted into the sanctuary. So jealous
   were they of any innovation or alteration, that only a linen cloth
   excluded the high-priest from public view, when, each time before
   changing his garments, he bathed--not in the ordinary place of the
   priests, but in one specially set apart for his use. Altogether he
   changed his raiments and washed his whole body five times on that day,
   [163] and his hands and feet ten times. [164]

   When the first dawn of morning was announced in the usual manner, the
   high-priest put off his ordinary (layman's) dress, bathed, put on his
   golden vestments, washed his hands and feet, and proceeded to perform
   all the principal parts of the ordinary morning service. Tradition has
   it, that immediately after that, he offered certain parts of the
   burnt-sacrifices for the day, viz. the bullock and the seven lambs,
   reserving his own ram and that of the people, as well as the
   sin-offering of a kid of the goats (Num 29:8-11), till after the
   special expiatory sacrifices of the day had been brought. But the text
   of Leviticus 16:24 is entirely against this view, and shows that the
   whole of the burnt-offerings and the festive sin-offering were brought
   after the expiatory services. Considering the relation between these
   services and sacrifices, this might, at any rate, have been expected,
   since a burnt-offering could only be acceptable after, not before,
   expiation.

    The Sin-offering

   The morning service finished, the high-priest washed his hands and
   feet, put off his golden vestments, bathed, put on his linen garments,'
   again washed his hands and feet, and proceeded to the peculiar part of
   the day's services. The bullock for his sin-offering stood between the
   Temple-porch and the altar. It was placed towards the south, but the
   high-priest, who stood facing the east (that is, the worshippers),
   turned the head of the sacrifice towards the west (that is, to face the
   sanctuary). He then laid both his hands upon the head of the bullock,
   and confessed as follows:--'Ah, JEHOVAH! I have committed iniquity; I
   have transgressed; I have sinned--I and my house. Oh, then, JEHOVAH, I
   entreat Thee, cover over (atone for, let there be atonement for) the
   iniquities, the transgressions, and the sins which I have committed,
   transgressed, and sinned before Thee, I and my house--even as it is
   written in the law of Moses, Thy servant: "For, on that day will He
   cover over (atone) for you to make you clean; from all your
   transgressions before JEHOVAH ye shall be cleansed."' It will be
   noticed that in this solemn confession the name JEHOVAH occurred three
   times. Other three times was it pronounced in the confession which the
   high-priest made over the same bullock for the priesthood; a seventh
   time was it uttered when he cast the lot as to which of the two goats
   was to be for JEHOVAH'; and once again he spoke it three times in the
   confession over the so-called scape-goat' which bore the sins of the
   people. All these ten times the high-priest pronounced the very name of
   JEHOVAH, and, as he spoke it, those who stood near cast themselves with
   their faces on the ground, while the multitude responded: Blessed be
   the Name; the glory of His kingdom is for ever and ever' (in support of
   this benediction, reference is made to Deut 32:3). Formerly it had been
   the practice to pronounce the so-called Ineffable Name' distinctly, but
   afterwards, when some attempted to make use of it for magical purposes,
   it was spoken with bated breath, and, as one relates (Rabbi Tryphon in
   the Jerus. Talm.) [165] who had stood among the priests in the Temple
   and listened with rapt attention to catch the mysterious name, it was
   lost amidst the sound of the priests' instruments, as they accompanied
   the benediction of the people.

    Choosing the Scape-goat

   The first part of the expiatory service--that for the priesthood--had
   taken place close to the Holy Place, between the porch and the altar.
   The next was performed close to the worshipping people. In the eastern
   part of the Court of Priests, that is, close to the worshippers, and on
   the north side of it, stood an urn, called Calpi, in which were two
   lots of the same shape, size, and material--in the second Temple they
   were of gold; the one bearing the inscription la-JEHOVAH,' for Jehovah,
   the other la-Azazel,' for Azazel, leaving the expression (Lev 16:8, 10,
   26) (rendered scape-goat' in the Authorised Version) for the present
   untranslated. These two goats had been placed with their backs to the
   people and their faces towards the sanctuary (westwards). The
   high-priest now faced the people, as, standing between his substitute
   (at his right hand) and the head of the course on ministry (on his left
   hand), he shook the urn, thrust his two hands into it, and at the same
   time drew the two lots, laying one on the head of each goat. Popularly
   it was deemed of good augury if the right-hand lot had fallen for
   Jehovah.' The two goats, however, must be altogether alike in look,
   size, and value; indeed, so earnestly was it sought to carry out the
   idea that these two formed parts of one and the same sacrifice, that it
   was arranged they should, if possible, even be purchased at the same
   time. The importance of this view will afterwards be explained.

    The Goat Shown to the People

   The lot having designated each of the two goats, the high-priest tied a
   tongue-shaped piece of scarlet cloth to the horn of the goat for
   Azazel--the so-called scape-goat'--and another round the throat of the
   goat for Jehovah, which was to be slain. The goat that was to be sent
   forth was now turned round towards the people, and stood facing them,
   waiting, as it were, till their sins should be laid on him, and he
   would carry them forth into a land not inhabited.' Assuredly a more
   marked type of Christ could not be conceived, as He was brought forth
   by Pilate and stood before the people, just as He was about to be led
   forth, bearing the iniquity of the people. And, as if to add to the
   significance of the rite, tradition has it that when the sacrifice was
   fully accepted the scarlet mark which the scape-goat had borne became
   white, to symbolise the gracious promise in Isaiah 1:18; but it adds
   that this miracle did not take place for forty years before the
   destruction of the Temple!

    The Confession of Sin and the Sacrifice

   With this presentation of the scape-goat before the people commenced
   the third and most solemn part of the expiatory services of the day.
   The high-priest now once more returned towards the sanctuary, and a
   second time laid his two hands on the bullock, which still stood
   between the porch and the altar, to confess over him, not only as
   before, his own and his household's sins, but also those of the
   priesthood. The formula used was precisely the same as before, with the
   addition of the words, the seed of Aaron, Thy holy people,' both in the
   confession and in the petition for atonement. Then the high-priest
   killed the bullock, caught up his blood in a vessel, and gave it to an
   attendant to keep it stirring, lest it should coagulate. Advancing to
   the altar of burnt-offering, he next filled the censer with burning
   coals, and then ranged a handful of frankincense in the dish destined
   to hold it. Ordinarily, everything brought in actual ministry unto God
   must be carried in the right hand--hence the incense in the right and
   the censer in the left. But on this occasion, as the censer for the Day
   of Atonement was larger and heavier than usual, the high-priest was
   allowed to reverse the common order. Every eye was strained towards the
   sanctuary as, slowly bearing the censer and the incense, the figure of
   the white-robed high-priest was seen to disappear within the Holy
   Place. After that nothing further could be seen of his movements.

    The Mercy-seat

   The curtain of the Most Holy Place was folded back, and the high-priest
   stood alone and separated from all the people in the awful gloom of the
   Holiest of All, only lit up by the red glow of the coals in the
   priest's censer. In the first Temple the ark of God had stood there
   with the mercy-seat' over-shadowing it; above it, the visible presence
   of Jehovah in the cloud of the Shechinah, and on either side the
   outspread wings of the cherubim; and the high-priest had placed the
   censer between the staves of the ark. But in the Temple of Herod there
   was neither Shechinah nor ark--all was empty; and the high-priest
   rested his censer on a large stone, called the foundation-stone.' He
   now most carefully emptied the incense into his hand, and threw it on
   the coals of the censer, as far from himself as possible, and so waited
   till the smoke had filled the Most Holy Place. Then, retreating
   backwards, he prayed outside the veil as follows: [166] May it please
   Thee, O Lord our God, and the God of our fathers, that neither this day
   nor during this year any captivity come upon us. Yet, if captivity
   befall us this day or this year, let it be to a place where the law is
   cultivated. May it please Thee, O Lord our God, and the God of our
   fathers, that want come not upon us, either this day or this year. But
   if want visit us this day or this year, let it be due to the liberality
   of our charitable deeds. May it please Thee, O Lord our God, and the
   God of our fathers, that this year may be a year of cheapness, of
   fulness, of intercourse and trade; a year with abundance of rain, of
   sunshine, and of dew; one in which Thy people Israel shall not require
   assistance one from another. And listen not to the prayers of those who
   are about to set out on a journey. [167] And as to Thy people Israel,
   may no enemy exalt himself against them. May it please Thee, O Lord our
   God, and the God of our fathers, that the houses of the men of Saron
   may not become their graves.' [168] The high-priest was not to prolong
   this prayer, lest his protracted absence might fill the people with
   fears for his safety.

    The Sprinkling of the Blood

   While the incense was offering in the Most Holy Place the people
   withdrew from proximity to it, and worshipped in silence. At last the
   people saw the high-priest emerging from the sanctuary, and they knew
   that the service had been accepted. Rapidly he took from the attendant,
   who had kept it stirring, the blood of the bullock. Once more he
   entered into the Most Holy Place, and sprinkled with his finger once
   upwards, towards where the mercy-seat had been, and seven times
   downwards, counting as he did so : Once' (upwards), once and once'
   (downwards), once and twice' and so on to once and seven times,' always
   repeating the word once,' which referred to the upwards sprinkling, so
   as to prevent any mistake. Coming out from the Most Holy Place, the
   high-priest now deposited the bowl with the blood before the veil. Then
   he killed the goat set apart for Jehovah, and, entering the Most Holy
   Place a third time, sprinkled as before, once upwards and seven times
   downwards, and again deposited the bowl with the blood of the goat on a
   second golden stand before the veil. Taking up the bowl with the
   bullock's blood, he next sprinkled once upwards and seven times
   downwards towards the veil, outside the Most Holy Place, and then did
   the same with the blood of the goat. Finally, pouring the blood of the
   bullock into the bowl which contained that of the goat, and again the
   mixture of the two into that which had held the blood of the bullock,
   so as thoroughly to commingle the two, he sprinkled each of the horns
   of the altar of incense, and then, making a clear place on the altar,
   seven times the top of the altar of incense. Thus he had sprinkled
   forty-three times with the expiatory blood, taking care that his own
   dress should never be spotted with the sin-laden blood. What was left
   of the blood the high-priest poured out on the west side of the base of
   the altar of burnt-offering.

    The Cleansing Completed

   By these expiatory sprinklings the high-priest had cleansed the
   sanctuary in all its parts from the defilement of the priesthood and
   the worshippers. The Most Holy Place, the veil, the Holy Place, the
   altar of incense, and the altar of burnt-offering were now clean alike,
   so far as the priesthood and as the people were concerned; and in their
   relationship to the sanctuary both priests and worshippers were atoned
   for. So far as the law could give it, there was now again free access
   for all; or, to put it otherwise, the continuance of typical
   sacrificial communion with God was once more restored and secured. Had
   it not been for these services, it would have become impossible for
   priests and people to offer sacrifices, and so to obtain the
   forgiveness of sins, or to have fellowship with God. But the
   consciences were not yet free from a sense of personal guilt and sin.
   That remained to be done through the scape-goat.' All this seems
   clearly implied in the distinctions made in Leviticus 16:33: And he
   shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an
   atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar,
   and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people
   of the congregation.'

    The Scape-goat

   Most solemn as the services had hitherto been, the worshippers would
   chiefly think with awe of the high-priest going into the immediate
   presence of God, coming out thence alive, and securing for them by the
   blood the continuance of the Old Testament privileges of sacrifices and
   of access unto God through them. What now took place concerned them, if
   possible, even more nearly. Their own personal guilt and sins were now
   to be removed from them, and that in a symbolical rite, at one and the
   same time the most mysterious and the most significant of all. All this
   while the scape-goat,' with the scarlet-tongue,' telling of the guilt
   it was to bear, had stood looking eastwards, confronting the people,
   and waiting for the terrible load which it was to carry away unto a
   land not inhabited.' Laying both his hands on the head of this goat,
   the high-priest now confessed and pleaded: Ah, JEHOVAH! they have
   committed iniquity; they have transgressed; they have sinned--Thy
   people, the house of Israel. Oh, then, JEHOVAH! cover over (atone for),
   I entreat Thee, upon their iniquities, their transgressions, and their
   sins, which they have wickedly committed, transgressed, and sinned
   before Thee--Thy people, the house of Israel. As it is written in the
   law of Moses, Thy servant, saying: "For on that day shall it be covered
   over (atoned) for you, to make you clean from all your sins before
   JEHOVAH ye shall be cleansed."' And while the prostrate multitude
   worshipped at the name of Jehovah, the high-priest turned his face
   towards them as he uttered the last words, Ye shall be cleansed!' as if
   to declare to them the absolution and remission of their sins.

    The Goat Sent into the Wilderness

   Then a strange scene would be witnessed. The priests led the
   sin-burdened goat out through Solomon's Porch,' and, as tradition has
   it, through the eastern gate, which opened upon the Mount of Olives.
   [169]

   Here an arched bridge spanned the intervening valley, and over it they
   brought the goat to the Mount of Olives, where one, specially appointed
   for the purpose, took him in charge. Tradition enjoins that he should
   be a stranger, a non-Israelite, as if to make still more striking the
   type of Him who was delivered over by Israel unto the Gentiles!
   Scripture tells us no more of the destiny of the goat that bore upon
   him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, than that they shall
   send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness,' and that
   he shall let go the goat in the wilderness' (Lev 16:22). But tradition
   supplements this information. The distance between Jerusalem and the
   beginning of the wilderness' is computed at ninety stadia, making
   precisely ten intervals, each half a Sabbath-day's journey from the
   other. At the end of each of these intervals there was a station,
   occupied by one or more persons, detailed for the purpose, who offered
   refreshment to the man leading the goat, and then accompanied him to
   the next station. By this arrangement two results were secured: some
   trusted persons accompanied the goat all along his journey, and yet
   none of them walked more than a Sabbath-day's journey--that is, half a
   journey going and the other half returning. At last they reached the
   edge of the wilderness. Here they halted, viewing afar off, while the
   man led forward the goat, tore off half the scarlet-tongue,' and stuck
   it on a projecting cliff; then, leading the animal backwards, he pushed
   it over the projecting ledge of rock. There was a moment's pause, and
   the man, now defiled by contact with the sin-bearer, retraced his steps
   to the last of the ten stations, where he spent the rest of the day and
   the night. But the arrival of the goat in the wilderness was
   immediately telegraphed, by the waving of flags, from station to
   station, till, a few minutes after its occurrence, it was known in the
   Temple, and whispered from ear to ear, that the goat had borne upon him
   all their iniquities into a land not inhabited.'

    The Meaning of the Rite

   What then was the meaning of a rite on which such momentous issue
   depended? Everything about it seems strange and mysterious--the lot
   that designated it, and that to Azazel'; the fact, that though the
   highest of all sin-offerings, it was neither sacrificed nor its blood
   sprinkled in the Temple; and the circumstance that it really was only
   part of a sacrifice--the two goats together forming one sacrifice, one
   of them being killed, and the other let go,' there being no other
   analogous case of the kind except at the purification of a leper, when
   one bird was killed and the other dipped in its blood, and let go free.
   Thus these two sacrifices--one in the removal of what symbolically
   represented indwelling sin, the other contracted guilt--agreed in
   requiring two animals, of whom one was killed, the other let go.' This
   is not the place to discuss the various views entertained of the import
   of the scape-goat. But it is destructive of one and all of the received
   interpretations, that the sins of the people were confessed not on the
   goat which was killed, but on that which was let go in the wilderness,'
   and that it was this goat--not the other--which bore upon him all the
   iniquities' of the people. So far as the conscience was concerned, this
   goat was the real and the only sin-offering for all the iniquities of
   the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their
   sins,' for upon it the high-priest laid the sins of the people, after
   he had by the blood of the bullock and of the other goat made an end of
   reconciling the Holy Place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and
   the altar' (Lev 16:20). The blood sprinkled had effected this; but it
   had done no more, and it could do no more, for it could not make him
   that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience' (Heb
   9:9). The symbolical representation of this perfecting was by the live
   goat, which, laden with the confessed sins of the people, carried them
   away into the wilderness' to a land not inhabited.' The only meaning of
   which this seems really capable, is that though confessed guilt was
   removed from the people to the head of the goat, as the symbolical
   substitute, yet as the goat was not killed, only sent far away, into a
   land not inhabited,' so, under the Old Covenant, sin was not really
   blotted out, only put away from the people, and put aside till Christ
   came, not only to take upon Himself the burden of transgression, but to
   blot it out and to purge it away. [170]

    The Teaching of Scripture

   Thus viewed, not only the text of Leviticus 16, but the language of
   Hebrews 9 and 10, which chiefly refer to the Day of Atonement, becomes
   plain. The blood,' both of the bullock and of the goat which the
   high-priest carried once a year' within the sacred veil,' was offered
   for himself (including the priesthood) and for the errors (or rather
   ignorances) of the people.' In the language of Leviticus 16:20, it
   reconciled the Holy Place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and
   the altar,' that is, as already explained, it rendered on the part of
   priests and people the continuance of sacrificial worship possible. But
   this live scape-goat let go' in the wilderness, over which, in the
   exhaustive language of Leviticus 16:21, the high-priest had confessed
   and on which he had laid all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
   and all their transgressions in all their sins,' meant something quite
   different. It meant the inherent weakness and unprofitableness of the
   commandment'; it meant, that the law made nothing perfect, but was the
   bringing in of a better hope'; that in the covenant mercy of God guilt
   and sin were indeed removed from the people, that they were covered
   up,' and in that sense atoned for, or rather that they were both
   covered up' and removed, but that they were not really taken away and
   destroyed till Christ came; that they were only taken into a land not
   inhabited, till He should blot it out by His own blood; that the
   provision which the Old Testament made was only preparatory and
   temporary, until the time of the reformation'; and that hence real and
   true forgiveness of sins, and with it the spirit of adoption, could
   only be finally obtained after the death and resurrection of the Lamb
   of God which taketh away the sin of the world.' Thus in the fullest
   sense it was true of the fathers,' that these all . . . received not
   the promise: God having provided some better things for us, that they
   without us should not be made perfect.' For the law having a shadow of
   the good things to come,' could not make the comers thereunto perfect';
   nor yet was it possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should
   take away sins.' The live goat let go' was every year a remover of sins
   which yet were never really removed in the sense of being blotted
   out--only deposited, as it were, and reserved till He came whom God
   hath set forth as a propitiation . . . because of the passing over of
   the former sins, in the forbearance of God' (Rom 3:25). [171]

   And for this cause He is the mediatory of a new covenant, in order
   that, death having taken place for the propitiation of the
   transgressions under the first covenant, they which have been called
   may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance' (Heb 9:15).

   This is not the place for following the argument further. Once
   understood, many passages will recur which manifest how the Old
   Testament removal of sin was shown in the law itself to have been
   complete indeed, so far as the individual was concerned, but not really
   and in reference to God, till He came to Whom as the reality these
   types pointed, and Who now once at the end of the world hath been
   manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself' (Heb 9:26). And
   thus did the types themselves prove their own inadequacy and
   insufficiency, showing that they had only a shadow of the good things
   to come, and not the very image of the things themselves' (Heb 10:1).
   With this also agree the terms by which in the Old Testament atonement
   is designated as a covering up' by a substitute, and the mercy-seat as
   the place of covering over.'

    The Term la-Azazel'

   After this it is comparatively of secondary importance to discuss, so
   far as we can in these pages, the question of the meaning of the term
   la-Azazel' (Lev 16:8, 10, 26). Both the interpretation which makes it a
   designation of the goat itself (as scape-goat' in our Authorised
   Version), and that which would refer it to a certain locality in the
   wilderness, being, on many grounds, wholly untenable, two other views
   remain, one of which regards Azazel as a person, and denoting Satan;
   while the other would render the term by complete removal.' The
   insurmountable difficulties connected with the first of these notions
   lie on the surface. In reference to the second, it may be said that it
   not only does violence to Hebrew grammar, but implies that the goat
   which was to be for complete removal' was not even to be sacrificed,
   but actually let go!' Besides, what in that case could be the object of
   the first goat which was killed, and whose blood was sprinkled in the
   Most Holy Place? We may here at once state, that the later Jewish
   practice of pushing the goat over a rocky precipice was undoubtedly on
   innovation, in no wise sanctioned by the law of Moses, and not even
   introduced at the time the Septuagint translation was made, as its
   rendering of Leviticus 16:26 shows. The law simply ordained that the
   goat, once arrived in the land not inhabited,' was to be let go' free,
   and the Jewish ordinance of having it pushed over the rocks is signally
   characteristic of the Rabbinical perversion of its spiritual type. The
   word Azazel, which only occurs in Leviticus 16, is by universal consent
   derived from a root which means wholly to put aside,' or, wholly to go
   away.' Whether, therefore, we render la-Azazel' by for him who is
   wholly put aside,' that is, the sin-bearing Christ, or for being wholly
   separated,' or put wholly aside or away,' the truth is still the same,
   as pointing through the temporary and provisional removal of sin by the
   goat let go' in the land not inhabited,' to the final, real, and
   complete removal of sin by the Lord Jesus Christ, as we read it in
   Isaiah 53:6: Jehovah hath made the iniquities of us all to meet on
   Him.'

    The Carcasses Burnt Outside the City'

   While the scape-goat was being led into the wilderness, the high-priest
   proceeded to cut up the bullock and the goat with whose blood he had
   previously made atonement,' put the inwards' in a vessel which he
   committed to an attendant, and sent the carcasses to be burnt outside
   the city,' in the place where the Temple ashes were usually deposited.
   Then, according to tradition, the high-priest, still wearing the linen
   garments, [172] went into the Court of the Women,' and read the
   passages of Scripture bearing on the Day of Atonement, viz. Leviticus
   16; 23:27-32; also repeating by heart Numbers 29:7-11.

   A series of prayers accompanied this reading of the Scriptures. The
   most interesting of these supplications may be thus summed
   up:--Confession of sin with prayer for forgiveness, closing with the
   words, Praise be to Thee, O Lord, Who in Thy mercy forgivest the sins
   of Thy people Israel; prayer for the permanence of the Temple, and that
   the Divine Majesty might shine in it, closing with--'Praise be to Thee,
   O Lord, Who inhabitest Zion; prayer for the establishment and safety of
   Israel, and the continuance of a king among them, closing--'Thanks be
   to Thee, O Lord, Who hast chosen Israel; prayer for the priesthood,
   that all their doings, but especially their sacred services, might be
   acceptable unto God, and He be gracious unto them, closing
   with--'Thanks be to Thee, O Lord, Who hast sanctified the priesthood;
   and, finally (in the language of Maimonides), prayers, entreaties,
   hymns, and petitions of the high-priest's own, closing with the words:
   Give help, O Lord, to Thy people Israel, for Thy people needeth help;
   thanks be unto Thee, O Lord, Who hearest prayer.'

    The High-priest in Golden Garments

   These prayers ended, the high-priest washed his hands and feet, put off
   his linen,' and put on his golden vestments,' and once more washed
   hands and feet before proceeding to the next ministry. He now appeared
   again before the people as the Lord's anointed in the golden garments
   of the bride-chamber. Before he offered the festive burnt-offerings of
   the day, he sacrificed one kid of the goats for a sin-offering' (Num
   29:16), probably with special reference to these festive services,
   which, like everything else, required atoning blood for their
   acceptance. The flesh of this sin-offering was eaten at night by the
   priests within the sanctuary. Next, he sacrificed the burnt-offerings
   for the people and that for himself (one ram, Lev 16:3), and finally
   burned the inwards' of the expiatory offerings, whose blood had
   formerly been sprinkled in the Most Holy Place. This, properly
   speaking, finished the services of the day. But the high-priest had yet
   to offer the ordinary evening sacrifice, after which he washed his
   hands and his feet, once more put off his golden' and put on his linen
   garments,' and again washed his hands and feet. This before entering
   the Most Holy Place a fourth time on that day, [173] to fetch from it
   the censer and incense-dish which he had left there.

   On his return he washed once more hands and feet, put off his linen
   garments, which were never to be used again, put on his golden
   vestments, washed hands and feet, burnt the evening incense on the
   golden altar, lit the lamps on the candlestick for the night, washed
   his hands and feet, put on his ordinary layman's dress, and was
   escorted by the people in procession to his own house in Jerusalem. The
   evening closed with a feast.

    The Mishnah

   If this ending of the Day of Atonement seems incongruous, the Mishnah
   records (Taan. iv. 8) something yet more strange in connection with the
   day itself. It is said that on the afternoon of the 15th of Ab, when
   the collection of wood for the sanctuary was completed, and on that of
   the Day of Atonement, the maidens of Jerusalem went in white garments,
   specially lent them for the purpose, so that rich and poor might be on
   an equality, into the vineyards close to the city, where they danced
   and sung. The following fragment of one of their songs has been
   preserved: [174]


   Around in circle gay, the Hebrew maidens see;

   From them our happy youths their partners choose.

   Remember! Beauty soon its charm must lose--

   And seek to win a maid of fair degree.

   When fading grace and beauty low are laid,

   Then praise shall her who fears the Lord await;

   God does bless her handiwork--and, in the gate,

   "Her works do follow her, " it shall be said.'

    The Day of Atonement in the Modern Synagogue

   We will not here undertake the melancholy task of describing what the
   modern synagogue has made the Day of Atonement, nor how it observes the
   occasion--chiefly in view of their gloomy thoughts, that on that day
   man's fate for the year, if not his life or death, is finally fixed.
   But even the Mishnah already contains similar perverted notions of how
   the day should be kept, and what may be expected from its right
   observance (Mish. Yoma, viii). Rigorous rest and rigorous fasting are
   enjoined from sundown of one day to the appearance of the first stars
   on the next. Neither food nor drink of any kind may be tasted; a man
   may not even wash, nor anoint himself, nor put on his sandals. [175]

   The sole exception made is in favour of the sick and of children, who
   are only bound to the full fast--girls at the age of twelve years and
   one day, and boys at that of thirteen years and one day, though it is
   recommended to train them earlier to it. [176]

   In return for all this affliction' Israel may expect that death along
   with the Day of Atonement will finally blot out all sins! That is
   all--the Day of Atonement and our own death! Such are Israel's highest
   hopes of expiation! It is unspeakably saddening to follow this subject
   further through the minutiae of rabbinical ingenuity--how much exactly
   the Day of Atonement will do for a man; what proportion of his sins it
   will remit, and what merely suspend; how much is left over for
   after-chastisements, and how much for final extinction at death. The
   law knows nothing of such miserable petty misrepresentations of the
   free pardon of God. In the expiatory sacrifices of the Day of Atonement
   every kind [177] of transgression, trespass, and sin is to be removed
   from the people of God.

   Yet annually anew, and each time confessedly only provisionally, not
   really and finally, till the gracious promise (Jer 31:34) should be
   fulfilled: I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin
   no more.' Accordingly it is very marked, how in the prophetic, or it
   may be symbolical, description of Ezekiel's Temple (Eze 40-46) all
   mention of the Day of Atonement is omitted; for Christ has come an
   high-priest of good things to come,' and entered in once into the Holy
   Place,' to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself' (Heb 9:11, 12,
   26).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [159] In that case we should translate Hebrews 7:27, Who needeth not on
   each day (viz. of atonement), as those high-priests, to offer up his
   sacrifices,' etc.

   [160] According to the Jewish view, it was also the day on which Adam
   had both sinned and repented; that on which Abraham was circumcised;
   and that on which Moses returned from the mount and made atonement for
   the sin of the golden calf.

   [161] May not the sprinkling of the ashes of an heifer' in Hebrews 9:13
   refer to this? The whole section bears on the Day of Atonement.

   [162] The only interesting point here is the Scriptural argument on
   which the Sadducees based their view. They appealed to Leviticus 16:2,
   and explained the expression, I will appear in the cloud upon the
   mercy-seat,' in a rationalistic sense as applying to the cloud of
   incense, not to that of the Divine Presence, while the Pharisees
   appealed to verse 13.

   [163] In case of age or infirmity, the bath was allowed to be heated,
   either by adding warm water, or by putting hot irons into it.

   [164] The high-priest did not on that day wash in the ordinary laver,
   but in a golden vessel specially provided for the purpose.

   [165] Possibly some readers may not know that the Jews never pronounce
   the word Jehovah, but always substitute for it Lord' (printed in
   capitals in the Authorised Version). Indeed, the right pronunciation of
   the word has been lost, and is matter of dispute, all that we have in
   the Hebrew being the letters I. H. V. H.--forming the so-called
   tetragrammaton, or four-lettered word.'

   [166] We give the prayer in its simplest form from the Talmud. But we
   cannot help feeling that its form savours of later than Temple-times.
   Probably only its substance dates from those days, and each high-priest
   may have been at liberty to formulate it according to his own views.

   [167] Who might pray against the fall of rain. It must be remembered
   that the autumn rains, on which the fruitfulness of the land depended,
   were just due.

   [168] This on account of the situation of that valley, which was
   threatened either by sudden floods or by dangerous landslips.

   [169] The Talmud has it, that the foreign Jews present used to burst
   into words and deeds of impatience, that the sin-bearer' might be gone.

   [170] May there be here also a reference to the doctrine of Christ's
   descent into Hades?

   [171] We have generally adopted the rendering of Dean Alford, where the
   reader will perceive any divergence from the Authorised Version.

   [172] But this was not strictly necessary; he might in this part of the
   service have even officiated in his ordinary layman's dress.

   [173] Hebrews 9:7 states that the high-priest went once in every year,'
   that is, on one day in every year, not on one occasion during that day.

   [174] The Talmud repeatedly states the fact and gives the song.
   Nevertheless we have some doubt on the subject, though the reporter in
   the Mishnah is said to be none other than Rabbi Simeon, the son of
   Gamaliel, Paul's teacher.

   [175] Only woollen socks are to be used--the only exception is, where
   there is fear of serpents or scorpions.

   [176] Kings and brides within thirty days of their wedding are allowed
   to wash their faces; the use of a towel which has been dipped the
   previous day in water is also conceded.

   [177] For high-handed, purposed sins, the law provided no sacrifice
   (Heb 10:26), and it is even doubtful whether they are included in the
   declaration Leviticus 16:21, wide as it is. Thank God, we know that the
   blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth from all sin,' without
   exception.

Chapter 17

  Post-Mosaic Festivals

   And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
   And Jesus walked in the Temple in Solomon's Porch.'--John 10:22, 23.

    Post-Mosaic Festivals

   Besides the festivals mentioned in the Law of Moses, other festive
   seasons were also observed at the time of our Lord, to perpetuate the
   memory either of great national deliverances or of great national
   calamities. The former were popular feasts, the latter public fasts.
   Though most, if not all of them, are alluded to in the Canonical
   Scriptures, it is extremely difficult to form a clear idea of how they
   were kept in the Temple. Many of the practices connected with them, as
   described in Jewish writings, or customary at present, are of much
   later date than Temple times, or else apply rather to the festive
   observances in the various synagogues of the land than to those in the
   central sanctuary. And the reason of this is evident. Though those who
   were at leisure might like to go to Jerusalem for every feast, yet the
   vast majority of the people would, except on the great festivals,
   naturally gather in the synagogues of their towns and villages.
   Moreover, these feasts and fasts were rather national than
   typical--they commemorated a past event instead of pointing forward to
   a great and world-important fact yet to be realised. Lastly, being of
   later, and indeed, of human, not Divine institution, the authorities at
   Jerusalem did not venture to prescribe for them special rites and
   sacrifices, which, as we have seen, constituted the essence of Temple
   worship.

   Arranging these various feasts and fasts in the order of their
   institution and importance, we have:--

    The Feast of Purim

   1. The Feast of Purim, that is of lots,' or the Feast of Esther, also
   called in 2 Maccabees xv. 36 the day of Mordecai,' which was observed
   in memory of the preservation of the Jewish nation at the time of
   Esther. The name Purim' is derived from the lot' which Haman cast in
   connection with his wicked desire (Esth 3:7; 9:24). It was proposed by
   Mordecai to perpetuate the anniversary of this great deliverance on the
   14th and the 15th of Adar (about the beginning of March), and
   universally agreed to by the Jews of his time (Esth 9:17-24).
   Nevertheless, according to the Jerusalem Talmud, its general
   introduction after the return from Babylon formed a subject of grave
   doubt and deliberation among the eighty-five elders'--a number which,
   according to tradition, included upwards of thirty prophets (Jer.
   Megillah, 70 b). [178]

   Even this shows that Purim was never more than a popular festival. As
   such it was kept with great merriment and rejoicing, when friends and
   relations were wont to send presents to each other. There seems little
   doubt that this was the feast of the Jews,' to which the Saviour went
   up to Jerusalem' (John 5:1), when He healed the impotent man' at the
   Pool of Bethesda. For no other feast could have intervened between
   December (John 4:35) and the Passover (John 6:4), except that of the
   Dedication of the Temple,' and that is specially designated as such
   (John 10:22), and not simply as a feast of the Jews.'

    Ceremonies of the Feast

   So far as we can gather, the religious observances of Purim commenced
   with a fast--'the Fast of Esther'--on the 13th of Adar. But if Purim
   fell on a Sabbath or a Friday, the fast was relegated to the previous
   Thursday, as it was not lawful to fast either on a Sabbath or the day
   preceding it. But even so, there were afterwards disputes between the
   Jews in Palestine and the much larger and more influential community
   that still resided in Babylon as to this fast, which seem to throw
   doubt on its very early observance. On the evening of the 13th of Adar,
   or rather on the beginning of the 14th, the Book of Esther, or the
   Megillah (the roll,' as it is called par excellence), was publicly
   read, as also on the forenoon of the 14th day, except in ancient walled
   cities, where it was read on the 15th. In Jerusalem, therefore, it
   would be read on the evening of the 13th, and on the 15th--always
   provided the day fell not on a Sabbath, on which the Megillah was not
   allowed to be read. In the later Jewish calendar arrangements care was
   taken that the first day of Purim should fall on the first, the third,
   the fifth, or the sixth day of the week. Country people, who went into
   their market towns every week on the Monday and Thursday, were not
   required to come up again specially for Purim, and in such synagogues
   the Megillah, or at least the principal portions of it, was read on the
   previous Thursday. It was also allowed to read the Book of Esther in
   any language other than the Hebrew, if spoken by the Jews resident in
   the district, and any person, except he were deaf, an idiot or a minor,
   might perform this service. The prayers for the occasion now used in
   the synagogue, as also the practice of springing rattles and other
   noisy demonstrations of anger, contempt, and scorn, with which the name
   of Haman, where it occurs in the Megillah, is always greeted by young
   and old, are, of course, of much later date. Indeed, so far from
   prescribing any fixed form of prayer, the Mishnah (Megill. iv. 1)
   expressly leaves it an open question, to be determined according to the
   usage of a place, whether or not to accompany the reading of the
   Megillah with prayer. According to the testimony of Josephus (Antiq.
   xi. 6, 13), in his time all the Jews that are in the habitable earth'
   kept these days festivals,' and sent portions to one another.' In our
   own days, though the synagogue has prescribed for them special prayers
   and portions of Scripture, they are chiefly marked by boisterous and
   uproarious merrymaking, even beyond the limits of propriety.

    The Feast of the Dedication of the Temple

   2. The Feast of the Dedication of the Temple, Chanuchah (the
   dedication'), called in 1 Maccabees iv. 52-59 the dedication of the
   altar,' and by Josephus (Antiq. xii. 7, 7) the Feast of Lights,' was
   another popular and joyous festival. It was instituted by Judas
   Maccabeus in 164 BC, when, after the recovery of Jewish independence
   from the Syro-Grecian domination, the Temple of Jerusalem was solemnly
   purified, the old polluted altar removed, its stones put in a separate
   place on the Temple-mount, and the worship of the Lord restored. The
   feast commenced on the 25th of Chislev (December), and lasted for eight
   days. On each of them the Hallel' was sung, the people appeared
   carrying palm and other branches, and there was a grand illumination of
   the Temple and of all private houses. These three observances bear so
   striking a resemblance to what we know about the Feast of Tabernacles,
   that it is difficult to resist the impression of some intended
   connection between the two, in consequence of which the daily singing
   of the Hallel,' and the carrying of palm branches was adopted during
   the Feast of the Dedication, while the practice of Temple-illumination
   was similarly introduced into the Feast of Tabernacles. [179]

   All this becomes the more interesting, when we remember, on the one
   hand, the typical meaning of the Feast of Tabernacles, and on the other
   that the date of the Feast of the Dedication--the 25th of
   Chislev--seems to have been adopted by the ancient Church as that of
   the birth of our blessed Lord--Christmas--the Dedication of the true
   Temple, which was the body of Jesus (John 2:19).

    The Origin of this Festival

   From the hesitating language of Josephus (Antiq. xii. 7, 7), we infer
   that even in his time the real origin of the practice of illuminating
   the Temple was unknown. Tradition, indeed, has it that when in the
   restored Temple the sacred candlestick [180] was to be lit, only one
   flagon of oil, sealed with the signet of the high-priest, was found to
   feed the lamps.

   This, then, was pure oil, but the supply was barely sufficient for one
   day--when, lo, by a miracle, the oil increased, and the flagon remained
   filled for eight days, in memory of which it was ordered to illuminate
   for the same space of time the Temple and private houses. A learned
   Jewish writer, Dr. Herzfeld, suggests, that to commemorate the descent
   of fire from heaven upon the altar in the Temple of Solomon (2 Chron
   7:1), the feast of lights' was instituted when the sacred fire was
   relit on the purified altar of the second Temple. But even so the
   practice varied in its details. Either the head of a house might light
   one candle for all the members of his family, or else a candle for each
   inmate, or if very religious he would increase the number of candles
   for each individual every evening, so that if a family of ten had begun
   the first evening with ten candles they would increase them the next
   evening to twenty, and so on, till on the eighth night eighty candles
   were lit. But here also there was a difference between the schools of
   Hillel and Shammai--the former observing the practice as just
   described, the latter burning the largest number of candles the first
   evening, and so on decreasingly to the last day of the feast. On the
   Feast of the Dedication, as at Purim and New Moons, no public fast was
   to be kept, though private mourning was allowed.

   The forms of prayer at present in use by the Jews are of comparatively
   late date, and indeed the Karaites, who in many respects represent the
   more ancient traditions of Israel, do not observe the festival at all.
   But there cannot be a doubt that our blessed Lord Himself attended this
   festival at Jerusalem (John 10:22), on which occasion He told them
   plainly: I and My Father are one.' This gives it a far deeper
   significance than the rekindling of the fire on the altar, or even the
   connection of this feast with that of Tabernacles.

    The Feast of Wood-offering

   3. The Feast of Wood-offering took place on the 15th Ab (August), being
   the last of the nine occasions on which offerings of wood were brought
   for the use of the Temple. For the other eight occasions the Talmud
   names certain families as specially possessing this privilege, which
   they had probably originally received by lot' at the time of Nehemiah
   (Neh 10:34; 13:31). At any rate, the names mentioned in the Mishnah are
   exactly the same as those in the Book of Ezra (Ezra 2). But on the 15th
   of Ab, along with certain families, all the people--even proselytes,
   slaves, Nethinim, and bastards, but notably the priests and Levites,
   were allowed to bring up wood, whence also the day is called the time
   of wood for the priests.' The other eight seasons were the 20th of Elul
   (September), the 1st of Tebeth (January), the 1st of Nisan (end of
   March or April), the 20th of Thammus (save, for the family of David'),
   the 5th, the 7th, the 10th, and the 20th of Ab. It will be observed
   that five of these seasons fall in the month of Ab, probably because
   the wood was then thought to be in best condition. The Rabbinical
   explanations of this are confused and contradictory, and do not account
   for the 15th of Ab being called, as it was, the day on which the axe is
   broken,' unless it were that after that date till spring no wood might
   be felled for the altar, although what had been previously cut might be
   brought up. The 15th of the month was fixed for the feast, probably
   because at full moon the month was regarded as at its maturity.
   Tradition, of course, had its own story to account for it. According to
   one version it was Jeroboam, the wicked King of Israel, to whom so much
   evil is always traced; according to another, a Syro-Grecian
   monarch--Antiochus Epiphanes; and according to yet a third, some
   unnamed monarch who had prohibited the carrying of wood and of the
   firstfruits to Jerusalem, when certain devoted families braved the
   danger, and on that day secretly introduced wood into the Temple, in
   acknowledgment whereof the privilege was for ever afterwards conceded
   to their descendants.

    The Wood used in the Festivals

   The wood was first deposited in an outer chamber, where that which was
   worm-eaten or otherwise unfit for the altar was picked out by priests
   who were disqualified from other ministry. The rest was handed over to
   the priests who were Levitically qualified for their service, and by
   them stored in the wood chamber.' The 15th of Ab was observed as a
   popular and joyous festival. On this occasion (as on the Day of
   Atonement) the maidens went dressed in white, to dance and sing in the
   vineyards around Jerusalem, when an opportunity was offered to young
   men to select their companions for life. We may venture on a suggestion
   to account for this curious practice. According to the Talmud, the 15th
   of Ab was the day on which the prohibition was removed which prevented
   heiresses from marrying out of their own tribes. If there is any
   historical foundation for this, it would be very significant, that when
   all Israel, without any distinction of tribes or families, appeared to
   make their offerings at Jerusalem, they should be at liberty similarly
   to select their partners in life without the usual restrictions.

    Fasts/The Four Great Fasts

   4. Fasts--These may be arranged into public and private, the latter on
   occasions of personal calamity or felt need. The former alone can here
   claim our attention. Properly speaking, there was only one
   Divinely-ordained public fast, that of the Day of Atonement. But it was
   quite in accordance with the will of God, and the spirit of the Old
   Testament dispensation, that when great national calamities had
   overtaken Israel, or great national wants arose, or great national sins
   were to be confessed, a day of public fasting and humiliation should be
   proclaimed (see for example, Judg 20:26; 1 Sam 7:6; 1 Kings 21:27; 2
   Chron 20:3). To these the Jews added, during the Babylonish captivity,
   what may be called memorial-fasts, on the anniversaries of great
   national calamities. Evidently this was an unhealthy religious
   movement. What were idly bewailed as national calamities were really
   Divine judgments, caused by national sins, and should have been
   acknowledged as righteous, the people turning from their sins in true
   repentance unto God. This, if we rightly understand it, was the meaning
   of Zechariah's reply (Zech 7; 8) to those who inquired whether the
   fasts of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months, were
   to be continued after the return of the exiles from Babylon. At the
   same time, the inquiry shows, that the four great Jewish fasts, which,
   besides the Day of Atonement and the Fast of Esther, are still kept,
   were observed so early as the Babylonish captivity (Zech 8:19). The
   fast of the fourth month' took place on the 17th Thammus (about June or
   July), in memory of the taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and the
   interruption of the daily sacrifice. To this tradition adds, that it
   was also the anniversary of making the golden calf, and of Moses
   breaking the Tables of the Law. The fast of the fifth month,' on the
   9th of Ab, was kept on account of the destruction of the first (and
   afterwards of the second) Temple. It is significant that the second
   Temple (that of Herod) was destroyed on the first day of the week.
   Tradition has it, that on that day God had pronounced judgment that the
   carcasses of all who had come out of Egypt should fall in the
   wilderness, and also, that again it was fated much later to witness the
   fulfilment of Jeremiah 26:18-23, when a Roman centurion had the
   ploughshare drawn over the site of Zion and of the Temple. The fast of
   the seventh month,' on the 2nd of Tishri, is said by tradition to be in
   memory of the slaughter of Gedaliah and his associates at Mizpah (Jer
   41:1). The fast of the tenth month' was on the 10th of Tebeth, when the
   siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar commenced.

    Other Fasts

   Besides these four, the Day of Atonement, and the Fast of Esther, the
   Jewish calendar at present contains other twenty-two fast-days. But
   that is not all. It was customary to fast twice a week (Luke 18:12),
   between the Paschal week and Pentecost, and between the Feast of
   Tabernacles and that of the Dedication of the Temple. The days
   appointed for this purpose were the Monday and Thursday of every
   week--because, according to tradition, Moses went up Mount Sinai the
   second time to receive the Tables of the Law on a Thursday, and came
   down again on a Monday. On public fasts, the practice was to bring the
   ark which contained the rolls of the law from the synagogue into the
   streets, and to strew ashes upon it. The people all appeared covered
   with sackcloth and ashes. Ashes were publicly strewn on the heads of
   the elders and judges. Then one more venerable than the rest would
   address the people, his sermon being based on such admonition as this:
   My brethren, it is not said of the men of Nineveh, that God had respect
   to their sackcloth or their fasting, but that "God saw their works,
   that they turned from their evil way" (Jonah 3:10). Similarly, it is
   written in the "traditions" (of the prophets): "rend your heart, and
   not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God"' (Joel 2:13). An
   aged man, whose heart and home God had emptied,' that he might give
   himself wholly to prayer, was chosen to lead the devotions. Confession
   of sin and prayer mingled with the penitential Psalms (Psa 102; 120;
   121; 130). [181]

   In Jerusalem they gathered at the eastern gate, and seven times [182]
   as the voice of prayer ceased, they bade the priests blow!' and they
   blew with horns and their priests' trumpets.

   In other towns, they only blew horns. After prayer, the people retired
   to the cemeteries to mourn and weep. In order to be a proper fast, it
   must be continued from one sundown till after the next, when the stars
   appeared, and for about twenty-six hours the most rigid abstinence from
   all food and drink was enjoined. Most solemn as some of these
   ordinances sound, the reader of the New Testament knows how sadly all
   degenerated into mere formalism (Matt 9:14; Mark 2:18; Luke 5:33); how
   frequent fasting became mere work- and self-righteousness, instead of
   being the expression of true humiliation (Luke 18:12); and how the very
   appearance of the penitent, unwashed and with ashes on his head, was
   even made matter of boasting and religious show (Matt 6:16). So true is
   it that all attempts at penitence, amendment, and religion, without the
   Holy Spirit of God and a change of heart, only tend to entangle man in
   the snare of self-deception, to fill him with spiritual pride, and
   still further to increase his real alienation from God. [183]

   [178] The learned Jost (Gesch. d. Judenth., i. 42, note 1) suggests
   that these 85 elders' were really the commencement of the great
   synagogue,' to which so many of the Jewish ordinances were traced in
   later times. The number was afterwards, as Jost thinks, arbitrarily
   increased to 120, which is that assigned by tradition to the great
   synagogue.' The great synagogue' may be regarded as the constituent'
   Jewish authority on all questions of ritual after the return from
   Babylon. Lastly, Jost suggests that the original 85 were the
   signatories to the covenant,' named in Nehemiah 10:1-27.

   [179] In point of fact, the three are so compared in 2 Maccabees x. 6,
   and even the same name applied to them, i. 9, 18.

   [180] According to tradition, the first candlestick in that Temple was
   of iron, tinned over; the second of silver, and then only a golden one
   was procured.

   [181] Our account is based on the Mishnah (Taan. ii). But we have not
   given the Psalms in the order there mentioned, nor yet reproduced the
   prayers and benedictions,' because they seem mostly, if not entirely,
   to be of later date. In general, each of the latter bases the hope of
   being heard on some Scriptural example of deliverance in answer to
   prayer, such as that of Abraham on Mount Moriah, of Israel when passing
   through the Red Sea, of Joshua at Gilgal, of Samuel at Mizpah, of
   Elijah on Mount Carmel, of Jonah in the whale's belly, and of David and
   Solomon in Jerusalem. Certain relaxations of the fast were allowed to
   the priests when actually on their ministry.

   [182] See the very interesting description of details in Taan. ii. 5.

   [183] Of the three sects or schools the Pharisees were here the
   strictest, being in this also at the opposite pole from the Sadducees.
   The fasts of the Essenes were indeed even more stringent, and almost
   constant, but they were intended not to procure merit, but to set the
   soul free from the bondage of the body, which was regarded as the seat
   of all sin. Besides the above-mentioned fast, and one of all the
   firstborn on the eve of every Passover, such of the men of the station'
   as went not up to Jerusalem with their company fasted on the Monday,
   Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, in their respective synagogues, and
   prayed for a blessing on their brethren and on the people. They
   connected their fasts and prayers with the section in Genesis 1, which
   they read on those days--praying on the Monday (Gen 1:9) for those at
   sea; on the Tuesday (v 11, 12) for all on a journey; on the Wednesday
   (v 14) on account of the supposed dangerous influence of sun and moon,
   against diseases of children; and on the Thursday (v 20) for women
   labouring with child and for infants. Further particulars would lead us
   from a description of the Temple-services to those of the synagogue.
   But it is interesting to note how closely the Roman Church has adopted
   the practices of the synagogue. In imitation of the four Jewish fasts
   mentioned in Zechariah 8:19, the year was divided into four
   seasons--Quatember--each marked by a fast--three of these being traced
   by tradition to Bishop Callistus (223), and the fourth to Pope Leo I
   (44). In 1095, Urban II fixed these four fasts on the Wednesdays after
   Ash-Wednesday, Whit-Sunday, the Exaltation of the Cross, and the Feast
   of S. Lucia (13th December). The early Church substituted for the two
   weekly Jewish fast-days--Monday and Thursday--the so-called dies
   stationum,' guard or watch-days' of the Christian soldier, or Christian
   fast-days--Wednesday and Friday, on which the Saviour had been
   respectively betrayed and crucified.

Chapter 18

  On Purifications

    The Burning of the Red Heifer
    The Cleansing of the Healed Leper
    The Trial of the Woman Suspected of Adultery

   And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, show
   thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a
   testimony unto them.'--Matthew 8:4.

   Festive seasons were not the only occasions which brought worshippers
   to Jerusalem. Every trespass and sin, every special vow and offering,
   and every defilement called them to the Temple. All the rites then
   enjoined are full of deep meaning. Selecting from them those on which
   the practice of the Jews at the time of Christ casts a special light,
   our attention is first called to a service, distinguished from the rest
   by its unique character.

    The Red Heifer

   1. The purification from the defilement of death by the ashes of the
   red heifer (Num 19). In the worship of the Old Testament, where
   everything was symbolical, that is, where spiritual realities were
   conveyed through outwards signs, every physical defilement would point
   to, and carry with it, as it were, a spiritual counterpart. But
   especially was this the case with reference to birth and death, which
   were so closely connected with sin and the second death, with
   redemption and the second birth. Hence, all connected with the origin
   of life and with death, implied defilement, and required Levitical
   purification. But here there was considerable difference. Passing over
   the minor defilements attaching to what is connected with the origin of
   life, the woman who had given birth to a child was Levitically unclean
   for forty or for eighty days, according as she had become the mother of
   a son or a daughter (Lev 12). After that she was to offer for her
   purification a lamb for a burnt-, and a turtle-dove, or young pigeon,
   for a sin-offering; in case of poverty, altogether only two
   turtle-doves or two young pigeons. We remember that the mother of Jesus
   availed herself of that provision for the poor, when at the same time
   she presented in the Temple the Royal Babe, her firstborn son (Luke
   2:22).

    The Offering for the First-born

   On bringing her offering, she would enter the Temple through the gate
   of the first-born,' and stand in waiting at the Gate of Nicanor, from
   the time that the incense was kindled on the golden altar. Behind her,
   in the Court of the Women, was the crowd of worshippers, while she
   herself, at the top of the Levites' steps, which led up to the great
   court, would witness all that passed in the sanctuary. At last one of
   the officiating priests would come to her at the gate of Nicanor, and
   take from her hand the poor's offering' (so it is literally called in
   the Talmud), which she had brought. The morning sacrifice was needed;
   and but few would linger behind while the offering for her purification
   was actually made. She who brought it mingled prayer and thanksgiving
   with the service. And now the priest once more approached her, and,
   sprinkling her with the sacrificial blood, declared her cleansed. Her
   first-born' was next redeemed at the hand of the priest, with five
   shekels of silver; [184] two benedictions being at the same time
   pronounced, one for the happy event which had enriched the family with
   a first-born, the other for the law of redemption.

   And when, with grateful heart, and solemnised in spirit, she descended
   those fifteen steps where the Levites were wont to sing the Hallel,' a
   sudden light of heavenly joy filled the heart of one who had long been
   in waiting for the consolation of Israel.' If the Holy Spirit had
   revealed it to just and devout Simeon, that he should not see death
   before he had seen the Lord's Christ,' who should vanquish death, it
   was the same Spirit, who had led him up into the Temple when the
   parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for Him after the custom of
   the law.' Then the aged believer took the Divine Babe from His mother's
   into his own arms. He felt that the faithful Lord had truly fulfilled
   His word. Content now to depart in peace, he blessed God from the
   fulness of a grateful heart, for his eyes had seen His salvation--'a
   light to lighten the Gentiles,' and the glory of His people Israel.'
   But Joseph and Mary listened, wondering, to the words which fell from
   Simeon's lips.

    Purification for the Dead

   Such was the service of purification connected with the origin of life.
   Yet it was not nearly so solemn or important as that for the removal of
   defilement from contact with death. A stain attached indeed to the
   spring of life; but death, which cast its icy shadow from the gates of
   Paradise to those of Hades, pointed to the second death, under whose
   ban every one lay, and which, if unremoved, would exercise eternal
   sway. Hence defilement by the dead was symbolically treated as the
   greatest of all. It lasted seven days; it required a special kind of
   purification; and it extended not only to those who had touched the
   dead, but even to the house or tent where the body had lain, and all
   open vessels therein. More than that, to enter such a house; to come
   into contact with the smallest bone, or with a grave; [185] even to
   partake of a feast for the dead (Hosea 9:4), rendered ceremonially
   unclean for seven days (Num 19:11-16, 18; 31:19).

   Nay, he who was thus defiled in turn rendered everything unclean which
   he touched (Num 19:22; comp. Hagg 2:13). For priests and Nazarites the
   law was even more stringent (Lev 21, etc; comp. Eze 44:25, etc.; Num
   6:7, etc.). The former were not to defile themselves by touching any
   dead body, except those of their nearest kin; the high-priest was not
   to approach even those of his own parents.

    The Six Degrees of Defilement

   In general, Jewish writers distinguish six degrees, which they
   respectively term, according to their intensity, the fathers of
   fathers,' the fathers,' and the first,' second,' third,' and fourth
   children of defilement.' They enumerate in all twenty-nine fathers of
   defilement,' arising from various causes, and of these no less than
   eleven arise from some contact with a dead body. Hence also the law
   made here exceptional provision for purification. A red heifer without
   spot,' that is, without any white or black hair on its hide, without
   blemish, and on which never yoke came,' was to be sacrificed as a
   sin-offering (Num 19:9, 17), and that outside the camp, not in the
   sanctuary, and by the son of, or by the presumptive successor to the
   high-priest. The blood of this sacrifice was to be sprinkled seven
   times with the finger, not on the altar, but towards the sanctuary;
   then the whole animal--skin, flesh, blood, and dung--burned, the priest
   casting into the midst of the burning cedarwood, and hyssop, and
   scarlet.' The ashes of this sacrifice were to be gathered by a man that
   is clean,' and laid up without the camp in a clean place.' But the
   priest, he that burned the red heifer, and who gathered her ashes, were
   to be unclean until the even,' to wash their clothes, and the two
   former also to bathe,' their flesh in water' (Num 19:7, 8). When
   required for purification, a clean person was to take of those ashes,
   put them in a vessel, pour upon them living water,' then dip hyssop in
   it, and on the third and seventh days sprinkle him who was to be
   purified; after which he had to wash his clothes and bathe his flesh,
   when he became clean' on the evening of the seventh day. The tent or
   house, and all the vessels in it, were to be similarly purified.
   Lastly, he that touched the water of separation,' of avoidance,' or of
   uncleanness,' was to be unclean until even, and he that sprinkled it to
   wash his clothes (Num 19:21).

    Death the Greatest Defilement

   From all these provisions it is evident that as death carried with it
   the greatest defilement, so the sin-offering for its purification was
   in itself and in its consequences the most marked. And its application
   must have been so frequently necessary in every family and circle of
   acquaintances that the great truths connected with it were constantly
   kept in view of the people. In general, it may here be stated, that the
   laws in regard to defilement were primarily intended as symbols of
   spiritual truths, and not for social, nor yet sanitary purposes, though
   such results would also flow from them. Sin had rendered fellowship
   with God impossible; sin was death, and had wrought death, and the dead
   body as well as the spiritually dead soul were the evidence of its
   sway.

    Levitical Defilement Traceable to Death

   It has been well pointed out (by Sommers, in his Bibl. Abh. vol. i. p.
   201, etc.), that all classes of Levitical defilement can ultimately be
   traced back to death, with its two great outward symptoms, the
   corruption which appears in the skin on the surface of the body, and to
   which leprosy may be regarded as akin, and the fluxes from the dead
   body, which have their counterpart in the morbid fluxes of the living
   body. As the direct manifestation of sin which separates man from God,
   defilement by the dead required a sin-offering, and the ashes of the
   red heifer are expressly so designated in the words: It is a
   sin-offering' (Num 9:17). [186]

   But it differs from all other sin-offerings. The sacrifice was to be of
   pure red colour; one upon which never came yoke'; [187] and a female,
   all other sin-offerings for the congregation being males (Lev 4:14).

   These particulars symbolically point to life in its freshness, fulness,
   and fruitfulness--that is, the fullest life and the spring of life. But
   what distinguished it even more from all others was, that it was a
   sacrifice offered once for all (at least so long as its ashes lasted);
   that its blood was sprinkled, not on the altar, but outside the camp
   towards the sanctuary; and that it was wholly burnt, along with
   cedarwood, as the symbol of imperishable existence, hyssop, as that of
   purification from corruption, and scarlet,' which from its colour was
   the emblem of life. Thus the sacrifice of highest life, brought as a
   sin-offering, and, so far as possible, once for all, was in its turn
   accompanied by the symbols of imperishable existence, freedom from
   corruption, and fulness of life, so as yet more to intensify its
   significance. But even this is not all. The gathered ashes with running
   water were sprinkled on the third and seventh days on that which was to
   be purified. Assuredly, if death meant the wages of sin,' this
   purification pointed, in all its details, to the gift of God,' which is
   eternal life,' through the sacrifice of Him in whom is the fulness of
   life.

    The Scape-goat, the Red Heifer, and the Living Bird Dipped in Blood

   And here there is a remarkable analogy between three sacrifices, which,
   indeed, form a separate group. The scape-goat, which was to remove the
   personal guilt of the Israelites--not their theocratic alienation from
   the sanctuary; the red heifer, which was to take away the defilement of
   death, as that which stood between God and man; and the living bird,'
   dipped in the water and the blood,' and then let loose in the field' at
   the purification from leprosy, which symbolised the living death of
   personal sinfulness, were all, either wholly offered, or in their
   essentials completed outside the sanctuary. In other words, the Old
   Testament dispensation had confessedly within its sanctuary no real
   provision for the spiritual wants to which they symbolically pointed;
   their removal lay outside its sanctuary and beyond its symbols.
   Spiritual death, as the consequence of the fall, personal sinfulness,
   and personal guilt lay beyond the reach of the Temple-provision, and
   pointed directly to Him who was to come. Every death, every case of
   leprosy, every Day of Atonement, was a call for His advent, as the eye,
   enlightened by faith, would follow the goat into the wilderness, or
   watch the living bird as, bearing the mingled blood and water, he
   winged his flight into liberty, or read in the ashes sprung from the
   burning of the red heifer the emblem of purification from spiritual
   death. Hence, also, the manifest internal connection between these
   rites. In the sacrifices of the Day of Atonement and of the purified
   leper, the offering was twofold, one being slain, the other sent away
   alive, while the purification from leprosy and from death had also many
   traits in common.

    These Sacrifices Defiled Those Who Took Part In Them

   Lastly, all these sacrifices equally defiled those who took part in
   their offering, [188] except in the case of leprosy, where the
   application would necessarily only be personal.

   Thus, also, we understand why the red heifer as, so to speak, the most
   intense of sin-offerings, was wholly burnt outside the camp, and other
   sin-offerings only partially so (Lev 4:11, 12, 20, etc.) For this
   burning signified that in the theocracy there was no one, who by his
   own holiness, could bear or take away the sin imputed to these
   sin-offerings, so that it was needful, as the wages of sin, to burn the
   sacrifice which had been made sin' (Keil, Bibl. Archaeol. vol. i. p.
   283). The ashes of this sin-offering, mixed with living water and
   sprinkled with hyssop, symbolised purification from that death which
   separates between God and man. This parallelism between the blood of
   Christ and the ashes of an heifer, on the one hand, and on the other
   between the purification of the flesh by these means, and that of the
   conscience from dead works, is thus expressed in Hebrews 9:13, 14: If
   the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling
   the defiled, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how much more
   shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered
   Himself without spot to God, purify your conscience from dead works to
   serve the living God?' And that this spiritual meaning of the types was
   clearly apprehended under the Old Testament appears, for example, from
   the reference to it in this prayer of David (Psa 51:7): Purge me from
   sin [189] (purify me) with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
   shall be whiter than snow'; which is again further applied in what the
   prophet Isaiah says about the forgiveness of sin (Isa 1:18).

    Significance of the Red Heifer

   This is not the place more fully to vindicate the views here
   propounded. Without some deeper symbolical meaning attaching to them,
   the peculiarities of the sin-offering of the red heifer would indeed be
   well-nigh unintelligible. This must be substantially the purport of a
   Jewish tradition to the effect that King Solomon, who knew the meaning
   of all God's ordinances, was unable to understand that of the red
   heifer. A Haggadah' maintains that the wisest of men had in
   Ecclesiastes 7:23 thus described his experience in this respect: All
   this have I proved by wisdom,' that is, all other matters; I said, I
   will be wise,' that is, in reference to the meaning of the red heifer;
   but it was far from me.' But if Jewish traditionalism was thus
   conscious of its spiritual ignorance in regard to this type, it was
   none the less zealous in prescribing, with even more than usual
   precision, its ceremonial. The first object was to obtain a proper red
   heifer' for the sacrifice. The Mishnah (Parah, i. ii.) states the
   needful age of such a red heifer as from two to four, and even five
   years; the colour of its hide, two white or black hairs springing from
   the same follicle disqualifying it; and how, if she have been put to
   any use, though only a cloth had been laid on her, she would no longer
   answer the requirement that upon her never came yoke.'

    The Sacrifice of the Red Heifer

   Even more particular are the Rabbis to secure that the sacrifice be
   properly offered (Parah, iii. iv.). Seven days before, the priest
   destined for the service was separated and kept in the Temple--in the
   House of Stoves'--where he was daily sprinkled with the ashes--as the
   Rabbis fable--of all the red heifers ever offered. When bringing the
   sacrifice, he was to wear his white priestly raiments. According to
   their tradition, there was an arched roadway leading from the east gate
   of the Temple out upon the Mount of Olives--double arched, that is,
   arched also over the supporting pillars, for fear of any possible
   pollution through the ground upwards. Over this the procession passed.
   On the Mount of Olives the elders of Israel were already in waiting.
   First, the priest immersed his whole body, then he approached the pile
   of cedar-, pine-, and fig-wood which was heaped like a pyramid, but
   having an opening in the middle, looking towards the west. Into this
   the red heifer was thrust, and bound, with its head towards the south
   and its face looking to the west, the priest standing east of the
   sacrifice, his face, of course, also turned westwards. Slaying the
   sacrifice with his right hand, he caught up the blood in his left.
   Seven times he dipped his finger in it, sprinkling it towards the Most
   Holy Place, which he was supposed to have in full view over the Porch
   of Solomon or through the eastern gate. Then, immediately descending,
   he kindled the fire. As soon as the flames burst forth, the priest,
   standing outside the pit in which the pile was built up, took
   cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet' wool, asking three times as he held up
   each: Is this cedarwood? Is this hyssop? Is this scarlet?' so as to
   call to the memory of every one the Divine ordinance. Then tying them
   together with the scarlet wool, he threw the bundle upon the burning
   heifer. The burnt remains were beaten into ashes by sticks or stone
   mallets and passed through coarse sieves; then divided into three
   parts--one of which was kept in the Temple-terrace (the Chel), the
   other on the Mount of Olives, and the third distributed among the
   priesthood throughout the land.

    Children Used in the Offering

   The next care was to find one to whom no suspicion of possible
   defilement could attach, who might administer purification to such as
   needed it. For this purpose a priest was not required; but any
   one--even a child--was fit for the service. In point of fact, according
   to Jewish tradition, children were exclusively employed in this
   ministry. If we are to believe the Mishnah (Parah, iii. 2-5), there
   were at Jerusalem certain dwellings built upon rocks, that were
   hollowed beneath, so as to render impossible pollution from unknown
   graves beneath. Here the children destined for this ministry were to be
   born, and here they were reared and kept till fit for their service.
   Peculiar precautions were adopted in leading them out to their work.
   The child was to ride on a bullock, and to mount and descend it by
   boards. He was first to proceed to the Pool of Siloam, [190] and to
   fill a stone cup with its water, and thence to ride to the Temple
   Mount, which, with all its courts, was also supposed to be free from
   possible pollutions by being hollowed beneath.

   Dismounting, he would approach the Beautiful Gate,' where the vessel
   with the ashes of the red heifer was kept. Next a goat would be brought
   out, and a rope, with a stick attached to it, tied between its horns.
   The stick was put into the vessel with the ashes, the goat driven
   backwards, and of the ashes thereby spilt the child would take for use
   in the sacred service so much as to be visible upon the water. It is
   only fair to add, that one of the Mishnic sages, deprecating a
   statement which might be turned into ridicule by the Sadducees,
   declares that any clean person might take with his hand from the vessel
   so much of the ashes as was required for the service. The purification
   was made by sprinkling with hyssop. According to the Rabbis (Parah, xi.
   9), three separate stalks, each with a blossom on it, were tied
   together, and the tip of these blossoms dipped into the water of
   separation, the hyssop itself being grasped while sprinkling the
   unclean. The same authorities make the most incredible assertion that
   altogether, from the time of Moses to the final destruction of the
   Temple, only seven, or else nine, such red heifers had been offered:
   the first by Moses, the second by Ezra, and the other five, or else
   seven, between the time of Ezra and that of the taking of Jerusalem by
   the Romans. We only add that the cost of this sacrifice, which was
   always great, since a pure red heifer was very rare, [191] was defrayed
   from the Temple treasury, as being offered for the whole people. [192]

   Those who lived in the country would, for purification from defilement
   by the dead, come up to Jerusalem seven days before the great
   festivals, and, as part of the ashes were distributed among the
   priesthood, there could never be any difficulty in purifying houses or
   vessels.

    Purification of the Leper

   2. After what has already been explained, it is not necessary to enter
   into details about the purification of the leper, for which this,
   indeed, is not the place. Leprosy was not merely the emblem of sin, but
   of death, to which, so to speak, it stood related, as does our actual
   sinfulness to our state of sin and death before God. Even a Rabbinical
   saying ranks lepers with those who may be regarded as dead. [193]

   They were excluded from the camp of Israel,' by which, in later times,
   the Talmudists understood all cities walled since the days of Joshua,
   who was supposed to have sanctified them. Lepers were not allowed to go
   beyond their proper bounds, on pain of forty stripes. For every place
   which a leper entered was supposed to be defiled. They were, however,
   admitted to the synagogues, where a place was railed off for them, ten
   handbreadths high and four cubits wide, on condition of their entering
   the house of worship before the rest of the congregation, and leaving
   it after them (Negaim, xiii. 12). It was but natural that they should
   consort together. This is borne out by such passages as Luke 17:12,
   which at the same time show how even this living death vanished at the
   word or the touch of the Saviour.

    Examination of the Leper

   The Mishnic tractate, Negaim, enters into most wearisome details on the
   subject of leprosy, as affecting persons or things. It closes by
   describing the ceremonial at its purification. The actual judgment as
   to the existence of leprosy always belonged to the priest, though he
   might consult any one who had knowledge of the matter. Care was to be
   taken that no part of the examination fell on the Sabbath, nor was any
   on whom the taint appeared to be disturbed either during his marriage
   week, or on feast days. Great precautions were taken to render the
   examination thorough. It was not to be proceeded with early in the
   morning, nor between the evenings,' nor inside the house, nor on a
   cloudy day, nor yet during the glare of midday, but from 9 a.m. to 12
   o'clock noon, and from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.; according to Rabbi Jehudah,
   only at 10 or 11 o'clock a.m., and at 2 and 3 o'clock p.m. The
   examining priest must neither be blind of an eye, nor impaired in
   sight, nor might he pronounce as to the leprosy of his own kindred. For
   further caution, judgment was not to be pronounced at the same time
   about two suspicious spots, whether on the same or on different
   persons.

    Right Meaning of Leviticus 13:12, 13

   A very curious mistake by writers on typology here requires passing
   notice. It is commonly supposed [194] that Leviticus 13:12, 13 refers
   to cases of true leprosy, so that if a person had presented himself
   covered with leprosy over all his flesh,' from his head even to his
   foot, wheresoever the priest looketh,' the priest was to pronounce: He
   is clean.'

   If this interpretation were correct, the priest would have had to
   declare what was simply untrue! And, mark, it is not a question about
   cleansing one who had been a leper, but about declaring such an one
   clean, that is, not a leper at all, while yet the malady covered his
   whole body from head to foot! Nor does even the doctrinal analogy, for
   the sake of which this strange view must have been adopted, hold good.
   For to confess oneself, or even to present oneself as wholly covered by
   the leprosy of sin, is not yet to be cleansed--that requires
   purification by the blood of Christ. Moreover, the Old Testament type
   speaks of being clean, not of cleansing; of being non-leprous, not of
   being purified from leprosy! The correct interpretation of Leviticus
   13:12, 13 evidently is, that an eruption having the symptoms there
   described is not that of true leprosy at all. [195]

   But where, in the Divine mercy, one really leprous had been restored,
   the law (Lev 14) defined what was to be done for his purification.' The
   rites are, in fact, twofold--the first (Lev 14:1-9), to restore him to
   fellowship with the congregation; the other to introduce him anew to
   communion with God (Lev 14:10-20). In both respects he had been dead,
   and was alive again; and the new life, so consecrated, was one higher
   than the old could ever have been.

    The Mishnah

   This will appear from an attentive study of the ceremonial of
   purification, as described in the Mishnah (Negaim, xiii.). The priest
   having pronounced the former leper clean, a quarter of a log (the log
   rather less than a pint) of living water' was poured into an
   earthenware dish. Then two clean birds' were taken--the Rabbis say two
   sparrows [196] --of whom one was killed over the living water,' so that
   the blood might drop into it, after which the carcass was buried.

   Next, cedar-wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool were taken and tied together
   (as at the burning of the red heifer), and dipped, along with the
   living bird, which was seized by the tips of his wings and of his tail,
   into the blood-stained water, when the person to be purified was
   sprinkled seven times on the back of his hand, or, according to others,
   on his forehead. Upon this the living bird was set free, neither
   towards the sea, nor towards the city, nor towards the wilderness, but
   towards the fields. Finally, the leper had all the hair on his body
   shorn with a razor, after which he washed his clothes, and bathed, when
   he was clean, though still interdicted his house [197] for seven days.

    The Second Stage

   The first stage of purification had now been completed, and the seven
   days' seclusion served as preparation for the second stage. The former
   might take place anywhere, but the latter required the attendance of
   the purified leper in the sanctuary. It began on the seventh day
   itself, when the purified leper had again all his hair shorn, as at the
   first, washed his clothes, and bathed. The Mishnah remarks (Negaim,
   xiv. 4) that three classes required this legal tonsure of all
   hair--lepers, Nazarites, and the Levites at their consecration--a
   parallel this between the purified lepers and the Levites, which
   appears even more clearly in their being anointed on the head with oil
   (Lev 14:29), and which was intended to mark that their new life was
   higher than the old, and that, like Levi, they were to be specially
   dedicated to God. [198]

   Though not of any special importance, we may add that, according to the
   Mishnah, as in the analogous case of the two goats for the Day of
   Atonement, the two birds for the leper were to be of precisely the same
   colour, size, and value, and, if possible, bought on the same day--to
   mark that the two formed integral parts of one and the same service;
   the cedar-wood was to be one cubit long and the quarter of a bedpost'
   thick; the hyssop of the common kind, that is, not such as had any
   other bye-name, as Grecian, Roman, ornamental, or wild; while the
   scarlet wool was to be a shekel's weight. The rest of the ceremonial we
   give in the words of the Mishnah itself (Negaim, xiv. 7, etc.):--'On
   the eighth day the leper brings three sacrifices--a sin-, a trespass-,
   and a burnt-offering, and the poor brings a sin- and a burnt-offering
   of a bird. He stands before the trespass-offering, lays his hands upon
   it, and kills it. Two priests catch up the blood--one in a vessel, the
   other in his hand. He who catches it up in the vessel goes and throws
   it on the side of the altar, and he who catches it in his hand goes and
   stands before the leper. And the leper, who had previously bathed in
   the court of the lepers, goes and stands in the gate of Nicanor. Rabbi
   Jehudah says:--He needs not to bathe. He thrusts in his head (viz. into
   the great court which he may not yet enter), and the priest puts of the
   blood upon the tip of his ear; he thrusts in his hand, and he puts it
   upon the thumb of his hand; he thrusts in his foot, and he puts it upon
   the great toe of his foot. Rabbi Jehudah says:--He thrusts in the three
   at the same time. If he have lost his thumb, great toe, or right ear,
   he cannot ever be cleansed. Rabbi Eliezer says:--The priest puts in on
   the spot where it had been. Rabbi Simeon says:--If it be applied on the
   corresponding left side of the leper's body, it sufficeth. The priest
   now takes from the log of oil and pours it into the palm of his
   colleague--though if he poured it into his own it were valid. He dips
   his finger and sprinkles seven times towards the Holy of Holies,
   dipping each time he sprinkles. He goes before the leper; and on the
   spot where he had put the blood he puts the oil, as it is written,
   "upon the blood of the trespass-offering." And the remnant of the oil
   that is in the priest's hand, he pours on the head of him that is to be
   cleansed, for an atonement; if he so puts it, he is atoned for, but if
   not, he is not atoned for. So Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Jochanan, the son of
   Nuri, saith:--This is only the remnant of the ordinance--whether it is
   done or not, the atonement is made; but they impute it to him (the
   priest?) as if he had not made atonement.'

    Purification from Suspicion of Adultery

   3. It still remains to describe the peculiar ceremonial connected with
   the purification of a wife from the suspicion of adultery. Strictly
   speaking, there was no real offering connected with this. The rites
   (Num 5:11-31) consisted of two parts, in the first of which the woman
   in her wave-offering solemnly commended her ways to the Holy Lord God
   of Israel, thus professing innocence: while in the second, she
   intimated her readiness to abide the consequences of her profession and
   appeal to God. Both acts were symbolical, nor did either of them imply
   anything like an ordeal. The meat-offering which she brought in her
   hand symbolised her works, the fruit of her life. But owing to the fact
   that her life was open to suspicion, it was brought, not of wheat, as
   on other occasions, but of barley-flour, which constituted the poorest
   fare, while, for the same reason, the customary addition of oil and
   frankincense was omitted. Before this offering was waved and part of it
   burned on the altar, the priest had to warn the woman of the terrible
   consequences of a false profession before the Lord, and to exhibit what
   he spoke in a symbolical act. He wrote the words of the curse upon a
   roll; then, taking water out of the laver, in which the daily
   impurities of the priests were, so to speak, symbolically cleansed, and
   putting into it dust of the sanctuary, he washed in this mixture the
   writing of the curses, which were denounced upon the special sin of
   which she was suspected. And the woman, having by a repeated Amen
   testified that she had quite apprehended the meaning of the whole, and
   that she made her solemn appeal to God, was then in a symbolical act to
   do two things. First, she presented in her meat-offering, which the
   priest waved, her life to the heart-searching God, and then, prepared
   for the consequences of her appeal, she drank the bitter mixture of the
   threatened curses, assured that it could do no harm to her who was
   innocent, whereas, if guilty, she had appealed to God, judgment would
   certainly at some time overtake her, and that in a manner corresponding
   to the sin which she had committed.

    Regulations as Given in the Mishnah

   According to the Mishnah, which devotes to this subject a special
   tractate (Sotah), a wife could not be brought to this solemn trial
   unless her husband have previously warned her, in presence of two
   witnesses, against intercourse with one whom he suspected, and also two
   witnesses had reported that she had contravened his injunction. The
   Rabbis, moreover, insist that the command must have been express, that
   it only applied to intercourse out of reach of public view, and that
   the husband's charge to his wife before witnesses should be preceded by
   private and loving admonition. [199]

   But if, after all this, she had left such warning unheeded, her husband
   had first to bring her before the Sanhedrim of his own place, who would
   dispatch two of their scholars with the couple to Jerusalem, where they
   were to appear before the Great Sanhedrim. The first endeavour of that
   tribunal was to bring the accused by any means to make confession. If
   she did so, she only lost what her husband had settled upon her, but
   retaind her own portion. [200]

   If she persisted in her innocence, she was brought through the eastern
   gate of the Temple, and placed at the gate of Nicanor, where the priest
   tore off her dress to her bosom, and dishevelled her hair. If she wore
   a white dress, she was covered with black; if she had ornaments, they
   were taken from her, and a rope put round her neck. Thus she stood,
   exposed to the gaze of all, except her own parents. all this to
   symbolise the Scriptural warning (Isa 65:7): Therefore I will measure
   their former work into their bosom'; for in what had been her pride and
   her temptation she was now exposed to shame. The priest was to write,
   in ink, Numbers 5:19-22, of course leaving out the introductory clauses
   in verses 19 and 21, and the concluding Amen.' The woman's double
   response of Amen bore reference first to her innocence, and secondly to
   the threatened curse.

   The waving of the woman's offering was done in the usual manner, but
   opinions differ whether she had to drink the bitter water' before or
   after part of her offering had been burned on the altar. If before the
   writing was washed into the water she refused to take the test, her
   offering was scattered among the ashes; similarly, if she confessed
   herself guilty. But if she insisted on her innocence after the writing
   was washed, she was forced to drink the water. The Divine judgment was
   supposed to overtake the guilty sooner or later, as some thought,
   according to their other works. The wave-offering belonged to the
   priest, except where the suspected woman was the wife of a priest, in
   which case the offering was burned. If a husband were deaf or insane,
   or in prison, the magistrates of the place would act in his stead in
   insisting on a woman clearing herself of just suspicion. An adulteress
   was prohibited from living with her seducer. It is beside our purpose
   further to enter into the various legal determinations of the Mishnah.
   But it is stated that, with the decline of morals in Palestine, the
   trial by the water of jealousy' gradually ceased (in accordance with
   what we read in Hosea 4:14), till it was finally abolished by Rabbi
   Jochanan, the son of Zacchai, some time after the death of our Lord.
   While recording this fact the Mishnah (Sotah, ix. 9-15) traces, in
   bitter language, the decay and loss of what had been good and precious
   to Israel in their worship, Temple, wisdom, and virtues, pointing
   forward to the yet greater sorrow of the last day,' shortly before the
   coming of Messiah,' when all authority, obedience, and fear of God
   would decline in the earth, and our only hope and trust' could spring
   from looking up to our Heavenly Father. Yet beyond it stands out, in
   the closing words of this tractate in the Mishnah, the final hope of a
   revival, of the gift of the Holy Spirit, and of the blessed
   resurrection, all connected with the long-expected ministry of Elijah!

   [184] According to the Mishnah (Beehor. viii. 7) of Tyrian weight' = 10
   to 12 shillings of our money. The Rabbis lay it down that
   redemption-money was only paid for a son who was the first-born of his
   mother, and who was suitable for the priesthood,' that is, had no
   disqualifying bodily blemishes.

   [185] According to Jewish tradition, a dead body, however deeply
   buried, communicated defilement all the way up to the surface, unless
   indeed it were vaulted in, or vaulted over, to cut off contact with the
   earth above.

   [186] The Authorised Version translates, without any reason: It is a
   purification for sin.'

   [187] The only other instance in which this is enjoined is Deuteronomy
   21:3, though we read of it again in 1 Samuel 6:7.

   [188] Hence the high-priest was prohibited from offering the red
   heifer.

   [189] The Hebrew (Piel) form for purge from sin' has no English
   equivalent, unless we were to coin the word unsin' or unguilt'
   me--remove my sin.

   [190] Or Gihon. According to Jewish tradition, the kings were always
   anointed at Siloam (1 Kings 1:33, 38).

   [191] It might be purchased even from non-Israelites, and the Talmud
   relates a curious story, showing at the same time the reward of filial
   piety, and the fabulous amount which it is supposed such a red heifer
   might fetch.

   [192] Philo erroneously states that the high-priest was sprinkled with
   it each time before ministering at the altar. The truth is, he was only
   so sprinkled in preparation for the Day of Atonement, in case he might
   have been unwittingly defiled. Is the Romish use of holy water' derived
   from Jewish purifications, or from the Greek heathen practice of
   sprinkling on entering a temple?

   [193] The other three classes are the blind, the poor, and those who
   have no children.

   [194] All popular writers on typology have fallen into this error. Even
   the learned Lightfoot has committed it. It is also adopted by Mr. Poole
   in Smith's Dict. of the Bible (ii. p. 94), and curiously accounted for
   by the altogether unfounded hypothesis that the law imposed
   segregation' only while the disease manifested activity'!

   [195] Even the modified view of Keil, which is substantially adopted in
   Kitto's Encycl. (3rd edit.), p. 812, that the state described in
   Leviticus 13:12, 13, was regarded as indicative of the crisis, as the
   whole evil matter thus brought to the surface formed itself into a
   scale, which dried and peeled off,' does not meet the requirements of
   the text.

   [196] May not our Saviour refer to this when He speaks of sparrows' as
   of marketable value: Are not two sparrows sold for one farthing' (Matt
   10:29)?

   [197] The Mishnah and all commentators apply this to conjugal
   intercourse.

   [198] The significance of anointing the head with oil is sufficiently
   known.

   [199] The tractate Sotah enters into every possible detail, with
   prurient casuistry--the tendency, as always in Jewish criminal law,
   being in favour of the accused.

   [200] According to Rabbinical law adulteresses only suffered death if
   they persisted in the actual crime after having been warned of the
   consequences by two witnesses. It is evident that this canon must have
   rendered the infliction of the death penalty the rarest
   exception--indeed, almost inconceivable.

Chapter 19

  On Vows

    The Nazarite's Vow
    The Offering of Firstfruits in the Temple

   But now is Christ risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that
   sleep.' . . . These were purchased from among men--the firstfruits unto
   God and to the Lamb.'--1 Corinthians 15:20; Revelation 14:4.

    Vows

   If a man vow a vow unto Jehovah, or swear an oath to bind his soul with
   a bond, he shall not profane his word; he shall do according to all
   that hath proceeded out of his mouth' (Num 30:2). These words establish
   the lawfulness of vows, define their character, and declare their
   inviolableness. At the outset a distinction is here made between a
   positive and a negative vow, an undertaking and a renunciation, a Neder
   and an Issar. In the former a man vowed a vow unto Jehovah'--that is,
   he consecrated unto Him some one or more persons or things, which he
   expressly designated; in the latter he 'swore an oath to bind his soul
   with a bond'--that is, he renounced the use of certain things binding
   himself to abstinence from them. The renunciation of the fruit of the
   vine would seem to place the Nazarite's vow in the class termed Issar.
   But, on the other hand, there was, as in the case of Samson and Samuel,
   also such positive dedication to the Lord, and such other provisions as
   seem to make the Nazarite's the vows of vows--that is, the full
   carrying out of the idea of a vow, alike in its positive and negative
   aspects--being, in fact, a voluntary and entire surrender unto Jehovah,
   such as, in its more general bearing, the Aaronic priesthood had been
   intended to express.

    Man Can Only Vow His Own Things

   It lies on the surface, that all vows were limited by higher
   obligations. A man could not have vowed anything that was not fairly
   his own; hence, according to the Mishnah, neither what of his fortune
   he owed to others, nor his widow's portion, nor yet what already of
   right belonged unto the Lord (Num 30:26-28); nor might he profane the
   temple by bringing to the altar the reward of sin or of unnatural crime
   (this is undoubtedly the meaning of the expression price of a dog' in
   Deut 23:18). Similarly, the Rabbinical law declared any vow of
   abstinence ipso facto invalid, if it interfered with the preservation
   of life or similar obligations, and it allowed divorce to a woman if
   her husband's vow curtailed her liberty or her rights. On this ground
   it was that Christ showed the profaneness of the traditional law, which
   virtually sanctioned transgression of the command to honour father and
   mother, by pronouncing over that by which they might have been profited
   the magic word Corban, which dedicated it to the Temple (Mark 7:11-13).
   In general, the Rabbinical ordinances convey the impression, on the one
   hand, of a desire to limit the obligation of vows, and, on the other,
   of extreme strictness where a vow had really been made. Thus a vow
   required to have been expressly spoken; yet if the words used had been
   even intentionally so chosen as afterwards to open a way of escape, or
   were such as connected themselves with the common form of a vow, they
   conveyed its obligations. In all such cases goods might be distrained
   to secure the performance of the vow; the law, however, providing that
   the recusant was to be allowed to retain food for a month, a year's
   clothing, his beds and bedding, and, if an artisan, his necessary
   tools. In the case of women, a father or husband had the right to annul
   a vow, provided he did so immediately on hearing it (Num 30:3-8). All
   persons vowed unto the Lord had to be redeemed according to a certain
   scale; which, in the case of the poor, was to be so lowered as to bring
   it within reach of their means (Lev 27:2-8). [201]

   Such beasts' whereof men bring an offering,' went to the altar; all
   others, as well as any other thing dedicated, were to be valued by the
   priest, and might be redeemed on payment of the price, together with
   one-fifth additional, or else were sold for behoof of the Temple
   treasury (Lev 27:11-27). How carefully the law guarded against all
   profanity, or from the attempt to make merit out of what should have
   been the free outgoing of believing hearts, appears from Deuteronomy
   23:22-24, Leviticus 27:9, 10, and such statements as Proverbs 20:25. As
   Scriptural instances of vows, we may mention that of Jacob (Gen 28:20),
   the rash vow of Jephthah (Judg 11:30, 31), the vow of Hannah (1 Sam
   1:11), the pretended vow of Absalom (2 Sam 15:7, 8), and the vows of
   the sailors who cast Jonah overboard (Jonah 1:16). On the other hand,
   it will be understood how readily, in times of religious declension,
   vows might be turned from their proper object to purposes contrary to
   the Divine mind. [202]

    Carelessness in Later Times

   In the latter times of the Temple such vows, made either thoughtlessly,
   or from Pharisaical motives, became painfully frequent, and called
   forth protests on the part of those who viewed them in a more reverent
   and earnest spirit. Thus it is said, that the high-priest, Simeon the
   Just--to whom tradition ascribes so much that is good and
   noble--declared that he had uniformly refused, except in one instance,
   to partake of the trespass-offering of Nazarites, since such vows were
   so often made rashly, and the sacrifice was afterwards offered
   reluctantly, not with pious intent. A fair youth, with beautiful hair,
   had presented himself for such a vow, with whom the high-priest had
   expostulated: My son, what could have induced thee to destroy such
   splendid hair?' To which the youth replied: I fed my father's flock,
   and as I was about to draw water for it from a brook, I saw my wraith,
   and the evil spirit seized and would have destroyed me (probably by
   vanity). Then I exclaimed: Miserable fool, why boastest thou in a
   possession which does not belong to thee, who art so soon to be the
   portion of maggots and worms? By the Temple! I cut off my hair, to
   devote it to God.' Upon this,' said Simeon, I rose and kissed him on
   the forehead, saying, Oh that many in Israel were like thee! Thou hast
   truly, and in the spirit of the Law, made this vow according to the
   will of God.'

   That great abuses crept in appears even from the large numbers who took
   them. Thus the Talmud records that, in the days of King Jannai no fewer
   than 300 Nazarites presented themselves before Simeon, the son of
   Shetach. Moreover, a sort of traffic in good works, like that in the
   Romish Church before the Reformation, was carried on. It was considered
   meritorious to be at charges' for poor Nazarites, and to defray the
   expenses of their sacrifices. King Agrippa, on arriving at Jerusalem,
   seems to have done this to conciliate popular favour (Jos. Antiq. xix.
   6. 1). A far holier motive than this influenced St. Paul (Acts 21:23,
   etc.), when, to remove the prejudices of Jewish Christians, he was at
   charges' for four poor Christian Nazarites, and joined them, as it
   were, in their vow by taking upon himself some of its obligations, as,
   indeed, he was allowed to do by the traditional law.

    The Nazarite Vow

   1. The law concerning the Nazarite vow (Num 6) seems to imply, that it
   had been an institution already existing at the time of Moses, which
   was only further defined and regulated by him. The name, as well as its
   special obligations, indicate its higher bearing. For the term Nasir is
   evidently derived from nazar, to separate, and the vow of a Nazarite'
   was to separate himself unto Jehovah (Num 6:2). Hence the Nazarite was
   holy unto Jehovah' (Num 6:8). In the sense of separation the term Nasir
   was applied to Joseph (Gen 44:26; comp. Deut 32:16), and so the root is
   frequently used. But, besides separation and holiness, we have also
   here the idea of royal priesthood, since the word Nezer is applied to
   the holy crown upon the mitre' of the high-priest (Exo 29:6; 34:30; Lev
   8:9), and the crown of the anointing oil' (Lev 21:12), as also, in a
   secondary sense, to the royal crown (2 Sam 1:10; 2 Kings 11:12; Zech
   9:16). [203]

   We have, therefore, in the Nazarite, the three ideas of separation,
   holiness, and the crown of the royal priesthood, all closely connected.
   With this agree the threefold obligations incumbent on a Nazarite. He
   was to be not only a priest, but one in a higher and more intense
   sense, since he became such by personal consecration instead of by mere
   bodily descent. If the priest was to abstain from wine during his
   actual ministration in the sanctuary, the Nazarite must during the
   whole period of his vow refrain from all that belongs to the fruit of
   the vine, from the kernels even to the husk' (Num 6:3, 4). a priest was
   to avoid all defilement from the dead, except in the case of his
   nearest relatives, but the Nazarite, like the high-priest (Lev 21:11),
   was to ignore in that respect even father and mother, brother and
   sister (Num 6:7). Nay more, if unwittingly he had become so defiled,
   the time of his vow which had already elapsed was to count for nothing;
   after the usual seven days purification (Num 19:11, 12), he was to cut
   off his hair, which, in that case, was buried, not burnt, and on the
   eighth day to bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, the one for
   a sin-, the other for a burnt-offering, with a lamb of the first year
   for a trespass-offering; after which he had to commence his Nazarite
   vow anew. Lastly, if the high-priest wore the holy Nezer upon the
   mitre,' the Nazarite was not to cut his hair, which was the Nezer of
   his God upon his head' (Num 6:7). And this use of the word Nezer, as
   applied to the high-priest's crown, as well as to the separation unto
   holiness of the Nazarite, casts additional light alike upon the object
   of the priesthood and the character of the Nazarite vow.

    The Mishnah Regulations

   According to the Mishnah (tractate Nazir), all epithets of, or
   allusions to, the Nazarite vow, carried its obligation. Thus if one
   said, I will be it! or, I will be a beautiful one!'--with reference to
   the long hair--or made any similar allusion, he had legally taken upon
   him the vow. If taken for an indefinite period, or without express
   declaration of the time, the vow lasted for thirty days, which was the
   shortest possible time for a Nazarite. There were, however, perpetual
   Nazarites,' the Mishnah distinguishing between an ordinary perpetual
   Nazarite' and a Samson-Nazarite.' Both were for life,' but the former
   was allowed occasionally to shorten his hair, after which he brought
   the three sacrifices. He could also be defiled by the dead, in which
   case he had to undergo the prescribed purification. But as Samson had
   not been allowed under any circumstances to poll his hair, and as he
   evidently had come into contact with death without afterwards
   undergoing any ceremonial (Judg 14:8, 15:15), so the Samson-Nazarite
   might neither shorten his hair, nor could he be defiled by the dead.
   However, practically such a question probably never arose, and the
   distinction was no doubt merely made to meet an exegetical necessity to
   the Jews, --that of vindicating the conduct of Samson! As already
   stated, another might undertake part or the whole of the charges of a
   Nazarite, and thus share in his vow. A father, but not a mother, might
   make a Nazarite vow for a son, while he was under the legal age of
   thirteen. The Mishnah (Naz. vi.) discusses at great length the three
   things interdicted to a Nazarite: defilement, cutting the hair, and
   whatever proceedeth from the vine.' Any wilful trespass in these
   respects, provided the Nazarite had been expressly warned, carried the
   punishment of stripes, and that for every individual act of which he
   had been so warned.

    Rabbinical Regulations

   To prevent even the accidental removal of hair, the Rabbis forbade the
   use of a comb (Naz. vi. 3). According to the Law, defilement from death
   annulled the previous time of the vow, and necessitated certain
   offerings. To this the Mishnah adds, that if anyhow the hair were cut,
   it annulled the previous time of a vow up to thirty days (the period of
   an indefinite vow), while it is curiously determined that the use of
   anything coming from the vine did not interrupt the vow. Another
   Rabbinical contravention of the spirit of the law was to allow
   Nazarites the use of all intoxicating liquors other than what came from
   the vine (such as palm-wine, etc.). Lastly, the Mishnah determines that
   a master could not annul the Nazarite vow of his slave; and that, if he
   prevented him from observing it, the slave was bound to renew it on
   attaining his liberty. The offerings of a Nazarite on the completion of
   his vow are explicitly described in Numbers 6:13-21. Along with the ram
   without blemish for peace-offerings,' he had to bring a basket of
   unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of
   unleavened bread anointed with oil,' as well as the ordinary
   meat-offering and their drink offerings' (Num 6:14, 15). The Rabbis
   explain, that the unleavened bread,' to accompany the peace-offerings,'
   was to be made of six-tenth deals and two-thirds of a tenth deal of
   flour, which were to be baked into ten unleavened cakes and ten
   unleavened wafers, all anointed with the fourth part of a log of oil;
   and that all this bread' was to be offered in one vessel, or basket.'
   The sin-offering was first brought, then the burnt-, and last of all
   the peace-offering. In the Court of the Women there was a special
   Nazarite's chamber. After the various sacrifices had been offered by
   the priest, the Nazarite retired to this chamber, where he boiled the
   flesh of his peace-offerings, cut off his hair, and threw it in the
   fire under the caldron. If he had already cut off his hair before
   coming to Jerusalem, he must still bring it with him, and cast it in
   the fire under the caldron; so that whether or not we understand Acts
   18:18 as stating that Paul himself had taken a vow, he might have cut
   off his hair at Cenchrea (Acts 18:18), and brought it with him to
   Jerusalem. After that the priest waved the offering, as detailed in
   Numbers 6:19, 20, [204] and the fat was salted, and burned upon the
   altar.

   The breast, the fore-leg, the boiled shoulder, and the waved cake and
   wafer, belonged to the priests--the remaining bread and meat were eaten
   by the Nazarite. Lastly, the expression, besides that that his hand
   shall get,' after mention of the other offerings (Num 6:21), seems to
   imply that the Nazarites were also wont to bring free-will offerings.

   Scripture mentions three Nazarites for life: Samson, Samuel, and John
   the Baptist, to which Christian tradition adds the name of James the
   Just, the brother of the Lord,' who presided over the Church at
   Jerusalem when Paul joined in the Nazarite-offering (Eusebius, Eccl.
   Hist. ii. 23. 3). In this respect it is noteworthy that, among those
   who urged upon Paul to be at charges' with the four Christian
   Nazarites, James himself is not specially mentioned (Acts 21:20-25).

    Offering the Firstfruits

   2. Properly speaking, the offering of the firstfruits belonged to the
   class of religious and charitable contributions, and falls within our
   present scope only in so far as certain of them had to be presented in
   the Temple at Jerusalem. Two of these firstfruit offerings were public
   and national; viz. the first omer, on the second day of the Passover,
   and the wave-loaves at Pentecost. The other two kinds of
   firstfruits'--or Reshith, the first, the beginning'--were offered on
   the part of each family and of every individual who had possession in
   Israel, according to the Divine directions in Exodus 22:29; 23:19;
   34:26; Numbers 15:20, 21; 18:12, 13; Deuteronomy 18:4; and Deuteronomy
   26:2-11, where the ceremonial to be observed in the Sanctuary is also
   described. Authorities distinguish between the Biccurim (primitiva), or
   firstfruits offered in their natural state, and the Terumoth
   (primitiae), brought not as raw products, but in a prepared state, --as
   flour, oil, wine, etc. [205]

   The distinction is convenient, but not strictly correct, since the
   Terumoth also included vegetables and garden produce (Ter. ii. 5; iii.
   1; x. 5). Still less accurate is the statement of modern writers that
   the Greek term Protogennemata corresponds to Biccurim, and Aparchai to
   Terumoth, an assertion not even supported by the use of those words in
   the version of the Septuagint, which is so deeply tinged with
   traditionalism.

    The Biccurim and Terumoth

   Adopting, however, the distinction of the terms, for convenience sake,
   we find that the Biccurim (primitiva) were only to be brought while
   there was a national Sanctuary (Exo 23:19; Deut 26:2; Neh 10:35).
   Similarly, they must be the produce of the Holy Land itself, in which,
   according to tradition, were included the ancient territories of Og and
   Sihon, as well as that part of Syria which David had subjugated. On the
   other hand, both the tithes [206] and the Terumoth were also obligatory
   on Jews in Egypt, Babylon, Ammon, and Moab.

   The Biccurim were only presented in the Temple, and belonged to the
   priesthood there officiating at the time, while the Terumoth might be
   given to any priest in any part of the land. The Mishnah holds that, as
   according to Deuteronomy 8:8 only the following seven were to be
   regarded as the produce of the Holy Land, from them alone Biccurim were
   due: viz. wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates.
   [207]

   If the distance of the offerer from Jerusalem was too great, the figs
   and grapes might be brought in a dried state.

   The amount of the Biccurim was not fixed in the Divine Law, any more
   than of the wheat which was to be left in the corners of the fields in
   order to be gleaned by the poor. [208]

   But according to the Rabbis in both these cases one-sixtieth was to be
   considered as the minimum. From Exodus 23:16 and Leviticus 23:16, 17,
   it was argued that the Biccurim were not to be brought to Jerusalem
   before Pentecost; nor yet were they to be offered later than the Feast
   of the Dedication of the Temple. If given at any other time than
   between Pentecost and the 25th Kislev, the regular service was not gone
   through at their presentation. Before describing this, we add a few
   particulars about the Terumoth. In regard to them it was said that a
   fine eye' (a liberal man) gives one-fortieth,' an evil eye' (a covetous
   person) one-sixtieth,' while the average rate of contribution--'a
   middling eye'--was to give one-fiftieth, or two per cent. The same
   proportion we may probably also set down as that of the Biccurim.
   Indeed, the Rabbis have derived from this the word Terumah, as it were
   Terei Mimeah, two out of a hundred.'

   In the class Terumoth we may also include the Reshith or first of the
   fleece' (Deut 18:11); which, according to the Mishnah (Chol. xi. 1, 2),
   had to be given by every one who possessed at least five sheep, and
   amounted, without dust or dirt, as a minimum, to five Judean, or ten
   Galilean, shekel weight of pure wool (one Judean, or sacred shekel = to
   under two hundred and seventy-four Parisian grains); and, further, the
   Reshith Challah, or first of the dough' (Num 15:18-21), [209] which, if
   the dough was used for private consumption, was fixed by the Rabbis at
   one-twenty-fourth, if for sale at one-forty-eighth, while if it were
   made for non-Israelites, it was not taxed at all. The Rabbis have it
   that the first of the dough' was only due from wheat, barley, casmin,
   oats, and rye, but not if the dough has been made of other esculents,
   such as rice, etc.

   Of course, neither tithes, nor Biccurim, nor Terumoth, were to be given
   of what already belonged to the Lord, nor of what was not fairly the
   property of a person. Thus if only the trees, but not the land in which
   they grew, belonged to a man, he would not give firstfruits. If
   proselytes, stewards, women, or slaves brought firstfruits, the regular
   service was not gone through, since such could not have truthfully said
   either one or other of these verses (Deut 26:3, 10): I am come to the
   country which the Lord sware to our fathers to give us'; or, I have
   brought the firstfruits of the land which Thou, O Lord, hast given me.'
   According to Leviticus 19:23-25, for three years the fruits of a
   newly-planted tree were to remain unused, while in the fourth year they
   were, according to the Rabbis, to be eaten in Jerusalem.

   Biccurim, Terumoth, and what was to be left in the corners' of the
   fields for the poor were always set apart before the tithing was made.
   If the offering of firstfruits' had been neglected, one-fifth was to be
   added when they were brought. Thus the prescribed religious
   contributions of every Jewish layman at the time of the second Temple
   were as follows: Biccurim and Terumoth, say two percent; from the first
   of the fleece,' at least five shekels' weight; from the first of the
   dough,' say four per cent; corners of the fields' for the poor, say two
   per cent; the first, or Levitical tithe, ten per cent; the second, or
   festival tithe, to be used at the feasts in Jerusalem, and in the third
   and sixth years to be the poor's tithe,' ten per cent; the firstling of
   all animals, either in kind or money-value; five shekels for every
   first-born son, provided he were the first child of his mother, and
   free of blemish; and the half-shekel of the Temple-tribute. Together,
   these amounted to certainly more than the fourth of the return which an
   agricultural population would have. And it is remarkable, that the Law
   seems to regard Israel as intended to be only an agricultural
   people--no contribution being provided for from trade or merchandise.
   Besides these prescribed, there were, of course, all manner of
   voluntary offerings, pious works, and, above all, the various
   sacrifices which each, according to his circumstances or piety, would
   bring in the Temple at Jerusalem.

    Biccurim in the Temple

   Having thus explained the nature of the various religious
   contributions, it only remains to describe the mode in which the
   Biccurim or firstfruits,' were ordinarily set apart, and the ceremonial
   with which they were brought to Jerusalem, and offered in the Temple.
   Strictly speaking, the presentation of the firstfruits was an act of
   family religion. As in the first omer at the Passover, and by the
   Pentecostal loaves, Israel as a nation owned their God and King, so
   each family, and every individual separately acknowledged, by the
   yearly presentation of the firstfruits, a living relationship between
   them and God, in virtue of which they gratefully received at His hands
   all they had or enjoyed, and solemnly dedicated both it and themselves
   to the Lord. They owned Him as the Giver and real Lord of all, and
   themselves as the recipients of His bounty, the dependents on His
   blessing, and the stewards of His property. Their daily bread they
   would seek and receive only at His hand, use it with thanksgiving, and
   employ it in His service; and this, their dependence upon God, was
   their joyous freedom, in which Israel declared itself the redeemed
   people of the Lord.

   As a family feast the presentation of the firstfruits would enter more
   than any other rite into family religion and family life. Not a child
   in Israel--at least of those who inhabited the Holy Land--could have
   been ignorant of all connected with this service, and that even though
   it had never been taken to the beautiful city of the Great King,' nor
   gazed with marvel and awe at the Temple of Jehovah. For scarcely had a
   brief Eastern spring merged into early summer, when with the first
   appearance of ripening fruit, whether on the ground or on trees, each
   household would prepare for this service. The head of the family--if we
   may follow the sketch in the harvest-picture of the household of the
   Shunammite--accompanied by his child, would go into his field and mark
   off certain portions from among the most promising of the crop. For
   only the best might be presented to the Lord, and it was set apart
   before it was yet ripe, the solemn dedication being, however,
   afterwards renewed, when it was actually cut. Thus, each time any one
   would go into the field, he would be reminded of the ownership of
   Jehovah, till the reapers cut down the golden harvest. So, also, the
   head of the house would go into his vineyards, his groves of
   broad-leaved fig-trees, of splendid pomegranates, rich olives and
   stately palms, and, stopping short at each best tree, carefully select
   what seemed the most promising fruit, tie a rush round the stem, and
   say: Lo, these are the firstfruits.' Thus he renewed his
   covenant-relationship to God each year as the winter was past, the rain
   over and gone, the flowers appeared on the earth, the time of the
   singing of birds was come, and the voice of the turtle was heard in the
   land, the fig-tree put forth his green figs, and the vines with the
   tender grapes gave a good smell.' And as these fruits gradually
   ripened, the ceremonies connected first with setting them apart, and
   then with actually offering them, must have continued in every
   Israelitish household during the greater portion of the year, from
   early spring till winter, when the latest presentation might be made in
   the Temple on the 25th Kislev (corresponding to our December).

    Songs of Ascent

   Of course every family could not always have sent its representatives
   to Jerusalem. But this difficulty was provided for. It will be
   remembered that as the priests and the Levites, so all Israel, were
   divided into twenty-four courses, who were represented in the Sanctuary
   by the so-called 'standing men,' or men of the station.' This implied a
   corresponding division of the land into twenty-four districts or
   circuits. In the capital of each district assembled those who were to
   go up with the firstfruits to the Temple. Though all Israel were
   brethren, and especially at such times would have been welcomed with
   the warmest hospitality each home could offer, yet none might at that
   season avail himself of it. For they must camp at night in the open
   air, and not spend it in any house, lest some accidental defilement
   from the dead, or otherwise, might render them unfit for service, or
   their oblation unclean. The journey was always to be made slowly, for
   the pilgrimage was to be a joy and a privilege, not a toil or
   weariness. In the morning, as the golden sunlight tipped the mountains
   of Moab, the stationary man of the district, who was the leader,
   summoned the ranks of the procession in the words of Jeremiah 31:6:
   Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion, and unto Jehovah our God.' To which
   the people replied, as they formed and moved onwards, in the
   appropriate language of Psalm 122: I was glad when they said unto me,
   Let us go into the house of Jehovah.' First went one who played the
   pipe; then followed a sacrificial bullock, destined for a
   peace-offering, his horns gilt and garlanded with olive-branches; next
   came the multitude, some carrying the baskets with the firstfruits,
   others singing the Psalms, which many writers suppose to have been
   specially destined for that service, and hence to have been called the
   Songs of Ascent'; in our Authorised Version the Psalms of Degrees.' The
   poorer brought their gifts in wicker baskets, which afterwards belonged
   to the officiating priests; the richer theirs in baskets of silver or
   of gold, which were given to the Temple treasury. In each basket was
   arranged, with vine-leaves between them, first the barley, then the
   wheat, then the olives; next the dates, then the pomegranates, then the
   figs; while above them all clustered, in luscious beauty, the rich
   swelling grapes.

   And so they passed through the length and breadth of the land,
   everywhere wakening the echoes of praise. As they entered the city,
   they sang Psalm 122:2: Our feet stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.' A
   messenger had preceded them to announce their approach, and a
   deputation from the Temple, consisting of priests, Levites, and
   treasurers, varying in numbers according to the importance of the place
   from which the procession came, had gone out to receive them. In the
   streets of Jerusalem each one came out to welcome them, with shouts of,
   Brethren of such a place' (naming it), ye come to peace; welcome! Ye
   come in peace, ye bring peace, and peace be unto you!'

   As they reached the Temple Mount, each one, whatever his rank or
   condition, took one of the baskets on his shoulder, and they ascended,
   singing that appropriate hymn (Psa 150), Praise ye Jehovah! praise God
   in His sanctuary: praise Him in the firmament of His power,' etc. As
   they entered the courts of the Temple itself, the Levites intoned Psalm
   30: I will extol Thee, O Jehovah; for Thou hast lifted me up, and hast
   not made my foes to rejoice over me,' etc. Then the young pigeons and
   turtle-doves which hung from the baskets were presented for
   burnt-offerings. After that, each one, as he presented his gifts,
   repeated this solemn confession (Deut 26:3): I profess this day unto
   Jehovah thy God, that I am come unto the country that Jehovah sware
   unto our fathers for to give us.' At these words, he took the basket
   from his shoulder, and the priest put his hands under it and waved it,
   the offerer continuing: A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he
   went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there
   a nation--great, mighty, and populous.' Then reciting in the words of
   inspiration the narrative of the Lord's marvellous dealings, he closed
   with the dedicatory language of verse 10: And now, behold, I have
   brought the firstfruits of the land which Thou, O Jehovah, hast given
   me.' So saying, he placed the basket at the side of the altar, cast
   himself on his face to worship, and departed. The contents of the
   baskets belonged to the officiating priests, and the offerers
   themselves were to spend the night at Jerusalem.

    The Word Firstfruits' in the New Testament

   Turning from this to what may be called its higher application, under
   the Christian dispensation, we find that the word rendered firstfruits'
   occurs just seven times in the New Testament. These seven passages are:
   Romans 8:13; Romans 11:16; Romans 16:5; 1 Corinthians 15:20-23; 1
   Corinthians 16:15; James 1:18; Revelation 14:4. If we group these texts
   appropriately, one sentence of explanation may suffice in each case.
   First, we have (1 Cor 15:20, 23), as the commencement of the new
   harvest, the Lord Jesus Himself, risen from the dead, the
   firstfruits'--the first sheaf waved before the Lord on the second
   Paschal day, just as Christ actually burst the bonds of death at that
   very time. Then, in fulfilment of the Pentecostal type of the first
   loaves, we read of the primal outpouring of the Holy Spirit, dispensed
   on the day of Pentecost. The presentation of the firstfruits is
   explained by its application to such instances as Romans 16:5, and 1
   Corinthians 16:15 (in the former of which passages the reading should
   be Asia, and not Achaia), while the character of these firstfruits is
   shown in James 1:18. The allusion in Romans 11:16 is undoubtedly to the
   first of the dough,' and so explains an otherwise difficult passage.
   The apostle argues, that if God chose and set apart the fathers--if He
   took the first of the dough, then the whole lump (the whole people) is
   in reality sanctified to Him; and therefore God cannot, and hath not
   cast away His people which He foreknew.' Finally, in Revelation 14:4,
   the scene is transferred to heaven, where we see the full application
   of this symbol to the Church of the first-born. But to us all, in our
   labour, in our faith, and in our hope, there remain these words,
   pointing beyond time and the present dispensation: Ourselves also,
   which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan
   within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of
   our body' (Rom 8:23).

   Glory to God on account of all things.'--St. Chrysostom.

  Appendix

   Did The Lord Institute His Supper' On The Paschal Night?

   The question, whether or not the Savior instituted His Supper during
   the meal of the Paschal night, although not strictly belonging to the
   subject treated in this volume, is too important, and too nearly
   connected with it, to be cursorily passed over. The balance of learned
   opinion, especially in England, has of late inclined against this view.
   The point has been so often and so learnedly discussed that I do not
   presume proposing to myself more than the task of explaining my reasons
   for the belief that the Lord instituted His Supper' on the very night
   of the Paschal Feast, and that consequently His crucifixion took place
   on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the 15th of Nisan.

   From the writers on the other side, it may here be convenient to select
   Dr. Farrar, as alike the latest and one of the ablest expositors of the
   contrary position. His arguments are stated in a special Excursus
   appended to his Life of Christ. At the outset it is admitted on both
   sides, that our Lord was crucified on Friday and rose on Sunday;' and,
   further, that our Lord could not have held a sort of anticipatory
   Paschal Supper in advance of all the other Jews, a Paschal Supper being
   only possible on the evening of the 14th Nisan, with which, according
   to Jewish reckoning, the 15th Nisan began. Hence it follows that the
   Last Supper which Christ celebrated with His disciples must have either
   been the Paschal Feast, or an ordinary supper, at which He afterwards
   instituted His own special ordinance. Now, the conclusions at which Dr.
   Farrar arrives are thus summed up by him' That Jesus ate His last
   supper with the disciples on the evening of Thursday, Nisan 13, i.e. at
   the time when, according to Jewish reckoning, the 14th of Nisan began;
   that this supper was not, and was not intended to be, the actual
   Paschal meal, which neither was nor could be legally eaten till the
   following evening; but by a perfectly natural identification, and one
   which would have been regarded as unimportant, the Last Supper, which
   was a quasi-Passover, a new and Christian Passover, and one in which,
   as in its antitype, memories of joy and sorrow were strangely blended,
   got to be identified, even in the memory of the Synoptists, with the
   Jewish Passover, and that St. john silently but deliberately corrected
   this

   erroneous impression, which, even in his time, had come to be generally
   prevalent.' Before entering into the discussion, I must confess myself
   unable to agree with the a priori reasoning by which Dr. Farrar
   accounts for the supposed mistake of the Synoptists. Passing over the
   expression, that the Last Supper was a quasi-Passover,' which does not
   convey to me a sufficiently definite meaning, I should rather have
   expected that, in order to realize the obvious antitype,' the tendency
   of the Synoptists would have been to place the death of Christ on the
   evening of the 14th Nisan, when the Paschal lamb was actually slain,
   rather than on the 15th Nisan, twenty-four hours after that sacrifice
   had taken place. In other words, the typical predilections of the
   Synoptists would, I imagine, have led them to identify the death of
   Christ with the slaying of the lamb; and it seems, a priori, difficult
   to believe that, if Christ really died at that time, and His last
   supper was on the previous evening -- that of the 13th Nisan, -- they

   should have fallen into the mistake of identifying that supper, not
   with His death, but with the Paschal meal. I repeat: a priori, if error
   there was, I should have rather expected it in the opposite direction.
   Indeed, the main dogmatic strength of the argument on the other side
   lies in the consideration that the anti-type (Christ) should have died
   at the same time as the type (the Paschal lamb). Dr. Farrar himself
   feels the force of this, and one of his strongest arguments against the
   view that the Last Supper took place at the Paschal meal is: The sense
   of inherent and symbolical fitness in the dispensation which ordained
   that Christ should be slain on the day and at the hour appointed for
   the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb.' Of all persons, would not the
   Synoptists have been alive: to this consideration? And, if so, is it
   likely that they would have fallen into the mistake with which they are
   charged? Would not all their tendencies have lain in the opposite
   direction?

   But to pass to the argument itself. For the sake of clearness it will
   here be convenient to treat the question under three aspects: -- How
   does the supposition that the Last Supper did not take place on the
   Paschal night agree with the general bearing of the whole history?
   What, fairly speaking, is the inference from the Synoptical Gospels?
   Lastly, does the account of St. John, in this matter, contradict those
   of the Synoptists, or is it harmonious indeed with theirs, but
   incomplete?

   How Does The Supposition That The Last Supper Did Not Take Place On The
   Paschal Night Agree With The General Bearing Of The Whole History?

   1. The language of the first three Evangelists, taken in its natural
   sense, seems dearly irreconcilable with this view. Even Dr. Farrar
   admits: If we construe the language for the Evangelists in its plain,
   straightforward, simple sense, and without reference to any
   preconceived theories, or supposed necessities for harmonizing the
   different narratives, we should be led to conclude from the Synoptists
   that the Last Supper was the ordinary Paschal meal.' On this point
   further remarks will be made in the sequel.

   2. The account of the meal as given, not only by the Synoptists but
   also by St. John, so far as he describes it, seems to me utterly
   inconsistent with the idea of an ordinary supper. It is not merely one
   trait or another which here influences us, but the general impression
   produced by the whole. The preparations for the meal; the allusions to
   it; in short, so to speak, the whole raise mise, en scene is not that
   of a common supper. Only the necessities of a preconceived theory would
   lead one to such a conclusion. On the other hand, all is just what
   might have been expected, if the Evangelists had meant to describe the
   Paschal meal.

   3. Though I do not regard such considerations as decisive, there are,
   to my mind, difficulties in the way of adopting the view that Jesus
   died while the Paschal lamb was being slain, far greater than those
   which can attach to the other theory. On the supposition of Dr. Farrar,
   the crucifixion took place on the 14th Nisan, between the evenings' of
   which the Paschal lamb was slain. Being a Friday, the ordinary evening
   service would have commenced at 1:30 P.M., and the evening sacrifice
   offered, say, at 1:30, after which the services connected with the
   Paschal lamb would immediately begin. Now it seems to me almost
   inconceivable, that under such circumstances, and on so busy an
   afternoon, there should have been, at the time when they must have been
   most engaged, around the cross that multitude of reviling Jews,
   likewise also the chief priests, mocking Him, with the scribes,' which
   all the four Evangelists record. (Matthew 27:39, 41; Mark 15:29, 31;
   Luke 23:35; John 21:20) Even more difficult does it seem to me to
   believe, that after the Paschal lamb had been slain, and while the
   preparations for the Paschal Supper were going on, as St. John reports,
   (John 20:39-39) an honorable councillor,' like Joseph of Arimathaea,
   and a Sanhedrist, like Nicodemus, should have gone to beg of Pilate the
   body of Jesus, or been able to busy themselves with His burial. I
   proceed now to the second question:

   What, Fairly Speaking, Is The Inference From The Synoptical Gospels?

   1.To this, I should say, there can be only one reply: -- The Synoptical
   Gospels, undoubtedly, place the Last Supper in the Paschal night. A
   bare quotation of their statements will establish this: Ye know that
   after two days is the Passover'; (Matthew 26:19) Now the first day of
   unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto Him, Where
   wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover?" (Matthew
   26:17) "I will keep the Passover at thy house" (Matthew 26:18). They
   made ready the Passover. (Matthew 26:19) Similarly, in the Gospel by
   St. Mark (Mark 14:12-17) And the first day of unleavened bread, when
   they killed the Passover, the disciples said unto Him, Where wilt Thou
   that we go and prepare, that Thou mayest eat the Passover?' The Master
   saith, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the Passover with
   my disciples? There make ready for us.' And they made ready the
   Passover. And in the evening He cometh with the twelve. And as they sat
   and did eat. . .' And in the Gospel by St. Luke (Luke 22:7-15) Then
   came the day of unleavened bread, when the Passover must be killed;' Go
   and prepare us the Passover, that we may eat;' Where is the
   guest-chamber where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?' There
   make ready;' And they made ready the Passover.' And when the hour was
   come He sat down;' With desire have I desired to eat this Passover with
   you BEFORE I SUFFER.' It is not easy to understand how even a
   preconceived theory' could weaken the obvious import of such
   expressions, especially when taken in connection with the description
   of the meal that follows.

   2. Assuming, then, the testimony of the Synoptical Gospels to be
   unequivocally in our favor, it appears to me extremely improbable that,
   in such a matter, they should have been mistaken, or that such an
   erroneous impression' could -- and this even in the time of St. John'
   have come to be generally prevalent.' On the contrary, I have shown
   that if mistake there was, it would most likely have been rather in the
   opposite: direction.

   3. We have now to consider what Dr. Farrar calls the incidental notices
   preserved in the Synoptists,' which seem to militate against their
   general statement. Selecting those which are of greatest force, we
   have: -- (a) The fact' that the disciples (John 13:22) suppose Judas to
   have left the room in order to buy what things they had need of against
   the feast.' But the disciples only suppose this; and in the confusion
   and excitement of the scene such a mistake was not unintelligible.
   Besides, though servile work was forbidden on the first Paschal day,
   the preparation of all needful provision for the feast was allowed, and
   must have been the more necessary, as, on our supposition, it was
   followed by a Sabbath. Indeed, the Talmudical law distinctly allowed
   the continuance of such preparation of provisions as had been commenced
   on the preparation day' (Arnheim, Gebeth. d. Isr., p. 500, note 69, a).
   In general, we here refer to our remarks at p. 247, only adding, that
   even now Rabbinical ingenuity can find many a way of evading the rigor
   of the Sabbath-law.

   (b) As for the meeting of the Sanhedrim, and the violent arrest of
   Christ on such a night of peculiar solemnity, the fanatical hatred of
   the chief priests, and the supposed necessities of the case, would
   sufficiently account for them. On any supposition we have to admit the
   operation of these causes, since the Sanhedrim confessedly violated, in
   the trial of Jesus, every principle and form of their own criminal
   jurisprudence.

   Lastly, We Have To Inquire: Does The Account Of St. John Contradict
   Those Of The Synoptists, Or Is It Harmonious, Indeed, With Them, But
   Incomplete?

   1. Probably few would commit themselves to the statement, that the
   account of St. John necessarily contradicts those of the Synoptists.
   But the following are the principal reasons urged by Dr. Farrar for the
   inference that, according to St. John, the Last Supper took place the
   evening before the Paschal night: -- (a) Judas goes, as is supposed, to
   buy the things that they have need of against the feast. This has
   already been explained. (b) The Pharisees went not into the
   judgment-hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the
   Passover.' And in answer to the common explanation that the Passover'
   here means the 15th day, Chaigigah, he adds, in a footnote, that there
   was nothing specifically Paschal' about this Chaigigah. Dr. Farrar
   should have paused before committing himself to such a statement. One
   of the most learned Jewish writers, Dr. Saalschutz, is not of his
   opinion. He writes as follows': The whole feast and all its festive
   meals were designated as the Passover. See Deuteronomy 16:2, comp. 2
   Chronicles 30:24, and 35:8, 9; Sebach. 99, b, Rosh ha Sh. 5, a, where
   it is expressly said "What is the meaning of the term Passover?"
   (Answer) "The peace-offerings of the Passover."' Illustrative
   Rabbinical passages are also quoted by Lightfoot:and by Schottgen. As a
   rule the Chagigah was always brought on the 15th Nisan, and it required
   Levitical purity. Lastly, Dr. Farrar himself admits that the statement
   of St. John (John 18:28) must not be too closely pressed, for that some
   Jews must have even gone into the judgment-hall without noticing "the
   defilement" is clear.' (c) According to St. John, (John 19:31) the
   following Sabbath was

   a high day,' or a great day;' on which Dr. Farrar comments: Evidently
   because it was at once; a Sabbath, and the first day of the Paschal
   Feast.' Why not the second day of the feast, when the first omer was
   presented in the Temple? To these may be added the following among the
   other arguments advanced by Dr. Farrar: -- (d) The various engagements
   recorded in the Gospels on the day of Christ's crucifixion are
   incompatible with a festive day of rest, such as the 15th Nisan. The
   reference to Simon the Cyrenian coming out of the country' seems to me
   scarcely to deserve special notice. But then Joseph of Arimathaea
   bought on that day the line linen' (Mark 15:46) for Christ's burial,
   and the women prepared spices and ointments.' (Luke 23:56) Here,
   however, it should be remembered, that the rigor of the festive was not
   like that of the Sabbatic rest; that there were means of really buying
   such a cloth without doing it in express terms (an evasion known to
   Rabbinical law). Lastly, the Jerusalem Talmud (Ber. 5, b) expressly
   declares it lawful on Sabbaths and feast-days to bring a coffin,
   graveclothes, and even mourning flutes -- in short, to attend to the
   offices for the dead -- just as on ordinary days. This passage, though,
   as far as I know, never before quoted in this controversy, is of the
   greatest importance. (e) Dr. Farrar attaches importance to the fact
   that Jewish tradition fixes the death of Christ on the 14th Nisan. But
   these Jewish traditions, to which an appeal is made, are not only of a
   late date, but wholly unhistorical and valueless. Indeed, as Dr. Farrar
   himself shows, they are full of the grossest absurdities. I cannot here
   do better than simply quote the words of the great Jewish historian,
   Dr. Jost: Whatever attempts may be made to plead in favor of these
   Talmudic stories, and to try and discover some historical basis in
   them, the Rabbis of the third and fourth centuries are quite at sea
   about the early Christians, and deal in legends for which there is no
   foundation of any kind.' (f) Dr. Farrar's objection that after supper'
   Jesus and His disciples went out, which seems to him inconsistent with
   the injunction of Exodus 12:22, and that in the account of the meal
   there is an absence of that hurry which, according to the law, should
   have characterized the supper, arises from not distinguishing the
   ordinances of the so-called Egyptian' from those of the permanent
   Passover.' On this and kindred points the reader is referred to
   Chapters 11., 12. (g) The only other argument requiring notice is that
   in their accounts the three Synoptists give not the remotest hint which
   could show that a lamb formed the most remarkable portion of the
   feast.' Now, this is an objection which answers itself. For, according
   to Dr. Farrar, these Synoptists had, in writing their accounts, been
   under the mistaken impression that they were describing the Paschal
   Supper. As for their silence on the subject, it seems to me , capable
   of an interpretation the opposite of that which Dr. Farrar has put upon
   it. Considering the purpose of all which they had in view -- the
   fulfillment of the type of the Paschal Supper, and the substitution for
   it of the Lord's Supper -- their silence seems not only natural, but
   what might have been expected. For their object was to describe the
   Paschal Supper only in so far as it bore upon the institution of the
   Lord's Supper. Lastly, it is a curious coincidence that throughout the
   whole Mishnic account of the Paschal Supper there is only one isolated
   reference to the lamb -- a circumstance so striking, that, for example,
   Caspari has argued from it that ordinarily this meal was what he calls
   a meal of unleavened bread,' and that in the majority of cases there
   was no Passover lamb at all! I state the inference drawn by Dr.
   Caspari, but there can scarcely be any occasion for replying to it.

   On the other hand, I have now to add two arguments taken from the
   masterly disquisition of the whole question by Wieseler, to show that
   St. John, like the Synoptists, places the date of the crucifixion on
   the 15^th Nisan, and hence that of the Last Supper on the evening of
   the 14^th (a) Not only the Synoptists, but St. John (John 18:39) refers
   to the custom of releasing a prisoner at the feast,' or, as St. John
   expressly calls it, at the Passover.' Hence the release of Barabbas,
   and with it the crucifixion of Jesus, could not have taken place (as
   Dr. Farrar supposes) on the 14th of Nisan, the morning of which could
   not have been designated as the feast,' and still less as the
   Passover.' (b) When St. John mentions (John 18:28) that the accusers of
   Jesus went not into Pilate's judgment-hall lest they should be defiled;
   but that they might eat the Passover,' he could not have referred to
   their eating the Paschal Supper. For the defilement thus incurred would
   only have lasted to the evening of that day, whereas the Paschal Supper
   was eaten after the evening had commenced, so that the defilement of
   Pilate's judgement-hall in the morning would in no way have interfered
   with their eating the Paschal Lamb. But it would have interfered with
   their either offering or partaking of the Chagigah on the 15th Nisan.

   2. Hitherto I have chiefly endeavored to show that the account of St.
   John is harmonious with that of the Synoptists in reference to the time
   of the Last Supper. But, on the other hand, I am free to confess that,
   if it had stood alone, I should not have been able to draw the same
   clear inference from it as from the narratives of the first three
   Gospels. My difficulty here arises, not from what St. John says, but
   from what he does not say. His words, indeed, are quite consistent with
   those of the Synoptists, but, taken alone, they would not have been
   sufficient to convey, at least to my mind, the same clear impression.
   And here I have to observe that St. John's account must in this respect
   seem equally incomplete, whichever theory of the time of the Last
   Supper be adopted. If the Gospel of St. John stood alone, it would, I
   think, be equally difficult for Dr. Farrar to prove from it his, as for
   me to establish my view. He might reason from certain expressions, and
   so might I; but there are no such clear, unmistakable statements as
   those in which the Synoptists describe the Passover night as that of
   the Last Supper. And yet we should have expected most fullness and
   distinctness from St. John! Is not the inference suggested that the
   account in the Gospel of St. John, in the form in which we at present
   possess it, may be incomplete? I do not here venture to construct a
   hypothesis, far less to offer a matured explanation, but rather to make
   a suggestion of what possibly may have been, and to put it as a
   question to scholars. But once admit the idea, and there are, if not
   many, yet weighty reasons, to confirm it.

   It would account for all the difficulties felt by those who have
   adopted the same view as Dr. Farrar, and explain, not, indeed, the
   supposed difference -- for such I deny -- but the incompleteness of St.
   John's narrative, as compared with those of the Synoptists.

   It explains what otherwise seems almost unaccountable. I agree with Dr.
   Farrar that St. John's accounts of the Last Supper are incomparably
   more full than those of the other Evangelists,' and that he was more
   immediately and completely identified with every act ill those last
   trying scenes than any one of the apostles.' And yet, strange to say,
   on this important point St. John's information is not only more scanty
   than that of the Synoptists, but so indefinite that, of alone, no
   certain inference could be drawn from it. The circumstance is all the
   more inexplicable if, as on Dr. Farrar's theory, the error' of the
   Synoptists was at the time generally prevalent,' and St. John silently
   but deliberately,' had set himself to correct it.

   Strangest of all, the Gospel of St. John is the only one which does not
   contain any account of the institution of the Lord's Supper, and yet,
   if anywhere; we would have expected to find it here. 4. The account in
   John 13, begins with a circumstantially which leads us to expect great
   fulness of detail. And yet, while maintaining throughout that
   characteristic, so far as the teaching of Jesus in that night is
   concerned, it almost suddenly and abruptly breaks off (about ver. 31)
   in the account of what He and they who sat with Him did at the Supper.

   Of such a possible hiatus there seems, on closer examination, some
   internal confirmation, of which I shall here only adduce this one
   instance -- that chapter 14: concludes by, Arise, let us go hence;'
   which, however, is followed by other three chapters of precious
   teaching and intercessory prayer, when the narrative is abruptly
   resumed, by a strange repetition, as compared with 14:31, in these
   words (18:1): When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His
   disciples over the brook Cedron.' Further discussion would lead beyond
   the necessary limits of the present Excursus. Those who know how
   bitterly the Quartodeciman controversy raged in the early Church, and
   what strong things were put forth by the so-called disciples of John'
   in defense of their view, that the Last Supper did not take place on
   the Paschal night, may see grounds to account for such a hiatus. In
   conclusion, I would only say that, to my mind, the suggestion above
   made would in no way be inconsistent with the doctrine of the plenary
   inspiration of Holy Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [201] The Mishnah declares that this scale was only applicable, if
   express reference had been made to it in the vow; otherwise the price
   of redemption was, what the person would have fetched if sold in the
   market as a slave.

   [202] In general the later legislation of the Rabbis was intended to
   discourage vows, on account of their frequent abuse (Nedar, i., iii.,
   ix.). It was declared that only evil-doers bound themselves in this
   manner, while the pious gave of their own free-will. Where a vow
   affected the interests of others, every endeavour was to be made, to
   get him who had made it to seek absolution from its obligations, which
   might be had from one sage,' or from three persons, in the presence of
   him who had been affected by the vow. Further particulars are beyond
   our present scope.

   [203] The learned writer of the article Nazarite' in Kitto's Encycl.
   regards the meaning diadem' as the fundamental one, following in this
   the somewhat unsafe critical guidance of Saalschutz, Mos. Recht. p.
   158. In proof, he appeals to the circumstance that the undressed vine'
   of the Sabbatical and the Jubilee year is designated by the term Nazir'
   in Leviticus 25:5, 11. But evidently the uncut, untrimmed vine of those
   years derived its designation from the Nazarite with his untrimmed
   hair, and not vice versa. Some of the Rabbis have imagined that the
   vine had grown in Paradise, and that somehow the Nazarite's abstinence
   from its fruit was connected with the paradisiacal state, and with our
   fall.

   [204] This part of the service was the same as at the consecration of
   the priests (Lev 8:26).

   [205] In our Authorised Version Terumah' is generally rendered by
   heave-offering,' as in Exodus 29:27; Leviticus 7:14, 32, 34; Numbers
   15:19; 18:8, 11; 31:41; and sometimes simply by offering,' as in Exodus
   25:2; 30:13; 35:5; 36:3, 6: Leviticus 22:12; Numbers 5:9.

   [206] The Mishnah (Bicc. i. 10) expressly mentions the olive-trees
   beyond Jordan,' although R. Joses declared that Biccurim were not
   brought from east of Jordan, since it was not a land flowing with milk
   and honey (Deut 26:15)!

   [207] The expression honey' in Deuteronomy 8:8 must refer to the
   produce of the date-palm.

   [208] The Mishnah enumerates five things of which the amount is not
   fixed in the Law (Peah, i. 1): the corners of the field for the poor;
   the Biccurim; the sacrifices on coming up to the feasts; pious works,
   on which, however, not more than one-fifth of one's property was to be
   spent; and the study of the Law (Josh 1:8). Similarly, these are the
   things of which a man eats the fruit in this world, but their
   possession passes into the next world (literally, "the capital
   continueth for the next, " as in this world we only enjoy the
   interest): to honour father and mother, pious works, peacemaking
   between a man and his neighbour, and the study of the Law, which is
   equivalent to them all.' In Shab. 127, a, six such things are
   mentioned.

   [209] The Mishnah lays down varying rules as to the amount of the
   Challah in different places outside Palestine (Chal. iv. 8).
