                                Prefatory Note.

   The following Catechism explains the constitution and ordinances of a
   Christian Church, and the duties incumbent on its office-bearers and
   members. When it was first published, in 1667, the names of the author
   and of the printer were withheld, and no intimation even was given of
   the place in which it was printed, lest danger should be incurred by
   the publication of a work advocating a form of polity at variance with
   the ecclesiastical system which the Court was at that time striving to
   render, as far as possible, universal in England. Dissenting
   congregations were, however, springing up in different parts of the
   country, and for the guidance of the Independents the Catechism was
   particularly useful. It was so much appreciated, that in the same year
   in which it first appeared, a second edition, with some slight
   differences and emendations, was published; and hence certain
   discrepancies between the following version of it and the one which is
   given in Russell's edition of our author's works, printed from the
   first edition of the Catechism.

   It came to be known as the "Independents' Catechism," and an angry
   attack was made upon it, in 1669, by Benjamin Camfield, rector of
   Whitby, in Derbyshire, in an octavo volume of 347 pages, entitled "A
   Serious Examination of the Independents' Catechism, and therein of the
   Chief Principles of Nonconformity to, and Separation from, the Church
   of England." The Catechism, in the estimation of the rector, was "the
   sink of all nonconforming and separating principles;" and he takes Owen
   to task for inconsistency in holding the Scriptures to be a sufficient
   rule of faith and duty. An attack conducted in this spirit only
   bespeaks the influence which this Catechism was beginning to exert in
   diffusing the principles and consolidating the interests of the
   denomination to which its author belonged. It was the occasion of
   another attack upon Owen, in the shape of a frivolous and bitter
   pamphlet with the title, "A Letter to a Friend concerning some of Dr
   Owen's Principles and Practices," etc., 1670. A copy of the Catechism
   had been sent by the "Friend" to the anonymous author of the pamphlet,
   who forthwith assailed Owen in a strain of pointless invective. The
   first charge against him is, that when vice-chancellor at Oxford, he
   had discountenanced some invidious distinctions in the dress of the
   members of the university, -- "those habits and formalities by which
   persons of distinct qualities and degrees were distinguished in that
   school of learning." It was an offence, too, that "when he was brought
   into Westminster Hall for his witness against Mr Dutton, he refused to
   kiss the book, and professed it to be against his conscience to swear
   with any other ceremony than with eyes and hands lifted up to heaven."
   The pamphlet closes with "An Independent Catechism," in which the views
   of our author are caricatured in a style that is intended to be witty.

   Certain principles laid down in Owen's Catechism, in regard to the
   ruling elder for example, are thought to bear some traces of affinity
   with Presbyterianism. Encouraged especially by the doctrine taught in
   it, that the elders, not the body of the church, are the primary
   subjects of office-power, Baxter wrote to Owen a long document of
   "theses," as the basis of a union between Independents and
   Presbyterians. The reply of the latter will be found in the Appendix to
   his "Life," vol. i. p cxix. "I am still a well-wisher to these
   mathematics," was his remark, when he finally returned the theses to
   their author; and "this," says Baxter, "was the issue of my third
   attempt for union with the Independents." There might be ground for
   supposing that, on terms suggested by the Catechism, a coalition might
   be effected between the two denominations; and Owen himself, in a
   subsequent work (see p. 433 of this volume), indicated circumstances in
   which they could not have been in separation from each other without
   blame. Superior, however, in practical sagacity to his correspondent,
   he might see difficulties where Baxter saw none, or might feel that a
   formula of abstract theses was a waste of ingenuity, so long as the
   mutual confidence was lacking, which alone could affix upon the union
   the seal of permanence. Too often the victim of his own ardour and
   acumen, Baxter was prone to believe that the difficulty of adjusting
   the wayward eddies of human feeling and opinion into one smooth and
   onward current, should yield at once to the same treatment as would
   suffice to work a problem or frame a syllogism. The consummation for
   which he sincerely panted, -- the outward unity of the church under one
   polity, -- seems as yet reserved in providence to grace distant and
   happier times. -- Ed.

              A Short Catechism with an Explication Upon the Same.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 1 -- What doth God require of us in our dependence on him,
   that he may be glorified by us, and we accepted with him?

   Answer -- That we ^aworship him ^bin and by the ways of his own
   appointment.
   ^aMatt. iv. 10; Rev. xiv. 7; Deut. vi. 13, x. 20.
   ^bLev. x. 1-3; Exod. xxiv. 3; Gen. xviii. 19; Josh. xxiii. 6-8; Zech.
   xiv. 16.

   Explication -- By the worship of God inquired after, not that which is
   natural or moral, which is required in the first commandment, is
   intended. Such is our faith and confidence in him, our fear of him, our
   subjection of soul and conscience unto him, as the great sovereign
   Lord, First Cause, Last End, Judge, and Rewarder of all men; the law
   whereof was originally written in the heart of man, and hath been
   variously improved and directed by new revelations and institutions.
   And this worship is called natural upon a double account:--

   First, Because it depends on the nature of God, a due perception and
   understanding whereof makes all this worship indispensably necessary:
   for none can know God but it is his duty to "glorify him as God," --
   that is, to believe in him, love him, trust him, and call upon him;
   which are all therefore cursed that do not, Ps. lxxix. 6; 2 Thess. i.
   8.

   And, secondly, Because it was in the principle of it created with the
   nature of man, as that which suited, directed, and enabled him to
   answer the law of his creation, requiring this obedience of him in his
   dependence on God. And this worship is invariable: but it concerneth
   those outward ways and means whereby God hath appointed that faith, and
   love, and fear of him to be exercised and expressed unto his glory. And
   this kind of worship, though it depend not upon the nature of God, but
   upon his free and arbitrary disposal, and so was of old liable unto
   alterations, yet God did ever strictly require in the several states
   and conditions that his church hath gone through in the world. And this
   is that which most commonly in the Scripture is called by the name of
   "The worship of God," as that whereby all the acceptable actings of the
   souls of men towards him are expressed, and the only way of owning and
   acknowledging him in the world, as also of entertaining a visible
   intercourse with him. This, therefore, he calls for, and requires
   indispensably of all that draw nigh to him, and that because he is "the
   Lord our God," Rev. xiv. 6, 7; Matt. iv. 10; Deut. x. 12, 13. For his
   observance hereof doth he so approve of Abraham, Gen. xviii. 19; and
   sets it down as an everlasting law unto all others, that in a holy
   observation thereof "he will be sanctified in them that come nigh him,"
   Lev. x. 1-3. His commands, also, concerning it are multiplied in the
   Scripture, with the approbation of all those that attend unto them. We
   may not think to find acceptance with God, or to inherit the promises,
   if, supposing ourselves to adhere unto him in worship internal and
   natural, we neglect that which is external and of his free appointment:
   for besides that we renounce thereby our inward dependence on him also,
   in not observing his commands, as Adam did in transgressing an
   institution, we become wholly useless unto all the ends of his glory in
   the world; which is not the way to come to an enjoyment of him. Neither
   do we only express and profess our inward moral-natural worship of God
   hereby, by which means it becomes the principal way and instrument of
   faith and trust exerting themselves in our obedience, but also it is a
   most effectual help and assistance unto the principle of that natural
   worship, strengthening the habit of it, and exciting it unto all
   suitable actings, unto its increase and growth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 2 -- By what means do we come to know that God will thus be
   worshipped?

   Answer -- That God is to be worshipped, and that according to his own
   will and appointment, is a ^aprincipal branch of the law of our
   creation written in our hearts, the ^bsense whereof is renewed in the
   second commandment; but the ways and means of that worship depend
   merely on God's ^csovereign pleasure and institution.
   ^aRom. i. 21, ii. 14, 15; Acts xiv. 16, 17, xvii. 23-31.
   ^bExod. xx. 4-6.
   ^cJer. vii. 31; Exod. xxv. 40; Heb. iii. 1-6; John i. 18.

   Explication -- These two things all men saw by nature:--

   First, That God, however they mistook in their apprehensions of him,
   would be, and was to be, worshipped with some outward solemn worship;
   so that although some are reported to have even cast off all knowledge
   and sense of a Divine Being, yet never any were heard of that came to
   an acknowledgment of any God, true or false, but they all consented
   that he was constantly and solemnly to be worshipped, and that not only
   by individual persons, but by societies together; that so they might
   own and honour him whom they took for their God. And thus far outward
   worship is required in the first commandment, -- namely, that the
   inward be exercised and expressed. When we take God for our God, we
   take him to worship him, Deut. x. 12, 13. Other thoughts, -- namely, of
   inward worship without outward expression, at all or any time, or in
   any way, -- are but a covert unto atheism. And, --

   Secondly, This also they were led to an apprehension of by the same
   light whereby they are "a law unto themselves," Rom. ii. 14, that God
   would be worshipped in the way and by the means that he himself
   appointed and approved: whence none among the heathen themselves
   undertook to appoint ways and ceremonies of worship, but still they
   pretended to derive the knowledge of them from the gods themselves; of
   whom they reckoned that every one would be worshipped in his own way.
   And because, notwithstanding this pretence, being left of God and
   deluded of Satan, they did invent false and foolish ways of worship,
   not only not appointed of God, but such as were unsuited unto those
   inbred notions which they had of his nature and excellencies, the
   apostle convinces and disproves them, as men acting against the light
   of nature and principles of reason, Rom. i. 20, 21, they might have
   seen that in their idolatry they answered not their own inbred
   conceptions of the divine power and Godhead, so as to "glorify him as
   God;" and in the like manner doth he argue at large, Acts xvii. 22-31.
   But beyond this the inbred light of nature could not conduct any of the
   sons of men; this alone is contained in the first precept. That God was
   to be worshipped they knew, and that he was to be worshipped by ways
   and means of his own appointment they knew; but what those means were
   they knew not. These always depended on God's sovereign will and
   pleasure, and he made them known to whom he pleased, Ps. cxlvii. 19,
   20. And although some of the ways which he doth appoint may seem to
   have a great compliance in them unto the light of nature, yet in his
   worship he accepts them not on that account, but merely on that of his
   own institution; and this as he hath declared his will about in the
   second commandment, so he hath severely forbidden the addition of our
   own inventions unto what he hath appointed, sending us for instruction
   unto Him alone whom he hath endowed with sovereign authority to reveal
   his will and ordain his worship, John i. 18; Matt. xvii. 5; 1 Chron.
   xvi. 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 3 -- How, then, are these ways and means of the worship of God
   made known unto us?

   Answer -- In and by the written word only, which contains a full and
   perfect revelation of the will of God as to his whole worship and all
   the concernments of it.
   John v. 39; Isa. viii. 20; Luke xvi. 29; 2 Tim. iii. 15-17; 2 Pet. i.
   19; Deut. iv. 2, xii. 32; Josh. i. 7; Prov. xxx. 6; Rev. xxii. 18, 19;
   Isa. xxix. 13, 14.

   Explication -- The end wherefore God granted his word unto the church
   was, that thereby it might be instructed in his mind and will as to
   what concerns the worship and obedience that he requireth of us, and
   which is accepted with him. This the whole Scripture itself everywhere
   declares and speaks out unto all that do receive it; as 2 Tim. iii.
   15-17, with the residue of the testimonies above recited, do declare.
   It supposeth, it declareth, that of ourselves we are ignorant how God
   is, how he ought to be, worshipped, Isa. viii. 20. Moreover, it
   manifests him to be a "jealous God," exercising that holy property of
   his nature in an especial manner about his worship, rejecting and
   despising every thing that is not according to his will, that is not of
   his institution, Exod. xx. 4-6.

   That we may know what is so, he hath made a revelation of his mind and
   will in his written word, -- that is, the Scripture. And to the end
   that we might expect instruction from thence alone in his worship, and
   act therein accordingly, --

   First, He sends us and directs us thereunto expressly for that purpose,
   Isa. viii. 20; Luke xvi. 29; John v. 39; and not once intimates in the
   least any other way or means of instruction unto that end.

   Secondly, He frequently affirms that it is sufficient, able, and
   perfect to guide us therein, 2 Tim. iii. 15-17; 2 Pet. i. 19; Ps. xix.
   7-9. And whereas he hath expressly given it unto us for that end, if
   there be any want or defect therein it must arise from hence, that
   either God would not or could not give unto us a perfect revelation of
   his will; neither of which can be imagined.

   Thirdly, He hath commanded us to observe all whatsoever he hath
   appointed therein, and not to make any addition thereunto, Josh. i. 7;
   Deut. iv. 2, xii. 32; Prov. xxx. 6; Rev. xxii. 18, 19. And, --

   Fourthly, Peculiarly interdicted us the use of any such things as are
   of the institution or appointment of men, Isa. xxix. 13, 14. So that
   from the Scriptures alone are we to learn what is accepted with God in
   his worship.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 4 -- Have these ways and means been always the same from the
   beginning?

   Answer -- No; but God hath altered and changed them at sundry seasons,
   according to the counsel of his own will, so as he saw necessary for
   his own glory and the edification of his church.
   Gen. ii. 16, 17, xvii. 10, 11; Exod. xii. 3-24, Exod. xx.xxv. 9; Heb.
   i. 1, 2, ix. 10-12.

   Explication -- The external worship whereof we speak being, as was
   showed before, not natural or moral, arising necessarily from the
   dependence of the rational creature on God as its first cause, chiefest
   good, last end, and sovereign Lord, but proceeding from the mere will
   and pleasure of God, determining how he will be honoured and glorified
   in the world, was always alterable by him by whom it was appointed. And
   whereas, ever since the entrance of sin into the world, God had always
   respect unto the promise of the Lord Christ and his mediation, in whom
   alone he will be glorified, and faith in whom he aimed to begin and
   increase in all his worship, he hath suited his institutions of the
   means thereof to that dispensation of light and knowledge of him which
   he was pleased at any time to grant. Thus, immediately after the giving
   of the promise, he appointed sacrifices for the great means of his
   worship; as to glorify himself expressly by men's offering unto him of
   the principal good things which he had given them, so to instruct them
   in the faith, and confirm them in the expectation of the great
   sacrifice for sin that was to be offered by the promised seed, Gen. iv.
   3, 4; Heb. xi. 4. These were the first instituted worship of God in the
   world after the entrance of sin. Hereunto he nextly added circumcision,
   as an express sign of the covenant, with the grace of it, which he
   called Abraham and his seed unto by Jesus Christ, Gen. xvii. 10, 11.
   And to the same general end and purpose he afterwards superadded the
   passover, with its attendant institutions, Exod. xii. 3-24; and then
   the whole law of institutions contained in ordinances, by the ministry
   of angels on mount Sinai, Exod. xx. So by sundry degrees he built up
   that fabric of his outward worship, which was suited, in his infinite
   wisdom, unto his own glory and the edification of his church, until the
   exhibition of the promised seed, or the coming of Christ in the flesh,
   and the accomplishment of the work of his mediation, Heb. i. 1, 2: for
   unto that season were those ordinances to serve, and no longer, chap.
   ix. 10-12, and then were they removed by the same authority whereby
   they were instituted and appointed, Col. ii. 14, 18-20. So that though
   God would never allow that men upon what pretence soever, should make
   any alteration in the worship appointed by him, by adding unto it
   anything of their own, or omitting aught that he had commanded, either
   in matter or manner, notwithstanding that he knew that it was to abide
   but for a season, but commanded all men straitly to attend to the
   observation of it whilst it was by him continued in force, Mal. iv. 4;
   yet he always reserved unto himself the sovereign power of altering,
   changing, or utterly abolishing it at his own pleasure: which authority
   he exerted in the gospel as to all the mere institutions of the Old
   Testament. Whilst they continued he enforced them with moral reasons,
   [such] as his own holiness and authority. But those reasons prove not
   any of those institutions to be moral, unless they ensue upon those
   reasons alone, and are nowhere else commanded; for being once
   instituted and commanded, they are to be enforced with moral
   considerations, taken from the nature of God and our duty in reference
   unto his authority. So saith he, "Thou shalt reverence my sanctuary, I
   am the Lord;" which no more proves that a moral duty than that enjoined
   upon the same foundation, Lev. xi. 44, "I am the Lord your God: ye
   shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am
   holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping
   thing that creepeth upon the earth." Not defiling ourselves with the
   touching or eating of creeping things is now no moral duty since the
   institution is ceased, although it be enforced by many moral
   considerations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 5 -- Is there any farther alteration to be expected in or of
   those institutions and ordinances of worship which are revealed and
   appointed in the gospel?

   Answer -- No; the last complete revelation of the will of God being
   made by the Son, who is Lord of all, his commands and institutions are
   to be observed inviolably unto the end of the world, without
   alteration, diminution, or addition.
   Heb. i. 1, 2, x. 25-27; Matt. xxviii. 20; 1 Cor. xi. 26; 1 Tim. vi. 14.

   Explication -- It was showed before that all the institutions of the
   Old Testament had respect unto the coming of Christ in the flesh, who
   was "the end of the law," Rom. x. 4; and thereupon they were subject to
   alteration and abolition upon a twofold account:--

   1. Because that which they were appointed principally to instruct the
   church in, and to direct it unto the expectation of, was, upon his
   coming, accomplished and fulfilled; so that their end was absolutely
   taken away, and they could no more truly teach the mind and will of
   God, for they would still direct unto that which was to come, after it
   was past and accomplished. And this is that which the apostle Paul so
   variously proves and fully confirms in his Epistle to the Hebrews,
   especially in the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth chapters.

   2. The Lord Christ, during their continuance, was to come as the Lord
   over his whole house, with more full and ample authority than any of
   those whom God had employed in the institution of his ordinances of old
   were intrusted withal: Heb. i. 1-3, "He spake in time past by the
   prophets," but now "by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all."
   Chap. iii. 6, "Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we."
   And, therefore, they were all to be at his disposal, to confirm or
   remove, as he saw reason and occasion. And this he did, -- (1.)
   Virtually, in the sacrifice of himself, or the blood of his cross,
   fulfilling and finishing of them all, John xix. 30; "breaking down the
   middle wall of partition; abolishing in his flesh the enmity, even the
   law of commandments contained in ordinances;" "blotting out the
   hand-writing of ordinances," he "took it out of the way, nailing it to
   his cross," Eph. ii. 14, 15; Col. ii. 14. (2.) Authoritatively, by his
   Spirit in the apostles, and the doctrine of the gospel preached by
   them: Acts xv. 10, 11, "Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke
   upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were
   able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus
   Christ we shall be saved, even as they." Gal. iii. 24, 25, "Wherefore
   the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be
   justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer
   under a schoolmaster." Chap. v. 1-4. And, (3.) Eventually or
   providentially, when he caused sacrifice and offering to cease, by the
   prince of the people, that came with an army making desolate, to
   destroy both city and sanctuary, Dan. ix. 26, 27, according to his
   prediction, Matt. xxiv. 2. But now, under the New Testament, the
   worship that is appointed in the gospel is founded in and built upon
   what is already past and accomplished, -- namely, the death and life of
   Jesus Christ, with the sacrifice and atonement for sin made thereby, 1
   Cor. xi. 23-26; which can never be again performed; neither is there
   any thing else to the same purpose either needful or possible, Heb. x.
   26. So that there is not any ground left for any new institution of
   worship, or any alteration in those that are already instituted. Nor,
   --

   Secondly, Can any one be expected to come from God with a greater and
   more full authority for the revelation of his mind than that wherewith
   his only Son was accompanied; which yet must be, if any alterations
   were to be made in the appointments of worship that he hath instituted
   in the gospel.

   For no inferior nor an equal authority can abolish or alter that which
   is already appointed, so as to give satisfaction unto the consciences
   of men in obedience unto such alterations. And, therefore, because
   there arose not a prophet like unto Moses under the Old Testament,
   there could be no alteration made in his institutions, but the church
   was bound severely to observe them all until the coming of Christ: Mal.
   iv. 4, "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto
   him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments;" and that
   because "there arose not a prophet afterwards in Israel like unto
   Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face," Deut. xxxiv. 10. And our
   apostle, to prove the right of Christ to alter the ordinances of the
   law, lays his foundation in manifesting that he was above the angels:
   Heb. i. 4, "Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by
   inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they;" and that because
   the law was given by the ministry of angels, chap. ii. 2; -- and so
   also that he was greater than Moses, chap. 3:3, 5, "For this man was
   counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath
   builded the house hath more honour than the house. Moses verily was
   faithful in all his house, as a servant, but Christ as a son over his
   own house;" because Moses was the lawgiver, and the mediator between
   God and man in the giving of the law. Now, if this be the sole
   foundation and warrant of the alteration made of Mosaical ordinances by
   Christ, -- namely, that he was greater and exalted above all those
   whose ministry was used in the dispensation of the law, -- unless some
   can be thought to be greater, and exalted in authority above the Son of
   God, there can be no alteration expected in the institutions of the
   gospel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 6 -- May not such an estate of faith and perfection in
   obedience be attained in this life, as wherein believers may be freed
   from all obligation unto the observation of gospel institutions?

   Answer -- No; for the ordinances and institutions of the gospel being
   inseparably annexed unto the evangelical administration of the covenant
   of grace, they may not be left unobserved, disused, or omitted, whilst
   we are to walk before God in that covenant, without contempt of the
   covenant itself, as also of the wisdom and authority of Jesus Christ.
   Heb. iii. 3-6; Rom. vi. 3-6; Luke xxii. 19, 20; 1 Cor. xi. 23-26; Heb.
   x. 25; Rev. ii. 5, iii. 3.

   Explication -- All our faith, all our obedience in this life, whatever
   may be obtained or attained unto therein, it all belongs unto our
   walking with God in the covenant of grace, wherein God dwells with men,
   and they are his people, and God himself is with them to be their God.
   Other ways of communion with him, of obedience unto him, of enjoyment
   of him, on this side heaven and glory, he hath not appointed nor
   revealed. Now, this is the covenant that God hath made with his people,
   "That he will put his laws into their mind, and write them in their
   hearts, and will be to them a God, and they shall be to him a people;
   and he will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and
   their iniquities will he remember no more," Heb. viii. 9-12. And
   whatever men attain unto, it is by virtue of the grace of that
   covenant; nor is there any grace promised in the covenant to lead men
   in this life, or to give them up into a state of perfection, short of
   glory. Unto this covenant are the institutions of gospel-worship
   annexed, and unto that administration of it which is granted unto the
   church upon the coming and death of Christ. Without a renunciation and
   relinquishment of that covenant and the grace of it, these institutions
   cannot be omitted or deserted. If men suppose that they have attained
   to an estate wherein they need neither the grace of God, nor the mercy
   of God, nor the blood of Christ, nor the Spirit of Christ, it is not
   much material what they think of the ordinances of worship. Their pride
   and folly, without that mercy which is taught, promised, and exhibited
   in those ordinances, will speedily be their ruin. Besides, the Lord
   Christ is the absolute Lord "over his own house," Heb. iii. 3-6; and he
   hath given out the laws whereby he will have it guided and ruled whilst
   it is in this world. In and by these laws are his ordinances of worship
   established. For any persons, on what pretence soever, to plead an
   exemption from the obligation of those laws, it is nothing but to cast
   off the lordship and dominion of Christ himself. And yet farther to
   secure our obedience in this matter, he hath expressly commanded the
   continuance of them until his coming unto judgment, as in the places
   above quoted will appear.

   Question 7 -- What are the chief things that we ought to aim at in our
   observation of the institutions of Christ in the gospel?

   Answer -- ^aTo sanctify the name of God; ^bto own and avow our
   professed subjection to the Lord Jesus Christ; ^cto build up ourselves
   in our most holy faith; and, ^dto testify and confirm our mutual love,
   as we are believers.
   ^aLev. x. 3; Heb. xii. 28, 29.
   ^bDeut. xxvi. 17; Josh. xxiv. 22; 2 Cor. viii. 5.
   ^cEph. iv. 11-16; Jude 20.
   ^d1 Cor. x. 16, 17.

   Explication -- That we may profitably and comfortably, unto the glory
   of God and our own edification, be exercised in the observation of the
   institutions and worship of God, we are always to consider what are the
   ends for which God hath appointed them and commanded our attendance
   unto them, that so our observance of them may be the obedience of
   faith. For, what end soever God hath appointed them unto, for that end
   are they useful and effectual, and to no other. If we come to them for
   any other end, if we use them for any other purpose or with any other
   design, if we look for any thing in them or by them, but what God hath
   appointed them to communicate unto us, we dishonour God and deceive our
   own souls. This we ought diligently to inquire into, to know not only
   what God requires of us, but wherefore also he requires it, and what he
   aims at therein; some of the principal things whereof are enumerated in
   this answer. And it is well known how horribly many of the institutions
   of the gospel have been by some (especially the Papists) abused, by a
   neglect of the ends of God in them, and imposing new ends of their own
   upon them, unto superstition and idolatry. Grace is ascribed unto the
   outward observance of them, whereas all grace is of the promise, and
   the promise in the covenant is given only to the faith of the right
   observers. The elements in the sacrament of the eucharist are turned
   into a god, first worshipped and then devoured, with many the like
   abominations.

   Question 8 -- How may we sanctify the name of God in the use of gospel
   institutions?

   Answer -- ^aBy a holy reverence of his sovereign authority appointing
   of them; ^ba holy regard unto his special presence in them; ^cfaith in
   his promises annexed to them; ^ddelight in his will, wisdom, love, and
   grace, manifested in them; ^econstancy and perseverance in obedience
   unto him in their due observation.

   Explication -- This is the first thing that God requireth us to attend
   unto in the celebration of the ordinances of his worship, -- namely,
   that we therein sanctify his name, the greatest duty that we are called
   unto in this world. This he lays down as the general rule of all we do
   herein: Lev. x. 3, "I will," saith he, "be sanctified in them that come
   nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified." Whatever we do
   in his worship, we must do it that he may be sanctified, or whatever we
   do is an abomination to him. Now, the principal ways how we may herein
   sanctify the name of God are expressed; as, --

   First, When in every ordinance we consider his appointment of it, and
   submit our souls and consciences unto his authority therein; which if
   we observe any thing in his worship but what he hath appointed we
   cannot do. Not formality, not custom, not the precepts of men, not any
   thing but the authority and command of God, is to be respected in this
   obedience. This is the first thing that faith regards in divine
   worship; it rests not in any thing, closeth not with any thing, but
   what it discerns that God hath commanded, and therein it eyes his
   authority as he requireth it: Mal. i. 6, "If I be a father, where is
   mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear?" Rom. xiv. 11, "As
   I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue
   shall confess to God." Reverence, then, unto the authority of God
   appointing his worship is a principal means of sanctifying the name of
   God therein. This was the solemn sanction of all his institutions of
   old: Deut. vi. 4-7, "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: and
   thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
   soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee
   this day, shall be in thy heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently
   unto thy children." And the observation of them he presseth on this
   account, that the people might fear that "glorious and fearful name,
   The Lord thy God," Deut. xxviii. 58; which name he had so often engaged
   in his commands, saying, "Thou shalt do it; I am the Lord." And in the
   New Testament, our Lord Jesus Christ proposeth his authority as the
   foundation of his commanding, and our observation of all the
   institutions of the gospel: Matt. xxviii. 18-20, "Jesus came and spake
   unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
   Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to
   observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you." And he is to be
   considered in all our obedience as the great and only lawgiver of his
   church; as the "one lawgiver, who is able to save and destroy," James
   iv. 12; the sovereign Lord over his "house," Heb. iii. 4-6, unto whom
   every knee is to bow and every conscience to be in subjection: and he
   who heareth not his voice is to be cut off from the people of God: Acts
   iii. 23, "It shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear
   that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people."

   Secondly, God hath frequently promised his special presence in and with
   his instituted ordinances of old, both unto the things themselves and
   the places wherein they were according to his appointment to be
   celebrated, those places being also his special institution. Under the
   New Testament, all difference of and respect unto place is taken away:
   John iv. 21, 23, "The hour cometh when ye shall neither in this
   mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. But the hour
   cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father
   in spirit and truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him." And
   we are commanded in all places equally to make our prayers and
   supplications. But his presence is promised and continued with the due
   celebration of the things themselves by him appointed for his service:
   Matt. xxviii. 20, "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I
   have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
   the world." In them is the "tabernacle of God with men," and he "dwells
   among them, and they are his people," Rev. xxi. 3; the promise of
   Christ being, that "where two or three are gathered together in his
   name, there he will be in the midst of them," Matt. xviii. 19, 20. And
   this promised presence of God, or Christ, consisteth, -- 1. In the
   power and efficacy which he by his Spirit implants upon his ordinances
   to communicate his grace and mercy unto his church, it being his
   covenant that his Spirit shall accompany his word for ever unto that
   purpose, Isa. lix. 21. 2. In the special blessing which he gives his
   people in those duties, both in the acceptance of them and testifying
   his good-will unto them: Exod. xxix. 42, 43, 45, "At the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, there I will meet with the children of
   Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. And I will
   dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God;" Zech. ii.
   10, 11; Ezek. xx. 40, 41, "I will accept you with your sweet savour;"
   chap. xliii. 27; -- in both giving them intimate communion with himself
   by Jesus Christ, 1 John i. 3. By all these he gives that special
   presence, which he requires an especial reverence and regard of faith
   unto, whereby his name is yet farther sanctified.

   Thirdly, God hath given special promises, or promises of his special
   grace, unto them that attend upon him in his worship in a due manner.
   And hereunto also belongs that sacred relation which, by virtue of
   divine institution, is between the sacramental elements and the
   especial graces of the covenant which they exhibit and confirm; and the
   mixing of these promises with faith, according as they are appropriated
   unto any particular institution, belongs also to the right
   sanctification of the mind of God. So also, --

   Fourthly, Doth our delight in them. Now, this delight in the worship of
   God, so much commended in the Scripture, and proposed unto our example,
   consists not in any carnal self-pleasing, or satisfaction in the
   outward modes or manner of the performance of divine worship; but it is
   a holy, soul-refreshing contemplation on the will, wisdom, grace, and
   condescension of God, in that he is pleased, of his own sovereign mere
   will and grace, so to manifest himself unto such poor sinful creatures
   as we are, so to condescend unto our weakness, so to communicate
   himself unto us, so to excite and draw forth our souls unto himself,
   and to give us such pledges of his gracious intercourse with us by
   Jesus Christ. By the contemplation of these things is the soul drawn
   forth to delight in God.

   Lastly, Whereas great opposition lies oftentimes against the church's
   obedience unto God in this matter, and much persecution befalls it on
   that account, -- great weariness also being apt, from the remainders of
   unbelief, carnal wisdom, indwelling sin, weakness of the flesh in
   believers themselves, to arise in the course thereof, and many
   temptations also beset them on every hand, to turn them aside from the
   way of truth and holiness, -- constancy and perseverance in the due and
   orderly celebration of all the ordinances of the gospel belongs unto
   this duty. And this perseverance respecteth both the things themselves
   and the manner of their performance, both which are of the highest
   concernment for us diligently to attend unto.

   1. As to the things themselves. Herein do we principally glorify God
   and give due honour unto Jesus Christ, when we abide in our professed
   subjection unto him and observance of his commands against
   difficulties, oppositions, and persecutions. This he taketh notice of,
   Rev. ii. 13, "Thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith,
   even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was
   slain among you, where Satan dwelleth." And this he requireth of us
   indispensably if we will be his disciples, or ever hope to obtain the
   reward: Matt. x. 38, 39, "He that taketh not his cross, and followeth
   after me, is not worthy of me;" and it is "he that shall endure unto
   the end" that shall be "saved," chap. xxiv. 13. And unto them who are
   "faithful unto death," and them alone, doth he give the "crown of
   life," Rev. ii. 10; giving us caution not to "lose those things which
   we have wrought," that we may "receive a full reward," 2 John 8.

   2. And as to the manner of their performance, two things are to be
   regarded in this duty of perseverance, and the sanctification of the
   name of God therein:-- (1.) The inward principle of our obedience, our
   faith and love; which are to be preserved from decay: Rev. ii. 4, 5, "I
   have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
   Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the
   first works." Chap. iii. 3, "Remember how thou hast received and heard,
   and hold fast, and repent." (2.) The outward manner of observance;
   which is to be kept entire, according to the primitive institution of
   Christ: 1 Cor. xi. 23, "I have received of the Lord that which also I
   delivered unto you," -- not admitting of any corruptions in it, to
   avoid the greatest trouble: Gal. v. 11, "And I, brethren, if I yet
   preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 9 -- How do we in our observation profess our subjection unto
   the Lord Jesus Christ and his gospel?

   Answer -- In that being all of them, first appointed by him as the
   head, lawgiver, and king of his church; and, secondly, made by him the
   ensigns and tokens of his kingdom and subjects; in their due
   observation principally consists that profession of him and his name
   which he so often calleth us unto, and so indispensably requireth at
   our hands.
   Matt. xxviii. 18-20; 1 Cor. xi. 23; Heb. iii. 6,, xii. 25John xiii. 13,
   viii. 31, xiv. 15, 21, 23, xv. 14, 17, xiii. 35, xv. 14; Luke ix. 26;
   Rom. x. 10; 1 John ii. 3, 4.

   Explication -- The ground and reason of this duty is evident. The Lord
   Jesus Christ straitly enjoins all his disciples the profession of his
   name, and lays it on them as indispensable unto salvation: Rom. x. 10,
   "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth
   confession," or profession, "is made unto salvation;" John xii. 42-45.
   Now, this profession of the name of Christ, which is so much abused and
   mistaken in the world, consists in the keeping of his commandments:
   John xv. 14, "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you." So
   also, Matt. xxviii. 20, his disciples are to be taught to do and
   observe whatever he commandeth. Now, whereas he is the head and king of
   the church, the next immediate and special lawgiver of it, appointing
   unto it all his ordinances and its whole worship, as it becomes him who
   is lord of the house, the institutions of the gospel worship are his
   most especial commands; and in their observation consists that
   profession of him which he requires of us; therein doth he call them
   out of the world by profession whom he hath redeemed out of it by his
   blood, 2 Cor. vi. 15-18; Rev. v. 9. In these he exerciseth his kingly
   or lordly power over his church, Heb. iii. 6; and in the willing
   obedience of his people, gathering themselves unto the ensigns of his
   rule, he is glorified in the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 10 -- How do we in and by them build up ourselves in our most
   holy faith?

   Answer -- By the exercise of that communion with God in Christ Jesus
   which, in their due observation, he graciously invites and admits us
   unto, for the increase of his grace in us, and the testification of his
   love and good-will towards us.
   Gen. xvii. 10; Lev. xxvi. 11, 12; Prov. ix. 5, 6; Ezek. xxxvi. 27, 28;
   Zech. xiv. 16, 17; Matt. xxvi. 27, 28; Rom. vi. 3.

   Explication -- The next and principal ends of all instituted worship,
   in respect of believers, are, the increase of the grace of God in them,
   their edification in their most holy faith, and the testification of
   the good-will of God unto them: Eph. iv. 11-16, "And he gave some,
   apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors
   and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
   ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in
   the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
   perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
   that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried
   about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning
   craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but speaking the truth
   in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even
   Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
   that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in
   the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the
   edifying of itself in love." Whence, also, is that prayer of the
   apostle for the blessing of God upon the church, in the use of them:
   Eph. iii. 16-19, "That he would grant you, according to the riches of
   his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner
   man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being
   rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints
   what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the
   love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with
   all the fulness of God." For these ends, and with a design to have them
   accomplished in and upon their souls, ought they to attend unto them:
   James i. 21, "Receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able
   to save your souls." 1 Pet. ii. 2, "As new-born babes, desire the
   sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby." Unto the effecting
   of these ends, especially the increase and establishment of our faith,
   are they suited and appointed of God; whereon all their efficacy doth
   depend. In their due observation doth God give out that supply of grace
   which he hath promised, Eph. iii. 16-19. And thus also is faith
   exercised in an especial manner; which is the only ordinary means of
   its growth and increase. Habits, both acquired and infused, are
   increased and strengthened by frequent acts on suitable objects: Hos.
   vi. 3, "Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord." In the
   celebration of gospel ordinances, God in Christ proposeth himself in an
   intimate manner to the believing soul as his God and reward; and his
   love in Christ, in an especial manner, in some ordinances. So doth
   Christ also exhibit himself thereunto: Rev. iii. 20, "Behold, I stand
   at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I
   will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me." Faith,
   therefore, directed by the word to rest in God, to receive the Lord
   Christ in the observation of his ordinances, is excited, increased,
   strengthened, and that in answer unto the appointment and promises of
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 11 -- How are mutual love and communion among believers
   testified and confirmed in their observation?

   Answer -- In that they are appointed by the Lord Christ for that end,
   and in their own nature, as attended unto in their assemblies, are in
   an especial manner suited unto that purpose.
   John xiii. 35; 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, xi. 18, 19; Eph. iv. 3-6.

   Explication -- The principles of mutual, spiritual love among believers
   arise from their relation unto one Father: Matt. xxiii. 9, "One is your
   Father, which is in heaven," who giveth unto all them that believe in
   Christ "power to become the sons of God," John i. 12; and their being
   all children of the same family, -- that family in heaven and earth
   which is called after the name of God, the Father of it, as the Father
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, Eph. iii. 14, 15; -- and unto Christ Jesus as
   their elder brother, who "is not ashamed to call them brethren," Heb.
   ii. 11, being by him born of God; -- and from their participation of
   one and the self-same Spirit, which dwelleth in them, as they are "the
   temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in them," 1 Cor. iii. 16;
   as also in all the fruits of that one Spirit, 1 Cor. xii. 4-8, and in
   that one faith and hope whereunto they are called: Eph. iv. 3-6,
   "Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
   There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of
   your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of
   all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all." And that love
   which is not built on these principles and foundations is not
   evangelical, whatever other ground it may have, or occasion it may
   pretend unto. Communion of saints consists in their mutual love, duly
   exercised according to rule; and all communion is an effect of union.
   In union therefore must lie the springs of love, and this consists in a
   joint incorporation of believers into Christ; "for as the body is one,
   and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many,
   are one body, so also is Christ; for by one Spirit we are all baptized
   into one body;" -- and this they have by the means before mentioned,
   namely, their adoption, faith, and inhabitation of the Spirit. Now, in
   the joint celebration of the ordinances of God's worship, they all
   together make profession of these principles, and act that one faith,
   hope, and love jointly, whereof they are made partakers, and thereby
   grow up more and more into the head "by that which every joint
   supplieth," Eph. iv. 16. And some of them are peculiarly designed by
   the Lord Christ for the testification of their love and union among
   themselves: 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, "The cup of blessing which we bless, is
   it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break,
   is it not the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are
   one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 12 -- What is principally to be attended unto by us in the
   manner of the celebration of the worship of God, and observation of the
   institutions and ordinances of the gospel?

   Answer -- That we observe and do all whatsoever the Lord Christ hath
   commanded us to observe, in the way that he hath prescribed; and that
   we add nothing unto or in the observation of them that is of man's
   invention or appointment.
   Deut. iv. 2, xii. 32; Jer. vii. 27; Matt. xv. 9, 13, xvii. 5; Col. ii.
   6; Matt. xxviii. 20 Heb. iii. 3-6; 1 Cor. xi. 23; Rev. xxii. 18, 19; 1
   Chron. xvi. 7; Isa. xxix. 13.

   Explication -- This was in part spoken to before on the third question,
   where it was showed that the Scripture is the only way and means
   whereby God hath revealed what that worship is which he will accept in
   and of the church. Here, moreover, as to the duty of the church in this
   matter, three things are asserted:--

   First, That we are to observe and do all whatsoever the Lord Christ
   hath commanded us to observe. This lies plain in the command, Mat.
   xxviii. 20, "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
   commanded you." And we are directed unto it in the injunction given us
   from heaven, to "hear," -- that is, to obey him in all things, Matt.
   xvii. 5, he being the prophet to whose teachings and instructions we
   owe obedience, on pain of extermination from among the people of God, 1
   Cor. x. 16, 17, xi. 18, 19; Acts iii. 22, 23. Whatever he hath
   appointed, commanded, revealed as the will of God to be observed in or
   about the worship of God, that is to kept and observed by the church
   inviolably; for if we are his friends and disciples, we will keep his
   commandments. No disuse, of what continuance soever, can discharge us
   from the observation of institutions. After the feast of tabernacles
   had been disused from the times of Joshua unto the return from the
   captivity, the restoration of it was required of God and accepted with
   him, Neh. viii. 17. No abuse, of how high a nature soever, can absolve
   us from obedience unto an institution, 1 Cor. xi. 20-23. After the
   great abuse of the Lord's supper in that church, the apostle recalls
   them again unto the observation of it, according to the institution of
   Christ. And after the defilement of all the ordinances of the gospel,
   under the antichristian apostasy, yet the temple and the alter are to
   be measured again, Rev. xi. 1, and the tabernacle of God was again to
   be raised amongst men, chap. xxi. 3. No opposition, no persecution, can
   give the church a dispensation wholly to omit and lay aside the use of
   any thing that the Lord Christ hath commanded to be observed in the
   worship of God, whilst we are under the obligation of that great rule,
   Acts iv. 19, "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto
   you more than unto God, judge ye." It is true, in the observation of
   positive institutions, we may have regard unto rules and prescriptions
   of prudence, as to times, places, and seasons, that by no inadvertency
   or miscarriage of ours, or advantage taken by the adversaries of the
   truth, the edification of the church be hindered; -- so the disciples
   met with "the doors shut for fear of the Jews," John xx. 19; and Paul
   met with the disciples in the night, in "an upper chamber," for the
   celebration of all the ordinances of the church, Acts xx. 7, 8; -- yet,
   as to the obligation unto their observation, it indispensably binds us,
   and that always, and that as to all the institutions of Christ
   whatever: Heb. x. 25, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves
   together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so
   much the more, as ye see the day approaching." To dispense with
   Christ's commands practically is unlawful, much more doctrinally, most
   of all authoritatively, as the pope takes on himself to do. This, then,
   is the church's duty, to search out all the commands of Christ recorded
   in the gospel, and to yield obedience unto them. We are not, in this
   matter, to take up merely with what we find in practice amongst others,
   no, though they be men good or holy. The duty of the church, and,
   consequently, of every member of it in his place and station, is to
   search the Scriptures, to inquire into the mind of Christ, and that
   with hearts and minds prepared unto a due observation of whatever shall
   be discovered to be his will.

   Secondly, Whatever belongs unto the worship of God, in the way or
   manner whereby any of the ordinances of Christ is to be performed,
   comes also under the command of Christ, which is duly to be attended
   unto and observed. Indeed, whatever is of this nature appointed by
   Christ, it doth therefore belong to the worship of God; and what is not
   so appointed neither doth nor can be any part thereof. Of this nature
   is the celebration of all other ordinances with prayer, for every thing
   is "sanctified by the word of God and prayer," 1 Tim. iv. 5; of some of
   them indispensably in the assemblies of the church, 1 Cor. x. 16, 17,
   xi. 20,24, 25, 33; with care in the observation of the general rules of
   love, modesty, condescension, and prudence, "doing all things decently
   and in order," 1 Cor. xi. 33, xiv. 40; gestures in some sacred actions,
   Matt. xxvi. 20, 26-28; John xiii. 23; -- all which the church is
   diligently to inquire into, as things that belong to the pattern of the
   house of God, "the goings out thereof and the comings in thereof, the
   forms thereof and the ordinances thereof, with the laws thereof,"
   promised to be showed unto it, Ezek. xliii. 11. To attend carefully to
   their observation is its duty, being left at liberty as to all other
   circumstances; which no authority of man can give any real relation to
   the worship of God unto. Therein lies the exercise of that spirit of
   wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of the mystery of the gospel,
   which is given unto the church, Eph. i. 17, 18. It was the wisdom of
   the ancient church to do and observe all that God appointed, in the way
   and manner that he had prescribed for their observance: Deut. iv. 5, 6,
   "Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my
   God commanded me. Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom
   and your understanding." And herein is the command of Christ kept
   inviolate and unblamable. The persuasion of some, that the Lord hath
   not prescribed all things wherein his worship is concerned, seems to
   proceed from a negligence in inquiring after what he hath so
   prescribed. And when once that persuasion is entertained, all farther
   inquiry is superseded and despised; for to what end should any one seek
   after that which he is satisfied cannot be found? as that which is not
   cannot be. But this mistake will be elsewhere more fully discovered.

   Thirdly, A principal part of the duty of the church in this matter is,
   to take care that nothing be admitted or practised in the worship of
   God, or as belonging thereunto, which is not instituted and appointed
   by the Lord Christ. In its care, faithfulness, and watchfulness herein
   consists the principal part of its loyalty unto the Lord Jesus, as the
   head, king, and lawgiver of his church; and which to stir us up into,
   he hath left so many severe interdictions and prohibitions in his word
   against all additions to his commands, upon any pretence whatever; of
   which afterward.

   Question 13 -- Are not some institutions of the New Testament ceased as
   to any obligation unto their observation, and therefore now rightly
   disused?

   Answer -- ^aSome symbolical tokens of moral duties, occasionally used,
   only for present instruction in those duties, are mentioned in the
   gospel, without any intention to oblige believers unto the formal
   constant use and repetition of them; and ^bsome temporary appointments
   relating unto gifts in the church, bestowed only for a season on the
   first plantation of the gospel, are ceased; -- but ^cno institution or
   command of Christ, given unto the whole church, relating unto the
   evangelical administration of the new covenant, for the use and benefit
   of all believers, doth or shall cease to the end of the world, nor can
   be wholly omitted without a violation of the authority of Jesus Christ
   himself.
   ^aJohn xiii. 12-15; Rom. xvi. 16; 1 Cor. xvi. 20; 1 Tim. v. 10.
   ^bMark vi. 13; James v. 14.
   ^cMatt. xxviii. 20; 1 Tim. vi. 14; 1 Cor. xi. 26.

   Explication -- Mention is made in the Scriptures of sundry things
   practised by the Lord Christ and his apostles, which being then in
   common use among men, were occasionally made by them symbolical
   instructions in moral duties. Such were washing of feet by one another,
   the holy kiss, and the like. But there being no more in them but a
   sanctified use directed unto the present civil customs and usages, the
   commands given concerning them respect not the outward action, nor
   appointed any continuance of them, being peculiarly suited unto the
   state of things and persons in those countries; as, John xiii. 12-15,
   "After he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was
   set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye
   call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your
   Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one
   another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I
   have done to you." It is evident in the moral duty of brotherly love,
   in condescension and mutual helpfulness, to be expressed in all
   necessary offices as occasion doth require, that is the thing which
   Jesus Christ here enjoined his disciples, and leads them to by his own
   example in an office of love then in use in those parts. The same is to
   be said of the "holy kiss," Rom. xvi. 16; which was a temporary,
   occasional token of entire love, which may, in answer thereunto, be
   expressed by any sober usage of salutation amongst men to the same
   purpose. But the things themselves were not instituted for any
   continuance, nor do represent any special grace of the new covenant,
   which is inseparable from every institution of gospel worship properly
   so called. Common usages or practices, therefore, directed to be used
   in a due manner and unto a proper end, where they are used, make them
   not institutions of worship. Neither have they in them, as so commanded
   or directed, any one thing that concurs to the constitution of a gospel
   ordinance; for neither had they their rise in the authority of Christ,
   nor is any continuance of them enjoined, nor any promise annexed unto
   them, nor any grace of the new covenant represented or exhibited in
   them.

   Besides, there were in the first churches, continued for a while,
   certain extraordinary gifts, that had their effects visible on the
   outward senses of men, and tended not immediately unto the edification
   of the churches in their faith, but unto the conviction of others, and
   vindication of the authority of them by whom the gospel was preached
   and propagated. Such was that gift of healing the sick: which being an
   especial effect of the Holy Ghost for the advantage of the church in
   those days, in some places it was accompanied by anointing with oil;
   but this being no universal practice, and used only in the exercise of
   a gift extraordinary, whose use and being has long since ceased, it
   never was appointed nor intended to be of continuance in the church,
   which is not tied by the Lord Christ to the empty signs and shadows of
   things whose substance is not enjoyed. Besides, no spiritual grace of
   the covenant was ever intimated, sealed, or exhibited by that usage of
   anointing with oil. The first mention of it is, Mark vi. 13, where its
   practice is reckoned among the effects of that extraordinary power
   which the Lord Christ committed unto his twelve disciples on their
   first sending out, and is referred unto the same series of miracles
   which they wrought in pursuit and by virtue thereof: "They cast out
   many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed
   them." And by what is there recorded, the subsequent mention of it,
   James v. 14, is to be regulated. But now, unto a real evangelical
   institution of worship, it is required, -- 1. That it be a command of
   Christ, manifested by his word or example proposed unto our imitation,
   Matt. xxviii. 20; 2. That it be given and enjoined unto the whole
   church, with the limitation of its administration expressed in the
   word, 1 Cor. xi. 25; 3. That, unto the due performance of it, gospel
   grace be required in them that attend unto it; 4. That it teach, or
   represent, or seal, or improve some grace of the covenant, and have a
   promise of acceptation annexed unto it. And whatever is thus appointed,
   the church is indispensably to continue in the observation of, unto the
   end of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 14 -- May not the church find out, and appoint to be observed,
   such religious rites as, being adjoined unto the celebration of God's
   instituted worship, may further the devotion of the worshippers, and
   render the worship itself in its performance more decent, beautiful,
   and orderly, as the appointing of images, and the like?

   Answer -- All acceptable devotion in them that worship God is the
   effect of faith, which respects the precepts and promises of God alone.
   And the comeliness and beauty of gospel worship consisteth in its
   relation unto God by Jesus Christ, as the merciful high priest over his
   house, with the glorious administration of the Spirit therein. The
   order also of it lieth in the due and regular observation of all that
   Christ hath appointed. And therefore all such inventions are in
   themselves needless and useless, and, because forbidden, unlawful to be
   observed.
   Rom. i. 21, xiv. 23; Heb. iv. 2, xi. 4, 6; Deut. xiii. 4, xxvii. 10,
   xxx. 2, 8, 20, xi. 27; Matt. xvii. 5; Isa. xxix. 13; Eph. ii. 18; 2
   Cor. iii. 7-11; Heb. x. 19-22; John iv. 21-23; 1 Cor. xiv. 25; Matt.
   xxviii. 20; Exod. xx. 4; Deut. iv. 2; Matt. xv. 13; Deut. xii. 32,
   xvii. 3.

   Explication -- Three things are usually pleaded in the justification of
   the observance of such rites and ceremonies in the worship of God:--
   First, That they tend unto the furtherance of the devotion of the
   worshippers; secondly, That they render the worship itself comely and
   beautiful; thirdly, That they are the great preservers of order in the
   celebration thereof. And therefore on these accounts they may be
   instituted or appointed by some, and observed by all.

   But things are indeed quite otherwise: "God is a Spirit, and will be
   worshipped in spirit and in truth," John iv. 24. And no devotion is
   acceptable unto him, but what proceedeth from and is an effect of
   faith; for "without faith it is impossible to please God," Heb. xi. 6.
   And faith in all things respects the commands and authority of God; for
   saith he, "In vain do they worship me, who teach for doctrines the
   commandments of men," Matt. xv. 9; and he rejecteth all that honour
   which is given him by those whose fear towards him or worship of him is
   "taught by the precepts of men," Isa. xxix. 13. These things,
   therefore, being utterly destitute of divine authority, they can no way
   further or promote the devotion of the worshippers. What natural or
   carnal affections may be excited by them, -- as men may "inflame
   themselves with idols," Isa. lvii. 5, -- or what outward, outside
   devotion they may direct unto or excite, is uncertain; but that they
   are no means of stirring up the grace of God in the hearts of
   believers, or of the increase or strengthening of their faith, -- which
   things alone God accepts in gospel worship, -- seeing they are not
   appointed by him for any such purpose, is most certain: for to say that
   any thing will effectually stir up devotion, -- that is, excite,
   strengthen, or increase grace in the heart towards God, -- that is not
   of his own appointment, is on the one hand to reflect on his wisdom and
   care towards his church, as if he had been wanting towards it in things
   so necessary, which he declares against, Isa. v. 4, "What," saith he,
   "could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?"
   so on the other, it extols the wisdom of men above what is meet to
   ascribe unto it. Shall men find out that which God would not, or could
   not, in matters of so great importance unto his glory and the souls
   that obey him? Yea, and it cannot be but that attendance unto them and
   their effects must needs divert the mind from those proper spiritual
   actings of faith and grace which is its duty to attend unto. And this
   is evidently seen in them who, indulging to themselves in their
   observation in multiplied instances, as in the church of Rome, have
   changed the whole spiritual worship of the church into a theatrical,
   pompous show of carnal devotion.

   Secondly, The comeliness and beauty of gospel worship doth not in the
   least depend upon them nor their observation. The apostle doth in
   sundry places expressly compare the spiritual worship of the gospel
   with that of the law, whilst the church had a worldly sanctuary and
   carnal ordinances, Heb. ix. 1. And although it be most evident that the
   worship of the Old Testament did, for the glory and ornaments of
   outward ceremonies, and the splendour of their observation, far exceed
   and excel that worship which God commands now, as suitable unto the
   simplicity of the gospel, yet doth the apostle prefer this, for glory,
   comeliness, and beauty, unspeakably above the other; which manifests
   that these things can have no respect unto outward rites and
   ceremonies, wherein the chief admirers of them can no way vie for glory
   with the old worship of the temple. So the apostle, 2 Cor. iii. 7-11,
   "If the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was
   glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold
   the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to
   be done away: how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather
   glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more
   doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that
   which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the
   glory that excelleth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much
   more that which remaineth is glorious." He compareth the two
   ministrations and the several worships of the law and gospel,
   preferring this unspeakably above the other, sufficiently manifesting
   that the glory of it consisteth not in any pompous observance of
   outward ceremonies. And elsewhere he declareth that indeed it doth
   consist in its relation to God in Christ, with the liberty and boldness
   of the worshippers to enter into the holy place, unto the throne of
   grace, under the ministry of their merciful and faithful high priest,
   being enabled thereunto by the Spirit of adoption and supplications;
   for therein, "through Christ, we have access by one Spirit unto the
   Father," Eph. ii. 18; as it is expressed, Heb. x. 19-21, "Having
   therefore boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by
   a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the
   vail, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest over the
   house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of
   faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
   bodies washed with pure water." This is the glory of gospel worship and
   the beauty of it; whose consideration whilst the minds of men are
   diverted from, to look for beauty in the outward preparation of
   ceremonies, they lose the privilege purchased for believers by the
   blood of Christ. Instead, then, of furthering the beauty and comeliness
   of gospel worship, they are apt to lead men into a dangerous error and
   mistake, -- as, upon a due consideration, will appear to be mean and
   carnal, and far beneath those ceremonies and ordinances of the Old
   Testament, which yet, in comparison of the worship of the gospel, are
   called "worldly, carnal, beggarly," and are said to have "no glory."

   Thirdly, They do not in the least tend unto the preservation of due
   order in the celebration of divine worship. All order consists in the
   due observation of rule. The rules of actions are either natural or of
   his special appointment. Both these take place in religious worship;
   the institutions or commands of Christ containing the substance
   thereof, in their observation principally consists the order of it.
   Whatever is of circumstance in the manner of its performance, not
   capable of especial determination, as emerging or arising only
   occasionally, upon the doing of that which is appointed at this or that
   time, in this or that place, and the like, is left unto the rule of
   moral prudence, in whose observation their order doth consist. But the
   superaddition of ceremonies necessarily belonging neither to the
   institutions of worship nor unto those circumstances whose disposal
   falls under the rule of moral prudence, neither doth nor can add any
   thing unto the due order of gospel worship; so that they are altogether
   needless and useless in the worship of God. Neither is this the whole
   of the inconvenience wherewith their observance is attended; for
   although they are not in particular and expressly in the Scripture
   forbidden, -- for it was simply impossible that all instances wherein
   the wit of man might exercise its invention in such things should be
   reckoned up and condemned, -- yet they fall directly under those severe
   prohibitions which God hath recorded to secure his worship from all
   such additions unto it, of what sort soever. Yea, the main design of
   the second precept is to forbid all making unto ourselves any such
   things in the worship of God, to add unto what he hath appointed;
   whereof an instance is given in that of making and worshipping images,
   the most common way that the sons of men were then prone to transgress
   by against the institutions of God. And this sense and understanding of
   the commandment is secured by those ensuing prohibitions against the
   adding any thing at all unto the commands of God in his worship: Deut.
   iv. 2, "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
   shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of
   the Lord your God." Deut. xii. 32, "What thing soever I command you,
   observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it;"
   chap. xvii. 3. To the same purpose were the places before mentioned,
   Matt. xv. 9, etc.; as also that severe rule applied by our Saviour unto
   the additions of the Pharisees, verse 13, "Every plant, which my
   heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up."

   And there is yet farther evidence contributed unto this intention of
   the command, from those places where such evils and corruptions as were
   particularly forbidden in the worship of God are condemned, not on the
   special account of their being so forbidden, but on that more general,
   of being introduced without warrant from God's institutions or
   commands: Jer. vii. 31, "They have built the high places of Tophet,
   which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and
   daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my
   heart." Chap. xix. 5, "They have built also the high places of Baal, to
   burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I
   commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind." These
   things were particularly forbidden; but yet God here condemns them as
   coming under the general evil of making additions unto his commands, --
   doing that which he commanded not, nor did it ever enter into his
   heart.

   The Papists say, indeed, that all additions corrupting the worship of
   God are forbidden, but such as further, adorn, and preserve it are not
   so; which implies a contradiction, for whereas every addition is
   principally a corruption because it is an addition, under which notion
   it is forbidden (and that in the worship of God which is forbidden is a
   corruption of it), there can be no such preserving, adorning addition,
   unless we allow a preserving and adorning corruption. Neither is it of
   more force which is pleaded by them, that the additions which they make
   belong not unto the substance of the worship of God, but unto the
   circumstances of it; for every circumstance observed religiously, or to
   be observed in the worship of God, is of the substance of it, as were
   all those ceremonious observances of the law, which had the same
   respect in the prohibitions of adding with the most weighty things
   whatsoever.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 15 -- Whence may it appear that the right and due observation
   of instituted worship is of great importance unto the glory of God, and
   of high concernment unto the souls of men?

   Answer -- This is fully taught in the Scriptures; as, ^aGod would never
   accept in any state of the church, before or since the fall, moral
   obedience without the observation of some institutions as trials,
   tokens, and pledges of that obedience. And ^bin their use and
   signification by his appointment they nearly concern the principal
   mysteries of his will and grace; and ^cby their celebration is he
   glorified in the world. And, therefore, ^das he hath made blessed
   promises to his people, to grant them his presence and to bless them in
   their use; so, ^ebeing the tokens of the marriage relation that is
   between him and them, with respect unto them alone he calls himself "a
   jealous God," and ^fhath actually exercised signal severity towards the
   neglecters, corrupters, or abusers of them.

   Explication -- For the most part, the instituted worship of God is
   neglected and despised in the world. Some are utterly regardless of it,
   supposing that if they attend, after their manner, unto moral
   obedience, that neither God nor themselves are much concerned in this
   matter of his worship. Others think the disposal and ordering of it to
   be so left unto men, that, as to the manner of its performance, they
   may do with it as it seems right in their own eyes; and some follow
   them therein, as willingly walking after their commandments, without
   any respect unto the will or authority of God. But the whole Scripture
   gives us utterly another account of this matter. The honour of God in
   this world, the trial of our faith and obedience, the order and beauty
   of the church, the exaltation of Christ in our professed subjection to
   him, and the saving of our souls in the ways of his appointment, are
   therein laid upon the due and right observance of instituted worship;
   and they who are negligent about these things, whatever they pretend,
   have no real respect unto anything that is called religion. First,
   therefore, in every state and condition of the church, God hath given
   his ordinances of worship as the touchstone and trial of its faith and
   obedience; so that they by whom they are neglected do openly refuse to
   come unto God's trial. In the state of innocency, the trial of Adam's
   obedience, according to the law of nature, was in and by the
   institution of the tree of life, and of the knowledge of good and evil:
   Gen ii. 16, 17, "And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every
   tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the
   knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day
   that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." This was the first
   institution of God, and it was given unto the church in the state of
   innocency and purity. And in our first parents' neglect of attending
   thereunto did they transgress the whole law of their creation, as
   failing in their duty in that which was appointed for their trial in
   the whole: Chap. iii. 11, "Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I
   commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?", etc. And the church in
   his family after the fall, built upon the promise, was tried also in
   the matter of instituted worship. Nor was there any discovery of the
   wickedness of Cain, or approbation of the faith of Abel, until they
   came to be proved in their sacrifices; a new part of God's instituted
   worship, the first in the state and condition of sin and the fall
   whereinto it was brought: Gen. iv. 3-5, "In process of time it came to
   pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the
   Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
   the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
   offering: but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect." The
   ground whereof the apostle declares, Heb. xi. 4, "By faith Abel offered
   unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained
   witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts." In the
   observation of that first institution, given to the church in the state
   of the fall, did Abel receive a testimony of his being justified and
   accepted with God. Afterward, when Abraham was called, and peculiarly
   separated to bear forth the name of God in the world, and to become the
   spring of the church for future ages, he had the institution of
   circumcision given him for the trial of his obedience; the law and
   condition whereof was, that he who observed it not should be esteemed
   an alien from the covenant of God, and be cut off from his people: Gen.
   xvii. 9-11, "God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant, thou,
   and thy seed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant,
   which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every
   man-child among you shall be circumcised." Verse 14, "And the
   uncircumcised man-child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised,
   that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my
   covenant." And in like manner, so soon as ever his posterity were to be
   collected into a new church state and order, God gave the ordinance of
   the passover: Exod. xii. 24, "Ye shall observe this thing for an
   ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever;" and that upon the same
   penalty with that of circumcision. To these he added many more on mount
   Sinai, Exod. xx.; all as the trials of their faith and obedience unto
   succeeding generations. How he hath dealt with his church under the New
   Testament we shall afterwards declare. In no state or condition, then,
   of the church did God ever accept of moral obedience without the
   observation of some instituted worship, accommodated in his wisdom unto
   its various states and conditions; and not only so, but, as we have
   seen, he hath made the observation of them, according unto his mind and
   appointment, the means of the trial of men's whole obedience, and the
   rule of the acceptance or rejection of them. And so it continues at
   this day, whatever be the thoughts of men about the worship which at
   present he requires.

   Besides, God hath appointed that his worship shall be an effectual
   means, as to instruct us in the mysteries of his will and mind, so of
   communicating his love, mercy, and grace unto us; as also of that
   communion or intercourse with his holy Majesty, which he hath
   graciously granted unto us by Jesus Christ. And this, as it is
   sufficiently manifested in the Scriptures quoted in answer unto this
   question, so it is at large declared in the writings of those holy and
   good men who have explained the nature of the gospel ordinances; and
   therefore, in particular, we need not here insist much in the farther
   proof of it. Thus, Abraham was instructed in the nature of the covenant
   of grace by circumcision, Gen. xvii. 10, which is often explained in
   the Old Testament by applying it in particular to the grace of
   conversion, called the "circumcision of the heart," Deut. x. 16, xxx.
   6, Jer. iv. 4; as also in the New Testament, Col. ii. 11. And by the
   passover were the people taught not only the mercy of their present
   deliverance, Exod. xii. 23, 24, but also to look for the Lamb of God
   who was to take away the sin of the world, John i. 29, the true
   Passover of the people of God, which was sacrificed for them, 1 Cor. v.
   7. How our insition or implanting into Christ is represented and
   signified by our baptism, the apostle declares, Rom. vi. 3-5; as also
   our communion with him in his death, by the supper of the Lord, Matt.
   xxvi. 26, 27, 1 Cor. xi. 24, 25. And all these graces which they teach
   they also exhibit, and are the means of the communication of them unto
   believers. Moreover, the experience of all believers who have
   conscientiously waited upon God in their due observance may be produced
   in the confirmation of it. The instruction, edification, consolation,
   spiritual strength, courage, and resolution, which they have received
   in and by them, hath been witnessed unto in their lives and ends; and
   they to whom these things are not of the greatest importance do but in
   vain pretend a regard unto God in any thing whatever.

   Furthermore; God hath appointed our duty in the observation of his
   instituted worship to be the means of our glorifying him in the world.
   Nor can we otherwise give glory to God but as we own his authority over
   us, and yield obedience to what he requires at our hands. And what we
   do herein is principally evident in those duties which lie under the
   eye and observation of men. Some duties of obedience there are which
   the world neither doth nor can discern in believers; such are their
   faith, inward holiness, purity of heart, heavenly-mindedness, sincere
   mortification of indwelling sin; some whose performance ought to be hid
   from them, as personal prayer and alms, Matt. vi. 2-6; some there are
   which are very liable to misconstruction amongst men, as zeal in many
   of the actings of it; but this conscientious observation of instituted
   worship, and therein avowing our subjection unto the authority of God
   in Christ, is that which the world may see and take notice of, and that
   which, unless in case of persecution, ought not to be hid from them,
   and that which they can have no pretence of scandal at: and therefore
   hath God appointed that by this means and way we shall honour and
   glorify him in the world; which if we neglect, we do evidently cast off
   all regard unto his concernments in this world. Herein it is that we
   manifest ourselves not to be ashamed of the gospel of Christ, of him
   and his words, which he so indispensably requireth at our hands: Mark
   viii. 38, "For," saith he, "whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my
   words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the
   Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with
   the holy angels." Hereby do we keep the commandments of Christ, as his
   "friends," John xv. 14, for these peculiarly are his commands (and if
   we suffer for them, then we do most properly suffer as Christians,
   which is our glory), that, 1 Pet. iv. 14-16, "If ye be reproached for
   the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God
   resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part
   he is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a
   thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busy-body in other men's matters.
   Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let
   him glorify God on this behalf." And a happy and a blessed thing it is
   to suffer for the observation of the special commands of Christ.

   Farther; to encourage us in our duty, the holy faithful God hath given
   us many great and precious promises that he will graciously afford unto
   us his especial, sanctifying, blessing presence, in our attendance on
   our worship according to his appointment; for as he promised of old
   that he would make glorious "the place of his feet," or abode among his
   people, Isa. lx. 13, -- that he would meet them in his sanctuary, the
   place of his worship, and there dwell amongst them, and bless them, and
   be their God, Exod. xxix. 42-45, Deut. xiv. 23, 24, -- so the Lord
   Jesus Christ hath promised his presence to the same ends and purposes,
   unto all them that assemble together in his name for the observation of
   the worship which in the gospel he hath appointed: Matt. xviii. 20,
   "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in
   the midst of them." And therein is the tabernacle of God, his gracious
   dwelling-place, with men, Rev. xxi. 3. Now, when God offereth unto us
   his presence, his gracious, blessing, sanctifying, and saving presence,
   and that in and by promises which shall never fail, what unspeakable
   guilt must we needs contract upon our souls if we neglect or despise
   the tenders of such grace!

   Because we are apt to be slothful, and are slow of heart in admitting a
   due sense of spiritual things, that fall not in with the light and
   principles of nature, to stir us up unto a diligence in our attendance
   unto the will of God in this matter, he hath declared that he looks
   upon our obedience herein as our whole loyalty unto him in that
   conjugal covenant which he is pleased in Christ Jesus to take believers
   into with himself: Jer. iii. 14, 15, "Turn, O backsliding children,
   saith the Lord; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a
   city, and two of a family, and I will bring you unto Zion: and I will
   give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with
   knowledge and understanding." Coming unto Zion, in the worship of God,
   under the leading and conduct of pastors according to the heart of God,
   is our answering the relation wherein we stand unto him as he is
   married unto us; and thereupon he teacheth us that as a husband he is
   jealous of our discharge of our duty in this matter, accounting our
   neglect of his worship, or profanation of it by inventions and
   additions of our own, to be spiritual disloyalty, whoredom and
   adultery, which his soul abhorreth, for which he will cast off any
   church or people, and that for ever. See Exod. xx. 5; Deut. iv. 23, 24;
   Josh. xxiv. 19; Ezek. xvi. Whatever he will bear withal in his church,
   he will not bear with that which his jealousy is exercised about. If it
   transgress therein, he will give it a bill of divorce; which repudiated
   condition is the state of many churches in the world, however they
   please and boast themselves in their meretricious ornaments and
   practices.

   To give yet farther strength unto all these considerations, that we may
   not only have rules and precepts, but examples also for our
   instruction, God hath given many signal instances of his severity
   against persons who, by ignorance, neglect, or regardlessness, have
   miscarried in not observing exactly his will and appointment in and
   about his worship. This was the case of Nadab and Abihu, the sons of
   Aaron, Lev. x. 1, 2; of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Num. xvi. 1-40; of
   the sons of Eli, -- a sin not to be "expiated with sacrifice nor
   offering for ever," 1 Sam. ii. 27-34, iii. 14; of Uzza in putting the
   ark into a cart, when he should have borne it upon his shoulders, 1
   Chron. xiii. 7-10; of Uzziah the king in offering incense contrary to
   God's institution, that duty being appropriated unto the priests of the
   posterity of Aaron, 2 Chron. xxvi. 16-21. These are sufficient
   intimations of what care and diligence we ought to use in attending
   unto what God hath appointed in his worship; and although now, under
   the New Testament, he doth not ordinarily proceed to the inflicting of
   temporal judgments in the like cases of neglect, yet he hath not wholly
   left us without instances of his putting forth tokens of his
   displeasure in temporal visitations on such miscarriages in his church:
   1 Cor. xi. 30, "For this cause," saith the apostle, "many are weak and
   sickly among you, and many sleep." From all which it appears of what
   concernment it is unto the glory of God, and the salvation of our own
   souls, to attend diligently unto our duty in the strict and sincere
   observation of the worship of the gospel; for he lets us know that now
   a more severe punishment is substituted against such transgressions in
   the room of that which he so visibly inflicted under the Old Testament,
   Heb. x. 25-29.

   Question 16 -- Is there yet any consideration that may stir up
   believers to a holy and religious care about the due observation of the
   institutions of the gospel?

   Answer -- Yes; namely, that the great apostasy of the church in the
   last days, foretold in the Scripture, and which God threateneth to
   punish and revenge, consists principally in false worship and a
   departure from the institutions of Christ.
   Rev. xiii. 4, 5, xvii. 1-5.

   Explication -- That there is an apostasy of the church foretold in the
   book of the Revelation is acknowledged by all who with sincerity have
   inquired into the mind of God therein. The state of things at this day,
   and for many ages past in the world, sufficiently confirm that
   persuasion. And herein sundry things in general are obvious unto every
   sober consideration thereof:--

   First, The horrible evils, troubles, and confusions that are to be
   brought into and upon the world thereby.

   Secondly, The high guilt and provocation of God that is contained in it
   and doth accompany it.

   Thirdly, The dreadful vengeance that God in his appointed time will
   take upon all the promoters and obstinate maintainers of it. These
   things are at large all of them foretold in the Revelation; and therein
   also the apostasy itself is set forth as the cause of all the plagues
   and destructions that, by the righteous judgment of God, are to be
   brought upon the world in these latter days. Now, as God doth earnestly
   call upon all that fear him not to intermeddle nor partake in the sins
   of the apostates, lest they should also partake in their judgments, --
   chap. xviii. 4, "I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
   my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive
   not of her plagues;" -- so he doth plainly declare wherein the apostasy
   and sin itself should principally consist; and that is in the
   corrupting and contaminating of the ordinances of his worship, or the
   introduction of false worship, joined with the persecution of them who
   refused to submit thereunto. For this cause is the sin itself set out
   under the name of "fornication" and "whoredom," and the church that
   maintains it is called "The mother of harlots," chap. xvii. 5. That by
   fornication and whoredom in the church, the adulterating of the worship
   of God, and the admission of false, self-invented worship in the room
   thereof, whereof God is jealous, is intended, the Scripture everywhere
   declares. It is easy, then, to gather of how great concernment unto us
   it is, especially in these latter days, wherein this so heinous and
   provoking sin is prevalent in the world, carefully to attend unto the
   safe, unerring rule of worship, and diligently to perform the duties
   that are required therein.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 17 -- Which are the principal institutions of the gospel to be
   observed in the worship of God?

   Answer -- ^aThe calling, gathering, and settling of churches, with
   their officers, as the seat and subject of all other solemn instituted
   worship; ^bprayer, with thanksgiving; ^csinging of psalms; ^dpreaching
   the word; ^eadministration of the sacraments of baptism and the supper
   of the Lord; ^fdiscipline and rule of the church collected and settled;
   most of which have also sundry particular duties relating unto them,
   and subservient unto their due observation.
   ^aMatt. xxviii. 19, 20; Acts ii. 41, 42; 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 11,
   12; Matt. xviii. 17, 18; 1 Cor. iv. 17, vii. 17; Acts xiv. 23; Titus i.
   5; 1 Tim. iii. 15.
   ^b1 Tim. ii. 1; Acts vi. 4, xiii. 2, 3.
   ^cEph. v. 19; Col. iii. 16.
   ^d2 Tim. iv. 2; Acts ii. 42; 1 Cor. xiv. 3; Acts vi. 4; Heb. xiii. 7.
   ^eMatt. xxviii. 19, xxvi. 26, 27; 1 Cor. xi. 23.
   ^fMatt. xviii. 17-19; Rom. xii. 6-8; Rev. ii., iii.

   Explication -- These things, being all of them afterward to be spoken
   unto severally and apart, need not here any particular explication.
   They are the principal heads wherein gospel worship consisteth, and
   whereunto the particular duties of it may be reduced.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 18 -- Whereas sundry of these things are founded in the light
   and law of nature, as requisite unto all solemn worship, and are,
   moreover, commanded in the moral law, and explications of it in the Old
   Testament, how do you look upon them as evangelical institutions, to be
   observed principally on the authority of Jesus Christ?

   Answer -- Neither their general suitableness unto the principles of
   right reason and the dictates of the light and law of nature, nor the
   practice of them in the worship of God under the Old Testament, does at
   all hinder them from depending on the mere institution of Jesus Christ,
   as to those especial ends of the glory of God in and by himself, and
   the edification of his church in the faith which is in him, whereunto
   he hath appointed them, nor as unto that especial manner of their
   performance which he requireth; in which respects they are to be
   observed on the account of his authority and command only.
   Matt. xvii. 5, xxviii. 20; John xvi. 23, 24; Heb. iii. 4-6; Eph. i. 22,
   ii. 20-22; Heb. xii. 25.

   Explication -- The principal thing we are to aim at, in the whole
   worship of God, is the discharge of that duty which we owe to Jesus
   Christ, the king and head of the church: Heb. iii. 6, "Christ as a son
   over his own house, whose house are we." 1 Tim. iii. 15, "That thou
   mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God,
   which is the church of the living God." This we cannot do unless we
   consider his authority as the formal reason and cause of our observance
   of all that we do therein. If we perform any thing in the worship of
   God on any other account, it is no part of our obedience unto him, and
   so we can neither expect his grace to assist us, nor have we his
   promise to accept us therein; for that he hath annexed unto our doing
   and observing whatever he hath commanded, and that because he hath
   commanded us: Matt. xxviii. 20, "Teaching them to observe all things
   whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you alway, even
   unto the end of the world." This promised presence respects only the
   observance of his commands. Some men are apt to look on this authority
   of Christ as that which hath the least influence into what they do. If
   in any of his institutions they find any thing that is suited or
   agreeable unto the light of nature, -- as ecclesiastical societies,
   government of the church, and the like, they say, are, -- they suppose
   and contend that that is the ground on which they are to be attended
   unto, and so are to be regulated accordingly. The interposition of his
   authority they will allow only in the sacraments, which have no light
   in reason or nature; so desirous are some to have as little to do with
   Christ as they can, even in the things that concern the worship of God!
   But it would be somewhat strange, that if what the Lord Christ hath
   appointed in his church to be observed in particular, in an especial
   manner, for especial ends of his own, hath in the general nature of it
   an agreement with what in like cases the light of nature seems to
   direct unto, therefore, his authority is not to be considered as the
   sole immediate reason of our performance of it. But it is evident, --

   First, That our Lord Jesus Christ being the king and head of his
   church, the lord over the house of God, nothing is to be done therein
   but with respect unto his authority: Mat. xvii. 5, "This is my beloved
   Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him." Eph. iv. 15, 16,
   "Speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which
   is the head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined
   together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according
   to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase
   of the body unto the edifying of itself in love." Chap. ii. 20-22, "Ye
   are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
   Christ himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom all the building
   fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom
   ye also are built together for a habitation of God through the Spirit."

   Secondly, And that, therefore, the suitableness of any thing to right
   reason or the light of nature is no ground for a church-observation of
   it, unless it be also appointed and commanded in especial by Jesus
   Christ.

   Thirdly, That being so appointed and commanded, it becomes an especial
   institution of his, and as such is to be observed. So that in all
   things that are done, or to be done, or to be done, with respect unto
   the worship of God in the church, the authority of Christ is always
   principally to be considered, and every thing to be observed as
   commanded by him, without which consideration it hath no place in the
   worship of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 19 -- What is an instituted church of the gospel?

   Answer -- A society of persons called out of the world, or their
   natural worldly state, by the administration of the word and Spirit,
   unto the obedience of the faith, or the knowledge and worship of God in
   Christ, joined together in a holy band, or by special agreement, for
   the exercise of the communion of saints, in the due observation of all
   the ordinances of the gospel.
   Rom. i. 5, 6; 1 Cor. i. 2, iv. 15; Heb. iii. 1; James i. 18; Rev. i.
   20; 1 Pet. ii. 5; Eph. ii. 20-22; 2 Cor. vi. 16-18.

   Explication -- The church whose nature is here inquired after is not
   the catholic church of elect believers of all ages and seasons, from
   the beginning of the world unto the end thereof, nor of any one age,
   nor the universality of professors of the gospel; but a particular
   church, wherein, by the appointment of Christ, all the ordinances of
   the worship of God are to be observed and attended unto according to
   his will. For although it be required of them of whom a particular
   church is constituted that they be true believers, seeing that unless a
   man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of God, and so on
   that account they be members of the church catholic, as also that they
   make visible profession of faith and obedience unto Jesus Christ, yet
   moreover it is the will, command, and appointment of Christ, that they
   should be joined together in particular societies or churches, for the
   due observation of the ordinances of the gospel, which can alone be
   done in such assemblies. For as the members of the catholic church are
   not known unto one another merely on the account of that faith and
   union with Christ which make them so, -- whence the whole society of
   them is, as such, invisible to the world, and themselves visible only
   on the account of their profession, and therefore cannot, merely as
   such, observe the ordinances of the gospel, which observation is their
   profession; -- so the visible professors that are in the world, in any
   age, cannot at any time assemble together; which, from the nature of
   the thing itself, and the institution of Christ, is indispensably
   necessary for the celebration of sundry parts of that worship which he
   requires in his church: and therefore particular churches are
   themselves an ordinance of the New Testament, as the national church of
   the Jews was of old; for when God of old erected his worship, and
   enjoined the solemn observation of it, he also appointed a church as
   his institution for the due celebration of it. That was the people of
   Israel, solemnly taken into a church relation with him by covenant;
   wherein they took upon themselves to observe all the laws, and
   ordinances, and institutions of his worship: Exod. xx. 19, "Speak thou
   with us, and we will hear." Chap. xxiv. 3, "And Moses came and told the
   people all the words of the Lord, and all the judgments: and all the
   people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the Lord
   hath said will we do." Deut. v. 27, "All that the Lord our God shall
   speak unto thee, we will hear it, and do it." And God accordingly
   appointed them ordinances to be observed by the whole congregation of
   them together, at the same time, in the same place: Exod. xxiii. 17,
   "Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord
   God." Deut. xvi. 16, "Three times in a year shall all thy males appear
   before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose."

   Neither would God allow any stranger, any one not of the church so
   instituted by him, to celebrate any part of his instituted worship,
   until he was solemnly admitted into that church as a member thereof:
   Exod. xii. 47, 48, "All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. And
   when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to
   the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near
   and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no
   uncircumcised person shall eat thereof."

   To the same end and purpose, when the knowledge of God was to be
   diffused all the world over by the preaching of the gospel, and
   believers of all nations under heaven were to be admitted unto the
   privilege of his worship, Eph. ii. 13-18, the national church of the
   Jews with all the ordinances of it being removed and taken away, the
   Lord Christ hath appointed particular churches, or united assemblies of
   believers, amongst and by whom he will have all his holy ordinances of
   worship celebrated. And this institution of his, at the first preaching
   of the gospel, was invariably and inviolably observed by all that took
   on them to be his disciples, without any one instance of questioning it
   to the contrary in the whole world, or the celebration of any
   ordinances of his worship amongst any persons, but only in such
   societies or particular churches. And there is sufficient evidence and
   warranty of this institution given us in the Scripture; for, --

   First, They are appointed and approved by Christ: Matt. xviii. 15-20,
   "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault
   between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
   brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
   more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
   established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
   church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a
   heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall
   bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose
   on earth shall be loosed also in heaven. Again I say unto you, That if
   two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall
   ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For
   where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the
   midst of them."

   Such a church he supposeth and approveth as his disciples had relation
   unto, and as any one of them could have recourse unto, as a brother, in
   obedience to his commands and directions. This could not be the church
   of the Jews, neither in its whole body nor in any of its judicatories;
   for as at that time there was a solemn decree of excommunication
   against all and every one that should profess his name, -- John ix. 22,
   "The Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was
   Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue," -- which was executed
   accordingly upon the man that was born blind, verse 34, which utterly
   disabled them from making any use of this direction, command, or
   institution of his for the present; so afterward the chief business of
   the rulers of those assemblies, from the highest court of their
   sanhedrin to the meanest judicatory in their synagogues, was to
   persecute them and bring them unto death: Matt. x. 17, "They will
   deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their
   synagogues;" John xv. 20, 21. And it is not likely that the Lord Christ
   would send his disciples for direction and satisfaction in the weighty
   matters of their obedience unto him, and mutual love towards one
   another, unto them with whom they neither had, nor could, nor ought to
   have, any thing to do withal; and if they were intended, they were all
   already made as heathens and publicans, being cast out by them for
   refusing to hear them in their blasphemies and persecutions of Christ
   himself. Such a society, also, is plainly intended as whereunto Christ
   promiseth his presence by his Spirit, and whose righteous sentences he
   takes upon himself to ratify and confirm in heaven.

   Moreover, such a church doth he direct unto as with which his disciples
   were to have familiar, brotherly, constant converse and communion, with
   whom they were so to be joined in society as to be owned or rejected by
   them according to their judgment; as is apparent in the practice
   enjoined unto them, and without relation whereunto no duty here
   appointed could be performed. As, therefore, the very name of the
   church and nature of the thing bespeak a society, so it is evident that
   no society but that of a particular church of the gospel can be here
   intended.

   Secondly, These churches he calls his "candlesticks," Rev. i. 20, in
   allusion unto the candlesticks of the temple; which, being an
   institution of the Old Testament, doth directly declare these churches
   to be so under the New. And this he speaks in reference unto those
   seven principal churches of Asia, every one of which was a candlestick
   or an institution of his own.

   Thirdly, In pursuit of this appointment of Christ, and by his
   authority, the apostles, so soon as any were converted unto the faith
   at Jerusalem, although the old national church-state of the Jews was
   yet continued, gathered them into a church or society for celebration
   of the ordinances of the gospel: Acts ii. 41, 42, "They that gladly
   received his word were baptized. And they continued stedfastly in the
   apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in
   prayers." Verse 47, "The Lord added to the church daily such as should
   be saved." And this company is expressly called "The church at
   Jerusalem," Acts viii. 1. This church, thus called and collected out of
   the church of the Jews, was the rule and pattern of the disposing of
   all the disciples of Christ into church-societies, in obedience unto
   his command, throughout the world, Acts xi. 26, xiv. 23, 27.

   Fourthly, They took care for the forming, completing, and establishing
   them in order according to his will, under the rule of them given and
   granted unto them by himself for that purpose; all in a steady pursuit
   of the commands of Christ: Acts xiv. 23, "They ordained them elders in
   every church;" Titus i. 5, "For this cause left I thee in Crete, that
   thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain
   elders in every city, as I had appointed thee;" 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph.
   iv. 11, 12.

   Fifthly, They do everywhere, in the name and authority of Christ, give
   unto these churches rules, directions, and precepts, for the due
   ordering of all things relating to the worship of God, and according to
   his mind, as we shall see afterward in particular; for, --

   1. There is no charge given unto the officers, ministers, guides, or
   overseers that he hath appointed, but it is in reference unto the
   discharge of their duty in such churches. That ministers or officers
   are of Christ's appointment is expressly declared, Eph. iv. 11, 12, "He
   gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and
   some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the
   work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ." 1 Cor.
   xii. 28, "God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
   prophets, thirdly teachers." These are of Christ's institution, but to
   what end? Why, as they were ordained in every church, Acts xiv. 23,
   Titus i. 5, so their whole charge is limited to the churches: Acts xx.
   17, 18, 28, "He sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church,
   and said to them, Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the
   flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
   the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood;" 1 Pet.
   v. 1, 2, "the elders which are among you I exhort: feed the flock of
   God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof;" 1 Tim. iii. 15;
   Col. iv. 17, "And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which
   thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it." They were the
   churches of Christ wherein they ministered; which Christ, appointing
   them to take care of, manifests to be his own institution and
   appointment. And this is fully declared, Rev. ii., iii., where all the
   dealings of Christ with his angels, or ministers, are about their
   behaviour and deportment among his candlesticks, each of them, the
   candlestick whereunto he was related, or the particular churches that
   they had care of and presided in, the candlesticks being no less of the
   institution of Christ than the angels. And they were distinct
   particular churches, which had their distinct particular officers, whom
   he treated distinctly withal about his institutions and worship,
   especially about that of the state of the churches themselves, and
   their constitution according to his mind.

   2. There is no instruction, exhortation, or reproof given unto any of
   the disciples of Christ after his ascension, in any of the books of the
   New Testament, but as they were collected into and were members of such
   particular churches. This will be evidenced in the many instances of
   those duties that shall afterwards be insisted on. And the Lord Christ
   hath not left that as a matter of liberty, choice, or conveniency,
   which he hath made the foundation of the due manner of the performance
   of all those duties whereby his disciples yield obedience unto his
   commands, to his glory in the world.

   Sixthly, The principal writings of the apostles are expressly directed
   unto such churches, and all of them intentionally, 1 Cor. i. 1, 2; 2
   Cor. i. 1; Gal. i. 1, 2; Phil. i. 1; Col. i. 1, 2, iv. 16; 1 Thess. i.
   1; 2 Thess. i. 1; Eph. i. 1, compared with Acts xx. 17; 1 Pet. v. 2; --
   or unto such particular persons, giving directions for their behaviour
   and duty in such churches, 1 Tim. iii. 15; Titus i. 5. So that the
   great care of the apostles was about these churches, as the principal
   institution of Christ, and that whereon the due observance of all his
   other commands doth depend. Of what nature or sort these churches were
   shall be afterward evinced; we here only manifest their institution by
   the authority of Christ.

   Seventhly, Much of the writings of the apostles, in those epistles
   directed to those churches, consists in rules, precepts, instructions,
   and exhortations for the guidance and preservation of them in purity
   and order, with their continuance in a condition of due obedience unto
   the Lord Christ. To this end do they so fully and largely acquaint the
   rulers and members of them with their mutual duty in that especial
   relation wherein they stand to each other; as also all persons in
   particular in what is required of them by virtue of their membership in
   any particular society; as may be seen at large in sundry of Paul's
   epistles. And to give more strength hereunto, our Lord Jesus Christ, in
   the revelation that he made of his mind and will personally after his
   ascension into heaven, insisted principally about the condition, order,
   and preservation of particular churches, not taking notice of any of
   his disciples not belonging to them or joined with them. These he
   warns, reproves, instructs, threatens, commands; all in order to their
   walking before him in the condition of particular churches, Rev. ii.
   and iii. at large.

   Besides, as he hath appointed them to be the seat and subject of all
   his ordinances, having granted the right of them unto them alone, 1
   Tim. iii. 15, intrusting them with the exercise of that authority which
   he puts forth in the rule of his disciples in this world, he hath also
   appointed the most holy institution of his supper to denote and express
   that union and communion which the members of each of these churches
   have by his ordinance among themselves: 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, "The cup of
   blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
   Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body
   of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are
   all partakers of that one bread." And also he gives out unto them the
   gifts and graces of his Spirit, to make every one of them meet for and
   useful in that place which he holds in such churches; as the apostle
   discourseth at large, 1 Cor. xii. 15-26; Col. ii. 19; Eph. iv. 16. It
   is manifest, then, that no ordinance of Christ is appointed to be
   observed by his disciples, no communication of the gifts of the Holy
   Ghost is promised to them, no especial duty is required of them, but
   with respect unto these churches of his institution.

   In the answer to this question four things are declared tending to the
   explication of the nature of a particular church or churches:-- 1. The
   subject-matter of them, or the persons whereof such a church doth or
   ought to consist. 2. The means whereby they are brought into a
   condition capable of such an estate, or qualified for it. 3. The
   general ends of their calling. 4. The especial means whereby they are
   constituted a church; which last will be spoken unto in the next
   question.

   For the first, all men are by nature the children of wrath, and do
   belong unto the world, which is the kingdom of Satan, and are under the
   power of darkness, as the Scripture everywhere declares. In this state
   men are not subjects of the kingdom of Christ, nor meet to become
   members of his church. Out of this condition they cannot deliver
   themselves. They have neither will unto it nor power for it; but they
   are called out of it. This calling is that which effectually delivers
   them from the kingdom of Satan, and translates them into the kingdom of
   Christ. And this work or effect, the Scripture, on several accounts,
   variously expresseth; sometimes by regeneration, or a new birth;
   sometimes by conversion, or turning unto God; sometimes by
   vivification, or quickening from the dead; sometimes from illumination,
   or opening the eyes of the blind; -- all which are carried on by
   sanctification in holiness, and attended with justification and
   adoption. And as these are all distinct in themselves, having several
   formal reasons of them, so they all concur to complete that effectual
   vocation or calling that is required to constitute persons members of
   the church. For besides that this is signified by the typical holiness
   of the church of old, into the room whereof real holiness was to
   succeed under the New Testament, -- Exod. xix. 6; Ps. xxiv. 3-6, xv. 1,
   2; Isa. xxxv. 8, 9, liv. 13, 14, lx. 21; 1 Pet. ii. 9, -- our Lord
   Jesus Christ hath laid it down as an everlasting rule, that "except a
   man be born again, he cannot enter the kingdom of God," John iii. 3, 5,
   requiring regeneration as an indispensable condition in a member of his
   church, a subject of his kingdom: for his temple is now to be built of
   living stones, 1 Pet. ii. 5, -- men spiritual and savingly quickened
   from their death in sin, and by the Holy Ghost, whereof they are
   partakers, made a meet habitation of God, Eph. ii. 21, 22; 1 Cor. iii.
   16; 2 Cor. vi. 16; which receiving vital supplies from Christ its head,
   increaseth in faith and holiness, edifying itself in love, Eph. iv. 15,
   16. And as the apostles in their writings do ascribe unto all the
   churches, and the members of them, a participation in this effectual
   vocation, affirming that they are "saints, called, sanctified,
   justified," and accepted with God in Christ, -- Rom. i. 5, 6; 1 Cor. i.
   2, iv. 15; Heb. iii. 1; James i. 18; 1 Pet. ii. 5; 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18; 1
   Cor. vi. 11, -- so many of the duties that are required of them in that
   relation and condition are such as none can perform unto the glory of
   God, their own benefit, and the edification of others (the ends of all
   obedience), unless they are partakers of this effectual calling, 1 Cor.
   x. 16, 17, xii. 12; Eph. iv. 16. And hereunto that these churches, and
   the members of them, are not only commanded to separate themselves, as
   to their worship of God, from the world, -- that is, men in their
   worldly state and condition, -- but are also required, when any amongst
   them transgress against the rules and laws of this holy calling above
   described, to cast them out of their society and communion, 1 Cor. v.
   13. From all which it appears who are the subject-matter of these
   churches of Christ; as also, secondly, the means whereby they come to
   be so, -- namely, the administration of the Spirit and word of Christ;
   and, thirdly, the general ends of their calling, which are all spoken
   to in this answer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 20 -- By what means do persons so called become a church of
   Christ?

   Answer -- They are constituted a church, and interested in the rights,
   power, and privileges of a gospel church, by the will, promise,
   authority, and law of Jesus Christ, upon their own voluntary consent
   and engagement to walk together in the due subjection of their souls
   and consciences unto his authority, as their king, priest, and prophet,
   and in a holy observation of all his commands, ordinances, and
   appointments.
   Matt. xviii. 20, xxviii. 19, 20; Acts ii. 41, 42; Exod. xxiv. 3; Deut.
   v. 27; Ps. cx. 3; Isa. xliv. 5, lix. 21; Eph. iv. 7-10; 2 Cor. viii. 5.

   Explication -- That the Lord Christ hath constituted such a
   church-state as that which we inquire about hath been proved already.
   Unto a church so constituted he hath also, by his word and promise,
   annexed all those privileges and powers which we find a church to be
   intrusted withal. This he hath done by the standing and unalterable law
   of the gospel, which is the charter of their spiritual society and
   incorporation. Neither are nor can any persons be interested in the
   rights of a church any otherwise but by virtue of this law and
   constitution. This, therefore, is first to be laid down, that the sole
   moral foundation of that church-state which we inquire after is laid in
   the word, law, and appointment of Christ. He alone hath authority to
   erect such a society; he is the builder of this house as well as the
   lord over it, Heb. iii. 3-6. Neither without it can all the authority
   of men in the world appoint such a state or erect a church; and all
   acceptable actings of men herein are no other but acts of pure
   obedience unto Christ.

   Furthermore, we have declared that the Lord Christ, by the dispensation
   of his word and Spirit, doth prepare and fit men to be subjects of his
   kingdom, members of his church. The work of sending forth the means of
   the conversion of the souls of men, of translating them from the power
   of darkness into light, he hath taken upon himself, and doth
   effectually accomplish it in every generation. And by this means he
   builds his church, for unto all persons so called he gives command that
   they shall do and observe whatever he hath appointed them to do, Matt.
   xxviii. 20; in particular, that they profess their subjection to him,
   and their obedience, in joining themselves in that state wherein they
   may be enabled to observe all his other laws and institutions, with the
   whole worship of God required therein. Being converted unto God by his
   word and Spirit, they are to consider how they may now obey the Lord
   Christ in all things. Amongst his commands, this of joining themselves
   in church-societies, wherein he hath promised his presence with them,
   Matt. xxviii. 20, -- that is, to dwell amongst them by his word and
   Spirit, Isa. lix. 21, -- is the very first. This, by virtue of that
   command and promise of his, they are warranted and enabled to do; nor
   do they need any other warrant. The authority of Christ is sufficient
   to bear men out in the discharge of their duty to him. Being then made
   willing and ready in the day of his power, Ps. cx. 3, they consent,
   choose, and agree to walk together in the observation of all his
   commands. And hereby do they become a church; for their becoming a
   church is an act of their willing obedience unto Christ. This is an act
   of their wills, guided by rule; for this also is necessary, that they
   proceed herein according to the rules of his appointment, afterward to
   be unfolded. And herein, upon their obedience unto the commands of
   Christ, and faith in his promises, do believers, by virtue of his law
   and constitution, become a gospel church, and are really and truly
   interested in all the power, rights, and privileges that are granted
   unto any church of Christ; for in this obedience they do these two
   things, which alone he requires in any persons for the obtaining of an
   interest in these privileges:-- First, They confess him, his person,
   his authority, his law, his grace; secondly, They take upon themselves
   the observance of all his commands.

   Thus did God take the children of Israel into a church-state of old. He
   proposed unto them the church-obedience that he required of them, and
   they voluntarily and freely took upon themselves the performance of it:
   Exod. xxiv. 3, "And Moses came and told the people all the words of the
   Lord, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one
   voice, and said, All the words which the Lord hath said will we do:" so
   Deut. v. 27. And hereby they had their solemn admission into their
   church-state and relation unto God. And the like course they took
   whenever there was need of renewing of their engagements: Josh. xxiv.
   18-22, "And the people said, We will serve the Lord; for he is our God.
   And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves
   that ye have chosen the Lord, to serve him. And they said, We are
   witnesses." This was the covenant that was between God and that people,
   which was solemnly renewed so often as the church was eminently
   reformed. Now, although the outward solemnity and ceremonies of this
   covenant were peculiar unto that people, yet as to the substance and
   nature of it, in a sacred consent for the performance of all those
   duties towards God and one another which the nature and edification of
   a church do require, it belongs to every church as such, even under the
   gospel.

   And this is the way whereby believers, or the disciples of Christ, do
   enter into this state, the formal constituting cause of any church,
   this account doth the apostle give of the churches of the Macedonians:
   2 Cor. viii. 5, "And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave
   their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God," before
   the performance of other duties; and in order thereunto, they first
   gave themselves to the Lord Jesus Christ, or took upon themselves the
   observance of his commands and institutions, which is the intendment of
   that expression. Among these commands one was, that they should give up
   themselves to the apostles' doctrine, rule, and government, in the
   order by Christ prescribed, -- that is, in church-order. This,
   therefore, they did by the will of God, according to his will and
   appointment. This description doth the apostle give of the way whereby
   the believers of Macedonia were brought into churches. It was by their
   own obedience unto the will of God; consenting, agreeing, and taking
   upon themselves the observation of all the commands and institutions of
   Christ, according to the direction and guidance of the apostles. So did
   the believers at Jerusalem, Acts ii. 41, 42. Being converted by the
   word, and making profession of that conversion in their baptism, they
   gave up themselves to a steadfast continuance in the observation of all
   other ordinances of the gospel.

   Besides, the church is a house, a temple, -- the "house of God," 1 Tim.
   iii. 15; the "house of Christ," Heb. iii. 6; the "temple of the Lord,"
   Eph. ii. 21, 22. Believers, singly considered, are "stones, living
   stones," 1 Pet. ii. 5. Now, how shall these "living stones" come to be
   a house, a temple? Can it be by occasional occurrences, civil
   cohabitation in political precincts, usage, or custom of assembling for
   some parts of worship in any place? These things will never frame them
   into a house or temple. This can be no otherwise done but by their own
   voluntary consent and disposition: Eph. ii. 19-22, "Ye are
   fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are
   built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
   himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom all the building fitly
   framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also
   are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit."
   Chap. iv. 16, "From whom the whole body fitly joined together and
   compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
   effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
   body unto the edifying of itself in love." From these and sundry other
   places it is manifest that the way and means of believers' coalition
   into a church-state is their own obedience of faith, acting itself in a
   joint voluntary consent to walk together in a holy observation of the
   commands of Christ; whence the being and union of a particular church
   is given unto any convenient number of them by his law and
   constitution.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 21 -- Seeing the church is a society or spiritual
   incorporation of persons under rule, government, or discipline, declare
   who or what are the rulers, governors, or officers therein under Jesus
   Christ?

   Answer -- They have been of two sorts: 1. Extraordinary, appointed for
   a season only; and, 2. Ordinary, to continue unto the end of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 22 -- Who are the extraordinary officers, or rulers, or
   ministers of the church, appointed to serve the Lord Jesus Christ
   therein for a season only?

   Answer -- ^aThe apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, with ^bthe
   evangelists and prophets, endowed with extraordinary gifts of the Holy
   Ghost, associated with them and employed by them in their works and
   ministry.
   ^aMatt. x. 2-4; Acts i. 26; 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 11.
   ^bLuke x. 1; 2 Tim. iv. 5; Titus i. 5; Acts xi. 27, 28, xxi. 9-11; 2
   Cor. i. 1.

   Explication -- That the church is a spiritual corporation, attended
   with rule and government, is evident from the nature of the thing
   itself and testimonies of Scripture. Only, as the kingdom of Christ is
   not of this world or worldly, so this rule and government of the church
   is not merely external and secular, but spiritual. Neither doth this
   rule at all belong unto it merely as materially considered, in men
   yielding obedience unto the call which is the foundation of the church;
   nor absolutely, as it is formally constituted a church by the consent
   and agreement described; but, moreover, it is required that it be
   organically complete, with officers or rulers. Now, to the constitution
   of such a society or corporation there is required, --

   First, That the persons whereof it is constituted do consent together
   into it for the attaining of the ends which they design. Without this
   no society of any kind can exist. This is the form of men's coalescency
   into societies; and that there is in the church such consent and
   agreement hath been showed.

   Secondly, That there be rules or laws for the guidance and direction of
   all the members of the society, in order to their pursuit of the proper
   ends of it. That such rules or laws are given and prescribed by the
   Lord Christ unto the church will afterward appear, in our consideration
   of them in particular; so that the church is a society of men walking
   according unto rule or law for the attaining of the ends of the
   society.

   Thirdly, That there be authority instituted to see to the due
   observation of these rules and laws of the society, which consists in
   this:-- 1. That some be appointed to rule and govern in the church; 2.
   Others to obey and be ruled or governed; both according to the laws of
   the society, and not otherwise. And both these are eminently found in
   this church-state, as we shall see in the ensuing questions, with their
   answers and explications.

   Now, that these officers or rulers should be of two sorts, both the
   nature of the thing itself required and so hath our Lord Jesus Christ
   appointed; for when the church was first to be called, gathered, and
   erected, it was necessary that some persons should be extraordinarily
   employed in that work, for ordinary officers antecedent unto the
   calling and erection of the church there could be none. And, therefore,
   these persons were in an extraordinary manner endowed with all the
   power which afterward was to reside in the churches themselves; and,
   moreover, with that which was peculiarly needful unto the discharge and
   performance of that special duty and work that they were appointed
   unto. But when churches were called, gathered, erected, and settled for
   continuance, there was need of officers suited to their state and
   condition, called in an ordinary way, -- that is, in a way appointed
   for continuance unto the end of the world; and to be employed in the
   ordinary work of the church, -- that is, the duties of it were
   constantly incumbent on it by virtue of the command and appointment of
   Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 23 -- Who are the ordinary officers or ministers of Christ in
   the church, to be always continued therein?

   Answer -- Those whom the Scripture calls pastors and teachers, bishops,
   elders, and guides.
   Acts xiv. 23, xx. 17, 28; 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 11; Phil. i. 1; 1
   Tim. iii. 1, 2, v. 17; Titus i. 5, 7; Heb. xiii. 7, 17; 1 Pet. v. 1.

   Explication -- Several names are, on several accounts, partly designing
   their authority, partly their duty, and partly the manner of their
   discharge thereof, assigned in the Scripture to the ordinary ministers
   of the churches. Sometimes they are called "pastors and teachers," Eph.
   iv. 11; 1 Cor. xii. 28; -- sometimes "bishops" or "overseers," Phil. i.
   1; Acts xx. 28; -- sometimes "elders," Titus i. 5; 1 Pet. v. 1; 1 Tim.
   v. 17; Acts xiv. 23, xx. 17; -- sometimes "guides," Heb. xiii. 7, 17.
   By all which names, and sundry others whereby they are expressed, the
   same sort, order, and degree of persons is intended. Nor is any one of
   these names applied or accommodated unto any, but all the rest are also
   in like manner; so that he who is a pastor or a teacher is also a
   bishop or overseer, a presbyter or elder, a guide or ruler, a minister,
   a servant of the church for the Lord's sake. And of all other names
   assigned to the ministers of the church, that of bishop can least of
   all be thought to have designed any special order or degree of
   pre-eminence amongst them; for whereas it is but four times, or in four
   places, used in the New Testament as denoting any officers of the
   church, in each of them it is manifest that those expressed by the
   other names of elders and ministers are intended. So, Acts xx. 28, the
   bishops are the elders of the particular church of Ephesus, verse 17.
   Phil. i. 1, there were many bishops in that one particular church, who
   had only deacons joined with them; that is, they were the elders of it,
   Titus i. 7. The bishops were the elders to be ordained, verse 5; which
   persons are also directly intended, 1 Tim. iii. 2, as is evident from
   the coincidence of the directions given by the apostles about them, and
   the immediate adjoining of deacons unto them, verse 8; so that no name
   could be fixed on with less probability, to assert from it a special
   supreme order or degree of men in the ministry, than this of bishops.
   Neither is there any mention in any place of Scripture of any such
   pre-eminence of one sort of these church-officers or ministers over
   another, not in particular in those places where the officers of the
   church are in an especial manner enumerated, as 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph.
   iv. 11; Rom. xii. 5-8. Nor is there any mention of any special office
   that should be peculiar unto such officers; or of any gifts or
   qualifications that should be required in them; or of any special way
   of calling or setting apart to their office; nor of any kind of church
   that they should relate unto, different from the churches that other
   elders or pastors do minister in; nor of any special rule or direction
   for their trial; nor any commands for obedience unto them but what are
   common to all ministers of the churches of Christ duly discharging
   their trust and performing their duty; no intimation is given unto
   either elders or ministers to obey them, or directions how to respect
   them, nor unto them how to behave themselves toward them: but all these
   things are spoken and delivered promiscuously and equally concerning
   all ministers of the gospel. It is evident, then, that these
   appellations do not belong unto one sort of ministers, not more than
   another. And for what is pleaded by some from the example of Timothy
   and Titus, it is said that when any persons can prove themselves to be
   evangelists, 2 Tim. iv. 5, to be called unto their office upon
   antecedent prophecy, 1 Tim. i. 18, and to be sent by the apostles, and
   in an especial manner to be directed by them in some employment for a
   season, which they are not ordinarily to attend unto, Titus i. 5, iii.
   12, it will be granted that they have another duty and office committed
   unto them than those who are only bishops or elders in the Scripture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 24 -- What are the principal differences between these two
   sorts of officers or rulers in the church, extraordinary and ordinary?

   Answer -- ^aThe former were called to their office immediately by Jesus
   Christ in his own person, or revelation made by the Holy Ghost in his
   name to that purpose; the latter by the suffrage, choice, and
   appointment of the church itself. ^bThe former, both in their office
   and work, were independent on, and antecedent unto, all or any
   churches, whose calling and gathering depended on their office as its
   consequent and effect; the latter, in both, consequent unto the
   calling, gathering, and constituting of the churches themselves, as an
   effect thereof, in their tendency unto completeness and perfection.
   ^cThe authority of the former being communicated unto them immediately
   by Jesus Christ, without any intervenient actings of any church,
   extended itself equally unto all churches whatever; that of the latter
   being derived unto them from Christ by the election and designation of
   the church, is in the exercise of it confined unto that church wherein
   and whereby it is so derived unto them. ^dThey differ also in the
   gifts, which were suited unto their several distinct works and
   employments.
   ^aMatt. x. 1; Luke x. 1; Gal. i. 1; Acts i. 26, vi. 3, xiv. 23.
   ^bJohn xx. 21-23; Gal. i. 1; Eph. ii. 20; Rev. xxi. 14; Acts xiv. 23;
   Titus i. 5, 7.
   ^cMatt. xxviii. 18-20; 2 Cor. xi. 28; Acts xx. 28; 1 Pet. v. 2; Col.
   iv. 17.
   ^d1 Cor. xii. 28-33.

   The answer hereunto is such as needs no farther explication.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 25 -- What is required unto the due constitution of an elder,
   pastor, or teacher of the church?

   Answer -- ^aThat he be furnished with the gifts of the Holy Spirit for
   the edification of the church, and the evangelical discharge of the
   work of the ministry; ^bthat he be unblamable, holy, and exemplary in
   his conversation; ^cthat he have a willing mind to give himself unto
   the Lord in the work of the ministry; ^dthat he be called and chosen by
   the suffrage and consent of the church; ^ethat he be solemnly set apart
   by fasting and prayer, and imposition of hands, unto his work and
   ministry.
   ^aEph. iv. 7, 8, 11-13.
   ^bTitus i. 7-9; 1 Tim. iii. 2-7.
   ^c1 Pet. v. 1-3.
   ^dActs xiv. 23.
   ^eActs xiii. 2, 3; 1 Tim. iv. 14, v. 22.

   Explication -- Five things are here said to be required unto the due
   and solemn constitution of a minister, guide, elder, pastor, or teacher
   of the church, which, as they do all equally belong unto the essence of
   the call, so they are all indispensably necessary unto him that would
   be accounted to have taken that office upon him according to the mind
   of Christ; and they that are plainly expressed in the Scripture.

   The first is, That they be furnished with the gifts of the Holy Ghost
   for the discharge of the ministry. The communication of the gifts of
   the Holy Ghost is the foundation of the ministry, as the apostle
   declares, Eph. iv. 7, 8, , 11-13, "But unto every one of us is given
   grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he
   saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave
   gifts unto men. And he gave some, apostles; and some prophets; and
   some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting
   of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the
   body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
   knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man." And if this were not
   continued, if the Lord Christ did not continue to give gifts unto men
   for that end, the ministry must and would cease in the church, and all
   church order and administrations thereon. The exercise, also, of the
   gifts is required in all them that are called unto sacred offices: 1
   Tim. iv. 14, "Neglect not the gift that is in thee." Hence, persons
   destitute of these gifts of the Spirit, as they cannot in a due manner
   discharge any one duty of the ministry, so, wanting an interest in that
   which is the foundation of the office, are not esteemed of God as
   ministers at all, whatever their outward call may be: Hos. iv. 6,
   "Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that
   thou shalt be no priest to me."

   Secondly, Their unblamableness and holiness of conversation is
   previously required in them that are to be set apart unto the ministry.
   This the apostle expressly declares, and lays down many particular
   instances whereby it is to be tried: Titus i. 7-9, "For a bishop must
   be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry,
   not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; but a lover
   of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
   holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be
   able by sound doctrine both to exhort and convince the gainsayers." 1
   Tim. iii. 2-7, "A bishop must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
   vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
   not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient,
   not a brawler, not covetous; one that ruleth well his own house, having
   his children in subjection with all gravity; (for if a man know not how
   to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
   not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the
   condemnation of the devil. Moreover he must have a good report of them
   which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the
   devil." Not that the particulars here mentioned by the apostle are only
   to be considered in the conversation of the person to be called to the
   ministry, but that, in a universal holy conversation, these things he
   requires that he should be eminent in amongst believers, as those which
   have an especial respect to his work and office. And a failure in any
   of them is a just cause or reason to debar any person from obtaining a
   part and lot in this matter; for whereas the especial end of the
   ministry is to promote and further faith and holiness in the church by
   the edification of it, how unreasonable a thing would it be if men
   should be admitted unto the work of it who in their own persons were
   strangers both unto faith and holiness! And herein are the elders of
   the churches seriously to exercise themselves unto God, that they may
   be an example unto the flock, in a universal labouring after conformity
   in their lives unto the great bishop and pastor of the church, our Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   Thirdly, It is required that such a person have a willing mind to give
   up himself unto God in this work: 1 Pet. v. 1-3, "The elders which are
   among you, I exhort: feed the flock of God which is among you, taking
   the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
   lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage,
   but being ensamples to the flock." Willingness and readiness of mind
   are the things here required as a previous qualification unto any man's
   susception of this office; and two things doth the apostle declare to
   be contrary hereunto:--

   1. The undertaking of it by constraint, which compriseth every
   antecedent external impression upon the mind of the undertaker; such
   are personal outward necessities, compulsions of friends and relations,
   want of other ways of subsistence in the world, -- which, and the like,
   are condemned by the apostle as bringing some constraint on the mind,
   which on other accounts ought to be free and willing; as also, all
   tergiversation and backwardness in persons duly qualified and called,
   on the consideration of difficulties, temptations, straits,
   persecutions, is here condemned.

   2. An eye and regard unto filthy lucre or profit in the world is
   proposed as opposite unto the readiness of mind which is required in
   them that are called to this work. An aim in this employment for men by
   it to advantage themselves in the outward things of this world, --
   without which it is evident that the whole work and office would lie
   neglected by the most of them who now would be accounted partakers of
   it, -- is openly here condemned by the apostle.

   Fourthly, Election, by the suffrage and consent of the church, is
   required unto the calling of a pastor or teacher; so that without it
   formally or virtually given or obtained, the call, however otherwise
   carried on or solemnized, is irregular and defective. There are but two
   places in the New Testament where there is mention of the manner
   whereby any are called in an ordinary way unto any ministry in the
   church, and in both of them there is mention of their election by the
   community of the church; and in both of them the apostles themselves
   presided with a fulness of church-power, and yet would not deprive the
   churches of that which was their liberty and privilege. The first of
   these is Acts vi., where all the apostles together, to give a rule unto
   the future proceeding of all churches in the constitution of officers
   amongst them, do appoint the multitude of the disciples or community of
   the church, to look out from among themselves, or to choose the persons
   that were to be set apart therein unto their office; which they did
   accordingly: Verses 2, 3, 5, "Then the twelve called the multitude of
   the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should
   leave the word of God, and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren, look ye
   out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and
   wisdom. And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
   Stephen," etc. This was done when only deacons were to be ordained, in
   whom the interest and concernment of the church is not to be compared
   with that which it hath in its pastors, teachers, and elders. The same
   is mentioned again, Acts xiv. 23, where Paul and Barnabas are said to
   ordain elders in the churches by their election and suffrage; for the
   word there used will admit of no other sense, however it be ambiguously
   expressed in our translation. Neither can any instance be given of the
   use of that word, applied unto the communication of any office or power
   to any person or persons in an assembly, wherein it denoteth any other
   action but the suffrage of the multitude; and this it doth constantly
   in all writers in the Greek tongue. And hence it was that this right
   and privilege of the church, in choosing of those who are to be set
   over them in the work of the Lord, was a long time preserved inviolate
   in the primitive churches, as the ancients do abundantly testify. Yea,
   the show and appearance of it could never be utterly thrust out of the
   world, but is still retained in those churches which yet reject the
   thing itself. And this institution of our Lord Jesus Christ by his
   apostles is suited to the nature of the church, and of the authority
   that he hath appointed to abide therein; for, as we have showed before,
   persons become a church by their own voluntary consent. Christ makes
   his subjects willing, not slaves; his rule over them is by his grace in
   their own wills, and he will have them every way free in their
   obedience. A church-state is an estate of absolute liberty under
   Christ, not for men to do what they will, but for men to do their duty
   freely, without compulsion. Now, nothing is more contrary to this
   liberty than to have their guides, rulers, and overseers imposed on
   them without their consent. Besides, the body of the church is obliged
   to discharge its duty towards Christ in every institution of his; which
   herein they cannot, if they have not their free consent in the choice
   of their pastors or elders, but are considered as mute persons or brute
   creatures. Neither is there any other ordinary way of communicating
   authority unto any in the church, but by the voluntary submission and
   subjection of the church itself unto them; for as all other imaginable
   ways may fail, and have done so, where they have been trusted unto, so
   they are irrational and unscriptural as to their being a means of the
   delegation of any power whatever.

   Fifthly, Unto this election succeeds the solemn setting apart of them
   that are chosen by the church unto this work and ministry, by fasting,
   prayer, and imposition of the hands of the presbytery, before
   constituted in the church wherein any person is so to be set apart.

   Question 26 -- May a person be called to, or be employed in, a part
   only of the office or work of the ministry; or may he hold the relation
   and exercise the duty of an elder or minister unto more churches than
   one at the same time?

   Answer -- Neither of these has either warrant or precedent in the
   Scripture; nor is the first of them consistent with the authority of
   the ministry, nor the latter with the duty thereof, nor either of them
   with the nature of that relation which is between the elders and the
   church.
   Acts xiv. 23; 1 Pet. v. 2; Acts xx. 28.

   Explication -- There are two parts of this question and answer, to be
   spoken unto severally. The first is concerning a person to be called or
   employed in any church in a part only of the office or work of the
   ministry; -- as suppose a man should be called or chosen by the church
   to administer the sacraments, but not to attend to the work of
   preaching, or unto the rule or guidance of the church; or, in like
   manner, unto any other part or parcel of the work of the ministry, with
   an exemption of other duties from his charge or care. If this be done
   by consent and agreement, for any time or season, it is unwarrantable
   and disorderly (what may be done occasionally upon an emergency, or in
   case of weakness or disability befalling any elder as to the discharge
   of any part of his duty, is not here inquired after); for, --

   First, If the person so called or employed have received gifts fitting
   him for the whole work of the ministry, the exercise of them is not to
   be restrained by any consent or agreement, seeing they are given for
   the edification of the church to be traded withal: 1 Cor. xii. 7, "The
   manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal;"
   and this he who hath received such gifts is bound to attend unto and
   pursue.

   Secondly, If he have not received such gifts as completely to enable
   him unto the discharge of the whole work of the ministry in the church
   wherein he is to administer, it is not lawful for the church to call
   him unto that work wherein the Lord Christ hath not gone before them in
   qualifying him for it; yea, to do so would be most irregular, for the
   whole power of the church consists in its attendance unto the rule
   given unto it: and therefore the office and work of the ministry being
   constituted by the law of Christ, it is not in the power of the church
   to enlarge or straiten the power or duty of any one that is called unto
   the office thereof. Neither can or ought any person that is called unto
   the work of the ministry to give his consent to the restraint of the
   exercise of that gift that he hath received, in a due and orderly
   manner, nor to the abridgment of the authority which the Lord Christ
   hath committed unto the ministers of the gospel.

   As it is incumbent upon them to take care to preserve their whole
   authority, and to discharge their whole duty, so it follows that
   arbitrary constitutions of this nature are irregular, and would bring
   in confusion into churches.

   The second part of the question is concerning the relation of the same
   person to more churches than one at the same time, and his undertaking
   to discharge the duty of his relation unto them, as elder or minister.
   And this also is irregular and unwarrantable. Now, a man may hold the
   relation of an elder, pastor, or minister unto more churches than one,
   two ways:-- 1. Formally and directly, by an equal formal interest in
   them, undertaking the pastoral charge equally and alike of them, being
   called alike to them, and accepting of such a relation. 2. Virtually,
   when, by virtue of his relation unto one church, he puts forth his
   power or authority in ministerial acts in or towards another. The first
   way is unlawful, and destructive both of the office and duty of a
   pastor; for as elders are ordained in and unto the churches
   respectively that they are to take care of, Acts xiv. 23, Titus i. 5,
   and their office-power consists in a relation unto the church that they
   are set over, so they are commanded to attend unto the service of the
   churches wherein and whereunto they are so ordained, Acts xx. 28, 1
   Pet. v. 2, and that with all diligence, care, and watchfulness, as
   those that must give an account, Heb. xiii. 17, which no man is able to
   do towards more churches than one, the same duty being at all times to
   be performed towards all. And because the whole authority of the
   elders, pastors, or bishops of churches, is ministerial, 1 Cor. iv. 1,
   consisting in a power of acting upon the command of Christ, they are
   bound in their own persons to the discharge of their duty and office,
   without the least pretence of authority to delegate another, or others,
   to act their part or to do their duty; which would be an effect of
   autocratical authority, and not of obedience or ministry. The latter
   way, also, of relation unto many churches is unwarrantable: for, -- 1.
   It hath no warrant in the Scripture; no law or constitution of Christ
   or his apostles can be produced to give it countenance; but elders were
   ordained to their own churches, and commanded to attend unto them. 2.
   No rule is given unto any elders how they should behave themselves in
   reference unto more churches than one, in the exercise of their
   ministerial power, as there are rules given unto every one for the
   discharge of that duty in the church whereunto he is related. 3. There
   is no example to give it countenance recorded in the Scripture. 4. The
   authority to be put forth hath no foundation. (1.) Not in the gifts
   they have received; for the ministerial power is not an absolute
   ability or faculty of doing what a man is able, but a right, whereby a
   man hath power to do that rightly and lawfully which before he could
   not do. This, gifts will not give to any; for if they did, they would
   do it to all that have received them. (2.) Not in their election; for
   they are chosen in and by that church whereunto they stand in especial
   relation, whose choice cannot give ministerial power over any but
   themselves. (3.) Not in their setting apart by fasting, prayer, and
   imposition of hands; for this is only unto that office-work and power
   whereunto they are chosen. They are not chosen for one end, and set
   apart for another. (4.) Not from the communion of churches; for that
   gives no new power, but only a due exercise of that which was before
   received.

   Question 27 -- What are the principal duties of the pastors or teachers
   of the church?

   Answer -- ^aTo be examples unto the flock in faith, love, knowledge,
   meekness, patience, readiness to suffer for the name and gospel of
   Christ, with constancy therein; ^bto watch for the souls and take care
   of all the spiritual concernments of the whole flock committed to them;
   ^cto preach the word diligently, dividing it aright; ^dto preserve and
   contend for the truth; ^eto administer all the ordinances of the gospel
   duly and orderly; ^fto stir up and exercise the gifts they have
   received in the discharge of their whole work and administration of all
   ordinances; ^gto instruct, admonish, cherish, and comfort all the
   members of the church, as their conditions, occasions, and necessities
   do require; ^hto attend with diligence, skill, and wisdom unto the
   discharge of that authority which in the rule of the church is
   committed unto them.

   ^hRom. xii. 7, 8; 1 Tim. v. 17.

   The answer is full and plain.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 28 -- Wherein principally doth the authority of the elders of
   the church consist?

   Answer -- ^aIn that the rule of the church and the guidance thereof, in
   things appertaining unto the worship of God, is committed unto them.
   And, therefore, ^bwhatever they do as elders in the church, according
   unto rule, they do it not in the name or authority of the church by
   which their power is derived unto them, nor as members only of the
   church by their own consent or covenant, but in the name and authority
   of Jesus Christ, from whom, by virtue of his law and ordinance, their
   ministerial office and power are received. So that, ^cin the exercise
   of any church-power, by and with the consent of the church, there is an
   obligation thence proceeding, which ariseth immediately from that
   authority which they have received of Jesus Christ, which is the spring
   of all rule and authority in the church.
   ^aActs xx. 28; Heb. xiii. 7, 17; 1 Pet. v. 2; 1 Cor. xii. 28.
   ^b1 Tim. iii. 5; Col. iv. 17; 2 Cor. x. 4, 8.
   ^c1 Tim. iv. 11; Titus ii. 15; 1 Pet. v. 2-5.

   Explication -- The answer unto this question explains the power or
   authority of the elders of the church, from whom they do receive it,
   and how it is exercised by them; the right stating whereof is of great
   importance in the whole discipline of the church, and must, therefore,
   here be farther explained. To this end we may consider, --

   First, That all church-power is originally vested in Jesus Christ, the
   sole head and monarch thereof. God the Father hath committed it unto
   him, and intrusted him with it for the accomplishment of his work of
   mediation, Matt. xxviii. 18.

   Secondly, That he doth communicate of this authority by way of trust,
   to be exercised by them in his name, unto persons by him appointed, so
   much is needful for the ordering and disposing of all things in his
   churches unto the blessed ends for which he hath instituted and
   appointed them; for no man can have any power in his church, for any
   end whatever, but by delegation from him. What is not received from him
   is mere usurpation. And whoever takes upon himself the exercise of any
   rule, or authority, or power in the church, not granted unto them by
   him, or not rightly derived from him, is an oppressor, a "thief and a
   robber." This necessarily follows upon the absolute investiture of all
   power in him alone, 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 11, 12.

   Thirdly, The means whereby the Lord Christ communicates this power unto
   men is by his law and constitution, whereby he hath granted, ordained,
   and appointed, that such and such powers shall be exercised in his
   church, and that by such and such persons, to be derived unto them in
   such a way and manner; so that the word of the gospel, or the laws and
   constitutions of the Lord Christ therein, are the first recipient seat
   and subject morally of all church-power whatever, Matt. xvi. 19, xviii.
   17-20.

   Fourthly, The way and means whereby any persons come to a participation
   of this power regularly, according to the mind of Christ, is by the
   obedience unto, and due observation of, his laws and commands in them
   unto whom they are prescribed; as when an office, with the power of it,
   is constituted and limited by the law of the land, there is no more
   required to invest any man in that office, or to give him that power,
   than the due observance of the means and way prescribed in the law to
   that end. The way, then, whereby the elders of the church do come to
   participate of the power and authority which Christ hath appointed to
   be exercised in his church is by their and the church's due observance
   of the rules and laws given by him for their election and setting apart
   unto that office, Heb. v. 4, 5; Acts xiv. 23.

   Fifthly, On this account they receive their power from Christ himself
   alone, and that immediately; for the means used for their participation
   of it are not recipient of the power itself formally, nor do
   authoritatively collate or confer it, only the laws of Christ are
   executed in a way of obedience. So that though they are chosen and set
   apart to their office by the church, yet they are made overseers by the
   Holy Ghost, Acts xx. 28. Though they have their power by the church,
   yet they have it not from the church; nor was that power whereof they
   are made partakers, as was said, formally resident in the body of the
   church, before their participation of it, but really in Christ himself
   alone, and morally in his word or law. And thence is the rule and
   guidance of the church committed unto them by Christ, Heb. xiii. 7, 17;
   1 Pet. v. 2; 1 Tim. iii. 5.

   Sixthly, This authority and power, thus received from Christ, is that
   which they exert and put forth in all their ministerial
   administrations, in all which they do as ministers in the house of God,
   either in his worship or in the rule of the church itself. They
   exercise that authority of Christ which he hath in his law appointed to
   be exercised in his church; and from that authority is due order given
   unto the administration of all the ordinances of worship, and an
   obligation unto obedience to acts of rule doth thence also ensue; so
   that they who despise them despise the authority of Christ.

   Seventhly, When, as elders, they do or declare any thing in the name of
   the church, they do not, as such, put forth any authority committed
   unto them from and by the church, but only declare the consent and
   determination of the church in the exercise of their own liberty and
   privilege; but the authority which they act by, and which they put
   forth, is that which is committed to themselves, as such, by Jesus
   Christ.

   Eighthly, This authority is comprised in the law and constitution of
   Christ, which themselves exert only ministerially; and therefore, when
   ever they act any thing authoritatively, which they are not enabled for
   or warranted in by the word of the gospel, or do any thing without or
   contrary unto rule, all such actings, as to any spiritual effect of the
   gospel, or obligation on the consciences of men, are "ipso facto" null,
   and are no way ratified in heaven, where all their orderly actings are
   made valid, -- that is, by Christ himself in his word.

   Ninthly, The reason, therefore, why the consent of the church is
   required unto the authoritative acting of the elders therein is, not
   because from thence any authority doth accrue unto them anew, which
   virtually and radically they had not before, but because by the rule of
   the gospel this is required to the orderly acting of their power, which
   without it would be contrary to rule, and therefore ineffectual; as
   also it must needs be from the nature of the thing itself, for no act
   can take place in the church without or against its own consent, whilst
   its obedience is voluntary and of choice.

   But if it be asked, "What, then, shall the elders do in case the church
   refuse to consent unto such acts as are indeed according to rule, and
   warranted by the institution of Christ?" it is answered, that they are,
   -- 1. Diligently to instruct them from the word in their duty, making
   known the mind of Christ unto them in the matter under consideration;
   2. To declare unto them the danger of their dissent in obstructing the
   edification of the body, to the dishonour of the Lord Christ and their
   own spiritual disadvantage; 3. To wait patiently for the concurrence of
   the grace of God with their ministry in giving light and obedience unto
   the church; and, 4. In case of the church's continuance in any failure
   of duty, to seek for advice and counsel from the elders and brethren of
   other churches; -- all which particulars might be enlarged, would the
   nature of our present design and work permit it.

   Question 29 -- What is the duty of the church towards their elders,
   pastors, or teachers?

   Answer -- ^aTo have them in reverence and honour for their office and
   work's sake; ^bto obey them conscientiously in all things wherein they
   speak unto them in the name of the Lord; ^cto pray earnestly for them,
   that they may, and to exhort them, if need require, to fulfil the work
   of the ministry; ^dto communicate unto them of their temporals, for
   their comfortable subsistence in the world and usefulness unto others;
   ^ewisely to order things by their direction, so as that they may be
   amongst them without fear; ^fto abide with and stand by them in their
   sufferings for the gospel, and service of Christ among them.

   Question 30 -- Are there any differences in the office or offices of
   the guides, rulers, elders, or ministers of the church?

   Answer -- The office of them that are teachers is one and the same
   among them all; but where there are many in the same church, it is the
   will of Christ that they should be peculiarly assigned unto such
   especial work, in the discharge of their office-power, as their gifts
   received from him do peculiarly fit them for and the necessities of the
   church require.
   Rom. xii. 4-8; 1 Cor. xii. 4-6, 8; 1 Pet. iv. 10, v. 2.

   Explication -- The office of them that are to instruct the church in
   the name and authority of Christ is one and the same, as hath been
   showed before. And there are many names that are equally accommodated
   unto all that are partakers of it, as elders, bishops, guides; they are
   all alike elders, alike bishops, alike guides, -- have the one office
   in common amongst them, and every one the whole entire unto himself.
   But there are names also given unto them, whereby they are
   distinguished, not as to office, but as to their work and employment in
   the discharge of that office: such are "pastors and teachers," Eph. iv.
   11, which are placed as distinct persons in their work, partakers of
   the same office. Now, the foundation of this distinction and difference
   lies, --

   First, In the different gifts that they have received; for although it
   be required in them all that they have received all those gifts,
   abilities, and qualifications which are necessary for the work of the
   ministry, yet as to the degrees of their participation of their gifts,
   some may more excel in one, others in another: 1 Cor. xii. 4-6, 8,
   "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. And there are
   differences of administrations, but the same Lord. And there are
   diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in
   all. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
   the word of knowledge by the same Spirit," etc. And all these gifts are
   bestowed upon them to be exercised and laid out for the profit and
   benefit of the church: Verse 7, "The manifestation of the Spirit is
   given to every man to profit withal." And therefore every one is in an
   especial manner to attend unto the exercise and use of that gift
   wherein he doth excel, or which tends most to the edification of the
   church, every man being to minister according as he hath received, 1
   Pet. iv. 10.

   Secondly, It lies in the nature of the work of the ministry in the
   church, which in general may be referred unto two heads or ends:--

   1. The instruction of it in the knowledge of God in Christ, and the
   mysteries of the gospel, that it might grow in grace, wisdom, saving
   light, and knowledge.

   2. The exhortation of it to walk answerable unto light received, in
   holiness and universal obedience. Now, though these several ends of the
   ministry cannot be divided or separated, yet they may be distinguished,
   and so carried on distinctly, that in the one, knowledge or light may
   be firstly and principally intended, so as to lead unto obedience; in
   the other, holiness may be firstly designed, as springing from gospel
   light or knowledge. Hence, therefore, are the elders of the church
   principally to attend unto that work, or that end of the ministry,
   which by the Holy Ghost they are most suited unto. And, therefore, the
   church following the intimations of the Holy Ghost, in communicating
   his gifts in variety as he pleaseth, and attending to their own
   edification, may and ought, amongst those whom they choose to the
   office of elders or ministers, withal design them in particular unto
   that especial work which they are especially fitted and prepared for;
   and this, upon their being chosen and set apart, they are accordingly
   to attend unto: "He that teacheth, on teaching; he that exhorteth, on
   exhortation," Rom. xii. 7, 8. Their office, then, is the same; but
   their teaching work and employment, on the grounds mentioned, distinct
   and different.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 31 -- Are there appointed any elders in the church whose
   office and duty consist in rule and government only?

   Answer -- Elders not called to teach ordinarily or administer the
   sacraments, but to assist and help in the rule and government of the
   church, are mentioned in the Scripture.
   Rom. xii. 8; 1 Cor. xii. 28; 1 Tim. v. 17.

   Explication -- This office of ruling elders in the church is much
   opposed by some, and in especial by them who have least reason so to
   do: for, first, they object against them that they are lay elders, when
   those with whom they have to do deny that distinction of the church
   into the clergy and laity; for although they allow the distribution of
   it into officers and the multitude of the brethren, yet they maintain
   that the whole church is God's clergy, his lot, and portion, 1 Pet. v.
   3. Again, they affirm them to be elders, and therein not merely of the
   members of the church, but officers set apart unto their office
   according to rule, or the appointment of Christ. And if by laity, the
   people distinct from the officers of the church are to be understood,
   the very term of a lay elder implies a contradiction, as designing one
   who is and is not a church-officer. Besides, themselves do principally
   govern the church by such whom they esteem laymen, as not in holy
   orders, to whom the principal part of its rule, at least in the
   execution of it, is committed; which renders their objection to this
   sort of church-officers unreasonable. Others, also, have given
   advantage by making this office annual or biennial in them that are
   chosen unto it; which, though they plead the necessity of their
   churches for, as not having persons meet for this work and duty who are
   willing to undertake it constantly during their lives, without such a
   contribution for their maintenance as they are not able to afford, yet
   the wisest of them do acknowledge an irregularity in what they do, and
   wish it remedied. But this hinders not but that such church-officers
   are indeed designed in the Scripture, and of whom frequent mention is
   made in the ancient writers, and footsteps also yet remain in most
   churches of their institution, though woefully corrupted; for besides
   that some light in this matter may be taken from the church of the
   Jews, wherein the elders of the people were joined in rule with the
   priests, both in the sanhedrin and all lesser assemblies, there is in
   the gospel express mention of persons that were assigned peculiarly for
   rule and government in the church, as 1 Cor. xii. 28. And it is in vain
   pretended that those words, "helps, governments," do denote gifts only,
   seeing the apostle expressly enumerates the persons in office, or
   officers, which the Lord Christ then used in the foundation and rule of
   the churches as then planted. He that ruleth, also, is distinguished
   from him that teacheth and him that exhorteth, Rom. xii. 8; and is
   prescribed diligence as his principal qualification in the discharge of
   his duty. And the words of the apostle to this purpose are express: 1
   Tim. v. 17, "Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double
   honour, especially those who labour in the word and doctrine." For the
   words expressly assign two sorts of elders, whereof some only attend
   unto rule; others, moreover, labour in the word and doctrine. Neither
   doth that word, as some would have it, "labour in the word," intend any
   other labour but what is incumbent on all the pastors and teachers of
   the church as their constant duty. See Rom. xvi. 12; Acts xx. 35; 1
   Thess. v. 12. Now, can we suppose that the apostle would affirm them to
   be worthy of double honour, whom, comparing with others, he notes as
   remiss and negligent in their work? for it seems that others were more
   diligent in the discharge of that duty, which was no less theirs, if
   only one sort of elders be here intended. The Scripture is not wont to
   commend such persons as worthy of double honour, but rather to propose
   them as meet for double shame and punishment, Jer. xlviii. 10; 1 Cor.
   ix. 16. And they are unmindful of their own interest who would have
   bishops that attend to the rule of the church to be distinctly intended
   by the elders that rule well, seeing the apostle expressly preferreth
   before and above them those that attend constantly to the word and
   doctrine. And besides what is thus expressly spoken concerning the
   appointment of this sort of elders in the church, their usefulness, in
   the necessity of their work and employment, is evident; for whereas a
   constant care in the church that the conversation of all the members of
   it be such as becometh the gospel, that the name of our Lord Jesus
   Christ be not evil spoken of, is of great concernment and importance,
   and the pastors and teachers, being to give up themselves continually
   unto prayer and the ministry of the word, cannot attend unto the
   constant and daily oversight thereof, the usefulness of these elders,
   whose proper and peculiar work it is to have regard unto the holy
   walking of the church, must needs be manifest unto all. But whereas in
   most churches there is little or no regard unto the personal holiness
   of the members of them, it is no wonder that no account should be had
   of them who are ordained by the Lord Christ to look after it and
   promote it.

   The qualification of these elders, with the way of their call and
   setting apart unto their office, being the same with those of the
   teaching elders before insisted on, need not be here again repeated.
   Their authority, also, in the whole rule of the church, is every way
   the same with that of the other sort of elders; and they are to act in
   the execution of it with equal respect and regard from the church. Yea,
   the business of rule being peculiarly committed unto them, and they
   required to attend thereunto with diligence in an especial manner, the
   work thereof is principally theirs, as that of labouring in the word
   and doctrine doth especially belong unto the pastors and teachers of
   the churches. And this institution is abused when either unmeet persons
   are called to this office, or those that are called do not attend unto
   their duty with diligence, or do act only in it by the guidance of the
   teaching officers, without a sense of their own authority, or due
   respect from the church.

   Question 32 -- Is there no other ordinary office in the church but only
   that of elders?

   Answer -- Yes, of deacons also.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 33 -- What are the deacons of the church?

   Answer -- Approved men chosen by the church to take care for the
   necessities of the poor belonging thereunto, and other outward
   occasions of the whole church, by the collection, keeping, and
   distribution of the alms and other supplies of the church; set apart
   and commended to the grace of God therein by prayer.
   Acts vi. 3, 5, 6; Phil. i. 1; 1 Tim. iii. 8-13.

   Explication -- The office of the deacon, the nature, end, and use of
   it, the qualifications of the persons to be admitted unto it, the way
   and manner of their election and setting apart, are all of them plainly
   expressed in the Scripture: Acts vi. 1-3, 5, 6, "There arose a
   murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows
   were neglected in the daily ministration. Then the twelve called the
   multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that
   we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. Wherefore, brethren,
   look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy
   Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. And the
   saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen," etc.,
   "whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid
   their hands on them." 1 Tim. iii. 8-13, "Likewise must the deacons be
   grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy
   lucre; holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. And let
   these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon,
   being found blameless; the husbands of one wife, ruling their children
   and their own houses well. For they that have used the office of a
   deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in
   the faith which is in Christ Jesus." These things are thus plain and
   express in the Scripture. But whereas many have grown weary of the
   observation of the institutions of the gospel, this office hath for a
   long time been lost amongst the most of Christians. By some the name is
   retained, but applied to another work, duty, and employment, than this
   to which it is peculiarly appropriated in the Scripture. Their proper
   and original work of taking care for the poor, they say, is provided
   for by others; and therefore that office being needless, another, unto
   another purpose, under the same name, is erected. Such are deacons that
   may read service, preach, and baptize, when they have license
   thereunto. But this choice, to reject an office of the appointment of
   Christ, under pretence of provision made for the duties of it another
   way, and the erecting of one not appointed by him, seems not equal. But
   whereas it is our duty in all things to have regard to the authority of
   Christ and his appointments in the gospel, if we claim the privilege of
   being called after his name, some think that if what he hath appointed
   may be colourably performed another way without respect unto his
   institutions, that is far the best; but omitting the practice of other
   men, the things that concern this office in the church are, as was
   said, clear in the Scripture.

   First, The persons called unto it are to be of honest report, furnished
   with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, especially with wisdom, Acts vi. 3,
   and those other endowments useful in the discharge of their duty
   mentioned, 1 Tim. iii. 8-13.

   Secondly, The way whereby they come to be made partakers of this office
   is by the choice or election of the church, Acts vi. 2, 3, 5, whereupon
   they are solemnly to be set apart by prayer.

   Thirdly, Their work or duty consists in a daily ministration unto the
   necessities of the poor saints, or members of the church, verses 1, 2.

   Fourthly, To this end, that they may be enabled so to do, it is
   ordained that every first day [of the week] the members of the church
   do contribute, according as God enables them, of their substance for
   the supply of the wants of the poor, 1 Cor. xvi. 2; and also
   occasionally, as necessity shall require, or God move their hearts by
   his grace.

   Fifthly, Hereunto is to be added whatever by the providence of God may
   be conferred upon the church for its outward advantage, with reference
   unto the end mentioned, Acts iv. 34, 35.

   Sixthly, These supplies of the church being committed to the care and
   charge of the deacons, they are from thence to minister with diligence
   and wisdom unto the necessities of the poor; that so the needy may be
   supplied, that there may be none that lack, the rich may contribute of
   their riches according to the mind of Christ, and in obedience unto his
   command; that they which minister well in this office "may purchase to
   themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith," and that in
   all the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified with praise and
   thanksgiving.

   It belongs, therefore, unto persons called unto this office, --

   First, To acquaint themselves with the outward condition of those that
   appear to be poor and needy in the church, whether by the addresses of
   such poor ones, who are bound to make known their wants, occasions, and
   necessities unto them, or by the information of others, or their own
   observation.

   Secondly, To acquaint the elders and the church, as occasion requireth,
   with the necessities of the poor under their care, that those who are
   able may be stirred up by the elders to a free supply and contribution.

   Thirdly, To dispose of what they are intrusted with faithfully,
   cheerfully, tenderly, without partiality or preferring one before
   another, for any outward respect whatever.

   Fourthly, To keep and give an account unto the church, when called for,
   of what they have received, and how they have disposed of it; that so
   they may be known to have well discharged their office, -- that is,
   with care, wisdom, and tenderness, -- whereby they procure to
   themselves a good degree, with boldness in the faith, and the church is
   encouraged to intrust them farther with this sacrifice of their alms,
   which is so acceptable unto God.

   Question 34 -- Wherein consists the general duty of the whole church,
   and every member thereof, in their proper station and condition?

   Answer -- In performing, doing, and keeping inviolate all the commands
   and institutions of Jesus Christ, walking unblamably and fruitfully in
   the world, holding forth the word of truth, and glorifying the Lord
   Christ in and by the profession of his name, and keeping his testimony
   unto the end.
   Matt. xxviii. 20; Acts ii. 42; Phil. ii. 15, 16, iv. 8, 9; 1 Thess.
   iii. 8; 1 Pet. iv. 10-14; 1 Tim. iii. 15; Heb. x. 23.

   Explication -- Besides the general duties of Christianity incumbent on
   all believers or disciples of Christ, as such, there are sundry
   especial duties required of them as gathered into church-societies,
   upon the account of an especial trust committed unto them in that state
   and condition; for, --

   First, The church being appointed as the seat and subject of all the
   institutions of Christ and ordinances of Gospel worship, it is its
   duty, -- that is, of the whole body, and every member in his proper
   place, -- to use all care, watchfulness, and diligence that all the
   commands of Christ be kept inviolate, and all his institutions observed
   according to his mind and will. Thus, those "added to the church," Acts
   ii. 42, together with the whole church, "continued stedfastly" (which
   argues care, circumspection, and diligence) "in the apostles' doctrine
   and fellowship, and breaking of bread, and in prayers;" which principal
   duties are enumerated to express their respect towards all. This is
   their "standing fast in the Lord," which was a matter of such joy to
   the apostle when he found it in the Thessalonians, 1 Epist. iii. 8,
   "For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord;" -- that order and
   steadfastness which he rejoiced over in the Colossians, chap ii. 5 "For
   though I be absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit,
   joying and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in
   Christ." And where this duty is despised, men contenting themselves
   with what is done by others, there is a great neglect of that
   faithfulness in obedience which the church owes unto Jesus Christ.

   Secondly, The glory of the Lord Christ, and the doctrine of the gospel,
   to be manifested in and by the power of a holy, exemplary conversation,
   is committed unto the church and all the members of it. This is one end
   wherefore the Lord Christ calls them out of the world, separates them
   to be a peculiar people unto himself, brings them forth unto a visible
   profession, and puts his name upon them, -- namely, that in their
   walking and conversation he may show forth the holiness of his
   doctrine, and power of his Spirit, grace, and example, to effect in
   them all holiness, godliness, righteousness, and honesty in the world.
   Hence are they earnestly exhorted unto these things: Phil. iv. 8,
   "Brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest,
   whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
   things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be
   any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things;" and
   that to this end, that the doctrine of the gospel may be adorned, and
   Christ glorified in all things, Titus ii. 10. And those who fail herein
   are said to be "the enemies of the cross of Christ," Phil. iii. 18, as
   hindering the progress of the doctrine thereof, by rendering it
   undesirable in their conversation. This also, therefore, even the duty
   of universal holiness, with an especial regard unto the honour of
   Christ and the gospel, which they are called and designed to testify
   and express in the world, is incumbent on the church, and every member
   of it, namely, as the apostle speaks, "that they may be blameless and
   harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked
   and perverse nation," among whom they are to "shine as lights in the
   world," Phil. ii. 15.

   Thirdly, The care of declaring and manifesting the truth is also
   committed unto them. Christ hath made the church to be the "pillar and
   ground of the truth," 1 Tim. iii. 15; where the truth of the gospel is
   to be firmly seated, founded, fixed, established, and then lifted up in
   the ways of Christ's appointment, to be seen, discerned, and known by
   others. And as this is done principally in the preaching of the gospel
   by the elders of the church, and in their "contending for the faith
   once delivered unto the saints," Jude 3, so it is also the duty of the
   whole church to "hold forth the word of life," Phil. ii. 16, by
   ministering of "the gifts that every man hath received," 1 Pet. iv. 10,
   in the way of Christ's appointment. In these and the like instances
   doth our Lord Jesus Christ require of his church that they express in
   the world their subjection unto him and his authority; and that they
   abide therein unto the end against all opposition whatever.

   The sinful neglect of churches in the discharge of their duty herein
   was one great means of that apostasy from the rule of the gospel which
   they generally of old fell into. When the members of them began to
   think that they had no advantage by their state and condition, but only
   the outward participation of some ordinances of worship, and no duty
   incumbent on them but only to attend and follow the motions and actings
   of their guides, the whole societies quickly became corrupt, and fit to
   be disposed of according to the carnal interest of those that had by
   their neglect and sin gotten dominion over them. And at all times, as
   the people were negligent in their duty, the leaders of them were apt
   to usurp undue authority. When the one sort will not do that which they
   ought, the other are ready to take upon them what they ought not. It is
   a circumspect performance of duty on all hands alone that will keep all
   sorts of persons in the church within those bounds and limits, and up
   to those rights and privileges, which Christ hath allotted and granted
   unto them. And herein alone doth the order, honour, and beauty of the
   church consist. Church-members, therefore, are to search and inquire
   after the particular duties which, as such, are incumbent on them; as
   also to consider what influence their special state and condition, as
   they are church-members, ought to have into all the duties of their
   obedience as they are Christians: for this privilege is granted unto
   them for their edification; that is, their furtherance in their whole
   course of walking before God. And if this be neglected, -- if they
   content themselves with a name to live in this or that church, to
   partake of the ordinances that are stated and solemnly administered
   only, -- that which would have been to their advantage may prove to be
   a snare and temptation unto them. What these especial duties are, in
   the particular instances of them, is of too large a consideration here
   to be insisted on. Besides, it is the great duty of the guides of the
   church to be inculcating of them into the minds of those committed to
   their charge; for the church's due performance of its duty is their
   honour, crown, and reward.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 35 -- Whence do you reckon prayer, which is a part of moral
   and natural worship, among the institutions of Christ in his church?

   Answer -- On many accounts; as, -- ^abecause the Lord Christ hath
   commanded his church to attend unto the worship of God therein;
   ^bbecause he bestows on the ministers of the church gifts and ability
   of prayer for the benefit and edification thereof; ^che hath appointed
   that all his other ordinances should be administered with prayer,
   whereby it becomes a part of them; ^dbecause himself ministers in the
   holy place, as the great high priest of his church, to present their
   prayers unto God at the throne of grace; ^ebecause in all the prayers
   of the church there is an especial regard had unto himself and the
   whole work of his mediation.
   ^aLuke xviii. 1, xxi. 36; Rom. xii. 12; 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2.
   ^bEph. iv. 8, 12, 13; Rom. viii. 15, 16; Gal. iv. 6.
   ^cActs ii. 42; 1 Tim. iv. 5.

   ^eJohn xiv. 13, John xv. 16, xvi. 23, 26; Eph. iii. 14, 15.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 36 -- May not the church, in the solemn worship of God, and
   celebration of the ordinances of the gospel, make use of and content
   itself in the use of forms of prayer in an unknown tongue composed by
   others, and prescribed unto them?

   Answer -- So to do would be ^acontrary to one principal end of prayer
   itself, which is, that believers may therein apply themselves to the
   throne of grace for spiritual supplies according to the present
   condition, wants, and exigencies of their souls; ^bto the main end that
   the Lord Jesus Christ aimed at in supplying men with gifts for the
   discharge of the work of the ministry, tending to render the promise of
   sending the Holy Ghost, which is the immediate cause of the church's
   preservation and continuance, needless and useless. Moreover, ^cit will
   render the discharge of the duty of ministers unto several precepts and
   exhortations of the gospel, for the use, stirring up, and exercise of
   their gifts, impossible; and ^dthereby hinder the edification of the
   church, the great end of all ordinances and institutions.
   ^aRom. viii. 26; Phil. iv. 6; Heb. iv. 16; 1 Pet. iv. 7.
   ^bEph. iv. 8, 12, 13.

   ^d1 Cor. xii. 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 37 -- Is the constant work of preaching the gospel by the
   elders of the church necessary?

   Answer -- It is so, both on the part of the elders or ministers
   themselves, of whom that duty is strictly required, and who principally
   therein labour and watch for the good of the flock, and on the part of
   the church, for the furtherance of their faith and obedience, by
   instruction, reproof, exhortation, and consolation.
   Matt. xxiv. 45-51; Rom. xii. 7, 8; 1 Cor. ix. 17, 18; Eph. iv. 11-13; 1
   Tim. iv. 15, 16, v. 17; 2 Tim. ii. 24, 25iii. 14-17, iv. 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 38 -- Who are the principal subjects of baptism?

   Answer -- Professing believers, if not baptized in their infancy, and
   their infant seed.
   Matt. xxviii. 19; Acts ii. 38, 39, xvi. 33; 1 Cor. i. 16, vii. 14; Col.
   ii. 12-14, with Gen. xvii. 10-12.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 39 -- Where and to whom is the ordinance of the Lord's supper
   to be administered?

   Answer -- In the church, or assembly of the congregation, to all the
   members of it, rightly prepared and duly assembled, or to such of them
   as are so assembled.
   1 Cor. xi. 20-22, 28, 29, 33; Acts ii. 46.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 40 -- How often is that ordinance to be administered?

   Answer -- Every first day of the week, or at least as often as
   opportunity and conveniency may be obtained.
   1 Cor. xi. 26; Acts xx. 7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 41 -- What is the discipline of the church?

   Answer -- It consists in the due exercise of that authority and power
   which the Lord Christ, in and by his word, hath granted unto the
   church, for its continuance, increase, and preservation in purity,
   order, and holiness, according to his appointment.
   Matt. xvi. 19; Rom. xii. 8; 2 Cor. x. 4-6; Rev. ii. 2, 20.

   Explication -- Sundry things are to be considered about this discipline
   of the church; as, --

   First, The foundation of it, which is a grant of power and authority
   made unto it by Jesus Christ as mediator, head, king, and lawgiver of
   his church; for all discipline being an act of power, and this being
   exercised in and about things internal and spiritual, no men can of
   themselves, or by grant of any others, have any right or authority to
   or in the exercise thereof. Whoever hath any interest herein or right
   hereunto, it must be granted unto him from above by Jesus Christ, and
   that as mediator and head of his church; for as all church-power is in
   an especial manner, by the authority and grant of the Father, vested in
   him alone, Matt. xxviii. 18, Eph. i. 20-23, so the nature of it, which
   is spiritual, the objects of it, which are the consciences and gospel
   privileges of believers, with the ends of it, -- namely, the glory of
   God in Christ, with the spiritual and eternal good of the souls of men,
   -- do all manifest that it can have no other right nor foundation. This
   in the first place is to be fixed, that no authority can be exercised
   in the church but what is derived from Jesus Christ, as was spoken
   before.

   Secondly, The means whereby the Lord Christ doth communicate this power
   and authority unto his church in his word or his law and constitution
   concerning it in the gospel; so that it is exactly limited and bounded
   thereby. And no power or authority can be exercised in the church but
   what is granted and conveyed unto it by the word, seeing that Christ
   communicates no power or authority any other ways. Whatever of that
   nature is beside it or beyond it is mere usurpation, and null in its
   exercise. Herein is the commission of the guides and rulers of the
   church expressed, which they are not to exceed in any thing. Herein are
   bounds and limits fixed to the actings of the whole church, and of
   every part and member of it.

   Thirdly, This power or authority, thus granted and conveyed by Jesus
   Christ, is to be exercised, as to the manner of the administration of
   discipline, with skill and diligence, Rom. xii. 8; 1 Cor. xii. And the
   skill required hereunto is a gift, or an ability of mind, bestowed by
   the Holy Ghost upon men, to put in execution the laws of Christ for the
   government of the church in the way and order by him appointed, or a
   spiritual wisdom, whereby men know how to behave themselves in the
   house of God in their several places, for its due edification in faith
   and love, 1 Tim. iii. 15. And this ability of mind to make a due
   application of the laws of the gospel unto persons, times, and actions,
   with their circumstances, is such a gift of the Holy Ghost as whereof
   there are several degrees, answering to the distinct duties that are
   incumbent on the rulers of the church on the one hand, and the members
   on the other. And where this skill and wisdom is wanting, there it is
   impossible that the discipline of the church should be preserved or
   carried on. Hereunto also diligence and watchfulness are to be added,
   without which ability and power will never obtain their proper end in a
   due manner, Rom. xii. 6-8.

   Fourthly, The end of this discipline is the continuance, increase, and
   preservation of the church, according to the rule of its first
   institution, 1 Cor. v. 7. This power hath Christ given his church for
   its conservation, without which it must necessarily decay and come to
   nothing. Nor is it to be imagined that where any church is called and
   gathered according to the mind of Christ, he hath left it destitute of
   power and authority to preserve itself in that state and order which he
   hath appointed unto it. And that which was one principal cause of the
   decays of the Asian churches was the neglect of this discipline, the
   power and privilege whereof the Lord had left unto them and intrusted
   them withal, for their own preservation in order, purity, and holiness.
   And, therefore, for the neglect thereof they were greatly blamed by
   him, Rev. ii. 14, 15, 20, iii. 1, 2; as is also the church of Corinth
   by the apostle, 1 Cor. v. 2; as they are commended who attended unto
   the diligent exercise of it, Rev. ii. 2, iii. 9. The disuse, also, of
   it hath been the occasion of all the defilements, abominations, and
   confusions that have spread themselves over many churches in the world.

   Question 42 -- Unto whom is the power and administration of this
   discipline committed by Jesus Christ?

   Answer -- As to the authority to be exerted in it, in the things
   wherein the whole church is concerned, unto the elders; as unto trial,
   judgment, and consent in and unto its exercise, unto the whole
   brotherhood; as unto love, care, and watchfulness in private and
   particular cases, to every member of the church.
   Matt. xxiv. 45; Eph. iv. 11, 12; Acts xx. 28; 1 Tim. iii. 5, v. 17;
   Heb. xiii. 7, 17; 1 Pet. v. 2; 1 Thess. v. 12; Gal. vi. 1, 2; 1 Cor.
   iv. 14, v. 2, 4, 5; 2 Cor. ii. 6-8; 2 Tim. iv. 2.

   Explication -- It hath been showed that this power is granted unto the
   church by virtue of the law and constitution of Christ. Now, this law
   assigns the means and way whereby any persons do obtain an interest
   therein, and makes the just allotments to all concerned in it. What
   this law, constitution, or word of Christ assigns unto any, as such,
   that they are the first seat and subject of, by what way or means
   soever they come to be intrusted therein. Thus, that power or authority
   which is given unto the elders of the church doth not first formally
   reside in the body of the church unorganized or distinct from them,
   though they are called unto their office by their suffrage and choice;
   but they are themselves, as such, the first subject of office-power,
   for so is the will of the Lord Christ. Nor is the interest of the whole
   church in this power of discipline, whatever it be, given unto it by
   the elders, but is immediately granted unto it by the will and law of
   the Lord Jesus.

   First, In this way and manner the authority above described is given in
   the first place, as such, unto the elders of the church. This authority
   was before explained, in answer unto the 28^th question; as also was
   the way whereby they receive it. And it is that power of office whereby
   they are enabled for the discharge of their whole duty, in the teaching
   and ruling of the church, called the "power of the keys," from Matt.
   xvi. 19; which expression being metaphorical, and in general liable
   unto many interpretations, is to be understood according to the
   declaration made of it in those particular instances wherein it is
   expressed. Nor is it a twofold power or authority that the elders of
   the church have committed unto them, -- one to teach and another to
   rule, commonly called the power of order and of jurisdiction; but it is
   one power of office, the duties whereof are of several kinds, referred
   unto the two general heads, first of teaching, by preaching the word
   and celebration of the sacraments, and secondly, of rule or government.
   By virtue hereof are they made rulers over the house of God, Matt.
   xxiv. 45; stewards in his house, 1 Cor. iv. 1; overseers of the church,
   Acts xx. 28, 1 Pet. v. 2; guides unto the church, Heb. xiii. 7, 17. Not
   that they have a supreme or autocratorical power committed unto them,
   to enable them to do what seems right and good in their own eyes,
   seeing they are expressly bound up unto the terms of their commission,
   Matt. xxviii. 19, 20, to teach men to do and observe all and only what
   Christ hath commanded; nor have they by virtue of it any dominion in or
   over the church, -- that is, the laws, rules, or privileges of it, --
   or the consciences of the disciples of Christ, to alter, change, add,
   diminish, or bind by their own authority, 1 Pet. v. 3, Mark x. 42-44.
   But it is a power merely ministerial, in whose exercise they are unto
   the Lord Christ accountable servants, Heb. xiii. 17, Matt. xxiv. 45,
   and servants of the church for Jesus' sake, 2 Cor. iv. 5. This
   authority, in the discipline of the church they exert and put forth by
   virtue of their office, and not either as declaring of the power of the
   church itself, or acting what is delegated unto them thereby, but as
   ministerially exercising the authority of Christ committed unto
   themselves.

   Secondly, The body of the church, or the multitude of the brethren
   (women being excepted by especial prohibition, 1 Cor. xiv. 34, 35, 1
   Tim. ii. 11, 12), is, by the law and constitution of Christ in the
   gospel, interested in the administration of this power of discipline in
   the church, so far as, --

   1. To consider, try, and make a judgment in and about all persons,
   things, and causes, in reference whereunto it is to be exercised. Thus,
   the brethren at Jerusalem joined in the consideration of the
   observation of Mosaical ceremonies with the apostles and elders, Acts
   xv. 23; and the multitude of them to whom letters were sent about it
   likewise did the same, verses 30-32; and this they thought it their
   duty and concernment to do, chap. xxi. 22. And they are blamed who
   applied not themselves unto this duty, 1 Cor. v. 2-6. Thence are the
   epistles of Paul to the churches to instruct them in their duties and
   privileges in Christ, and how they ought to behave themselves in the
   ordering of all things amongst them according to his mind. And these
   are directed unto the churches themselves, either jointly with their
   elders, or distinctly from them, Phil. i. 1. And the whole preservation
   of church-order is, on the account of this duty, recommended unto them.
   Neither can what they do in compliance with their guides and rulers be
   any part of their obedience unto the Lord Christ, unless they make
   previously thereunto a rational consideration and judgment, by the
   rule, of what is to be done. Neither is the church of Christ to be
   ruled without its knowledge or against its will; nor in any thing is
   blind obedience acceptable to God.

   2. The brethren of the church are intrusted with the privilege of
   giving and testifying their consent unto all acts of church-power,
   which, though it belong not formally unto the authority of them, is
   necessary unto their validity and efficacy; and that so far forth as
   that they are said to do and act what is done and effected thereby, 1
   Cor. v. 4, 5, 13; 2 Cor. ii. 6-8. And they who have this privilege of
   consent, which hath so great an influence into the action and validity
   of it, have also the liberty of dissent, when any thing is proposed to
   be done, the warrant whereof from the word and the rule of its
   performance are not evident unto them.

   unto the church; ^bin judging with the elders, according to rule, what,
   in all cases of offence, is necessary to be done for the good of the

   admonition, ejection, pardoning, and restoring of offenders, as the
   matter shall require.

   Question 46 -- What is the duty of private members in reference unto
   the discipline appointed by Christ in his church?

   Answer -- It is their duty, in their mutual watch over one another, to
   exhort each other unto holiness and perseverance; and if they observe
   any thing in the ways and walkings of any of their fellow-members not
   according unto the rule and duty of their profession, which, therefore,
   gives them offence, to admonish them thereof in private, with love,
   meekness, and wisdom; and in case they prevail not unto their
   amendment, to take the assistance of some other brethren in the same
   work; and if they fail in success therein also, to report the matter,
   by the elders' direction, unto the whole church.
   Matt. xviii. 16-18; 1 Thess. v. 14.

   Explication -- In these questions an inquiry is made after the exercise
   of discipline in the church, -- as to that part of it which belongs
   unto the reproof and correction of miscarriages, according to the
   distribution of right, power, and privilege before explained.

   The first act hereof consists in private admonition; for so hath our
   Lord ordained, that in case any brother or member of the church do in
   any thing walk disorderly, and not according to the rule of the gospel,
   he or they unto whom it is observed, and who are thereby offended, may
   and ought to admonish the person or persons so offending of their
   miscarriages and offence; concerning which is to be observed, --

   First, What is previously required thereunto; and that is, --

   1. That in all the members of the church there ought to be "love
   without dissimulation." They are to "be kindly affectioned one to
   another with brotherly love," Rom. xii. 9, 10; which as they are taught
   of God, so they are greatly exhorted thereunto, Heb. xiii. 1. This love
   is the bond of perfection, the most excellent way and means of
   preserving church-order, and furthering the edification thereof, 1 Cor.
   xiii., without which, well seated and confirmed in the hearts and minds
   of church-members, no duty of their relation can ever be performed in a
   due manner.

   2. This love is to exert and put forth itself in tender care and
   watchfulness for the good of each other; which are to work by mutual
   exhortations, informations, instructions, according as opportunities do
   offer themselves, or as the necessities of any do seem to require, Heb.
   iii. 13, x. 24.

   Secondly, This duty of admonishing offenders privately and personally
   is common to the elders with all the members of the church; neither
   doth it belong properly unto the elders as such, but as brethren of the
   same society. And yet, by virtue of their office, the elders are
   enabled to do it with more authority morally, though office-power
   properly be not exercised therein. By virtue, also, of their constant
   general watch over the whole flock in the discharge of their office,
   they are enabled to take notice of and discern miscarriages in any of
   the members sooner than others: but as to the exercise of the
   discipline of the church in this matter, this duty is equally incumbent
   on every member of it, according as the obligation on them to watch
   over one another, and to exercise especial love towards each other, is
   equal; whence it is distinguished from that private pastoral
   admonition, which is an act of the teaching office and power, not
   directly belonging unto the rule or government inquired after. But this
   admonition is an effect of love; and when it proceedeth not from thence
   it is irregular, Matt. xviii. 16-18; Rom. xv. 14.

   Thirdly, This duty is so incumbent on every member of the church, that
   in case of the neglect thereof, he both sinneth against the institution
   of Christ and makes himself partaker of the sin of the party offending,
   and is also guilty of his danger and ruin thereby, with all that
   disadvantage which will accrue to the church by any of the members of
   it continuing in sin against the rule of the gospel. They have not only
   liberty thus to admonish one another, but it is their express and
   indispensable duty so to do; the neglect whereof is interpreted by God
   to be "hatred of our brother," such as wherewith the love of God is
   inconsistent, Lev. xix. 17; 1 John iii. 15, iv. 20.

   Fourthly, Although this duty be personally incumbent on every
   individual member of the church, yet this hinders not but if the sin of
   an offender be known to more than one at the same time, and they
   jointly take offence thereat, they may together in the first instance
   admonish him, which yet still is but the first and private admonition;
   which is otherwise when others are called into assistance who are not
   themselves acquainted with the offence, but only by information, and
   join in it, not upon the account of their own being offended, but of
   being desired according unto rule to give assistance to them that are
   so.

   Fifthly, The way and manner of the discharge of this duty is, that it
   be done with prudence, tenderness, and due regard unto all
   circumstances; whence the apostle supposeth a spiritual ability to be
   necessary for this work: Rom. xv. 14, "Ye also are full of goodness,
   filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another."
   Especially four things are to be diligently heeded:--

   1. That the whole duty be so managed that the person offending may be
   convinced that it is done out of love to him and affectionate,
   conscientious care over him, that he may take no occasion thereby for
   the exasperation of his own spirit.

   2. That the persons admonishing others of their offence do make it
   appear that what they do is in obedience unto an institution of Christ,
   and therein to preserve their own souls from sin, as well as to benefit
   the offenders.

   3. That the admonition be grounded on a rule; which alone gives it
   authority and efficacy.

   4. That there be a readiness manifested by them to receive
   satisfaction, -- either (1.) in case that, upon trial, it appeareth the
   information they have had of the miscarriage whence the offence arose
   was undue or not well grounded; or, (2.) of acknowledgement and
   repentance.

   Sixthly, The ends of this ordinance and institution of Christ are, --

   1. To keep up love without dissimulation among all the members of the
   church; for if offences should abide unremoved, love, which is the bond
   of perfection, would not long continue in sincerity, which tends to the
   dissolution of the whole society.

   2. To gain the offender, by delivering him from the guilt of sin, that
   he may not lie under it, and procure the wrath of God against himself,
   Lev. xix. 17.

   3. To preserve his person from dishonour and disreputation, and thereby
   to keep up his usefulness in the church. To this end hath our Lord
   appointed this discharge of this duty in private, that the failings of
   men may not be unnecessarily divulged, and themselves thereby exposed
   unto temptation.

   4. To preserve the church from that scandal that might befall it by the
   hasty opening of all the real or supposed failings of its members. And,
   --

   5. To prevent its trouble in the public hearing of things that may be
   otherwise healed and removed.

   Seventhly, In case these ends are obtained, either by the supposed
   offending persons clearing of themselves and manifesting themselves
   innocent of the crimes charged on them, as Josh. xxii. 21-29, 2 Cor.
   vii. 11, or by their acknowledgement, repentance, and amendment, then
   this part of the discipline of the church hath, through the grace of
   Christ, obtained its appointed effect.

   Eighthly, In case the persons offending be not humbled nor reformed,
   nor do give satisfaction unto them by whom they are admonished, then
   hath our Lord ordained a second degree of this private exercise of
   discipline:-- that the persons who, being offended, have discharged the
   foregoing duty themselves according unto rule, shall take unto them
   others, -- two or three, as the occasion may seem to require, -- to
   join with them in the same work and duty, to be performed in the same
   manner, for the same ends, with that before described, Matt. xviii.
   15-17. And it is the duty of these persons so called in for assistance,
   --

   1. To judge of the crime, fault, or offence reported to them, and not
   to proceed unless they find it to consist in something expressly
   contrary to the rule of the gospel, and attested in such a manner and
   with such evidence as their mutual love doth require in them with
   respect unto their brethren. And they are to judge of the testimony
   that is given concerning the truth of the offence communicated unto
   them, that they may not seem either lightly to take up a report against
   their brother or to discredit the testimony of others.

   2. In case they find the offence pretended not to be a real offence,
   indeed contrary to the rule of the gospel, or that it is not aright
   grounded as to the evidence of it, but taken up upon prejudice or an
   over-easy credulity, contrary to the law of that love which is required
   amongst church-members, described 1 Cor. xiii., and commanded as the
   great means of the edification of the church and preservation of its
   union, then to convince the brother offended of his mistake, and with
   him to satisfy the person pretended to be the offender, that no breach
   or schism may happen among the members of the same body.

   3. Being satisfied of the crime and testimony, they are to associate
   themselves with the offended brother in the same work and duty that he
   himself had before discharged towards the offender.

   Ninthly, Because there is no determination how often these private
   admonitions are to be used in case of offence, it is evident from the
   nature of the thing itself that they are to be reiterated, first the
   one and then the other, whilst there is any ground of hope that the
   ends of them may be obtained, through the blessing of Christ, -- the
   brother gained, and the offence taken away. Neither of these, then, is
   to be deserted or laid aside on the first or second attempt, as though
   it were performed only to make way for somewhat farther; but it is to
   be waited on with prayer and patience, as an ordinance of Christ
   appointed for attaining the end aimed at.

   Tenthly, In case there be not the success aimed at obtained in these
   several degrees of private admonition, it is then the will of our Lord
   Jesus Christ that the matter be reported unto the church, that the
   offended may be publicly admonished thereby and brought to repentance;
   wherein is to be observed, --

   1. That the persons who have endeavoured in vain to reclaim their
   offending brother by private admonition are to acquaint the elders of
   the church with the case and crime, as also what they have done
   according to rule for the rectifying of it; who, upon that information,
   are obliged to communicate the knowledge of the whole matter to the
   church. This is to be done by the elders, as to whom the preservation
   of order in the church and the rule of its proceedings do belong, as we
   have showed before.

   2. The report made to the church by the elders is to be, -- (1.) Of the
   crime, guilt, or offence; (2.) Of the testimony given unto the truth of
   it; (3.) Of the means used to bring the offender to acknowledgment and
   repentance; (4.) Of his deportment under the private previous
   admonitions, either as to his rejecting of them, or as to any
   satisfaction tendered; all in order, love, meekness, and tenderness.

   3. Things being proposed unto the church, and the offender heard upon
   the whole of the offence and former proceeding, the whole church or
   multitude of the brethren are, with the elders, to consider the nature
   of the offence, with the condition and temptation of the offender, with
   such a spirit of meekness as our Lord Jesus Christ, in his own person,
   set them an example of in his dealing with sinners, and which is
   required in them as his disciples, Gal. vi. 1, 2; 2 Cor. ii. 8.

   4. The elders and brethren are to judge of the offence and the carriage
   of the offender according to rule; and if the offence be evident and
   persisted in, then, --

   5. The offender is to be publicly admonished by the elders, with the
   consent and concurrence of the church, 1 Thess. v. 14; 1 Tim. v. 20;
   Matt. xviii. 17. And this admonition consists of five parts:-- (1.) A
   declaration of the crime or offence, as it is evidenced unto the
   church. (2.) A conviction of the evil of it, from the rule or rules
   transgressed against. (3.) A declaration of the authority and duty of
   the church in such cases. (4.) A rebuke of the offender in the name of
   Christ, answering the nature and circumstances of the offence. (5.) An
   exhortation unto humiliation, and repentance, and acknowledgment.

   Eleventhly, In case the offender despise this admonition of the church,
   and come not upon it unto repentance, it is the will and appointment of
   our Lord Jesus Christ that he be cut off from all the privileges of the
   church, and cast out from the society thereof, or be excommunicated;
   wherein consists the last act of the discipline of the church for the
   correction of offenders. And herein may be considered, --

   1. The nature of it, that it is an authoritative act, and so
   principally belongs unto the elders of the church, who therein exert
   the power that they have received from the Lord Christ, by and with the
   consent of the church, according to his appointment, Matt. xvi. 19,
   xviii. 18; John xx. 23; 1 Cor. v. 4, 5; Titus iii. 10; 1 Tim. i. 20; 2
   Cor. ii. 6. And both these, the authority of the eldership and the
   consent of the brethren, are necessary to the validity of the sentence,
   and that according to the appointment of Christ, and the practice of
   the first churches.

   2. The effect of it, which is the cutting off or casting out of the
   person offending from the communion of the church, in the privileges of
   the gospel, as consequently from that of all the visible churches of
   Christ in the earth, by virtue of their communion one with another;
   whereby he is left unto the visible kingdom of Satan in the world.--
   Matt. xviii. 17; 1 Cor. v. 2, 5, 13; 1 Tim. i. 20; Titus iii. 10; Gal.
   v. 12.

   3. The ends of it, which are, --

   (1.) The gaining of the party offending, by bringing him to repentance,
   humiliation, and acknowledgment of his offence, 2 Cor. ii. 6, 7, xiii.
   10.

   (2.) The warning of others not to do so presumptuously.

   (3.) The preserving of the church in its purity and order, 1 Cor. v. 6,
   7; all to the glory of Jesus Christ.

   4. The causes of it, or the grounds and reasons on which the church may
   proceed unto sentence against any offending persons. Now, these are no
   other but such as they judge, according to the gospel, that the Lord
   Christ will proceed upon in his final judgment at the last day; for the
   church judgeth in the name and authority of Christ, and are to exclude
   none from its communion but those whom they find by the rule that he
   himself excludes from his kingdom; and so that which they bind on earth
   is bound by him in heaven, Matt. xviii. 18. And their sentence herein
   is to be declared, as the declaration of the sentence which the Head of
   the church and Judge of all will pronounce at the last day; only with
   this difference, that it is also made known that this sentence of
   theirs is not final or decretory, but in order to the prevention of
   that which will be so unless the evil be repented of. Now, although the
   particular evils, sins, or offences that may render a person obnoxious
   unto this censure and sentence are not to be enumerated, by reason of
   the variety of circumstances, which change the nature of actions, yet
   they may in general be referred unto these heads:--

   (1.) Moral evils, contrary to the light of nature and express commands
   or prohibitions of the moral law, direct rules of the gospel, or of
   evil report in the world amongst men walking according to the rule and
   light of reason. And, in cases of this nature, the church may proceed
   unto the sentence whereof we speak without previous admonition, in case
   the matter of fact be notorious, publicly and unquestionably known to
   be true, and no general rule (which is not to be impeached by
   particular instances) lie against their procedure, 1 Cor. v. 3-5; 2
   Tim. iii. 2-5.

   (2.) Offences against that mutual love which is the bond of perfection
   in the church, if pertinaciously persisted in, Matt. xviii. 16, 17.

   (3.) False doctrines against the fundamentals in faith or worship,
   especially if maintained with contention, to the trouble and
   disturbance of the peace of the church, Gal. v. 12; Titus iii. 9-11; 1
   Tim. vi. 3-5; Rev. ii. 14, 15.

   (4.) Blasphemy or evil speaking of the ways and worship of God in the
   church, especially if joined with an intention to hinder the prosperity
   of the church or to expose it to persecution, 1 Tim. i. 20.

   (5.) Desertion, or total causeless relinquishment of the society and
   communion of the church; for such are self-condemned, having broken and
   renounced the covenant of God, that they made at their entrance into
   the church, Heb. x. 25-31.

   5. The time or season of the putting forth the authority of Christ in
   the church for this censure is to be considered, and that is ordinarily
   after the admonition before described, and that with due waiting, to be
   regulated by a consideration of times, persons, temptations, and other
   circumstances; for, --

   (1.) The church in proceeding to this sentence is to express the
   patience and long-suffering of Christ towards offenders, and not to put
   it forth without conviction of a present resolved impenitency.

   (2.) The event and effect of the preceding ordinance of admonition is
   to be expected; which though not at present evident, yet, like the word
   itself in the preaching of it, may be blessed to a good issue after
   many days.

   6. The person offending thus cut off, or cast out from the present
   actual communion of the church, is still to be looked on and accounted
   as a brother, because of the nature of the ordinance which is intended
   for his amendment and recovery, -- 2 Thess. iii. 15, "Count him not as
   an enemy, but admonish him as a brother," -- unless he manifests his
   final impenitency by blasphemy and persecution: 1 Tim. i. 20, "Whom I
   have declared unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."

   7. The church is, therefore, still to perform the duties of love and
   care towards such persons, --

   (1.) In praying for them, that they "may be converted from the error of
   their way," James v. 19, 20. 1 John v. 16, "If any man see his brother
   sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him
   life for them that sin not unto death."

   (2.) In withdrawing from them even as to ordinary converse, for their
   conviction of their state and condition, 1 Cor. v. 11, "With such an
   one no not to eat;" 2 Thess. iii. 14.

   (3.) In admonishing of him: 2 Thess. iii. 15, "Admonish him as a
   brother:" which may be done, -- [1.] Occasionally, by any member of the
   church; [2.] On set purpose, by the consent and appointment of the
   whole church: which admonition is to contain, -- 1^st, A pressing of
   his sin from the rule on the conscience of the offender; 2^dly, A
   declaration of the nature of the censure and punishment which he lieth
   under; 3^dly, A manifestation of the danger of his impenitency, in his
   being either hardened by the deceitfulness of sin or exposed unto new
   temptations of Satan.

   8. In case the Lord Jesus be pleased to give a blessed effect unto this
   ordinance, in the repentance of the person cut off and cast out of the
   church, he is, --

   (1.) To be forgiven both by those who in an especial manner were
   offended at him and by him, and by the whole church, Matt. xviii. 18; 2
   Cor. ii. 7.

   (2.) To be comforted under his sorrow, 2 Cor. ii. 7, and that by, --
   [1.] The application of the promises of the gospel unto his conscience;
   [2.] A declaration of the readiness of the church to receive him again
   into their love and communion.

   (3.) Restored, -- [1.] By a confirmation or testification of the love
   of the church unto him, 2 Cor. ii. 8; [2.] A re-admission unto the
   exercise and enjoyment of his former privileges in the fellowship of
   the church; all with a spirit of meekness, Gal. vi. 1.

   Question 47 -- The preservation of the church in purity, order, and
   holiness, being provided for, by what way is it to be continued and
   increased?

   Answer -- The way appointed thereunto is by adding such as, being
   effectually called unto the obedience of faith, shall voluntarily offer
   themselves unto the society and fellowship thereof.
   Acts ii. 41; 2 Cor. viii. 5.

   Explication -- The means appointed by our Lord Jesus Christ for the
   continuance and increase of the church are either preparatory unto it
   or instrumentally efficient of it. The principal means subservient or
   preparatory unto the continuance and increase of the church is the
   preaching of the word to the conviction, illumination, and conversion
   of sinners, whereby they may be made meet to become living stones in
   this spiritual building, and members of the mystical body of Christ.
   And this is done either ordinarily, in the assemblies of the church,
   towards such as come in unto them and attend to the word dispensed
   according to the appointment of Christ amongst them, -- 1 Cor. xiv. 24,
   25, "If there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is
   convinced of all, he is judged of all: and thus are the secrets of his
   heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship
   God," -- or occasionally, amongst the men of the world, Acts viii. 4.

   Secondly, The instrumentally efficient cause is that which is expressed
   in the answer, -- namely, the adding in due order unto it such as,
   being effectually called unto the obedience of the faith and profession
   of the gospel, do voluntarily, out of conviction of their duty and
   resolution to walk in subjection to all the ordinances and commands of
   Christ, offer themselves to the society and fellowship thereof, whereby
   they may be laid in this spiritual building as the stones were in the
   temple of old, which were hewed and fitted elsewhere.

   Question 48 -- What is required of them who desire to join themselves
   unto the church?

   Answer -- ^aThat they be free from blame and offence in the world;
   ^bthat they be instructed in the saving truths and mysteries of the
   gospel; ^csound in the faith; ^dthat, the Lord having called them unto
   faith, repentance, and newness of life by Jesus Christ, they give up
   themselves to be saved by him, and to obey him in all things; and,
   therefore, ^eare willing and ready, through his grace, to walk in
   subjection to all his commands, and in the observation of all his laws
   and institutions, notwithstanding any difficulties, oppositions, or
   persecutions, which they meet withal.

   direct, comfort, and encourage in the way, such as they judge to love
   the Lord Jesus in sincerity; ^cto propose and recommend them unto the
   whole church, with prayers and supplications to God for them; ^dto
   admit them, being approved, into the order and fellowship of the gospel
   in the church.
   ^aActs viii. 20, 23; Titus i. 10; Rev. ii. 2; Jer. xv. 19.

   Question 50 -- What is the duty of the whole church in reference unto
   such persons?

   Answer -- To consider them in love and meekness, according as their
   condition is known, reported, or testified unto them; to approve of and
   rejoice in the grace of God in them; and to receive them in love
   without dissimulation.
   1 Cor. xiii.

   Explication -- What in general is required, unto the fitting of any
   persons to be members of a visible church of Christ, was before
   declared; and that is that which the Lord Jesus hath made the
   indispensable condition of entering into his kingdom, -- namely, of
   being "born again," John iii. 3, 5. This work, being secret, hidden,
   and invisible, the church cannot judge of directly and in its own form
   or nature, but in the means, effects, and consequents of it; which are
   to be testified unto it, concerning them who are to be admitted unto
   its fellowship and communion. It is required, therefore, of them, --

   First, That they be of a conversation free from blame in the world; for
   whereas one end of the gathering of churches is to hold forth and
   express the holiness of the doctrine of Christ, and the power of his
   grace in turning men from all ungodliness unto sobriety, righteousness,
   and honesty, it is required of them that are admitted into them that
   they answer this end. And this the principle of grace, which is
   communicated unto them that believe, will effect and produce; for
   although it doth not follow that every one who hath attained an
   unblamable honesty in this world is inwardly quickened with a true
   principle of saving grace, yet it doth that they who are endowed with
   that principle will be so unblamable. And although they may on other
   accounts be evil spoken of, yet their good conversation in Christ will
   justify itself.

   Secondly, Competent knowledge in the mysteries of the gospel is another
   means whereby the great qualification inquired after is testified unto
   the church; for as without this no privilege of the gospel can be
   profitably made use of, nor any duty of it rightly performed, so saving
   light is of the essence of conversion, and doth inseparably accompany
   it: 2 Cor. iv. 6, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of
   darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
   of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Where this is
   wanting, it is impossible for any person to evidence that he is
   delivered from that blindness, darkness, and ignorance, which all men
   are under the power of in the state of nature. Such a measure, then, of
   light and knowledge, as whereby men are enabled to apprehend aright of
   the person and offices of Christ, of the nature of his mediation, the
   benefits thereof, and the obedience that he requires at the hands of
   his disciples, is expected in them who desire to be admitted into the
   fellowship of the church.

   Thirdly, Hereunto is to be added the soundness in the faith; for the
   unity of faith is the foundation of love and all the duties thereof,
   which in an especial manner are to be performed towards the church,
   called, therefore, "The household of faith." There is among the members
   of the church "one faith," Eph. iv. 5; the "common faith," [Titus i.
   4]; the "faith once delivered unto the saints," Jude 3; which is the
   "sound doctrine," 1 Tim. i. 10, which those that will not endure must
   be turned from, 2 Tim. iii. 5; the "faithful word," that is to be "held
   fast," Titus i. 9, 1 Tim. i. 19, and which we are to be "sound in,"
   Titus i. 13; contained in a "form of sound words," as to the profession
   of it, 2 Tim. i. 13. And this soundness in the unity of faith, as it
   should be improved unto oneness of mind and oneness of accord in all
   the things of God, Phil. ii. 2, though it may admit of some different
   apprehensions in some things, wherein some may have more clear and
   distinct discoveries of the mind and will of God than others, which
   hinders not but that all may walk according to the same rule, Phil.
   iii. 15, 16; so it is principally to be regarded in the fundamental
   truths of the gospel, in and by the faith whereof the church holdeth on
   the head, Jesus Christ, Col. ii. 19; and in the fundamental principles
   of gospel worship, the joint celebration whereof is the next end of the
   gathering the church: for without a consent of mind and accord herein,
   no duty can be performed unto the edification, nor the peace of the
   church be preserved. And these principles are those which we have
   explained.

   Fourthly, It is required that these things be testified by them unto
   the church, with the acknowledgment of the work of God's grace towards
   them, and their resolution, through the power of the same grace, to
   cleave unto the Lord Christ with full purpose of heart, and to live in
   all holy obedience unto him. They come to the church as disciples of
   Christ, professing that they have learnt the truth as it is in Jesus:
   which what it infers the apostle teacheth at large, Eph. iv. 20-24; see
   also Acts xi. 23, xiv. 22. And this by themselves [is] to be testified
   unto the church:--

   1. That they may be received in love without dissimulation, as real
   partakers in the same faith, hope, and salvation with themselves, as
   living members of the mystical body of Christ.

   2. That on all ensuing occasions they may be minded of their own
   profession and engagements, to stir them up thereby unto faithfulness,
   steadfastness, and perseverance. Hereupon are the elders of the church
   to judge by the rule of truth, in love and meekness, concerning their
   condition and meetness to be laid as living stones in the house of God;
   so as that they may, --

   (1.) Reject false, hypocritical pretenders, if in or by any means their
   hypocrisy be discovered unto them, Acts viii. 20-23; Titus i. 10; Jer.
   xv. 19.

   (2.) That they may direct and encourage in the way such as appear to be
   sincere, instructing them principally in the nature of the way
   whereinto they are engaging, the duties, dangers, and benefits of it,
   Acts xviii. 26, xiv. 22; 1 Cor. iii. 22, 23.

   (3.) To propose them, their condition, their desires, their
   resolutions, unto the church, after their own expressions of them, to
   be considered of in love and meekness, Acts ix. 26, 27. Whereupon those
   that are approved do give up themselves unto the Lord, to walk in the
   observation of all his commands and ordinances; and to the church for
   the Lord's sake, 2 Cor. viii. 5, abiding in the fellowship thereof,
   whereunto they are admitted, Acts ii. 41, 42.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 51 -- Wherein doth the especial form of a particular church,
   whereby it becomes such, and is distinguished as such from all others,
   consist?

   Answer -- In the special consent and agreement of all the members of it
   to walk together in the observation of the same ordinances numerically;
   hence its constitution and distinction from other churches doth
   proceed.
   Exod. xix. 5, 8, xxiv. 3, 7; Deut. xxvi. 17; 2 Cor. viii. 5; Acts xiv.
   23, xx. 28; Heb. xiii. 17.

   Explication -- It hath been before declared what especial agreement or
   covenant there ought to be among all the members of the same church, to
   walk together in a due subjection unto and observance of all the
   institutions of the Lord Christ. And this is that which gives it its
   special form and distinction from all other churches. In the general
   nature of a church, all churches do agree and equally partake. There is
   the same law of the constitution of them all; they have all the same
   rule of obedience, all the same Head, the same end; all carry it on by
   the observation of the same ordinances in kind. Now, besides these
   things, which belong unto the nature of a church in general, and
   wherein they all equally participate, they must also have each one its
   proper difference, that which doth distinguish it from all other
   churches; and this gives it its special form as such. Now, this cannot
   consist in any thing that is accidental, occasional, or extrinsical
   unto it, such as is cohabitation (which yet the church may have respect
   unto, for conveniency and furthering of its edification); nor in any
   civil or political disposal of its members into civil societies for
   civil ends, which is extrinsical to all its concernments as a church;
   nor doth it consist in the relation of that church to its present
   officers, which may be removed or taken away without the dissolution of
   the form or being of the church: but it consisteth, as was said, in the
   agreement or covenant before mentioned. For, --

   First, This is that which constitutes them a distinct body, different
   from others; for thereby, and no otherwise, do they coalesce into a
   society, according to the laws of their constitution and appointment.

   Secondly, This gives them their especial relation unto their own
   elders, rulers, or guides, who watch over them as so associated by
   their own consent, according unto the command of Christ. And, --

   Thirdly, From hence they have their mutual especial relation unto one
   another; which is the ground of the especial exercise of all church
   duties whatsoever.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 52 -- Wherein consists the duty of any church of Christ
   towards other churches?

   Answer -- ^aIn walking circumspectly, so as to give them no offence;
   ^bin prayer for their peace and prosperity; ^cin communicating supplies
   to their wants according to ability; ^din receiving with love and
   readiness the members of them into fellowship, in the celebration of
   the ordinances of the gospel, as occasion shall be; ^ein desiring and
   making use of their counsel and advice in such cases of doubt and
   difficulty as may arise among them; ^fin joining with them to express
   their communion in the same doctrine of faith.
   ^a1 Cor. x. 32.
   ^bPs. cxxii. 6; Eph. vi. 18; 1 Tim. ii. 1.
   ^c2 Cor. viii. 1-15; Acts xi. 29, 30; Rom. xv. 26, 27.
   ^dRom. xvi. 1, 2; 3 John 8, 9.
   ^eActs xv. 2, 6.
   ^f1 Tim. iii. 15.

   Explication -- Churches being gathered and settled according to the
   mind of Christ, ought to preserve a mutual holy communion among
   themselves, and to exercise it in the discharge of those duties whereby
   their mutual good and edification may be promoted; for whereas they are
   all united under one head, the Lord Christ, Eph. i. 22, 23, in the same
   faith and order, chap. iv. 5, and do walk by the same rule, they stand
   in such a relation one to another as is the ground of the communion
   spoken of. Now, the principal ways whereby they exercise this communion
   are the acts and duties enumerated in the answer to this question; as,
   --

   First, Careful walking, so as to give no offence unto one another;
   which, although it be a moral duty in reference unto all, yet therein
   especial regard is to be had unto other churches of Christ, that they
   be not in any thing grieved or tempted: 1 Cor. x. 32, "Give none
   offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of
   God."

   Secondly, In constant prayer for the peace, welfare, edification, and
   prosperity one of another, Rom. i. 9; Col. i. 9; Eph. vi. 18. And this
   because of the special concernment of the name and glory of our Lord
   Jesus Christ in their welfare.

   Thirdly, In communicating of supplies for their relief according unto
   their ability, in case of the outward wants, straits, dangers, or
   necessities of any of them. -- Acts xi. 29, 30; Rom. xv. 26, 27; 2 Cor.
   viii. 1-15.

   Fourthly, The receiving of the members of other churches to communion,
   in the celebration of church-ordinances, is another way whereby this
   communion of churches is exercised, Rom. xvi. 1, 2; 3 John 8, 9; for
   whereas the personal right of such persons unto the ordinances of the
   church, and their orderly walking in the observation of the commands of
   Christ, are known by the testimony of the church whereof they are
   members, they may, without farther inquiry or satisfaction given, be
   looked on "pro tempore" as members of the church wherein they desire
   fellowship and participation of the ordinances of Christ.

   Fifthly, In desiring or making use of the counsel and advice of one
   another, in such cases of doubt and difficulty, whether doctrinal or
   practical, as may arise in any of them, Acts xv. 2, 6. And from hence
   it follows, that in case any church, either by error in doctrine, or
   precipitation, or mistake in other administrations, do give offence
   unto other churches, those other churches may require an account from
   them, admonish them of their faults, and withhold communion from them
   in case they persist in the error of their way; and that because in
   their difficulties, and before their miscarriages, they were bound to
   have desired the advice, counsel, and assistance of those other
   churches, which being neglected by them, the other are to recover the
   end of it unto their utmost ability, Gal. ii. 6-11. And hence, also, it
   follows that those that are rightly and justly censured in any church
   ought to be rejected by all churches whatever; both because of their
   mutual communion, and because it is and ought to be presumed, until the
   contrary be made to appear, that, in case there had been any difficulty
   or doubt in the procedure of the church, they would have taken the
   advice of those churches, with whom they were obliged to consult.

   Lastly, Whereas the churches have all of them one common faith, and are
   all obliged to hold forth and declare it to all men as they have
   opportunity, 1 Tim. iii. 15, to testify this their mutual communion,
   their interest in the same faith and hope, for the more open
   declaration and proposition of the truths of the gospel which they
   profess, and for the vindication both of the truth and themselves from
   false charges and imputations, they may, and, if God give opportunity,
   ought to join together in declaring and testifying their joint consent
   and fellowship in the same doctrine of faith, expressed in a "form of
   sound words."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Question 53 -- What are the ends of all this dispensation and order of
   things in the church?

   Answer -- The glory of God, the honour of Jesus Christ the mediator,
   the furtherance of the gospel, the edification and consolation of
   believers here, with their eternal salvation hereafter.
   Rev. iv. 9-11, v. 12, 13; 1 Cor. iii. 22, 23; Eph. iv. 11-16.
