DEDICATION, BY MR. LE CLERC.

    TO THE MOST REVEREND PRELATE,

THOMAS,

  LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY,

   PRIMATE OF ALL ENGLAND AND METROPOLITAN, AND PRIVY COUNSELLOR TO HER
   MOST SERENE MAJESTY THE QUEEN OF GREAT BRITAIN.

   UPON the reprinting this excellent piece of that great man Hugo
   Grotius, concerning the Truth of the Christian Religion, (whereunto I
   thought fit to add something of my own, and also some testimonies, from
   which the good opinion he had of the Church of England is evident),
   there was no other person, most reverend Prelate, to whom I thought it
   so proper for me to dedicate this edition, with the additions, as the
   Primate and Metropolitan of the whole Church of England. I therefore
   present it to you, as worthy your protection upon its own account, and
   as an instance of my respect and duty towards you. I will not attempt
   here either to praise or defend Grotius; his own virtue and
   distinguishing merits in the commonwealth of Christians do sufficiently
   commend and justify him amongst all good and learned men. Neither will
   I say any thing of the Appendix which I have added; it is so short that
   it may be read over almost in an hour's time. If it be beneath Grotius,
   nothing that I can say about it will vindicate me to the censorious;
   but if it be thought not beneath him, I need not give any reasons for
   joining it with a piece of his. Perhaps it might be expected, most
   illustrious Prelate, that I should, as usual, commend you and your
   Church; but I have more than once performed this part, and declared a
   thing known to all: wherefore, forbearing that, I conclude with wishing
   that both you and the reverend Prelates, and the rest of the Clergy of
   the Church of England, who are such brave defenders of the true
   Christian Religion, and whose conversations are answerable to it, may
   long prosper and flourish; which I earnestly desire of Almighty God.

TO THE READER

JOHN LE CLERC WISHETH ALL HEALTH.

   THE bookseller having a design to reprint this piece of Grotius's, I
   gave him to understand that there were many great faults in the former
   editions; especially in the testimonies of the ancients, which it was
   his business should be mended, and that something useful might be added
   to the notes: neither would it be unacceptable or unprofitable to the
   reader, if a book were added, to shew where the Christian religion, the
   truth of which this great man has demonstrated, is to be found in its
   greatest purity. He immediately desired me to do this upon his account,
   which I willingly undertook, out of the reverence I had for the memory
   of Grotius, and because of the usefulness of the thing. How I have
   succeeded in it, I must leave to the candid reader's judgment. I have
   corrected many errors of the press, and perhaps should have done more,
   could I have found all the places. I have added some, but very short
   notes, there being very many before, and the thing not seeming to
   require more. My name adjoined, distinguishes them from Grotius's. I
   have also added to Grotius a small book, concerning choosing our
   opinion and church amongst so many different sects of Christians; in
   which I hope I have offered nothing contrary to the sense of that great
   man, or at least to truth. I have used such arguments as will recommend
   themselves to any prudent person, easy and not far-fetched; and I have
   determined that Christians ought to manage themselves so in this matter
   as the most prudent men usually do in the most weighty affairs of life.
   I have abstained from all sharp controversy, and from all severe words,
   which ought never to enter into our determinations of religion, if our
   adversaries would suffer it. I have declared the sense of my mind in a
   familiar style, without any flourish of words, in a matter where
   strength of argument, and not the enticement of words, is required. And
   herein I have imitated Grotius, whom I think all ought to imitate, who
   attempt to write seriously, and with a mind deeply affected with the
   gravity of the argument upon such subjects.

   As I was thinking upon these things, the letters which you will see at
   the end were sent me by that honourable and learned person, (to whose
   singular good-nature I am much indebted), the most serene Queen of
   Great Britain's Ambassador Extraordinary to his Royal Highness the most
   serene Great Duke of Tuscany. I thought, with his leave, they might
   conveniently be published at the end of this volume, that it might
   appear what opinion Grotius had of the church of England, which is
   obliged to him, notwithstanding the snarling of some men, who object
   those inconsistent opinions, Socinianism, Popery, nay, even Atheism
   itself, against this most learned and religious man; for fear, I
   suppose, his immortal writings should be read, in which their foolish
   opinions are entirely confuted. In which matter, as in many other
   things of the like nature, they have in vain attempted to blind the
   eyes of others; but God forgive them, (for I wish them nothing worse),
   and put better thoughts into their minds, that we may at last be all
   joined by the love of truth and peace, and be united into one flock,
   under one Shepherd, Jesus Christ. This, kind reader, is what you ought
   to desire and wish with me; and may God so be with you, and all that
   belong to you, as you promote this matter as far as can be, and assist
   to the utmost of your power.

   Farewell.

   I HAVE nothing to add to what I said eight years since, but only, that
   in this my second edition of Grotius I have put some short notes, and
   corrected a great many faults in the ancient testimonies.

THE TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

    TO THE

  CHRISTIAN READER.

   THE general acceptation this piece of Grotius has met with in the world
   encouraged this translation of it, together with the notes, which,
   being a collection of ancient testimonies, upon whose authority and
   truth the genuineness of the books of holy Scripture depends, are very
   useful in order to the convincing any one of the truth of the Christian
   religion. These notes are for the most part Grotius's own, except some
   few of mr. Le Clerc's, which I have, therefore, translated also,
   because I have followed his edition, as the most correct.

   The design of the book is to shew the reasonableness of believing and
   embracing the Christian Religion above any other; which our author
   does, by laying before us all the evidence that can he brought, both
   internal and external, and declaring the sufficiency of it; by
   enumerating all the marks of genuineness in any books, and applying
   them to the sacred writings; and by making appear the deficiency of all
   other institutions of religion, whether Pagan, Jewish, or Mahometan. So
   that the substance of the whole is briefly this: That as certain as is
   the truth of natural principles, and that the mind can judge of what is
   agreeable to them; as certain as is the evidence of men's bodily
   senses, in the most plain and obvious matters of fact; and as certainly
   as men's integrity and sincerity may be discovered, and their accounts
   delivered down to posterity faithfully; so certain are we of the truth
   of the Christian religion; and that, if it be not true, there is no
   such thing as true religion in the world; neither was there ever, or
   can there ever be, any revelation proved to be from heaven.

   This is the author's design, to prove the truth of the Christian
   religion in general, against Atheists, Deists, Jews, or Mahometans; and
   he does not enter into any of the disputes which Christians have among
   themselves, but confines himself wholly to the other. Now, as the state
   of Christianity at present is, were a heathen or Mahometan convinced of
   the truth of the Christian religion in general, he would yet be
   exceedingly at a loss to know what society of Christians to join
   himself with; so miserably divided are they amongst themselves, and
   separated into so many sects and parties, which differ almost as widely
   from each other as heathens from Christians, and who are so zealous and
   contentious for their own particular opinions, and bear so much hatred
   and towards those that differ from them, that there is very little of
   the true spirit of charity, which is the bond of peace, to be found
   amongst any of them: this is a very great scandal to the professors of
   Christianity, and has been exceedingly disserviceable to the Christian
   religion; insomuch that great numbers have been hindered from embracing
   the gospel, and many tempted to cast it off, because they saw the
   professors of it in general agree so little amongst themselves: this
   consideration induced mr. Le Clerc to add a seventh book to those of
   Grotius; wherein he treats of this matter, and shews what it becomes
   every honest man to do in such a case; and I have translated it for the
   same reason. All that I shall here add, shall be only briefly to
   inquire into the cause of so much division in the church of Christ, and
   to shew what seems to me the only remedy to heal it. First, to examine
   into the cause why the church of Christ is so much divided: A man needs
   but a little knowledge of the state of the Christian church, to see
   that there is just reason for the same complaint St. Paul made in the
   primitive times of the church of Corinth: that some were for Paul, some
   for Apollos, and some for Cephas; so very early did the spirit of
   faction creep into the church of God, and disturb the peace of it, by
   setting its members at variance with each other, who ought to have been
   all of the same common faith into which they were baptized; and I wish
   it could not be said that the same spirit has too much remained amongst
   Christians ever since. It is evident that the foundation of the
   divisions in the church of Corinth was their forsaking their common
   Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, into whose name alone they were
   baptized, and uniting themselves, some under one eminent apostle or
   teacher, and some under another, by whom they had been instructed in
   the doctrine of Christ, whereby they were distinguished into different
   sects, under their several denominations: this St. Paul complains of as
   a thing in itself very bad, and of pernicious consequence; for hereby
   the body of Christ, that is, the Christian church, the doctrine of
   which is one and the same at all times and in all places, is rent and
   divided into several parts, that clash and interfere with each other;
   which is the only method, if permitted to have its natural effect, that
   can overthrow and destroy it. And from the same cause have arisen all
   the divisions that are or have been in the church ever since. Had
   Christians been contented to own but one Lord, even Jesus Christ, and
   made the doctrine delivered by him the sole rule of faith, without any
   fictions or inventions of men, it had been impossible but that the
   church of Christ must have been one universal, regular, uniform thing,
   and not such a mixture and confusion as we now behold it. But when
   Christians once began to establish doctrines of their own, and to
   impose them upon others by human authority, as rules of faith, (which
   is the foundation of Antichrist), then there began to be as many
   schemes of religion as there were parties of men who had different
   judgment, and got the power into their hands. A very little
   acquaintance with ecclesiastical history does but too sadly confirm the
   truth of this, by giving us an account of the several doctrines in
   fashion in the several ages of the Christian church, according to the
   then present humour. And if it be not so now, how conies it to pass
   that the generality of Christians are so zealous for that scheme of
   religion which is received by that particular church of which they
   profess themselves members? How is it that the generality of Christians
   in one country are zealous for Calvinism, and in another country as
   zealous for Arminianism? It is not because men have any natural
   disposition more to the one than the other, or perhaps that one has
   much more foundation to support it from Scripture than the other; but
   the reason is plain, viz. because they are the established doctrines of
   the places they live in; they are by authority made the rule and
   standard of religion, and men are taught them from the beginning by
   this means they are so deeply fixed and rooted in their minds that they
   become prejudiced in favour of them, and have so strong a relish of
   them, that they cannot read a chapter in the Bible, but it appears
   exactly agreeable to the received notions of them both, though perhaps
   those notions are directly contradictory to each other; thus, instead
   of making the Scripture the only rule of faith, men make rules of faith
   of their own, and interpret Scripture according to them; which being an
   easy way of coming to the knowledge of what they esteem the truth, the
   generality of Christians sit down very well satisfied with it. But
   whoever is, indeed, convinced of the truth of the gospel, and has any
   regard for the honour of it, cannot but be deeply concerned to see its
   sacred truths thus prostituted to the power and interests of men; and
   think it his duty to do the utmost he is able to take it out of their
   hands, and fix it on its own immovable bottom. In order to contribute
   to which, I shall, in the second place, shew what seems to he the only
   remedy that can heal these divisions amongst Christians; and that is,
   in one word, making the Scripture the only rule of faith. Whatever is
   necessary for a Christian to believe, in order to everlasting
   salvation, is there declared, in such a way and manner as the wisdom of
   God, who best knows the circumstances and conditions of mankind, has
   thought fit. This, God himself has made the standard for all ranks or
   orders, for all capacities and abilities; and to set up any other
   above, or upon the level with it, is dishonouring God, and abusing of
   men. All the authority in the world cannot make any thing an article of
   faith, but what God has made so; neither can any power establish or
   impose upon men, more or less, or otherwise than what the Scripture
   commands. God has given every man proportionable faculties and
   abilities of mind, some stronger and some weaker; and he has by his own
   authority made the Scripture the rule of religion to them all: it is,
   therefore, their indispensable duty to examine diligently and study
   attentively this rule, to instruct themselves in the knowledge of
   religious truths front hence, and to form the best judgment they can of
   the nature of them. The Scripture will extend or contract itself
   according to the capacities of men; the strongest and largest
   understanding will there find enough to fill and improve it, and the
   narrowest and meanest capacity will fully acquiesce in what is there
   required of it. Thus all men are obliged to form a judgment of religion
   for themselves, and to be continually rectifying and improving it: they
   may be very helpful and assisting to each other in the means of coming
   to this divine knowledge, but no one can finally determine for another;
   every man must judge for himself; and for the sincerity of his judgment
   he is accountable to God only, who knows the secrets of all hearts,
   which are beyond the reach of human power: this must be left till the
   final day of account, when every man shall be acquitted or condemned
   according as he has acted by the dictates of his conscience or no. Were
   all Christians to go upon this principle, we should soon see an end of
   all the fierce controversies and unhappy divisions which now rend and
   confound the church of Christ: were every man allowed to take the
   Scripture for his only guide in matters of faith and, after all the
   means of knowledge and instruction used, all the ways of assurance and
   conviction tried, permitted quietly to enjoy his own opinion, the
   foundation of all divisions would be taken away at once: and, till
   Christians do arrive at this temper of mind, let them not boast that
   they are endued with that excellent virtue of charity, which is the
   distinguishing mark of their profession; for, if what St. Paul says be
   true, that charity is greater than faith, it is evident no Christian
   ought to be guilty of the breach of a greater duty upon account of a
   lesser; they ought not to disturb that peace and unity which ought to
   be amongst all Christians, for the sake of any matters of faith, any
   differences of opinion; because it is contrary to the known law of
   charity: and how the far greatest part of Christians will clear
   themselves of transgressing this plain law, I know not. Wherefore, if
   ever we expect to have our petitions answered, when we pray that God
   would make us one flock under one Shepherd and Bishop of our souls,
   Jesus Christ, we must cease to make needless fences of our own, and to
   divide ourselves into small separate flocks, and distinguish them by
   that whereby Christ has not distinguished them. When this spirit of
   love and unity, of forbearing one another in meekness, once becomes the
   prevailing principle amongst Christians, then, and not till then, will
   the kingdom of Christ in its highest perfection and purity flourish
   upon the earth, and all the powers of darkness fall before it.

HIERONYMUS BIGNONIUS,

  THE KING'S SOLICITOR IN THE
  SUPREME COURT OF AUDIENCE AT PARIS.

   MOST NOBLE AND EXCELLENT SIR,

   I SHOULD offend against justice, if I should divert another way that
   time which you employ in the exercise of justice in your high station:
   but I am encouraged in this work because it is for the advancement of
   the Christian Religion, which is a great part of justice, and of your
   office; neither would justice permit me to approach any one else so
   soon as you, whose name my book glories in the title of. I do not say I
   desire to employ part of your leisure; for the discharge of so
   extensive an office allows you no leisure. But, since change of
   business is instead of leisure to them that are fully employed, I
   desire you would, in the midst of your forensic affairs, bestow some
   hours upon these papers. Even then you will not be out of the way of
   your business. Hear the witnesses, weigh the force of their testimony,
   make a judgment, and I will stand by the determination.

   We are to join ourselves with those who are most worthy the name of
   Christians
   252

   They are most worthy the name of Christians who, in the purest manner

BOOK II.

   I.

   That we ought to have a love for truth in all things, but more
   especially in such as are of great moment
   277
   II.

   Nothing can be of greater moment than religion; and therefore we ought
   to use our utmost endeavours to come at the true knowledge of it
   27$
   III.

   That an indifference in religion is in its own nature unlawful,
   forbidden by the laws of God, and condemned by all sects of Christians
   280
   IV.

   We ought not hastily to condemn those who differ from us, as if they
   were guilty of such a crime, or such unlawful worship, as is
   inconsistent with eternal life; so that none who admit such persons
   should be capable of the mercy of God; nor yet, on the other hand, is
   it lawful for us to profess that we believe what we do not really
   believe, or to do what, at the same time, we condemn

  SECTION I. The occasion of this work.

   YOU have frequently inquired of me, worthy sir, (whom I know to be a
   gentleman that highly deserves the esteem of your country, of the
   learned world, and, if you will allow me to say it, of myself also),
   what the substance of those books is, which I wrote in defence of the
   Christian religion, in my own language. Nor do I wonder at your
   inquiry; for you, who have with so great judgment read every thing that
   is worth reading, cannot but be sensible with how much philosophic
   nicety Ræmuudus Sebundus, with what entertaining dialogues Ludovicus
   Vives, and with how great eloquence your Mornæus, have illustrated this
   matter. [1] For which reason, it might seem more useful to translate
   some of them into our own language, than to undertake any thing new
   upon this subject. But though I know not what judgment others will pass
   upon me, yet have I very good reason to hope that you, who are so fair
   and candid a judge, will easily acquit me, if I should say, that, after
   having read not only the fore-mentioned writings, but also those that
   have been written by the Jews in behalf of the ancient Jewish
   dispensation, and those of Christians for Christianity, I choose to
   make use of my own judgment, such as it is; and to give my mind that
   liberty which at present is denied my body: for I am persuaded, that
   truth is no other way to be defended but by truth, and that such as the
   mind is fully satisfied with; it being in vain to attempt to persuade
   others to that which you yourself are not convinced of. Wherefore I
   selected, both from the ancients and moderns, what appeared to me most
   conclusive; leaving such arguments as seemed of small weight, and
   rejecting such books as I know to be spurious, or had reason to suspect
   to be so. Those which I approved of I explained, and put in a regular
   method, and in as popular a manner as I could, and likewise turned them
   into verse, that they might the easier be remembered. For my design was
   to undertake something that might be useful to my countrymen,
   especially seamen; that they might have an opportunity to employ that
   time which, in long voyages, lies upon their hands, and is usually
   thrown away: wherefore I began with an encomiun upon our nation, which
   so far excels others in the skill of navigation; that, by this means, I
   might excite them to make use of this art, as a peculiar favour of
   Heaven, not only to their own profit, but also to the propagating the
   Christian religion: for they can never want matter; but, in their long
   voyages, will every where meet either with pagans, as in China or
   Guinea; or Mahometans, as in the Turkish and Persian empires, and in
   the kingdoms of Fez and Morocco; and also with Jews, who are the
   professed enemies of Christianity, and are dispersed over the greatest
   part of the world: and there are never wanting profane persons, who,
   upon occasion, are ready to scatter their poison amongst the weak and
   simple, which fear had forced then to conceal: against all which evils,
   my desire was to have my countrymen well fortified; that they, who have
   the best parts, might employ them in confuting errors, and that the
   other would take heed of being seduced by them.

   [1] These were the chief writers upon this subject in Grotius's time;
   but, since then, a great number have wrote concerning the truth of the
   Christian religion, especially in French and English; moved thereto by
   the example of Grotius, whom they imitated, and sometimes borrowed from
   him: so that the glory of so pious and necessary a method of writing
   chiefly redounds to him. Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. II. That there is a God.

   AND, that we may shew that religion is not a vain and empty thing, it
   shall be the business of this first book to lay the foundation thereof
   in the existence of the Deity; which I prove in the following manner:
   That there are some things which had a beginning, is confessed on all
   sides, and obvious to sense: but these things could not be the cause of
   their own existence; because that which has no being, cannot act; for
   then it would have been before it was, which is impossible: whence it
   follows, that it derived its being from something else: this is true,
   not only of those things which are now before our eyes, or which we
   have formerly seen, but also of those things out of which these have
   arisen, and so on, till we arrive at some cause, which never had any
   beginning, but exists, as we say, necessarily, and not by accident: [2]
   Now this Being, whatsoever it be, (of whom we shall speak more fully by
   and by), is what we mean by the Deity, or God. Another argument for the
   proof of a Deity may be drawn from the plain consent of all nations,
   who have any remains of reason, any sense of good manners, and are not
   wholly degenerated into brutishness. For human inventions, which depend
   upon the arbitrary will of men, are not always the same every where,
   but are often changed; whereas there is no place where this notion is
   not to be found; nor has the course of time been able to alter it,
   (which is observed by Aristotle himself, [3] a man not very credulous
   in these matters); wherefore we must assign it a cause as extensive as
   all mankind; and that can be no other than a declaration from God
   himself, or a tradition derived down from the first parents of mankind:
   if the former be granted, there needs no further proof; if the latter,
   it is hard to give a good reason why our first parents should deliver
   to posterity a falsity in a matter of so great moment. Moreover, if we
   look into those parts of the world which have been a long time known,
   or into those lately discovered; if they have not lost the common
   principles of human nature, as was said before, this truth immediately
   appears; as well amongst the more dull nations, as amongst those who
   are quicker, and have better understandings; and, surely, these latter
   cannot all be deceived, nor the former be supposed to have found out
   something to impose upon each other with: nor would it be of any force
   against this, if it should be urged, that there have been a few persons
   in many ages who did not believe a God, or at least made such a
   profession; for, considering bow few they were, and that, as soon as
   their arguments were known, their opinion was immediately exploded, it
   is evident, it did not proceed from the right use of that reason which
   is common to all men, but either from an affectation of novelty, like
   the heathen philosopher who contended that snow was black; or from a
   corrupted mind, which, like a vitiated palate, does not relish things
   as they are; especially since history and other writings inform us,
   that the more virtuous any one is, the more carefully is this notion of
   the Deity preserved by him: and it is further evident, that they, who
   dissent from this anciently-established opinion, do it out of an ill
   principle, and are such persons, whose interest it is that there should
   be no God, that is, no Judge of human actions; because whatever
   hypothesis they have advanced of their own, whether an infinite
   succession of causes, without any beginning, or a fortuitous concourse
   of atoms, or any other, it is attended with as great, if not greater
   difficulties, and not at all more credible than what is already
   received; as is evident to any one that considers it ever so little.
   [4] For that which some object, that they do not believe a God, because
   they do not see him, if they can see any thing, they may see how much
   it is beneath a man, who has a soul which he cannot see, to argue in
   this manner. Nor, if we cannot fully comprehend the nature of God,
   ought we therefore to deny that there is any such Being; for the beasts
   do not know what sort of creatures men are, and much less do they
   understand how men, by their reason, institute and govern kingdoms,
   measure the course of the stars, and sail across the seas: these things
   exceed their reach: and hence man, because he is placed by the dignity
   of his nature above the beasts, and that not by himself, ought to
   infer, that He, who gave him this superiority above the beasts, is as
   far advanced beyond him as he is beyond the beasts; and that therefore
   there is a nature which, as it is more excellent, so it exceeds his
   comprehension.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] Because, as their manner of speaking is, there can be no such thing
   as going on for ever; for of those things which had a beginning, either
   there is some first cause, or there is none. If it be denied that there
   is any first cause; then, those things which had a beginning were
   without a cause; and consequently existed, er name out of nothing, of
   themselves; which is absurd. Le Clerc.

   [3] Metaphys. book xi. ch. 5. where, after relating the fables of the
   gods, he has these words: "Which, if any one rightly distinguishes, he
   will keep wholly to this as the principal thing; that to believe the
   gods to be the first beings, is a divine truth; and that though arts
   and sciences have probably been often lost, and revived, yet this
   opinion hath been preserved as a relic to this very time." Le Clerc.

   [4] Grotius might have said, and that not rashly, that there are much
   greater difficulties in the opinions of those who would have the world
   to be eternal, or always to have been; such as, that it must have come
   out of nothing of itself, or that it arose from the fortuitous
   concourse of atoms; opinions full of manifest contradictions, as many
   since Grotius's time have exactly demonstrated; amongst whom is the
   eminent and learned dr. Ralph Cudworth, who wrote the English treatise
   of the intellectual system of the universe. There are also other very
   excellent English divines mid natural philosophers. Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. III. That there is but one God.

   HAVING proved the existence of the Deity, we come next to his
   attributes: the first whereof is, that there can be no more Gods than
   one; which may be gathered from hence; because, as was before said, God
   exists necessarily, or is self-existent. Now that which is necessary,
   or self-existent, cannot be considered as of any kind or species of
   beings, but as actually existing, and is therefore a single being; [5]
   for, if you imagine many Gods, you will see that necessary existence
   belongs to none of them; nor can there be any reason why two should
   rather be believed than three, or ten than five: beside, the abundance
   of particular things of the same kind proceeds from the fruitfulness of
   the cause, in proportion to which more or less is produced; but God has
   no cause, or original. Further, particular different things are endued
   with peculiar properties, by which they are distinguished from each
   other; which do not belong to God, who is a necessary being. Neither do
   we find any signs of many Gods; for this whole universe makes but one
   world, in which there is but one thing that far exceeds the rest in
   beauty, viz. the sun: [6] and in every man there is but one thing that
   governs, that is, the mind: moreover, if there could be two or more
   Gods, free agents, acting according to their own wills, they might will
   contrary to each other; and so one be hindered by the other front
   effecting his design; now, a possibility of being hindered is
   inconsistent with the notion of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] But a great many single beings are a great many individual beings;
   this argument therefore might have been omitted, without any detriment
   to so good a cause: Le Clerc.--Whoever would see the argument for the
   unity of God, drawn from his necessary or self-existence, urged in its
   full force, may find it at the beginning of dr. Samuel Clark's Boyle's
   Lectures.

   [6] At least to the inhabitants of this our solar system, (as we now
   term it), as those fiery centres the stars are to other erterns. Le
   Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. IV. All perfection is in God.

   THAT we may come to the knowledge of the other attributes of God, we
   conceive all that is meant by perfection to be in him, (I use the Latin
   word perfectio, as being the best that tongue affords, and the same as
   the Greek teleiotes); because whatever perfection is in any thing,
   either had a beginning, or not; if it had no beginning, it is the
   perfection of God; if it had a beginning, it must of necessity be from
   something else: and, since none of those things that exist are produced
   from nothing, it follows, that whatever perfections are in the effects,
   were first in the cause, so that it could produce any thing endued with
   them; and consequently they are all in the first cause. Neither can the
   first cause ever be deprived of any of its perfections: not from any
   thing else; because that which is eternal does not depend upon any
   other thing; nor can it at all suffer from any thing that they can do;
   nor from itself, because every nature desires its own perfection.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. V. And in an infinite degree.

   To this must be added, that these perfections are in God, in an
   infinite degree: because those attributes that are finite are therefore
   limited; because the cause whence they proceed has communicated so much
   of them, and no more; or else, because the subject was capable of no
   more. But no other nature communicated any of its perfections to God;
   nor does he derive any thing from any one else, he being, as was said,
   necessary or self-existent.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VI. That God is eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, and completely good.

   Now, seeing it is very evident that those things which have life are
   more perfect than those which have not; and those which have a power of
   acting, than those which have none; those which have understanding,
   than those which want it; those which are good, than those which are
   not so; it follows, from what has been already said, that these
   attributes belong to God, and that infinitely: wherefore he is a living
   infinite God; that is, eternal, of immense power, and every way good,
   without the least defect.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VII. That God is the cause of all things.

   EVERY thing that is, derives its existence from God; this follows from
   what has been already said. For we conclude, that there is but one
   necessary self-existent Being; whence we collect, that all other things
   sprung from a being different from themselves: for those things, which
   are derived front something else, were all of them, either immediately
   in themselves, or mediately in their causes, derived front him who had
   no beginning, that is, from God, as was before evinced. And this is not
   only evident to reason, but in a manner to sense too: for if we take a
   survey of the admirable structure of a human body, both within and
   without, and see how every, even the most minute, part hath its proper
   use, without any design or intention of the parents, and with so great
   exactness, as the most excellent philosophers and physicians could
   never enough admire; it is a sufficient demonstration that. the Author
   of nature is the most complete understanding. Of this a great deal may
   be seen in Galen, [7] especially where he examines the use of the hands
   and eyes: and the same may be observed in the bodies of dumb creatures;
   for the figure and situation of their parts to a certain end cannot be
   the effect of any power in matter. As also in plants and herbs, which
   is accurately observed by the philosophers. Strabo [8] excellently well
   takes notice hereof in the position of water, which, as to its quality,
   is of a middle nature betwixt air and earth, and ought to have been
   placed betwixt them, but is therefore interspersed and mixed with the
   earth, lest its fruitfulness, by which the life of man is preserved,
   should be hindered. Now it is the property of intelligent beings only
   to act with some view. Neither are particular things appointed for
   their own peculiar ends only, but for the good of the whole; as is
   plain in water, which, contrary to its own nature, is raised upwards,
   lest by a vacuum there should be a gap in the structure of the
   universe, which is upheld by the continued union of its parts. [9] Now,
   the good of the whole could not possibly be designed, nor a power put
   into things to tend towards it, but by an Intelligent Being, to whom
   the universe is subject. There are moreover some actions, even of the
   beasts, so ordered and directed, as plainly discover them to be the
   effects of some small degree of reason: as is most manifest in ants and
   bees, and also in some others, which, before they have experienced
   them, will avoid things hurtful, and seek those that are profitable to
   them. That this power, of searching out and distinguishing, is not
   properly in themselves, is apparent from hence, because they act always
   alike, and are unable to do other things which do not require more
   pains; wherefore they are acted upon by some foreign reason; and what
   they do, must of necessity proceed from the efficiency of that reason
   impressed upon them: which reason is no other than what we call God.
   [10] Next, the heavenly constellations, but more especially those
   eminent ones, the sun and moon, have their courses so exactly
   accommodated to the fruitfulness of the earth, and to the health of
   animals, that nothing can be imagined more convenient: for though,
   otherwise, the most simple motion had been along the equator, yet are
   they directed in an oblique circle, that the benefit of them might
   extend to more places of the earth. And as other animals are allowed
   the use of the earth, so mankind are permitted to use those animals,
   and can by the power of his reason tame the fiercest of them. Whence it
   was that the stoics concluded that the world was made for the sake of
   man. [11] But, since the power of man does not extend so far as to
   compel the heavenly luminaries to serve him, nor is it likely they
   should of their own accord submit themselves to him, hence it follows,
   that there is a superior understanding, at whose command those
   beautiful bodies afford their perpetual assistance to man, wile, is
   placed so far beneath them; which understanding is none other than the
   Maker of the stars and of the universe. The eccentric motions of the
   stars, and the epicycles, as they term them, manifestly show, that they
   are not the effects of matter, but the appointment of a free agent;
   [12] and the same assurance we have from the position of the stars,
   some in one part of the heavens, and some in another: and from the
   unequal form of the earth and seas: nor can we attribute the motion of
   the stars in such a direction, rather than another, to any thing else.
   The very figure of the world, which is the most perfect, viz. round,
   and all the parts of it inclosed, as it were, in the bosom of the
   heavens, and placed in wonderful order, sufficiently declare, that
   these things were not the result of chance, but the appointment of the
   most excellent understanding: for, can any one be so foolish, as to
   expect any- thing so accurate from chance? He may as soon believe, that
   pieces of timber, and stones, should frame themselves into a house:
   [13] or that, from letters thrown at a venture, there should arise a
   poem; when the philosopher, who saw only some geometrical figures on
   the sea-shore, thought them plain indications of a man's having been
   there, such things not looking as if they proceeded from chance.
   Besides, that mankind were not from eternity, but date their original
   from a certain period of time, is clear, as from other arguments, so
   from the improvement of arts, and those desert places, which came
   afterwards to be inhabited, [14] and is further evidenced by the
   language of islands, plainly derived from the neighbouring continents.
   There are, moreover, certain ordinances so universal amongst men, that
   they do not seem so much to owe their institution to the instinct of
   nature, or the deductions of plain reason, as to a constant tradition,
   scarcely interrupted in any place, either by wickedness or misfortune:
   of which sort were formerly sacrifices, amongst holy rites; and now
   shame in venereal things, the solemnity of marriage, and the abhorrence
   of incest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] Book iii. ch.10. which place is highly worth reading, but too long
   to be inserted. But many later divines and natural philosophers in
   England have explained these things more accurately. Le Clerc.

   [8] Book xvii. where after he had distinguished betwixt the works of
   nature, that is, the material world, and those of Providence, he adds:
   "After, the earth was surrounded with water, because man was not made
   to dwell in the water, but belongs partly to the earth and partly to
   the air, and stands in great need of light. Providence has caused many
   eminences and cavities in the earth, that in these the water, or the
   greatest part of it, might be received; whereby that part of the earth
   under it might be covered; and that by the other the earth might be
   advanced to cover the water, except what is of use for men, animals,
   and plants." The same hath been observed by rabbi Jehuda Levita, and
   Abeneadra, amongst the Jews, and St. Chrysostom, in his 9th homily of
   statutes, among Christians.

   [9] This was borrowed from the peripatetic philosophy, by this great
   man; which supposed the water in a pump to ascend for fear of a vacuum;
   whereas it is now granted by all to be done by the pressure of the air.
   But by the laws of gravitation, as the moderns explain them, the order
   of the universe, and the wisdom of its Creator, are no less
   conspicuous. Le Clerc.

   [10] No, they are done by the soul of those beasts, which is so far
   reasonable, as to be able to do such things, and not others. Other.
   wise God himself would act in them instead of a soul, which a good
   philosopher will hardly be persuaded of. Nothing hinders but that there
   may be a great many ranks of sensible and intelligent natures, the
   lowest of which may be in the bodies of brute creatures; for nobody, I
   think, really believes with Ren. Cartes, that brutes are mere corporeal
   machines. But you will say, when brute creatures die, what becomes of
   the souls? That indeed 1 know not; but it is nevertheless true that
   souls reside in them. There is no necessity that we should know all
   things, nor are we therefore presently to deny any thing because we
   cannot give account of it. We are to receive those things that are
   evident, and be content to be ignorant of those things which we cannot
   know. Le Clerc.

   [11] See Tully in his first book of offices, and his second of the
   nature of the gods.

   [12] This argument is learnedly handled by Maimonides, in his Ductor
   Dubitantium, part ii. c. 4. And if you suppose the earth to be moved,
   it amounts to the same thing in other words.--These, and some of the
   following things, are according to the vulgar opinion, which is now
   exploded; but the efficacy of the Divine Power is equally seen in the
   constant motion of the planets, in ellipses, about the sun, through the
   most fluid vortex; in such a manner as not to recede from, or approach
   to, their centre, more than their wonted limits, but always cut the
   sun's equator at like obliquity. Le Clerc.--Sir Isaac Newton has
   demonstrated that there are no such vortexes, but that their motions
   are better explained without them.

   [13] Or ship, or engine.

   [14] t Tertullian treats of this matter, from history, in his book
   concerning the soul, sect. 30. "We find" (says he) "in all
   commentaries, especially of the antiquities of men, that mankind
   increase by degrees," &c. And a little after, "The world manifestly
   improves every day, and grows wiser than it was." These two arguments
   caused Aristotle's opinion (who would not allow mankind any beginning)
   to be rejected by the learned historians, especially the Epicureans.
   Lucretius, book v.--

   " If heaven and earth had no original,
   How is it, that, before the Trojan war,
   No poets sung of memorable things;
   Bat deeds of heroes died so oft with them;
   And no where monuments raised to their praise?
   This shews the world is young, and lately made.
   Whence 'tis that arts are every day increas'd,
   Or fresh renew'd; and ships so much improv'd,
   And music, to delight the ear."
   With a great deal more to the same purpose. Virgil, Eclogue vi.

   ----"From these first principles
   All things arose; hence sprung the tender world."
   And in his Georgics.

   "Use first produc'd those various arts we see, By small degrees; this
   taught the husbandman
   To plough and sow his fields; from the hard flint
   To fetch the hidden sparks; then men began
   With hollow boats to cross the stream; pilots
   Call'd Hyades and Pleiades their signs,
   And Charles's wain: then sportsmen spread their nets
   To catch wild beasts, and dogs pursued their game.
   Some drain the rivers, and some seek the main,
   Stretching their nets to inclose the finny prey:
   Others with iron forge whet instruments
   To cleave the yielding wood: then arts arose."
   Horace, book i. sat. iii.

   "When first mankind began to spread the earth.
   Like animals devoid of speech, they strove
   With utmost strength of hands, for dens and acorns;
   From thence to clubs, and then to arms, they came,
   Taught by experience; till words express'd
   Their meaning, and gave proper names to things:
   Then ended wars, cities were built, and laws
   Were made for thieves, adulterers, and rogues."
   Pliny, in his third book of natural history, about the beginning,
   "Wherefore I would be so understood as the words theinselvei signify,
   without the flourish of men; and as they were understood at the
   beginning, before any great exploits were performed." The same author
   affirms, that the Hercynean wood (in Germany) was coeval with the
   world, book xvi. Seneca, in Lanctantius, "It is not a thousand years
   since wisdom had a beginning." Tacitus's Annals, iii. "The first men,
   before appetite and passion swayed them, lived without bribes, and
   without iniquity; and needed not to be restrained from evil by
   punishment: neither did they stand in need of reward, every one
   naturally pursuing virtue; for so long as nothing was desired contrary
   to morality, they wanted not to be restrained by fear; but after they
   laid aside equity, and violence and ambition succeeded in the room of
   honesty and humility, then began that power which has always continued
   amongst some people. But others immediately, or at least after they
   grew weary of kings, preferred a legal government." And Aristotle could
   not fully persuade himself, any more than others, of the truth of his
   own hypothesis, that mankind never had any beginning. For he speaks
   very doubtfully of the matter in many places, as Moses Maimonides
   observes in his Ductor Dubitantium, part ii. In the prologue to his
   second book, concerning the heavens, he calls his position only a
   persuasion, and not a demonstration; and there is a saying of the same
   philosopher, in the third book of the soul, chap. iii. "that persuasion
   is a consequence of opinion." But his principal argument is drawn from
   the absurdity of the contrary opinion, which supposes the heavens and
   the universe not to be created, but generated; which is inconsistent.
   Book xi. of his Metaphysics, chap. 8, he says, "It is very likely that
   arts have often been lost, and invented again." And, in the last
   chapter of the third book of the generation of animals, he has these
   words, "It would not be a foolish conjecture, concerning the first rise
   of men and beasts, if any one should imagine, that of old they sprung
   out of the earth one of these two ways; either after the manner of
   maggots, or to have come from eggs." After his explication of each of
   these, he adds, "If therefore animals had any beginning, it is manifest
   it must be one of these two ways." The same Aristotle, in the first of
   his Topics, chap. xi. "There are some questions against which very good
   arguments may be brought; it being very doubtful which side is in the
   right, there being great probability on either hand, we have no
   certainty of them: and though they be of great weight, we find it very
   difficult to determine the cause and manner of their existence; as for
   instance, whether the world were from eternity, or no: for such things
   as these are disputable." And again, disputing about the same thing, in
   his first book of the heavens, chap. x. "What shall be said will be the
   more credible, if we allow the disputants arguments their due weight."
   Tatian, therefore, did well not to pass by this, where he brings his
   reasons for the belief of the scriptures, "That what they deliver,
   concerning the creation of the universe, is level to every one's
   capacity." If you take Plato for the world's having a beginning, and
   Aristotle for its having had none, you will have seen both the Jewish
   and Christian opinions."

  SECT. VIII. The objection concerning the cause of evil, answered.

   NOR ought we to be in the least shaken in what has been said, because
   we see many evils happen, the original of which cannot be ascribed to
   God, who, as was affirmed of him, is perfectly good. For when we say,
   that God is the cause of all things, we mean of all such things as have
   a real existence; which is no reason why those things themselves should
   not be the cause of some accidents, such as actions are. God created
   man, and some other intelligences superior to man, with a liberty of
   acting; which liberty of acting is not in itself evil, but may be the
   cause of something that is evil. [15] And to make God the author of
   evils of this kind, which are called moral evils, is the highest
   wickedness. But there are other sorts of evils, such as loss or pain
   inflicted upon a person, which may be allowed to come from God, suppose
   for the reformation of the man, or as a punishment which his sins
   deserve: for here is no inconsistency with goodness; but, on the
   contrary, these proceed from goodness itself, in the same manner as
   physic, unpleasant to the taste, does from a good physician.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [15] "God, indeed, foresaw that free agents would abuse their liberty,
   and that many natural and moral evils would arise from hence; yet did
   not this hinder him from permitting such abuse, and the consequences
   thereof; any more than it hindered his creating beings endued with such
   liberty. The reason is plain. Because a free agent being the most
   excellent creature, which discovers the highest power of tile Creator,
   God was unwilling to prevent those inconveniencies which proceed from
   the mutability of their nature; because he can amend them as he
   pleases, to all eternity; in such a manner as is agreeable to his own
   goodness, though he has not yet revealed it to us. Concerning which we
   have largely treated in French, in a book wrote against Pet. Bayle, the
   seeming advocate of the Manichees. Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. IX. Against two principles.

   AND here, by the way, we ought to reject their opinion, who imagine
   there are two active principles, the one good, and the other evil. [16]
   For from two principles, that nye contradictory to each other, can
   arise no regular order, but only ruin and destruction: neither can
   there be a self-existent being perfectly evil, as there is one
   self-existent perfectly good; because evil is a defect, which cannot
   reside but in something which has a being; and the very having a being
   is to be reckoned amongst the things which are good. [17]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] This has respect to the ancient disciples of Zoroastres, and to
   the Manichees. Le Clerc.

   [17] But here the author was speaking of moral and not of natural good.
   It had therefore been better to have forborne such kind of reasoning.
   Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. X. That God governs the universe.

   THAT the world is governed by the providence of God, is evident from
   hence; that not only men, who are endued with understanding, but birds,
   and both wild and tame beasts, (who are led by instinct, which serves
   them instead of understanding), take care of, and provide for, their
   young. Which perfection, as it is a branch of goodness, ought not to be
   excluded from God: and so much the rather, because he is all-wise, and
   all-powerful, and cannot but know every thing that is done, or is to be
   done, and with the greatest facility direct and govern them: to which
   we may add, what was before hinted concerning the motion of particular
   things, contrary to their own nature, to promote the good of the whole.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XI. And the affairs of this lower world.

   AND they are under a very great mistake, who confine this providence to
   the heavenly bodies; [18] as appears from the foregoing reason, which
   holds as strong for all created beings; and moreover from this
   consideration, that there is an especial regard had to the good of man,
   in the regulation of the course of the stars, as is confessed by the
   best philosophers, and evident from experience. [19] And it is
   reasonable to conceive, that greater care should be taken of that for
   whose sake the other was made, than of that which is only subservient
   to it.

   And the particulars in it.

   NEITHER is their error less, who allow the universe to be governed by
   him, but not the particular things in it. [20] For if he were ignorant
   of any particular thing, (as some of them say), he would not be
   thoroughly acquainted with himself. Neither will his knowledge be
   infinite, (as we have before proved it to be). if it does not extend to
   individuals. Now, if God knows all things, what should binder his
   taking care of them; especially since individuals, as such, are
   appointed for some certain end, either particular or general? and
   things in general (which they themselves acknowledge to be preserved by
   God) cannot subsist but in their individuals: so that if the
   particulars be destroyed, by providence's forsaking them, the whole
   must be destroyed too.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [18] This was the opinion of Aristotle. See Plutarch concerning the
   opinions of the philosophers, book. ii. chap. 3. and Atticus in
   Eusebius's Gospel Preparation, book v. ch. 3. Le Clerc.

   [19] Though not for man only; for it doth not appear that there are no
   other intelligent beings in other planets; yet partly for him, and, so
   far as he makes use of them, without any detriment to other creatures.
   Because we cannot live without the sun, we may well conclude it was
   made upon our account; unless we can imagine that chance provided every
   thing that is necessary for us; which is very absurd; just like a man
   who, happening upon a house well furnished, should deny that it was
   built for the convenience of men, who are alone capable of enjoying it.
   Le Clerc.

   [20] This was the opinion of the stoics: see Arrius's Dissertations
   upon Epictetus, book i. ch. 12. and Justin Lipsius, in his stoical
   physiology, Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XII. This is further proved by the preservation of empires.

   THE preservation of commonwealths hath been acknowledged, both by
   philosophers and historians, to be no mean argument for the Divine
   Providence over human affairs. First, in general; because wherever good
   order in government and obedience hath been once admitted, it has been
   always retained; [21] and in particular, certain forms of government
   have continued for many ages; as that of kings among the Assyrians,
   Egyptians, and Franks; and that of aristocracy among the Venetians.
   Now, though human wisdom may go a good way towards this, yet, if it be
   duly considered what a multitude of wicked men there are, how many
   external evils, how liable things are in their own nature to change; we
   can hardly imagine any government should subsist so long without the
   peculiar care of the Deity. And this is more visible where it has
   pleased God to change a government: [22] for all things (even those
   which do not depend upon human prudence) succeed beyond their wish
   (which they do not ordinarily in the variety of human events) to those
   whom God has appointed instruments for this purpose, as it were,
   destined by him; (suppose Cyrus, Alexander, Cæsar the dictator, the
   Cingi [23] amongst the Tartars, Namcaa [24] amongst the Chinese): which
   wonderful agreeableness of events, and all conspiring to a certain end,
   is a manifest indication of a provident direction. For though a man may
   now and then throw a particular cast on a die by chance; yet, if he
   should do it a hundred times together, every body would conclude there
   was some art in it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [21] Because without it there is no such thing as human society, and
   without society mankind cannot be preserved; whence we may collect,
   that men were created by Divine Providence, that they might live in
   society, and make use of laws, without which there neither is nor can
   be any society. Le Clerc.

   [22] Thus Lucretius: "Some secret cause confounds the exploits of men."

   [23] He seems to mean Genghiz Can, who came out of eastern Tartary, and
   out of the city Caracarom, and subdued not only Tartary, but also the
   northern Sina and India. From him sprung the Mogul kings, and the
   princes of the lesser Tartary. His life is written in French, and
   published at Paris in 1710. Le Clerc.

   [24] Here, in justice, Manca Capacus ought to be named, who was the
   founder of the empire of Peru. (See Garsilazzi de la Vega, in Incarum
   historia).
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XIII. And by miracles.

   BUT the most certain proof of Divine Providence is from miracles, and
   the predictions we find in histories: it is true, indeed, that a great
   many of those relations are fabulous; but there is no reason to
   disbelieve those which are attested by credible witnesses to have been
   in their time, men whose judgment and integrity have never been called
   in question. For, since God is all-knowing and all-powerful, why should
   we think him not able to signify his knowledge or his resolution to act
   out of the ordinary course of nature, which is his appointment, and
   subject to his direction and government? If any one should object
   against this, that inferior intelligent agents may be the cause of
   them, it is readily granted; and this tends to make us believe it the
   more easily of God: beside, whatever of this nature is done by such
   beings, we conceive God does by them, or wisely permits them to do
   them; in the same manner as, in well regulated kingdoms, nothing is
   done otherwise than the law directs, but by the will of the supreme
   governor.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XIV. But more especially amongst the Jews, who ought to be credited upon
  the account of the long continuance of their religion.

   Now, that some miracles have really been seen, (though it should seem
   doubtful from the credit of all other histories), the Jewish religion
   alone may easily convince us: with though it has been a long time
   destitute of human assistance, nay exposed to contempt and mockery, yet
   it remains to this very day, in almost all parts of the world; [25]
   when all other religions [26] (except the Christian, which is, as it
   were, the perfection of the Jewish) have either disappeared as soon as
   they were forsaken by the civil power and authority, (as all the pagan
   religions did), or else they are yet maintained by the same power as
   Mahometanism is: for, if any one should ask, whence it is that the
   Jewish religion hath taken so deep root in the minds of all the
   Hebrews, as never to be forced out; there can be no other possible
   cause assigned or imagined than this, that the present Jews received it
   from their parents, and they from theirs, and so on, till you come to
   the age in which Moses and Joshua lived: they received, I say, by a
   certain and uninterrupted tradition, the miracles which were worked, as
   in other places, so more especially at their coming out of Egypt, in
   their journey, and at their entrance into Canaan; of all which their
   ancestors themselves were witnesses. [27] Nor is it in the least
   credible, that a people of so obstinate a disposition could ever be
   persuaded, any otherwise, to submit to a law loaded with so many rites
   and ceremonies; or that wise men, amongst the many distinctions of
   religion which human reason might invent, should choose circumcision;
   which could not be performed without great pain, [28] and was laughed
   at by all strangers, [29] and had nothing to recommend it but the
   authority of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [25] Hecatæus, concerning the Jew; which lived before the time of
   Alexander, has these words: "Though they be severely reproached by
   their neighbours and by strangers, and many times harshly treated by
   the Persian kings and nobility; yet cannot they be brought off from
   their opinion. but will undergo the most cruel torments and sharpest
   death, rather than forsake the religion of their country." Josephus
   preserved this place, in his first book against Appion: and he adds
   another example out of the same Hecatæus, relating to Alexander's time,
   wherein the Jewish soldiers peremptorily refused to assist at the
   repairing the temple of the god Belus. And the same Josephus has very
   well shewn, in his other book against Appion, that the firm persuasion
   of the Jews of old, concerning God's being the author of their law, is
   from hence evident; because they have not dared, like other people, to
   alter any thing in their laws; not even when, in long banishments,
   under foreign princes, they have been tried by all sorts of
   threatenings and flatteries. To this we may add something of Tacitus
   about the proselytes: "All that are converted to them do the like; for
   the first principle they are instructed in is to have a contempt of the
   gods; to lay aside their love to their country, and to have no regard
   for their parents or brethren." That is, when the law of God comes in
   competition with them; which this profane author unjustly blames. See
   further what Porphyry has delivered about the constancy of the Jews, in
   his second and fourth books against eating of living creatures; where
   Le mentions Antiochus, and particularly the constancy of the Essenes
   amongst the Jews.

   [26] Even those so highly commended laws of Lycurgus, as is observed by
   Josephus and Theodoret.

   [27] To which we give credit, because it was worthy of God to institute
   a religion in which it was taught that there was one God, the Creator
   of all things, who is a spiritual Being, and is alone to be worshipped.
   Le Clerc.

   [28] Philo says, it was done "with very great pain."

   [29] The same Philo says, "It was a thing laughed at by every body:"
   whence the Jews by the poets are called cropt, circumcised,
   fore-skinned.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XV. From the truth and antiquity of Moses.

   THIS also gives the greatest credit imaginable to the writings of
   Moses, in which these miracles are recorded to posterity; that there
   was not only a settled opinion and constant tradition amongst the Jews
   that this Moses was appointed by the express command of God himself to
   be the leader and captain of this people; but also because, as is very
   evident, he did not make his own glory and advantage his principal aim,
   but he himself relates those-errors of his own, which he could have
   concealed; and delivered the regal and sacerdotal dignity to others,
   (permitting his own posterity to be reduced only to common Levites).
   All which plainly shew, that he had no occasion to falsify in his
   history; as the style of it further evinces, it being free from that
   varnish and colour, which uses to give credit to romances; and is very
   natural and easy, and agreeable to the matter of which it treats.
   Moreover, another argument for the undoubted antiquity of Moses's
   writings, which no other writings can pretend to, is this, that the
   Greeks (from whom all other nations derived their learning) own, that
   they had their letters from foreigners; [30] which letters of theirs
   have the same order, name, and shape, as the Syriac or Hebrew: [31] and
   further still, the most ancient Attic laws, from whence the Roman were
   afterwards taken, owe their original to the law of Moses. [32]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [30] Herodotus in his Terpsichore says, "That the Ionians had their
   letters from the Phoenicians, and used them, with very little
   variation; which afterwards appearing, those letters were called
   Phoenician, (as they ought to be), from the Phoenicians bringing them
   into Greece." He calls them, "The Phoenician characters of Cadmus," And
   Callimachus; ----Cadmus, from whom the Greeks
   Their written books derive." And Plutarch calls them Phoenician or
   Punic letters, in his ninth book, and third prob. of his Symposiacs,
   where he says, that alpha in the Phoenician language signifies an ox,
   which is very true. Eupolemus, in his book of the kings of Judæa, says,
   "That Moses was the first wise man, and that letters were first given
   by him to the Jews, and from them the Phoenicians received them;" that
   is, the ancient language of the Jews and Phoenicians was the same, or
   very little different. Thus Lucian: "He spake some indistinct words,
   like the Hebrew or Phoenician." And Chærilus, In his verses concerning
   the Solimi, who, he says, dwelt near the lake, I suppose he means
   Asphaltites, "These with their tongue pronounced Phoenician words." See
   also the Punic scene of Plautus, where you have the words that are put
   in the Punic language twice, by reason of the double writing; and also
   the Latin translation; whence you may easily correct what is corrupted.
   And as the Phoenician and Hebrew languages were the same, so are the
   ancient Hebrew letters the same with those of the Phoenicians. See the
   great men about this matter. Joseph Scaliger's Diatriba of the Eusebian
   year I? I?CCXVII. and the first book, ch. x. of Gerard Vossius's
   Grammar, (and particularly Sam. Bochart, in his Chanaan). You may amid
   also, if you please, Clement of Alexandria, Strom. book 1. and
   Esebius's Gospel Preparation, book x. ch. 5.

   [31] He means the Samaritan letters, which are the same as the
   Phoenician, as Lud. Capel, Sam. Bochart, and others, have shewn. I also
   have treated of the same in French, in the Biblioth. Select. vol. xi.
   Le Clerc.

   [32] You have a famous instance of this, in thieves that rob by night,
   which we have treated of in the second book of war and peace, chap. i.
   sect. 12. and another in that law which Sopator recites, "Let him that
   is next a-kin possess the heiress;" which is thus explained by Terence:
   "There is a law, by which widows ought to be married to the next
   kinsmen, and the same law obliges these kinsmen to marry them." Donatus
   remarks upon this place thus: "That the widow should be married to the
   next kinsman, and he marry her, is the Attic law," viz. taken from the
   law of Moses, in the last chap. of Numbers, which we shall have
   opportunity of speaking more of afterwards. A great many other things
   may be found to this purpose, if any one search diligently for them: as
   the feast in which they carried clusters of grapes, taken from the
   feast of tabernacles; the law that the high priest should marry none
   but a virgin, and his countrywoman; that next after sisters, kinsmen by
   the father's side should inherit: wherefore the Attic laws agree with
   many of the Hebrew, because the Attics owe many of their customs to
   Cecrops, king of Egypt; and because God established many laws amongst
   the Hebrews, very much like those of the Egyptians, to which they had
   been accustomed, only reforming such things as were bad in them; as we
   have often observed in our notes upon the Pentateuch, and, before us,
   John Spencer in his book about the ritual laws of the Jews. Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XVI. From foreign testimonies.

   TO these we may add the testimony of a great number, who were strangers
   to the Jewish religion, which shews that the most ancient tradition
   among all nations is exactly agreeable to the relation of Moses. For
   his description of the original of the world is almost the very same as
   in the ancient Phoenician histories, which are translated by Philo
   Biblius from Sanchuniathon's collection; [33] and a good part of it is
   to be found among the Indians [34] and Egyptians; [35] whence it is
   that in Linus, [36] Hesiod, [37] and many other animals, and also of
   man's formation after the Divine image, and the dominion given him over
   all living creatures, which are to be seen in many writers,
   particularly in Ovid, who transcribed them from the Greek: [38] That
   all things were made by the word of God, is asserted by Epicharmus,
   [39] and the Platonists; [40] and before them, by the most ancient
   writer, I do not mean of those hymns which go under his name, but of
   those verses which were of old called Orpheus's; [41] not because
   Orpheus composed them, but because they contained his doctrines. And
   Empedocles [42] acknowledged, that the sun was not the original light,
   but the receptacle of light, the storehouse and vehicle of fire, as the
   ancient Christians express it. Aratus [43] and Catullus [44] thought
   the divine residence was above the starry orb; in which, Homer says,
   there is a continual light. Thales [45] taught, from the ancient
   schools, that God was the oldest of beings, because not begotten; that
   the world was most beautiful, because the workmanship of God; that
   darkness was before light, which latter we find in Orpheus's verses,
   [46] and Hesiod; [47] whence it was, that the nations, who were most
   tenacious of ancient customs, reckoned the time by nights. [48]
   Anaxagoras affirmed, that all things were regulated by the Supreme
   Mind: [49] Aratus, [50] that the stars were made by God; Virgil, [51]
   from the Greeks, that life was infused into things by the Spirit of
   God; Hesiod, [52] Homer, [53] and Callimachus, [54] that man was formed
   of clay; lastly, Maximus Tyrius asserts, that it was a constant
   tradition received by all nations, that there was one supreme God, the
   cause of all things. [55] And we learn from Josephus, [56] Philo, [57]
   Tibullus, [58] Clemens Alexandrinus, [59] and Lucian, [60] (for I need
   not mention the Hebrews), that the memory of the seven days' work was
   preserved, not only among the Greeks and Italians, by honouring the
   seventh day; but also amongst the Celtæ and Indians, who all measured
   the time by weeks; [61] as we learn from Philostratus, [62] Dion
   Cassius, [63] and Justin Martyr; and also the most ancient names of the
   days. [64] The Egyptians tell us, that at first met led their lives in
   great simplicity, [65] their bodies being naked; [66] whence arose the
   poet's fiction of the golden age, famous among the Indians, as Strabo
   remarks. [67] Maimonides [68] takes notice, that the history of Adam,
   of Eve, of the tree, and of the serpent, was extant amongst the
   idolatrous Indians in his time: [69] and there are many witnesses in
   our age, [70] who testify that the same is still to be found amongst
   the heathen dwelling in Peru, and the Philippine islands, people
   belonging to the same India; the name of Adam amongst the Brachmans;
   and that it was reckoned six thousand years since the creation of the
   world, by those of Siam. [71] Berosus, in his history of Chaldea;
   Manethos, in his of Egypt; Hierom, in his of Phoenicia; Hestiæus,
   Hecatæus, Hillanicus, in theirs of Greece; and Hesiod among the poets,
   [72] all assert, that the lives of those who descended from the first
   men were almost a thousand years in length; which is the less
   incredible, because the historians of many nations (particularly
   Pausanius [73] and Philostratus [74] amongst the Greeks, and Pliny [75]
   amongst the Romans) relate, that men's bodies, upon opening their
   sepulchres, were found to be much larger in old time. [76] And
   Catullus, [77] after many of the Greeks, relates, that divine visions
   were made to men before their great and manifold crimes did, as it
   were, hinder God, and those spirits that attend him, from holding any
   correspondence with men. [78] We almost every where, in the Greek [79]
   and Latin [80] historians, meet with the savage life of the giants,
   Mentioned by Moses. And it is very remarkable concerning the deluge,
   that the memory of almost all nations ends in the history of it, even
   those nations which were unknown till our forefathers discovered them:
   so that Varro calls all that the unknown time. [81] And all those
   things which we read in the poets, wrapped up in fables, (a liberty
   they allow themselves), are delivered by the ancient writers according
   to truth and reality, that is, agreeable to Moses; as you may see in
   Berosus's [82] history of Chaldea, Abydenus's [83] of Assyria, who
   mentions the dove that was sent out of the ark; [84] and in Plutarch
   from the Greeks; and in Lucian, [85] who says, that in Hierapolis of
   Syria there was remaining a most ancient history of the ark, and of the
   preserving a few not only of mankind, but also of other living
   creatures. The same history was extant also in Molo, [86] and in
   Nicolaus Damascenus; [87] which latter names the ark, which we also
   find in the history of Deucalion in Apollodorus: and many Spaniards
   [88] affirm, that in several parts of America, as Cuba, Mechoacana,
   Nicaraga, is preserved the memory of the deluge, the saving alive of
   animals, especially the raven and dove; and the deluge itself in that
   part called Golden Castile. That remark of Pliny's, [89] that Joppa was
   built before the flood, discovers what part of the earth men inhabited
   before the flood. The place where the ark rested after the deluge, on
   the Gordyæan mountains, [90] is evident from the constant tradition of
   the Armenians, from all past ages, down to this very day. [91] Japhet,
   [92] the father of the Europeans, and, from him, Ion, or, as they
   formerly pronounced it, Javon [93] of the Greeks, and Hammon [94] of
   the Africans, are names to be seen in Moses; and Josephus [95] and
   others observe the like footsteps in the names of other places and
   nations. And which of the poets is it, in which we do not find mention
   made of the attempt to climb the heavens? [96] Diodorus Siculus, [97]
   Strabo, [98] Tacitus, [99] Pliny, [100] Solinus, [101] speak of the
   burning of Sodom. Herodotus, [102] Diodorus, [103] Strabo, [104] Philo
   Biblius, [105] testify the ancient custom of circumcision, which is
   confirmed by those nations descended from Abraham, [106] not only
   Hebrews, but also Idumæans, [107] Ismaelites, [108] and others. [109]
   The history of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, agreeable with Moses,
   was extant of old [110] in Philo Biblius out of Sanchuniathon, [111] in
   Berosus, [112] Hecatæus, [113] Damascenus, [114] Artapanus, Eupolemus,
   Demetrius, [115] and partly in the ancient writers of the Orphic
   verses; [116] and something of it is still extant in Justin, [117] out
   of Trogus Pompeius. By almost all which is related also the history of
   Moses, and his principal acts. [118] The Orphic verses expressly
   mention his being taken out of the water, and the two tables that were
   given him by God. [119] To these we may add Polemon: [120] and several
   things about his coming out of Egypt, from the Egyptian writers,
   Manetho, Lysimachus, Chæremon. [121] Neither can any prudent man think
   it at all credible that Moses, who had so many enemies, [122] not only
   of the Egyptians, but also of many other nations, as the Idumæans,
   [123] Arabians, [124] and Phoenicians, [125] would venture to relate
   any thing concerning the creation of the world, or the original of
   things, which could be confuted by more ancient writings, or was
   contradictory to the ancient and received opinions; or that he would
   relate any thing of matters in his own time, that could be confuted by
   the testimony of many persons then alive. Diodorus Siculus, [126] and
   Strabo, [127] and Pliny, [128] Tacitus, [129] and, after them,
   Dionysius Longinus, [130] (concerning loftiness of speech), make
   mention of Moses. Besides the Talmudists, [131] Pliny [132] and
   Apulcius [133] speak of Jamnes and Mambres, who resisted Moses in
   Egypt. Some things there are in other writers, [134] and many things
   amongst the Pythagoreans, [135] about the law and rites given by Moses.
   Strabo and Justin, [136] out of Trogus, remarkably testify concerning
   the religion and righteousness of the ancient Jews: so that there seems
   to be no need of mentioning what is found, or has formerly been found,
   of Joshua and others, agreeable to the Hebrew books; seeing that
   whoever gives credit to Moses, (which it is a shame for any one to
   refuse), cannot but believe those famous miracles done by the hand of
   God; which is the principal thing here aimed at. Now, that the miracles
   of later date, such as those of Elijah, [137] Elisha, and others,
   should not be counterfeit, there is this further argument; that in
   those times Judæa was become more known, and, because of the difference
   of religion, was bated by the neighbours, who could very easily confute
   the first rise of a lie. The history of Jonah's being three days in the
   whale's belly is in Lycophron and Æneas Gazeus, [138] only under the
   name of Hercules; to advance whose fame, every thing that was great and
   noble used to be related of him, as Tacitus observes. [139] Certainly
   nothing but the manifest evidence of the history could compel Julian
   (who was as great au enemy to the Jews as to the Christians) to confess
   that there were some men inspired by the Divine Spirit amongst the
   Jews, [140] and that fire descended from heaven, and consumed the
   sacrifices of Moses and Elias. [141] And here it is worthy of
   observation, that there were not only very severe punishments
   threatened amongst the Hebrews, to any who should falsely assume the
   gift of prophecy, [142] but very many kings, [143] who by that means
   might have procured great authority to themselves; and many learned
   men, such as Esdras and others, [144] dared not to assume this honour
   to themselves; nay, some ages before Christ's time, nobody dared to do
   it. [145] Much less could so many thousand people be imposed upon, in
   avouching a constant and public miracle, I mean that of the oracle,
   [146] which shined on the high priest's breast, which is so firmly
   believed by all the Jews to have remained till the destruction of the
   first temple, that their ancestors must of necessity be well assured of
   the truth of it. [147]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [33] Eusebius has preserved them for us in his first book, chap. 10. of
   his Preparation. "The theology of the Phoenicians supposes the
   foundation of the universe to have been a dark and windy air, or the
   breath of a dark air, and a dismal chaos, covered with thick darkness;
   that these were infinite, and had no bounds for many ages. But, when
   this spirit or breath placed its desire or love on these first
   principles, and a mixture was produced thereby, this conjunction was
   called love: this was the beginning of the creation of all things; but
   the breath, or spirit, was not created; and from its embraces proceeded
   Mot, Mot, which some call Mud, others the corruption of a watery
   mixture. This was the seminary, and from hence were all things
   produced." In Moses's history we find the spirit or breath, and the
   darkness; and the Hebrew word mrchpht Merachepheth, signifies Love.
   Plutarch, Symposiac. viii. prob. 1. explaining of Plato, says, that God
   is the father of the world, not by the emission of seed, but by a
   certain generative power infused into matter; which he illustrates by
   this similitude: " The female bird is oft impregnated
   By the quick motion of the wind." And Mot, Mot, vmvt, whence the Greeks
   derive their Mothos, Mothos, signifies in Hebrew thvm Tehom, in Greek,
   Abussos, an Abyss already in motion. For Abussos, Abyssos, is in Ennius
   nothing else but Mud, if I understand him right:-- "From muddy Tartarus
   a birth gigantic sprung." This mud separated into earth and sea.
   Apollonius in the ivth of his Argonautics, "The earth's produced from
   mud." Upon which place the Scholiast says; "Zeno affirms, that the
   chaos in Hesiod is water, of which all things were made; the water
   subsiding made mud, and the mud congealing made solid earth." Now this
   Zeno was a Phoenician, a colony of whom were planted in Cittium, whence
   the Hebrews call all beyond the seas ktym Chittim. Not much different
   from which is that of Virgil, Eclogue vi. "Then earth began to harden,
   and include
   The seas within its bounds, and things to take
   Their proper forms." Numenius, cited by Porphyry, about the nymph's
   den, affirms, "That it was said by the prophet, (meaning Moses), that
   the Spirit of God was moved upon the waters;" the same expression which
   Tertullian uses concerning baptism. Now, because the Hebrew word
   mrchpht Merachepheth signifies properly the brooding of a dove upon her
   eggs, therefore it follows in Sanchuniathon, that the living creatures,
   that is, the constellations, were in that mud, as in an egg; and hence
   that spirit is called by the name of the dove: under the similitude of
   which dove, rabbi Solomon explains the word mrchpht Merachepheth.
   Nigidius, in the Scholiast of Germauicus, says, "That there was found
   an egg of a huge bigness, which, being rolled about, was cast upon the
   earth, and, after a few days, Venus, the goddess of Syria, was hatched
   thereby." Lucius Ampelius, in his book to Matrinus, says, "It is
   reported that, in the river Euphrates, a dove sat many days upon a
   fish's egg, and hatched a goddess, very kind and merciful to the life
   of man." Macrobius resembles the world to an egg, in the viith book and
   16th chap. of his Saturnalia. It is said to be "the beginning of
   generation" in the Orphic verses mentioned by Plutarch, Symposiac. xi.
   chap. 3. and Athenagoras. And hence the Syrian gods are called by
   Arnobius, "the offspring of eggs;" by which gods he means the stars.
   For it follows in the Phoenician theology, that "the mud was
   illuminated with light, whence came the sun and moon, and great and
   little stars." You see here, as in Moses, that light was before the
   sun. The word that Moses uses immediately after, I mean 'rts Erets;
   where evidently that which was dried from the water is called
   yvrhJabashah; the same Pherecydes, from the authority of the Syrians,
   expresses thus, (as we are informed by others, but particularly by
   Josephus in his first book against Appion:) "Chthonia was the name
   given to the earth after that Jupiter had honoured it." This place we
   find in Diogenes Laërtius, and others; and Anaximander calls the sea
   "that which remained of the first moisture of things." That things were
   confused before their separation, (concerning which you have the very
   words of Moses in Chalcidius's explication of Timæus), Linus informs
   us, as he was himself taught, that "In the beginning all things were
   confused." So Anaxagoras, "All things were blended together, till the
   Divine Mind separated them, and adorned and regulated that which was
   confused." And for this reason was the name mind given by Anaxagoras,
   as Phliasius assures us in his Timon; "For Anaxagoras, that hero fam'd,
   was term'd a mind, 'cause that was thought by him
   A mind, which from confusion order brought." All this came from the
   Phoenicians, who held a very ancient correspondence with the Greeks.
   The ancients say that Linus was descended from Phoenix: so Orpheus had
   his opinions from the Phoenicians, one of which was this in
   Athenagoras, "That mud proceeded from water." After which he mentions a
   great egg split into two parts, heaven and earth. From the same
   Orpheus, Timotheus the chronographer cites this passage; "The chaos was
   dark as night, in which darkness all things under this sky were
   involved; the earth could not be seen by reason of the darkness, till
   light, breaking from the sky, illuminated every creature." See the
   place in Scaliger, in the beginning of the first book of the Greek
   Chronicle of Eusebius. In that which follows of Sanchuniathon, it is
   called baaun, which is certainly the vhv bohu of Moses. And the winds,
   which are there called kolpia, Kolpia, are the same with
   qlphyhKolphijah, the voice of the mouth of God.

   [34] Megasthenes, in the fifteenth book of Strabo, expresses their
   opinion thus: "That in many things they agree with the Greeks; as that
   the world had a beginning, and will have an end; that it is of a
   spherical figure; that God, the Creator and Governor of it, penetrates
   all things; that things had different beginnings; and that the world
   was made of water." Clement has preserved the words of Megasthenes
   himself out of his third book of the Indian history, strom. i. "All
   that was of old said concerning the nature of things, we find also said
   by the philosophers who lived out of Greece, the Brachmans among the
   Indians, and they that are called Jews in Syria."

   [35] Concerning whom, see Laërtius in his Proemium, "The foundation was
   a confused chaos, from whence the four elements welt separated, and
   living creatures made." And a little after, "That as the world had a
   beginning, so it will have an end." Diodorus Siculus explains their
   opinion thus: "In the beginning of the creation of all things, the
   heavens and the earth had the same form and appearance, their natures
   being mixed together; but afterwards the parts separating from one
   another, the world received that form in which we now behold it, and
   the air a continual motion, The fiery part ascended highest, because
   the lightness of its nature caused it to tend upwards; for which reason
   the son and multitude of stars go in a continual round; the muddy and
   grosser part, together with the fluid, sunk down, by reason of its
   heaviness. And this, rolling and turning itself continually round, from
   in moisture produced the see, and from the more solid parts proceeded
   the earth, as yet very soft and miry; but when the sun began to shine
   upon it, it grew firm and hard; and the warmth causing the superficies
   of it to ferment, the moisture in many places swelling, put forth
   certain putrid substances, covered with skins; such as we now see in
   fenny moorish grounds, when, the earth being cool, the air happens to
   grow warm, not by a gradual change, but on a sudden. Afterwards the
   fore-mentioned substances, in the moist places, having received life
   from the heat in that manner, were nourished in the night by what fell
   from the cloud surrounding them, and in the day they were strengthened
   by the heat. Lastly, when these foetuses were come to their full
   growth, and the membranes by which they were inclosed broke by the
   heat, all sorts of creatures immediately appeared; those that were of a
   hotter nature became birds, and mounted up high; those that were of a
   grosser and earthy nature became creeping things, and such like
   creatures, which are confined to the earth; and those which were of a
   watery nature immediately betook themselves to a place of the like
   quality, and were called fish. Now the earth being very much dried and
   hardened, by the heat of the sun, and by the wind, was no longer able
   to bring forth living creatures, but they were afterwards begotten by
   mixing with each other. Euripides seems not to contradict this account,
   who was the scholar of Anaxagoras the philosopher; for he says thus in
   his Menalippe, "Heaven and earth at first were of one form,
   But when their different parts were separate,
   Thence sprung beasts, fowls, and all the shoals of fish,
   Nay, even men themselves." "This therefore is the account we have
   received of the original of things. And if it should seem strange to
   any one, that the earth should in the beginning have a power to bring
   forth living creatures, it may be further confirmed by what we see
   comes to pass even now. For at Thebais in Egypt, upon the river Nile's
   very much overflowing its banks, and thereby moistening the ground,
   immediately by the heat of tile sun is caused a putrefaction, out of
   which arises an incredible number of mice. Now, if after the earth has
   been thus hardened, and the air does not preserve its original
   temperature, yet some animals are notwithstanding produced; from hence,
   they say, it is manifest, that in the beginning all sorts of living
   creatures were produced out of the earth in this manner." If we add to
   this, that God is the Creator, who is called by Anaxagoras a Mind, you
   will find many things agreeing with Moses, and the tradition of the
   Phoenicians: as the heavens and earth mixed together, the motion of the
   air, the mud or abyss, the light, the stars, the separation of heaven
   and earth, and sea, the birds, the creeping things, fishes, and other
   animals; and, last of all. mankind. Macrobius, in his seventh of his
   Saturnalia, chap. 18, transcribed the following words from the
   Egyptians: "If we allow, what our adversaries affirm, that the things
   which now are had a beginning; nature first formed all sorts of animals
   perfect; and then ordained, by a perpetual law, that their succession
   should be continued by procreation. Now, that they might be made
   perfect in the beginning, we have the evidence of very many creatures
   produced perfect from the earth and the water; as in Egypt, mice; and,
   in other places, frogs, serpents, and the like." And it is with just
   reason that Aristotle prefers Anaxagoras before any a the ancient Greek
   philosophers, Metaphys. book i. chap. 3, as a sober man, when the rest
   were drunken; because they referred every thing to matter, whereas this
   man added also a cause, which acts with design; which cause Aristotle
   calls Nature, and Anaxagores Mind, which is better; and Moses, God; and
   so does Plato. See Laërtius, where he treats concerning the first
   principles of things, according to the opinion of Plato; and Appuleius
   concerning the opinions of Plato. Thales, who was before Anaxagoras,
   taught the same; as Velleius in Cicero tells us, in his first book of
   the Nature of the Gods. "For Thales Milesius, who was the first that
   inquired into such things as these, says, that water was the beginning
   of all things; and that God was that Mind which formed all things out
   of water." Where, by water he means the chaos, which Xenophon and
   others call earth; all of them well enough, if we rightly apprehend
   them.

   [36] In the verse quoted above.

   [37] In his Theogonia:-- "The rise of all things was a chaos rude,
   Whence sprung the spacious earth, n seat for gods,
   Who dwell oil high Olympus' snowy top,
   Nor are excluded from the dark abyss
   Beneath the earth; from hence the god of love,
   Most amiable of all, who frees the breasts
   Of men and gods from anxious cares and thoughts,
   And comforts each of them with soft delight; Greek writers, mention is
   made of a chaos, (signified by some under the name of an egg), and of
   the framing of From hence rose Erebus, and gloomy night.
   These produced æther, and the gladsome day,
   As pledges of their love." If we compare this with those of the
   Phoenicians now quoted, it will seem to be taken from them. For Hesiod
   lived hard by the Theban Boeotia, which was built by Cadmus the
   Phoenician. Eribos, Erebus, is the same as Moses's rv Ereb, which night
   and day follow in the hymns that are ascribed to Orpheus, "All things
   that are, sprung from a chaos vast." In the Argonautics, which go under
   the same name; "In verse he sang the original of things,
   Nature's great change; how heaven on high was fram'd,
   The earth established, and begirt with sea;
   How love created all things by his power.
   And gave to each of them his proper place." So also Epicharmus, the
   most ancient comic poet, relating an old tradition, "'Tis said that
   chaos was before the gods." And Aristophanes, in his play called the
   Birds, in a passage pre. Served by Lucian, in his Philopatris, and by
   Suidas, "First of all was chaos and night, dark Erebus and gloomy
   Tartarus; There was no earth, nor air, nor heaven, till dusky night, By
   the wind's power on the wide bosom of Erebus, brought forth an egg, Of
   which was hatch'd the god of love, (when time began), who, with his
   golden wings Fixed to his shoulders, flew like a mighty whirlwind; and
   mixing with black chaos, In Tartarus' dark shades, produced mankind,
   and brought them into light. For, before love joined all things, the
   gods themselves had no existence; But upon this conjunction, all things
   being mixed and blended, æther arose; And sea and earth, and the
   blessed abodes of the immortal gods." These appear, upon a very slight
   view, to be taken from the tradition of the Phoenicians, who held an
   ancient correspondence with the inhabitants of Attica, the most ancient
   of the Ionians. We have already spoken of Erebus. Tartarus is thvm
   Tehom, Abussos, Abyssos; and mrchpht Merachepheth, signifies Love, as
   was shewn before: to which agrees that of Parmenides, "Love was the
   first of all the gods."

   [38] The place is no further than the first book of his Metamorphoses,
   and is very well worth reading; the principal things in it being so
   very like those of Moses, and almost the same words, so that they
   afford much light to what has been already said, and are likewise much
   illustrated by it:-- "Before the sea, and earth, and heaven's high
   roof,
   Were framed, nature had but one form, one face;
   The world was then a chaos, one huge mass,
   Gross, undigested; where the seeds of things
   Lay in confusion, and disorder hurl'd,
   Without a sun to cherish with his warmth
   The rising world, or paler horned moon.
   No earth, suspended in the liquid air,
   Borne up by his own weight; no ocean vast,
   Through unknown tracts of land to cut his way;
   But sea, and earth, and air, are mix'd In one;
   The earth unsettled, sea innavigable,
   The air devoid of light; no form remain'd:
   For each resisted each, being all confin'd;
   Hot jarr'd with cold, and moist resisted dry;
   Hard, soft, light, heavy, strove with mighty force;
   Till God and nature did the strife compose,
   By parting heaven from earth, and sea from land,
   And from gross air the liquid sky dividing;
   All which, from lumpish matter once discharg'd,
   Had each his proper place, by law decreed:
   The light and fiery parts upwards ascend,
   And fill the region of the arched sky;
   The air succeeds, as next in weight, and place;
   The earth, compos'd of grosser elements,
   Was like a solid orb begirt with sea.
   Thus the well-order'd mass into due parts
   Was separated by Divine command.
   And first, the earth not stretch'd into a plain,
   But like an artificial globe condens'd;
   Upon whose surface winding rivers glide,
   And stormy seas, whose waves each shore rebound.
   Here fountains send forth streams, there one broad lake
   Fills a large plain; thus, mix'd with pools and springs,
   The gentle streams which roll along the ground,
   Are some by thirsty hollow earth absorb'd;
   Some in huge channels to the ocean bend,
   And leave their banks to beat the sandy shore.
   By the same power were plains and vales produc'd,
   And shady woods and rocky mountains rais'd.
   The heaven begirt with zones; two on the right,
   Two on the left, the torrid one between.
   The same distinction does the earth maintain,
   By care divine into five climates mark'd;
   Of which the middlemost, through heat immense,
   Has no inhabitants; two with deep snow
   Are cover'd; what remain are temperate.
   Next, between heaven and earth the air was fix'd,
   Lighter than earth, but heavier than fire;
   In this low region storms and clouds were hung,
   And hence loud thunder timorous mortals fright;
   And forked lightning, mix'd with blasts of wind.
   But the wise Framer of the world did not
   Permit them every where; because their force
   Is scarce to be resisted, (when each wind
   Prevaileth in its turn); but nature shakes,
   Their discord is so great. And first the east
   Obtains the morn, Arabia's desert land;
   And Persia's, bounded by the rising sun:
   Next, Zephyr's gentle breeze, where Phoebus dips
   Himself into the sea: then the cold north,
   At whose sharp blasts the hardy Scythians shake:
   And last the south, big with much rain and clouds.
   Above this stormy region of the air
   Was the pure æther plac'd, refin'd and clear.
   When each had thus his proper bounds decreed,
   The stars, which in their grosser mass lay hid,
   Appear'd, and shone throughout the heaven's orb.
   Then, lest a barren desert should succeed,
   Creatures of various kinds each place possess'd.
   The gods and stars celestial regions fill,
   The waters with large shoals of fishes throng'd,
   The earth with beasts, the air with birds was stock'd.
   Nothing seem'd wanting, but a mind endu'd
   With sense and reason to rule o'er the rest;
   Which was supplied by man, the seed divine
   Of him who did the frame of all things make;
   Or else when earth and sky----
   Some of the heavenly seed remain'd, which sown
   By Japhet, and with wat'ry substance mix'd,
   Was form'd into the image of the gods.
   And when all creatures to the earth were prone,
   Man had an upright form to view the heavens,
   And was commanded to behold the stars." Here you see man has the
   dominion over all inferior creatures given him; and also that he was
   made after the image of God, or of divine beings. To the same purpose
   are the words of Eurysus the Pythagorean, in his book of fortune: "His
   (that is, man's) tabernacle, or body, is like that of other creatures,
   because it is composed of the same materials; but worked by the best
   Workman, who framed it according to the pattern of himself." Where the
   word skenos is put for body, as in Wisdom, chap. ix. ver. 15. and 2
   Cor. v. 1. and 4. To which way be added that of Horace, who calls the
   soul ----"A particle of breath divine." And Virgil, "An æthereal
   sense." And that of Juvenal, sat. xv. ----"Who alone
   Have ingenuity to be esteem'd,
   As capable of things divine, and fit
   For arts; which sense we men from heav'n derive,
   And which no other creature is allowed;
   For He that framed us both did only give
   To them the breath of life, but us a soul." And those remarkable things
   relating hereto, in Plato's Phædon and Alcibiades. Cicero, in the
   second book of the nature of the gods, says thus: "For when he (that
   is, God) left all other creatures to feed on the ground, he made man
   upright, to excite him to view the heavens, to which he is related, as
   being his former habitation." And Sallust, in the beginning of the
   Catiline war: "All men, that desire to exceed other animals, ought
   earnestly to endeavour not to pass away their days in silence, like the
   beasts, which nature has made prone, and slaves to their bellies." And
   Pliny, b. ii. c. 20. "The never enough to be admired Hipparchus; than
   whom none more acknowledged the relation betwixt man and the stars, and
   who considered our souls as a part of the heavens."

   [39] "Man's reason is derived from that of God."

   [40] Amelius the Platonic: "And this is that reason, or word, by which
   all things that ever were, were made; according to the opinion of
   Heraclitus. That very Word, or Reason, the barbarian means, which set
   all things in order in the beginning, and which was with God before
   that order, and by which every thing was made, and in which was every
   creature; the fountain of life and being." The barbarian he here speaks
   of is St. John the evangelist, a little later than whose time Amelius
   lived. Eusebius has preserved his words in the eleventh book and
   nineteenth chapter of his Preparation; and Cyril in his eighth book
   against Julian. St. Austin mentions the same place of Amelius, in his
   tenth book, and 29th chapter, of tile city of God, and in the eighth
   book of his confessions. And Tertullian against the Gentiles: "It is
   evident (says he) that with your wise men, the Logos, Logos, Word or
   Reason, was the Maker of the universe; for Zeno would have this Word to
   he the Creator, by whom all things were disposed in their formation."
   This place of Zeno was in his book peri ousias, concerning being, where
   he calls the to poioun, the efficient cause, Logos, the Word, or
   Reason; and in this he was followed by Cleanthes, Chrysippus,
   Archedemus, and Posidonius, as we are told by Laërtius in his life of
   Zeno. Seneca, in his lxvth epistle, calls it the "Reason which formeth
   every thing." And Chalcidius to Timæus says, "That the reason of God is
   God himself, who has a regard to human affairs, and who is the cause of
   men's living well and happily, if they do not neglect the gift bestowed
   on them by the most high God." And in another place, speaking of Moses,
   he has these words: Who is clearly of opinion, "that the heaven and
   earth were made by the Divine Wisdom preceding: and that then the
   Divine Wisdom was the foundation of the universe."

   [41] The verses are these:-- "I swear by that first word the Father
   spake,
   When the foundation of the earth was laid." They are extant in the
   admonition to the Greeks, among the works of Julian: as also these:-- "
   I speak to those I ought; begone, profane,
   Away: but, O Musæus, hearken thou,
   Thou offspring of the moon; I speak the truth:
   Let not vain thoughts the comfort of thy life
   Destroy; the Divine Reason strictly view,
   And fix it in thy mind to imitate;
   Behold the Great Creator of the world,
   Who's only perfect, and did all things make,
   And is in all; though we with mortal eyes
   Cannot discern him; but he looks on us." These we find in the
   admonition to the Greeks; as also in a book concerning the monarchy of
   the world, in the works of Justin Martyr; in Clemens Alexandrinus,
   Strom. 5. and in the xiiith book of Eusebius's Gospel Preparation, from
   Aristobulus.

   [42] Of whom Laërtitis says, "That he affirmed the sun to be a great
   heap of fire." And he that wrote the opinions of the philosophers has
   these words: "Empedocles said, that the æther was first separated, then
   the fire, and after that the earth; the superficies of which being
   compressed by its violent motion, the water burst out; from which the
   air was exhaled; that the heavens were composed of æther, and the sun
   of fire." And, chap. 20. Empedocles affirms, "There are two suns, one
   the original, and the other the apparent." And Philolaus, as we there
   also read, says, "That the sun is of the same nature as glass,
   receiving its splendour from the fire that is in the world, and
   transmitting its light to us." Anaxagoras, Democritus, Metrodorus,
   affirmed the sun to be a certain mass of fire; as you find it in the
   same place. And Democritus shews, that these were the roost ancient
   opinions, as Laërtius relates.

   [43] Aratus:-- "As far as the dire gulf Eridanus,
   Under the footstool of the gods extends."

   [44] Catullus, the interpreter of Callimachus, introduces Berenice's
   hair, speaking after this manner: "Tho' in the night the gods upon me
   tread."

   [45] As we see in Diogenes Laërtius; and Herodotus and Leander assert
   him to have been originally a Phoenician.

   [46] In his hymn to night: "I sing the night, parent of men and gods."

   [47] Whose verses upon this subject are cited above.

   [48] The Numidians in Libya "reckon their time not by days, but by
   nights," says Nicolaus Damascenes: and Tacitus affirms of the Germans,
   "that they do not, like us, compute the number of the days, but of the
   nights; so they date their decrees and citations; night seems to begin
   the day with them." See the Speculum Saxonicum, book i. art. 3, 67. and
   in other places. So likewise the learned Lindenbrogius, upon the word
   Night, in his Vocabulary of the German laws. The neighbouring people of
   Bohemia and Poland preserve this custom to this very day, and the Gauls
   used it of old. Cæsar, in his sixth book of the Gallic war, says, "That
   all their distances of time were reckoned, not by the number of days,
   but of nights." And Pliny, concerning the druids, in the sixteenth book
   of his natural history, says, "The moon with them began their months
   and years." It is a known custom amongst the Hebrews. Gellius, in his
   third book, chap. ii. adds the Athenians, who in this matter were the
   scholars of the Phoenicians.

   [49] His words are quoted above, which are to be found in Laërtius, the
   writer of the opinions of the philosophers, and others: as are also the
   verses of Timon concerning his opinion.

   [50] In the beginning of his Phænomena:-- "Begin with Jupiter, whose
   essence is
   Ineffable by mortal man, whose presence
   Does all things fill; assemblies, courts, and marts,
   The deep abyss, and ports, are fill'd with him.
   We all enjoy him, all his offspring are,
   Whose nature is benign to man; who stirs
   Them up to work, spewing the good of life.
   'Tis he appoints the time to plough and sow,
   And reap the fruitful harvest.----
   'Twas he that in the heavens fix'd the stars,
   Allotting each his place, to teach the year,
   And to declare the fate us men attends;
   That all things are by certain laws decreed.
   Him therefore let us first and last appease,
   O Father, the great help we mortals have." That by Jupiter we are here
   to understand God, the true Maker of the world, and all things in it,
   St. Paul chews us in the seventeenth chapter of the Acts, ver. 28. And
   we learn from Lactantius, that Ovid ended his Phænomena with these
   verses:-- "Such, both in number and in form, did God
   Upon the heavens place, and give in charge
   To enlighten the thick darkness of the night." And Chalcidius to Timæus
   "To which thing the Hebrews agree, who affirm that God was the adorner
   of the world, and appointed the sun to rule the day, and the moon to
   govern the night; and so disposed the rest of the stars, as to limit
   the times and seasons of the year, and to be signs of the productions
   of things."

   [51] In the sixth book of his Æneid, which Servius says was composed
   from many of the ancient Greek writings:-- "At first the heav'n and
   earth, and wat'ry seas,
   The moon's bright orb, and all the glittering stars,
   Were fed and nourish'd by a Power Divine:
   For the whole world is acted by a sun,
   Which throughly penetrates it: whence mankind,
   And beasts, and birds, have their original;
   And monsters in the deep produc'd: the seed
   Of each is a divine and heavenly flame." Which may be explained by
   those in his Georgics, iv. "By such examples taught, and by such marks,
   Some have affirm'd that bees themselves partake
   Of the celestial mind, and breath ethereal;
   For God pervades the sea, and earth, and heavens;
   Whence cattle, herds, men, and all kinds of beasts,
   Derive the slender breath of fleeting life."

   [52] In his poem upon Labour and Days:-- "Then ordered Mulciber,
   without delay,
   To mix the earth and water, and infuse
   A human voice."

   [53] Iliad, viii. "You all to earth and water must return." For all
   things return from whence they came. Euripides in his Hipsipyle (as
   Stobæus tells us in the title) uses this argument, for bearing
   patiently the events of things; which is transcribed by Tully in his
   third book of Tusculan questions:-- ----"All which in vain us mortals
   vex:
   Earth must return to earth; for fate ordains
   That life, like corn, must be cut off in all." To the same purpose,
   Euripides in his Supplicants:-- "Permit the dead to be entomb'd in
   earth,
   From whence we all into this body came;
   And when we die, the spirit goes to air,
   To earth the body; for we can possess
   Life only for a time; the earth demands
   It back again." All which, you see, exactly agree with Moses, Gen. iii.
   19. and Solomon, Eccl. xii. 7.

   [54] Who, in his Scazon, calls man Prometheus's clay. Of this clay we
   find mention made in Juvenal and Martial. To which we may add this
   place of Censorinus: "Democritus, the Abderite, was of opinion, that
   men were first formed of clay and water; and Epicurus was much of the
   same mind."

   [55] In his first dissertation: "Notwithstanding the great discord,
   confusion, and debates that are amongst men; the whole world agree in
   this one constant law and opinion, that God is the sole King and Father
   of all; but that there are many other gods, who are Ida sons, and share
   in his government. This is affirmed by the Greek and the barbarian; by
   him who dwells in the continent, and by hint who lives on the
   sea-shore; by the wise and by the foolish." To which may be added those
   places cited in the second book attar and peace, chap. xx. § 45. And
   that of Antisthenes, related by Tully in his first book of the nature
   of the gods: "that there are many vulgar gods, but there is but one
   natural God." And Lactantius, book i. chap. 5. adds, from the same
   Antisthenes, that he is "The Maker of the whole world." So likewise
   Sophocles:-- "There is really but one God,
   The Maker of heaven and earth,
   And sea, and winds." To which may be added that place of Varro, cited
   by St. Austin, in the fourth book, and chap. 31. of his City of God.

   [56] Against Appion, about the cud of the second book, where he says,
   "There is no city, Greek or barbarian, in which the custom of resting
   on the seventh day is not preserved, as it is amongst the Jews."

   [57] Concerning the seventh day: "It is a festival celebrated not only
   in one city or country, but throughout the whole world."

   [58] "The seventh day is sacred to the Jews."

   [59] Who, in his Strom. v. quotes out of Hesiod, "that the seventh day
   was sacred." And the like out of Homer and Callimachus. To which may be
   subjoined what Eusebius has taken out of Aristobulus, book xiii. chap.
   12. "Theophilas Antiochenus, b. ii. to Autolychus, concerning the
   seventh day, which is distinguished by all men." And Suetonius, in his
   Tiberius, xxxii. "Diogenes the grammarian uses to dispute at Rhodes
   upon the sabbath day."--(The seventh day of the month ought not to be
   confounded with the last day of the week. See what John Selden has
   remarked upon this subject, in his book of the laws of nature and
   nations, book chap. 17. Le Clerc.

   [60] Who tells us in his Paralogist, "That boys were used to play on
   the seventh day."

   [61] As is evident by the names of the days among the different nations
   of the Celtæ, viz. Germans, Gauls, and Britons. Helmoldus tells us the
   same of the Sclavonians, book i. chap. 84.

   [62] Book iii. chap. 13. speaking of the Indians.

   [63] Book xxxvii. "The day called Saturn's." Where he adds, that the
   custom of computing the time by weeks was derived from the Egyptians to
   all mankind. And that this was not a new, but a very ancient custom,
   Herodotus tells us in his second book: to which may be added Isidore
   concerning the Romans, book v. ch. 30. and 33.

   [64] See the Oracle, and Orpheus's verses in Scaliger's Prolegomena to
   his emendation of times.--(I suspect that the foundation of weeks was
   rather from the seven planets, than from the creation of the world in
   seven days. Le Clerc.)

   [65] See what we have said of this matter, book ii. sect. 12.
   concerning the right of war, and the notes belonging to it.

   [66] Whose opinion Diodorus Siculus thus relates: "The first men lived
   very hardy, before the conveniencies of life were found out; being
   accustomed to go naked, and wanting dwellings and fires; and being
   wholly ignorant of the food of civilized nations." And Plato, in his
   politics: "God their governor fed them, being their keeper; as man, who
   is a more divine creature, feeds the inferior creatures." And a little
   after: "They fed naked and without garments in the open air." And
   Dicearchus the peripatetic, cited both by Porphyry, in his fourth book
   against eating living creatures, and to the same sense by Varro,
   concerning country affairs: "The ancients, who were nearest to the
   gods, were of an excellent disposition, and led so good lives, that
   they were called a golden race."

   [67] Book xv. where he brings in Calanus the Indian speaking thus: "Of
   old we met every where with barley, wheat, and meal, as we do
   now-a-days with dust. The fountains flowed, some with water, some with
   milk; and likewise some with honey, some with wine, and some with oil.
   But men, through fullness and plenty, fell into wickedness; which
   condition Jupiter abhorring, altered the state of things, and ordered
   them a life of labour."

   [68] In his guide to the doubting, part iii. chap. 29.

   [69] In those places which Philo Biblius has translated out of
   Sanchuniathon. The Greek word protogonos, first-born, is the same with
   the Hebrew 'dm Adam; and the Greek word aion, Age, is the same with the
   Hebrew word chvh Chavah, Eve. The first men found out the fruit of
   trees. And in the most ancient Greek mysteries, they cried out Heua,
   Eva, and at the same time shewed a serpent. Which is mentioned by
   Hesychius, Clemens in his exhortations, and Plutarch in the life of
   Alexander. Chalcidius, to Timæus, has these words: "That, as Moses
   says, God forbade the first man to eat the fruit of those trees by
   which the knowledge of good and evil should steal into their minds."
   And in another place; "To this the Hebrews agree, when they say, that
   God gave to man a soul by a divine breath, which they call reason, or a
   rational soul; but to dumb creatures, and wild beasts of the forest,
   one void of reason: the living creatures and beasts being, by the
   command of God, scattered over the face of the earth; amongst which was
   that serpent who, by his evil persuasions, deceived the first of
   mankind."

   [70] See, amongst others, Ferdinand Mendesius de Pinto.

   [71] What Simplicius relates out of Porphyry, comment, xvi. upon book
   ii. concerning the heavens, agrees exactly with this number; that the
   observations collected at Babylon, which Callisthenes sent to
   Aristotle, were to that time cm to CI? I? CCCCIII. [1903], which is not
   far from the flute of the deluge.

   [72] Josephus, in the first book, chap. 4, of his ancient history,
   quotes the testimony of all these writers, whose books were extant in
   his time; and besides these, Acusilaus, Ephorus, and Nicolaus
   Damascenus. Servius, in his notes upon the eighth book of Virgil's
   Æneid, remarks, that the people of Arcadia lived to three hundred
   years.

   [73] In his Laconics, he mentions the bones of men, of a more than
   ordinary bigness, which were shewn in the temple of Æsculapius at the
   city of Asepus: and, in the first of his Eliacs, of a bone taken out of
   the sea, which aforetime was kept at Piso, and thought to have been one
   of Pelops's.

   [74] In the beginning of his Heroics, he says, that many bodies of
   giants were discovered in Pallene, by showers of rain and earthquakes.

   [75] Book vii. chap. 16. "Upon the bursting of a mountain in Crete by
   an earthquake, there was found a body standing upright, which was
   reported by some to have been the body of Orion, by others the body of
   Eetion. Orestes's body, when it was commanded by the oracle to be
   digged up, is reported to have been seven cubits long. And, almost a
   thousand years ago, the poet Homer continually complained that men's
   bodies were less than of old." And Solinus, chap. i. "Were not all who
   were born in that age less than their parents? And the story of
   Orestes's funeral testifies the bigness of the ancients, whose bones,
   when they were digged up in the fifty-eighth Olympiad, at Tegea, by the
   advice of the oracle, are related to have been seven cubits in length.
   And other writings, which give a credible relation of ancient matters,
   affirm this, that in the war of Crete, when the rivers had been so high
   as to overflow and break down their banks, after the flood was abated,
   upon the cleaving of the earth there was found a human body of three
   and thirty feet long; which L. Flaccus the legate, and Metellus
   himself, being very desirous of seeing, were much surprised to have the
   satisfaction of seeing what they did not believe when they heard." See
   Austin's fifteenth book, chap. 11. of the city of Cod, concerning the
   cheek tooth of a man, which he himself saw.

   [76] Josephus, book v. chap. 2. of his ancient history; "There remains
   to this day some of the race of the giants, who, by reason of the bulk
   and figure of their bodies, so different from other men, are wonderful
   to see or hear of: their bones are now shewn, far exceeding the belief
   of the vulgar." Gabinius, in his history of Mauritania, said, that
   Antæus's bones were found by Sertorius, which, joined together, were
   sixty cubits long. Phlegon Trallianus, in his ninth chapter of wonders,
   mentions the digging up of the head of Ida, which was three times as
   big as that of an ordinary woman. And he adds also, that there were
   many bodies found in Dalmatia, whose arms exceeded sixteen cubits. And
   the same man relates out of Theopompus, that there were found in the
   Cimmerian Bosphorus a heap of human bones twenty-four cubits in length.
   And there is extant a book of the same Phlegon, concerning long life,
   which is worth reading.--(That in many places of old time, as the
   present, there were men of a very large stature, or such as exceeded
   others some few feet, is not very hard to believe; but that they should
   all of them have been bigger, I can no more believe, than that the
   trees were taller, or the channels of the rivers deeper. There is the
   same proportion between all these, and things of the like kind, now, as
   there was formerly, they answering to one another, so that there is no
   reason to think they have undergone any change. See Theodore Riekius's
   oration about giants. Le Clerc.)

   [77] In his epithalamium on Peleus and Thetis:--

   "But when the earth was stain'd with wickedness
   And lust, and justice fled from every breast,
   Then brethren vilely shed each others blood,
   And parents ceas'd to mourn their children's death;
   The father wish'd the funeral of his soul;
   The son to enjoy the father's relic wish'd:
   The impious mother, yielding to the child,
   Fear'd not to stain the temple of the gods.
   Thus right and wrong, by furious passion mix'd,
   Drove from us the divine propitious mind."

   [78] Of this, see those excellent things said by Plutarch in his Isis;
   Maximus Tyrius in his first and sixteenth dissertations, and Julian's
   hymn to the sun. The name of angels is used, when they treat of this
   matter, not only by the Greek interpreters of the Old Testament, but
   also by Labeus, Aristides, Porphyry, Jamblicus, Chalcidius, and by
   Hostanes, who was older than any of them, quoted by Minutius: the
   fore-mentioned Chalcidius relates an assertion of Heraclitus, that such
   as deserved it were forewarned by the instruction of the divine powers.

   [79] Homer, Iliad ix. and Hesiod, in his Labours. To this may be
   referred the wars of the gods, mentioned by Plato in his second
   republic; and those distinct and separate governments taken notice of
   by the same Plato, in his third book of laws.

   [80] See the first book of Ovid's metamorphoses, and the fourth book of
   Lucan, and Seneca's third book of natural questions, quest. 30. where
   he says concerning the deluge, "That the beasts also perished, into
   whose nature men were degenerated."

   [81] Thus Censorinus: "Now I come to treat of that space of time which
   Varro calls historical. For he makes three distinctions of time; the
   first from the creation of man to the first flood, which, because we
   are ignorant of it, is called the unknown. The second, from the first
   flood to the first Olympiad; which is called the fabulous, because of
   the many fabulous stories related in it. The third, from the first
   Olympiad to our time, which is called the historical, because the
   things done in it are related in a true history." The time which Varro
   calls unknown, the Hebrew rabbins, call void. Philo, in his book of the
   eternity of the world, remarks, that the shells found on the mountains
   are a sign of the universal deluge.

   [82] Concerning whom Josephus says thus, in his first book against
   Appion "This Berosus, following the most ancient writings, relates, in
   the same manner as Moses, the history of the flood, the destruction of
   mankind, the ark or chest in which Noah, the father of mankind, was
   preserved, by its resting on the top of the mountains of Armenia."
   After having related the history of the deluge, Berosus adds these
   words, which we find in the same Josephus, book i. and chap. 4. of his
   ancient history: "It is reported that part of the ship now remains in
   Armenia, on the Gordyæan mountains, and that some bring pitch from
   thence, which they use for a charm."

   [83] Eusebius has preserved the place in the ninth book of his
   preparation, chap. 12. and Cyril in his first book against Julian.
   "After whom reigned many others, and then Sisithrus, to whom Saturn
   signified there should be an abundance of rain on the fifteenth day of
   the month Desius, and commanded him to lay up all his writings in
   Heliopolis. a city of the Sipparians; which when Sisithrus had done, he
   sailed immediately into Armenia, and found it true as the god had
   declared to him. On the third day after the waters abated, he sent out
   birds to try if the water was gone off any part of the earth; but they
   finding a vest sea, and having no where to rest, returned back to
   Sisithrus: in the same manner did others: and again the third time,
   (when their wings were daubed with mud). Then the gods took him from
   among men; and the ship came into Armenia, the wood of which the people
   there use for a charm." Sisithrus, and Ogyges, and Deucalion, are all
   names signifying the same thing in other languages, as Noah does in the
   Hebrew, in which Moses wrote; who so expressed proper names, that the
   Hebrews might understand the meaning of them: for instance, Alexander
   the historian, writing Isaac in Greek, calls him Gelota, Laughter, as
   we learn from Eusebius: and many such like we meet with among the
   historians as in Philo concerning rewards and punishments; "The Greeks
   call him Deucalion, the Chaldeans Noach, in whose time the great flood
   happened." It is the tradition of the Egyptians, an Diodorus testifies
   in his first book, that the universal deluge was that of Deucalion.
   Pliny says it reached as far as Italy, book iii. chap. 14. But, to
   return to the translation of names into other languages, there is a
   remarkable place in Plato's Critias concerning it: "Upon the entrance
   of this discourse, it may be necessary (says he) to premise the reason,
   lest you be surprised when you hear the names of barbarians in Greek.
   When Solon put this relation into verse, he inquired Into the
   signification of the names, and found, that the first Egyptians, who
   wrote of these matters, translated them into their own language; and he
   likewise, searching out their true meaning, turned them into our
   language." The words of Abydenus agree with those of Alexander the
   historian, which Cyril has preserved in his fore-mentioned first book
   against Julian: "After the death of Otiartes, his son Xisuthrus reigned
   eighteen years, in whose time, they say, the great deluge was. It is
   reported that Xisuthrus was preserved by Saturn's foretelling him what
   was to come; and that it was convenient for him to build an ark, that
   birds and creeping things, and beasts, might sail with him in it." The
   most high God is named by the Assyrians and other nations from that
   particular star of the seven (to use Tacitus's words) by which mankind
   are governed, which is moved in the highest orb, and with the greatest
   force: or certainly the Syriac word, 'yl Il, which signifies God, was
   therefore translated Kronos Kronos, by the Greek interpreters, because
   he was called 'yl Il by the Syrians. Philo Biblius, the interpreter of
   Sanchuniathon, hath these words: "Ilus, who is called Saturn." He is
   quoted by Eusebius: in whom it immediately follows from the same Philo,
   "that Kronos was the same the Phoenicians call Israel;" but the mistake
   was in the transcriber, who put Israel Israel, for hil Il, which many
   times amongst the Greek Christians is the contraction of Israel;
   whereas hil is, as we have observed, what the Syrians call 'yl Il, and
   the Hebrews 'l El.-- (It ought not to be overlooked, that in this
   history, Deucalion, who was the same person as Noah, is called aner
   purrhas, that is, 'ys 'dmh a man of the earth, that is, a husbandman.
   Sac my notes upon Gen. ix. 20. Le Clerc.)

   [84] In his book where he inquires which have most cunning, water or
   land animals: "They say Deucalion's dove, which he sent out of the ark,
   discovered at its return that the storms were abated, and the heavens
   clear." It is to be observed, both in this place of Plutarch's, and in
   that of Alexander the historian, as well as in the book of Nicolaus
   Damascenes, and the writers made use of by Theophilus Antiochenes in
   his third book, that the Greek word larnax lrnax, answers to the Hebrew
   word tvh tebah, and so Josephus translates it.

   [85] In his book concerning the goddess of Syria, where having begun to
   treat of the very ancient temple of Hierapolis, he adds: "They say this
   temple was founded by Deucalion, the Scythian, that Deucalion in whose
   days the flood of water happened. I have heard in Greece the story of
   this Deucalion from the Greeks themselves, which is thus: the present
   generation of men is not the original one, for all that generation
   perished; and the men which now are came from a second stock, the whole
   multitude of them descended from Deucalion. Now, concerning the first
   race of men, they relate thus: they were very obstinate, and did very
   wicked things; and had no regard to oaths, had no hospitality or
   charity in them; upon which account many calamities befel them. For on
   a sudden the earth sent forth abundance of water, great showers of rain
   fell, the rivers overflowed exceedingly, and the sea overspread the
   earth, so that all was turned into water, and every man perished;
   Deucalion was only saved alive, to raise up another generation, because
   of prudence and piety. And he was preserved in this manner: he, and his
   wives, and his children, entered into a large ark, which he had
   prepared; and after them went in bears, and horses, and lions, and
   serpents, and all other kinds of living creatures that fed upon the
   earth, two and two; he received them all in, neither did they hurt him,
   but were very familiar with him, by a divine influence. Thus they
   sailed in the same ark, as long as the water remained on the earth.
   This is the account the Greeks give of Deucalion. Now concerning what
   happened afterwards: There was a strange story related by the
   inhabitants of Hierapolis, of a great hole in the earth in that
   country, which received all the water; after which, Deucalion built an
   altar, and reared a temple to Juno over the hole. I saw the hole
   myself; it is but a small one, under the temple; whether it was larger
   formerly, I know not; I am sure this which I saw was but small. To
   preserve this story, they perform this ceremony: twice every year water
   is brought from the sea into the temple; and not only the priests, but
   all the people of Syria and Arabia, fetch it; many go even from the
   river Euphrates as far as tile sea to fetch water, which they pour out
   in the temple, and it goes into the hole, which, though it be but
   small, holds a vast quantity of water: when they do this, they say it
   was a rite instituted by Deucalion, in memory of that calamity, and his
   preservation. This is the ancient story of this temple."

   [86] Eusebius relates his words in his ninth book of the Gospel
   Preparation, chap. 19. "At the deluge, the man and his children that
   escaped came out of Armenia, being driven from his own country by the
   inhabitants; and, having passed through the country between, went into
   the mountainous part of Syria, which was then uninhabited."

   [87] Josephus gives us his words, out of the ninety-sixth book of his
   universal history, in the fore-cited place: "There is above the city
   Minyas, (which Strabo and Pliny call Milyas), a huge mountain in
   Armenia called Batis, on which they say a great many were saved from
   the flood, particularly one, who was carried to the top of it by an
   ark; the relics of the wood of which were preserved a great while: I
   believe it was the same man that Moses, the lawgiver of the Jews,
   mentions in his history." To these writers we may add Jerom the
   Egyptian, who wrote the affairs of Phoenicia and Mnaseas, mentioned by
   Josephus. And perhaps Eupolemus, which Eusebius quotes out of Alexander
   the historian, in his Gospel Preparation, book ix. chap. 17.

   [88] See Josephus Acosta, and Antonius Herrera.

   [89] Book v. chap. xiii. Mela and Solinus agree with Pliny. Compare it
   with that which we have quoted out of Abydenus.

   [90] Which Moses calls Ararath; the Chaldean interpreters translate it
   Kardu; Josephus, Cordiæan; Curtius, Cordæan; Strabo writes it Gordiæan,
   book xvi. and Pliny, book vi. and Ptolemæus.--(These, and what follows
   in relation to the sacred geography and the founders of nations, since
   these of Grotius were published, are with great pains, and much more
   accuracy, searched into by Sam. Bochart, in his sacred geography, which
   add weight to Grotius's arguments. Le Clerc.)

   [91] Theophilus Antiochenus says, in his third book, that the relics of
   the ark were shewn in his time. And Epiphanius, against the Nazarites:
   "The relics of Noah's ark are shewn at this time, in the region of the
   Cordiæans:" and Chrysostom, in his oration of perfect love. And
   Isidore, book xiv. chap. 8. of his antiquities: "Ararath, a mountain in
   Armenia, on which, histories testify the ark rested after the deluge;
   where at this day are to be seen some marks of the wood." We may add
   the words out of Haiton the Armenian, ch. 9. "There is a mountain in
   Armenia, higher than any other in the whole world, which is commonly
   called Ararath, on the top of which mountain the ark first rested after
   the deluge." See the Nubian geographer, and Benjamin's Itinerary.

   [92] It is the very same word ypht Japheth; for the same letter ph is
   by some pronounced like p p, by others ph ph; and the like difference
   is now preserved among the Germans and Dutch. Jerom upon Daniel has
   observed this of the Hebrew letter.

   [93] For iaones iaones is often found amongst the ancient writers. The
   Persian in Aristophanes's play, called Acharnenses, pronounces it
   iaonau iaonau. Now it was a very ancient custom to put a digamma
   between two vowels, which afterwards began to be wrote by a V, formerly
   thus, F. In like manner, that which was auos auos, is now aos aos, and
   heos eos, tauos tauos, a peacock; tous Ellenas kalousin iaunas, the
   Greeks are called iaunas. Suidas.

   [94] the Greeks sometimes render the Hebrew letter ch Cheth by an
   aspirate, and sometimes omit it; as chtsrmvt Chatzarmuth,
   AdramuttosAdramyttos, or Hadramuttos Hadramyttos; chkmt Chachmoth,
   achmoth Achmuth, in Irenæus and others: chvrh Chabrah, a companion, by
   the ancient Greeks abra abra; chyh Chajah, aion aion, an age. hnh Hanno
   or Anno; chnyvl Hannibal or Annibal, chtsrvl Hasdrubal or Asdrubal;
   chsym Chashim; axoumitai axoumitai, for on on is a Greek ending. This
   person is transformed, not only by the Lybians, but also by many other
   nations, into the star Jupiter, as a god. Lucan, book ix. "Jupiter
   Ammon is the only god
   Amongst the happy Arabs, and amongst
   The Indians and Ethiopians." And the sacred scripture puts Egypt
   amongst them. Psalm lxxviii. 51. cv. 23, 27. cvi. 22. Jerom, in his
   Hebrew traditions on Genesis, has these words, "From whom Egypt, at
   this very day, is called the country of Ham, in the Egyptian language."

   [95] He says, Gomareis Gomareis, the Galatians, is derived from gmr
   Gomar, where Pliny's town Comara is. The people of Comara we find in
   the first book of Mela. The Scythians are derived from mgvgMagog, by
   whom the city Scythopolis in Syria was built, and the other city Magog;
   Pliny, book v. chap. 23. which is called by others Hierapolis and
   Bambyce. It is evident that the Medes are derived from mdy Medi; and,
   as we have already observed, Javones, Iaones, Iones, from yvzJaven.
   Josephus says, the Iberians in Asia come from tvl Thebal, in the
   neighbourhood of whom Ptolemy places the city of Thabal, as preserving
   the marks of its ancient original. The city Mazaca, mentioned by him,
   comes from msd Masach, which we find in Strabo, book xii. and in Pliny,
   book vi. 3. and in Ammianus Marcellinus, book xx. Add to this the
   Moschi mentioned by Strabo, book xi. and in the first and third book of
   Mela, whom Pliny calls Moscheni, book vi. chap. 9. and we find in them
   and Pliny the Moschican mountains. Josephus and others agree, that the
   Thracians were derived from tyrs Tiras, and the word itself shews it;
   especially if we observe, that the Greek letter x x at first answered
   to the Syriac letter s s, as the place of it shews. Concerning those
   that are derived from 'skntsAschanaz, the place is corrupt in Josephus;
   but without doubt Ascania, a part of Phrygia and Mytia, mentioned in
   Homer, comes from thence; concerning which see Strabo, book xii. and
   Pliny, book v. chap. 32. The Ascanian lake, and the river flowing from
   it, we find in Strabo, book xiv. and in Pliny's fore-cited fifth book,
   chap. 32. The Ascanian harbour is in Pliny, book v. chap. 30. and the
   Ascanian islands also, book iv. chap. 12. and book v. chap. 31.
   Josephus says, the Paphlagonians are derived from ryphchRiphath, by
   some called Riphatæans, where Mela, in his first book, puts the
   Riphacians. The same Josephus tells us, that the aioleis aioleis, come
   from 'lysh Alishah; and the Jerusalem paraphrast agrees with him, in
   naming the Greeks Æolians, putting the part for the whole; nor is it
   much unlike Hella, the name of the country. The same Josephus also
   says, that the Cilicians are derived from trsys Tarshish, and proves it
   from the city Tarsus; for it happens in many places, that the names of
   the people are derived from the names of cities. We have before hinted
   that Kittion Kittion, is derived from ktymChitim. The Ethiopians are
   called Chusæans by themselves and their neighbours, from kvsChush, now;
   as Josephus observed they were in his time; from whence there is a
   river so called by Ptolemy; and, in the Arabian geographer, there are
   two cities which retain the same name. So likewise Misor in Philo
   Biblius is derived from mtsrymMitzraim; those which the Greeks call
   Egyptians, being called by themselves and their neighbours Mesori; and
   the name of one of their months is Mesiri, Mesiri. Cedrenus calls the
   country itself Mestsa, and Josephus rightly conjectures, that the river
   in Mauritania is derived from phyt Phut. Pliny mentions the same river,
   book v. c. 1. "Phut, and the neighbouring Phutensian country, is so
   called to this day." Jerom, in his Hebrew traditions on Genesis, says,
   it is not far from Fesa, the name remaining even now. The chnv Chenaan,
   in Moses, is contracted by Sanchuniathon, and from him by Philo
   Biblius, into Chna Chua; you will find it in Eusebius's Preparation,
   book i. chap. 10. and the country is called so. Stephanus, of cities,
   says, "Chna was so called by the Phoenicians." And St. Austin, in his
   book of expositions on the epistle to the Romans, says, in his time, if
   the country people that lived at Hippo were asked who they were, they
   answered, Canaanites. And in that place of Eupolemus, cited by
   Eusebius, Prepar. ix. 17. the Canaanites are called Mestraimites.
   Ptolemy's Regema, in Arabia Felix, is derived from rmh Raamah, by
   changing into g g, as in Gomorrha and other words. Josephus deduces the
   Sabins from sv' Saba, a known nation, whose chief city Strabo says,
   book xvi. was Saba, where Josephus places the Sabateni, from svth
   Sabatah; there Pliny places the city Sobotale, book vi. chap. 28. The
   word lhvym Lehabim, is not much different from the name of the Lybians;
   nor the word nphtchymNephathim from Nepata, a city of Ethiopia,
   mentioned by Pliny, book vi. chap. 29. Nor Ptolemy's Nepata, or the
   Pharusi in Pliny, book v. chap. 8. from phtsrysymPhatstrasim, the same
   as Ptolemy's Phaurusians in Ethiopia. The city Sidon, famous in all
   poets and historians, comes from tsydvTridon. And Ptolemy's town
   Gerasa, from grgsyGergashi: and Arca, a city of the Phoenicians,
   mentioned by Ptolemy and Pliny, book v. ch.18. from rqy Arki. And
   Aradus, an island mentioned in Strabo, book xvi. and Pliny, book v.
   chap. 20. and Ptolemy in Syria, from 'rvdyArodi; and Amathus of Arabia,
   mentioned by Herodotus in his Euterpe and Thalia, from hmchy Hamathi;
   and the Elymites, neighbours to the Medes, from ylm Eelim, mentioned by
   Strabo, book xvi. Pliny, book vi. ch. 25. and Livy, book xxxvii. Their
   descendants in Phrygia are called Elymites by Athenæus, book iv. Every
   one knows, that the Assyrians are derived from 'svr Ashur, as the
   Lydians are from lvdLud, from whence comes. the Latin word Ludi. Those
   which by the Greeks are called Syrians, from the city tsvr Tzur, are
   called Aramites to this day, from 'rm Aram: for ts tz is sometimes
   translated t t, and sometimes s s,; whence the city tsvr Tzur, which
   the Greeks call Tyre, is by Ennius called Sarra, and by others Sina and
   Tina. Strabo, book xvi. towards the end: "The poet mentions the
   Arimites, whom Possidonius would have us to understand, not to be any
   part of Syria, or Cilicia, or any other country, but Syria itself." And
   again, book xiii. " Some mean Syrians by Arimites, whom they now call
   Aramites." And in the first book: "For those we call Syrians, are by
   themselves called Aramites." "The country Ausanitis, mentioned by the
   Seventy in Job, is derived from hvts Hutz. Aristæus calls it Austias.
   And the city Cholla, placed by Ptolemy in Syria, from chvl Chol; and
   the city Gindarus in Ptolemy, from nhr Geher; and the Gindaren people
   in Pliny, book v. chap. 23. in Coelo-Syria. And the mountain Masius,
   not far from Nisibus, mentioned by Strabo, book xi. and Ptolemy, in
   Mesopotamia, is derived from ms Mash. The names yqtvJoktan, and
   chtsrmvchHatzoramuth, and hvln Holan, are represented by the Arabian
   geographers under the names of Balsatjaktan, Hadramuth, and Chaulan; as
   the learned Capell observes. The river Ophar, and the people called
   Opharites, near Mæotis, Pliny, book vi. 7. If I mistake not, retain the
   name 'vphr Ophar; and those cities, which Moses mentions in this place,
   appear to be the most ancient by comparing of authors. Every one knows
   front whence Babylon is derived. 'rk Arach is Aracca, placed by Ptolemy
   in Susiana; from whence conic the Aracæan fields in Tibullus, as the
   famous Salamasius, a man of vast reading, observes. Acabene, a
   corruption of Acadene, is derived from 'kd Achad, as is probably
   conjectured by Franciscus Junius, a diligent interpreter of scripture,
   who has observed many of those things we have been speaking of. chlnh
   Chalnah is the town Caunisus on the river Euphrates, whose name
   Ammianus tells us, in his twenty-third book, continued to his time. The
   land snr Senaar is the Babylonian Senaas, in Histiæus Milesus, which
   place Josephus has preserved in his ancient history, book i. chap. 7.
   and in his Chronicon; as has Eusebius in his Preparation. He wrote the
   affairs of Phoenicia; whom also Stephens had read. Again, ts being
   changed into g g, Ptolemy from hence calls the mountain Singarus in
   Mesopotamia. And Pliny mentions the town Singara, book v. chap. 24. and
   hence the Singaranæan country in Sextus Rufus. nynvhNineveh is
   undoubtedly the Ninos of the Greeks, contractN1; thus, in
   Sardanapalus's epitaph;-- "I, who great Ninus rul'd, am now but dust."
   The same name we find in Theognis, and Strabo, b. xvi. and Pliny, book
   vi. chap. 13. whose words are these: "Ninus was built upon the river
   Tigris, towards the west, a beautiful city to behold." Lucan, book iii.
   "Happy Ninus, as fame goes." The country Calachena has its name from
   the principal city klh Chala: Strabo, book xi. and afterwards in the
   beginning of book xvi. rsn Resin is Resaina in Ammianus, book xxiii.
   Sidon every one knows. vh Azzah, is without doubt rendered Gaza in
   Palestine, by changing, as before, the letter into g g; it is mentioned
   by Strabo, book xvi. and Mela, book i. who calls it a large and well
   fortified town; and Pliny, book v. ch. 13. and book vi. chap. 28. and
   elsewhere. sphrhSephirah, is Heliopolis, a city of the Sipparians, in
   that place of Abydenus now quoted. Sippara is by Ptolemy placed in
   Mesopotamia. 'vr Ur is the castle Ur, mentioned by Ammianus, book xxv.
   chrn Curran is Carra, famous for the slaughter of the Crassi.

   [96] See Homer, Odyss. 30. and Ovid's Metamorphoses, book i. "The
   giants, by report, would heaven have storm'd." See also Virgil's first
   Georgic, and Lucan, book vii. It is a frequent way of speaking amongst
   all nations, to call those things which are raised above the common
   height, things reaching to heaven, as we often find in Homer, and Deut.
   i. 28. and ix. 1. Josephus quotes one of the Sibyls, I know not which,
   concerning the unaccountable building of that tower; the words are
   these: "When all men spoke the same language, some of them built a vast
   high tower, as if they would ascend up into heaven; but the gods sent a
   wind, and overthrew the tower, and assigned to each a particular
   language; and from hence the city Babylon was so called." And Eusebius,
   in his Preparation, b. ix. c. 14. Cyril, book i. against Julian, quotes
   these words out of Abydenus: "Some say, that the first men, who sprang
   out of the earth, grew proud upon their great strength and bulk, and
   boasted that they could do more than the gods, and attempted to build a
   tower, where Babylon now stands; but when it came nigh the heavens, it
   was overthrown apon them by the gods, with the help of the winds, and
   the ruins are called Babylon. Men till then had but one language, but
   the gods divided it, and then began the war betwixt Saturn and Titan."
   It is a false tradition of the Greeks, that Babylon was built by
   Semiramis, as Berosus tells us in his Chaldaics, and Josephus in his
   first book against Appion; and the same error is refuted by Julius
   Firmicus out of Philo Biblius, and Dorotheus Sidonius. See also what
   Eusebius produces out of Eupolemus, concerning the giants and the
   tower, in his Gospel Preparation, book ix. chap. 17.

   [97] Book xix. where he describes the lake Asphaltites: "The
   neighbouring country burns with fire, the ill smell of which makes the
   bodies of the inhabitants sickly, and not very long lived."--(See more
   of this in our dissertation added to the Pentateuch concerning the
   burning of Sodom. Le Clerc.)

   [98] Book xvi. after the description of the lake Asphaltites: "There
   are many signs of this country's being on fire: for about Masada they
   shew many cragged and burnt rocks, and in many places caverns eaten in,
   and ground turned into ashes, drops of pitch falling from the rocks,
   and running waters stinking to a great distance, and their habitations
   overthrown; which makes credible a report amongst the inhabitants, that
   formerly there were. thirteen cities inhabited there, the chief of
   which was Sodom, so large as to be sixty furlongs round; but by
   earthquakes and fire breaking out, and by hot waters mixed with bitumen
   and brimstone, it became a lake, as we now see it; the rocks took fire,
   some of the cities were swallowed up, and others forsaken by those
   inhabitants that could flee away."

   [99] In the fifth book of his history: "Not far from thence are those
   fields which are reported to have been formerly very fruitful, and had
   large cities built in them, but they were burnt by lightning; the marks
   of which remain; in that the land is of a burning nature, and has lost
   its fruitfulness. For every thing that is planted, or grows of itself,
   as soon as it is come to an herb or flower, or grown to its proper
   bigness, vanishes like dust, into nothing."

   [100] He describes the lake Asphaltites, book v. chap. 16. and book
   xxxv. chap. 15.

   [101] In the 36th chap. of Salmasius's edition: "At a good distance
   from Jerusalem, a dismal lake extends itself, which was struck by
   lightning, as appears from the black earth burnt to ashes. There were
   two towns there, one called Sodom, the other Gomorrha; the apples that
   grow there cannot be eaten, though they look at if they were ripe; for
   the outward skin incloses a kind of sooty ashes, which, pressed by the
   least touch, flies out in smoke, and vanishes into fine dust."

   [102] With some little mistake. The words are in his Euterpe,
   "Originally only the Colchians, and Egyptians, and Ethiopians, were
   circumcised. For the Phoenicians, and Syrians in Palestine, confess
   they learned it from the Egyptians. And the Syrians who dwell at
   Thermodoon, and on the Parthenian river, and the Macrons, their
   neighbours, say, they learnt it of the Colchians. For these are the
   only men that are circumcised, and in this particular agree with the
   Egyptians. But concerning the Ethiopians and Egyptians, I cannot affirm
   positively which learned it of the other." Josephus rightly observes,
   that none were circumcised in Palestine Syria but the Jews; in the
   eighth book, chap. 4. of his ancient history, and first book against
   Appion. Concerning which Jews, Juvenal says, "They take off their
   foreskin;" and Tacitus, "that they instituted circumcising themselves,
   that they might be known by such distinction." See Strabo, book xvii.
   But the Jews are so far from confessing that they derived this custom
   from the Egyptians, that, on the contrary, they openly declare, that
   the Egyptians learnt to be circumcised of Joseph. Neither were all the
   Egyptians circumcised, as all the Jews were, as we may see from the
   example of Appion, who was an Egyptian, in Josephus. Herodotus
   undonbtedly put the Phoenicians for the Idumæans; as Aristophanes does
   in his play called the Birds, where he calls the Egyptians and
   Phoenicians, "the circumcised." Ammonius, of the difference of words,
   says, "the Idumæans were not originally Jews, but Phoenicians and
   Syrians." Those Ethiopians which were circumcised, were of the
   posterity of Keturah, as shall be observed afterwards. The Colchians
   and their neighbours were of the ten tribes that Salmanasar carried
   away, and from thence some came into Thrace. Thus the Scholiast on
   Aristophanes's Acharnenses says, "That the nation of the Odomants is
   the same as the Thracians; they are said to be Jews." Where, by Jews,
   are to be understood, improperly, Hebrews, as is usual. From the
   Ethiopians, circumcision went across the sea into the new world, if it
   be true what is said of that rite's being found in many places of that
   world.--(The learned dispute whether circumcision was instituted first
   amongst the Egyptians or amongst the Jews; concerning which, see my
   notes upon Genesis xvii. 10. Le Clerc.)

   [103] Book i. of the Colchians; "That this nation sprang from the
   Egyptians appears from hence, that they are circumcised after the
   manner of the Egyptians; which custom remains amongst this colony, as
   it does amongst the Jews." Now, since the Hebrews were of old
   circumcised; it no more follows, from the Cholchians being circumcised,
   that they sprang from the Egyptians, than that they sprang from the
   Hebrews, as we affirm they did. He tells us, book iii. that the
   Troglodites were circumcised, who were a part of the Ethiopians.

   [104] Book xvi. concerning the Troglodites: "Some of these are
   circumcised, like the Egyptians." In the same book he ascribes
   circumcision to the Jews.

   [105] In the fable of Saturn, in Eusebius, book i. chap. 10.

   [106] To which Abraham, that the precept of circumcision was first of
   all given, Theodorus tells us in his poem upon the Jews; out of which
   Eusebius has preserved these verses in his Gospel Preparation, book ix.
   chap. 22.-- "He who from home the righteous Abraham brought,
   Commanded him, and all his house, with knife
   To circumcise their foreskin. He obeyed."

   [107] So called from Esau, who is called Ousoos Ousoos, by Philo
   Biblius. His other name was Edom, which the Greeks translated Eruthran
   Eruthran, from whence comes the Erythræan sea, because the ancient
   dominions of Esau and his posterity extended so far. They who are
   ignorant of their original confound them, as we observed, with the
   Phoenicians. Ammonius says, the Idumæans were circumcised; and so does
   Justin, in his dialogue with Trypho; and Epiphanius against the
   Ebionites. Part of these were Homerites, who, Epiphanius against the
   Ebionites tells us, were circumcised in his time.

   [108] These were circumcised of old, but on the same year of their age
   as Ismael. Josephus, book i. chap. 12. and 13. "A child was born to
   them (viz. Abraham and Sarah) when they were both very old, which they
   circumcised on the eighth day; and hence the custom of the Jews is, to
   circumcise after so many days. But the Arabians defer it thirteen
   years: for Ismael, the father of that nation, who was the child of
   Abraham by his concubine, was circumcised at that age." Thus Origen, in
   his excellent discourse against fate, which is extant in Eusebius, book
   vi. chap. 11. and in the Greek collection, whose title is Philokalia;
   "I don't know how this can be defended, that there should be just such
   a position of the stars upon every one's birth in Judæa, that upon the
   eighth day they must be circumcised, made sore, wounded, lamed, and so
   inflamed, that they want the help of a physician, as soon as they come
   into the world. And that there should be such a position of the stars
   to the Ismaelites in Arabia, that they must be all circumcised when
   they are thirteen years old; for so it is reported of them."
   Epiphanius, in his dispute against the Ebionites, rightly explains
   these Ismaelites to be the Saracens; for the Saracens always observed
   this custom, and the Turks had it from them.

   [109] Namely those that descended from Keturah, concerning whore there
   is a famous place of Alexander the historian in Josephus book i. chap.
   16. which Eusebius quotes in his Gospel Preparation, book ix. chap. 20.
   "Cleodemus the prophet, who is called Malchus, in his relation of the
   Jews, gives us the same history as Moses their lawgiver, viz. that
   Abraham had many children by Keturah, to three of which he gave the
   names Afer, Asser, and Afra. Assyria is so called from Asser; and from
   the other two, Afer, and Afra, the city Afra, and the country Africa,
   are denominated. These fought with Hercules against Lybia and Antæus.
   Then Hercules married his daughter to Afra: he had a son of her, whose
   name was Deodorus, of whom was born Sophon, whence the barbarians are
   called Sophaces." Here the other names, through the fault of the
   transcribers, neither agree with Moses, nor with the books of Josephus
   and Eusebius, as we have them now. But Apher Apher, is undoubtedly the
   same phr Apher in Moses. We are to understand by Hercules, not the
   Theban Hercules, but the Phoenician Hercules, much older, whom Philo
   Biblius mentions, quoted by Eusebius often, in the fore-mentioned 10th
   chapter of the first book of his Gospel Preparation. This is that
   Hercules who, Sallust says in his Jugurthine war, brought his army into
   Africa. So that we see whence the Ethiopians, who were a great part of
   the Africans, had their circumcision, which they had in Herodotus's
   time; and even now, those that are Christians retain it, not out of a
   religious necessity, but out of respect to so ancient a custom.

   [110] Scaliger thinks that several things, which Eusebius has preserved
   out of Philo Biblius, certainly relate to Abraham: see himself in his
   appendix to the Emendation of Time. There is some reason to doubt of
   it.

   [111] How far we are to give credit to Philo's Sanchuniathon does not
   yet appear; for the very learned Henry Dodwell has rendered his
   integrity very suspicious, in his English dissertation on
   Sanchuniathon's Phoenician history, published at London, in the year
   1681, to whose arguments we may add this, that in his fragments there
   is an absurd mixture of the gods unknown to the eastern Grecians in the
   first times, with the deities of the Phoenicians, which the straitness
   of paper will not allow me to enlarge upon. Le Clerc.

   [112] Josephus has preserved his words in his ancient history, book i.
   chap. 8. "In the tenth generation after the flood, there was a man
   amongst the Chaldæans, who was very just and great, and sought after
   heavenly things." Now it is evident from reason, that this ought to be
   referred to the time of Abraham.

   [113] He wrote a book concerning Abraham, which is now lost, but was
   extant in Josephus's time.

   [114] Nicolaus, that famous man, who was the friend of Augustus and
   Herod, some of whose relics were lately procured by that excellent
   person Nicholas Peiresius; by whose death, learning and learned men had
   a very great loss. The words of this Nicolaus Damascenes, Josephus
   relates in the fore-cited place: "Abraham reigned in Damascus, being a
   stranger who came out of the land of the Chaldæans, beyond Babylon;
   and, not long after, he, and those that belonged to him, went from
   hence into the land then called Canaan, but now Judæa, where he and
   those that descended from him dwelt, of whose affairs I shall treat in
   another place. The name of Abraham is at this day famous in the country
   about Damascus, and they shew us the town which from him is called
   Abraham's dwelling."

   [115] Eusebius, in his Preparation, book ix. ch. 16, 17, 18, 21, 23.
   has quoted several things, under these men's names, out of Alexander
   the historian, but the places are too long to be transcribed; nobody
   has quoted them before Eusebius. But the fable of the Bethulians, which
   Eusebius took out of Philo Biblius, Prepar. book i. chap. 10. came from
   the altar of Bethel, built by Jacob, mentioned Gen. xxxvi.

   [116] 2 For certainly those that we find in Clemens Alexandrinus,
   Strom. v. and Eusebius, book xiii. chap. 12. can be understood of no
   other:--

   "The Maker of all things is known to none,
   But one of the Chaldæan race, his son
   Only begotten, who well understood
   The starry orb, and by what laws each star
   Moves round the earth, embracing all things in it."
   Where Abraham is called only begotten, as in Isaiah li. 2. 'chd Achad.
   We have before seen, in Berosus, that Abraham was famous for the
   knowledge of astronomy; and Eupolemus, in Eusebius, says of him, "that
   he was the inventor of astronomy amongst the Chaldæans."

   [117] Book xxxvi. chap. 2. "The original of the Jews was from Damascus,
   an eminent city in Syria, of which afterwards Abraham and Israel were
   kings," Trogus Pompeius calls them kings, as Nicolaus did; because they
   exercised a kingly power in their families; and therefore they are
   called Anointed, Psalm cv. 15.

   [118] See Eusebius, in the fore-mentioned book ix. chap. 26, 27, 28.
   Those things are true which are there quoted out of Tragicus Judtæus
   Ezechiel, part of which we find in Clemens Alexandrinus, Strom. i. who
   reports, out of the books of the priests, that an Egyptian was slain at
   Moses's word; and, Strom. v. he relates some things belonging to Moses,
   out of Artapanus, though not very exactly. Justin, out of Trogus
   Pompeius, says of Moses, "He was leader of those that were banished,
   and took away the sacred things of the Egyptians; which they
   endeavouring to recover by arms, were forced by a tempest to return
   home; and that Moses having entered into his own country of Damascus,
   took possession of mount Sinah;" and what follows, which is a mixture
   of truth and falsehood, where we find Arvas written by him, it should
   be read Arnas, who is Aaron, not the son, as he imagines, but the
   brother of Moses, and a priest.

   [119] As the great Scaliger has mended the place; who with a very
   little variation of the shape of a letter, instead of hulogenes,
   hulogenes, as it is quoted out of Aristobulus, by Eusebius, in his
   Gospel Preparat. book xiii. chap. 12. bids us read hudogeneshudogenes,
   born of the water. So that the verses are thus:-- "So was it said of
   old, so he commands
   Who's born of water, who receiv'd from God
   The two great tables of the moral law," The ancient writer of the
   Orphic verses, whoever he was, added these words, after he had said,
   that there was but one God to be worshipped, who was the Creator and
   Governor of the world.

   [120] He seems to have lived in the time of Ptolemy Epiphanes:
   concerning which, see that very useful book of the famous Gerard
   Vossius, of the Greek historians. Africanus says, the Greek histories
   were wrote by him; which is the same book Athenæus calls Helladikon.
   His words are these: "In the reign of Apis the son of Phoroneus, part
   of the Egyptian army went out of Egypt, and dwelt in Syria, called
   Palestine, not far from Arabia." As Africanus preserved the place of
   Polemon, so Eusebius, in his chronology, preserved that of Africanus.

   [121] The places are in Josephus against Appion, with abundance of
   falsities, as coining from people whit) hated the Jews; and from hence
   Tacitus took his account of them. But it appears, from all these
   compared together, that the Hebrews descended from the Assyrians; and,
   possessing a great part of Egypt, led the life of shepherds; but
   afterwards, being burthened with hard labour, they came out of Egypt
   under the command of Moses, some of the Egyptians accompanying them,
   and went through the country of the Arabians, unto Palestine Syria, and
   there set up rites contrary to those of the Egyptians; but Josephus, in
   that learned book, has surprisingly shewn, how the Egyptian writers, in
   the falsities which they have here and there mixed with this history,
   differ with one another, and some with themselves, and how many ages
   the books of Moses exceed theirs in antiquity.

   [122] From whom they went away, by force, whose laws the Jews
   abolished. Concerning the implacable hatred of the Egyptians against
   the Jews, see Philo against Flaccus, and in his Embassy, and Josephus
   in each book against Appion.

   [123] Who inherited the ancient hatred between Jacob and Esau; which
   was increased from a new cause, when the Idumæans denied the Hebrews a
   passage, Numb. xx. 14.

   [124] Those, I mean, that descended from Ismael.

   [125] Namely, the Canaanites, and the neighbouring nations, who had
   continual wars with the Hebrews.

   [126] In his first book, where he treats of those who made the gods to
   be the authors of their laws, he adds; "Amongst the Jews was Moses, who
   called God by the name of Iao, Iao;" where by Iao, he means ychvh
   Jehovah, which was so pronounced by the oracles, and in the Orphic
   verses mentioned by the ancients, and by the Basilidian heretics, and
   other gnostics. The same name the Tyrians, as we learn from Philo
   Biblius, pronounced Ieuo, Ieuo, others Iaou, Iaou, as we see in Clemens
   Alexandrinus. The Samaritans pronounced it Iabai, Iabai, as we read in
   Theodoret; for the eastern people added to the same words, some one
   vowel, and some another; from whence it is that there is such
   difference in the proper names In the Old Testament. Philo rightly
   observes, that this word signifies existence. Besides Diodurus, of
   those who make mention of Moses, the exhortation to the Greeks, which
   is ascribed to Justin, names Appion, Ptolemy on Mandesius, Hellanicus,
   Philochorus, Castor, Thallus, Alexander the historian: and Cyril
   mentions some of them in his first book against Julian.

   [127] The place is in the sixteenth book, where he thinks that Moses
   was an Egyptian priest; which he had from the Egyptian writers, as
   appears in Josephus: afterwards he adds his own opinion, which him some
   mistakes in it: "Many who worshipped the Deity agreed with him (Moses);
   for he both said and taught, that the Egyptians did not rightly
   conceive of God, when they likened him to wild beasts and cattle; nor
   the Libyans, nor the Greeks, in resembling him by a human shape; for
   God is no other than that universe which surrounds us; the earth, and
   the sea, and the heaven, and the world, and the nature of all things,
   as they are called by us. Who (says he) that has any understanding,
   would presume to form any image like to these things that are about us?
   Wherefore we ought to lay aside all carved images, and worship him in
   the innermost part of a temple worthy of him, without any figure." He
   adds, that this was the opinion of good men: he adds also, that sacred
   rites were instituted by him, which were not burdensome for the
   costliness, nor hateful, as proceeding from madness. He mentions
   circumcision, the meats that were forbidden, and the like: and, after
   he had shewu that man was naturally desirous of civil society, he tells
   us, that it is promoted by divine and human precepts, but more
   effectually by divine.

   [128] 2 Book xxx. chap. 1. "There is another sect of magicians, which
   sprang from Moses." And Juvenal; "They learn, and keep, and fear, the
   Jewish law,
   Which Moses in his secret volume gave."

   [129] History v. where, according to the Egyptian fables, Moses is
   called " one of those that were banished."

   [130] He lived in the time of Aurelian the emperor, a favourite or
   Zenobia, queen of the Palmyrians. In his book of the Sublime, after he
   had said, that they who speak of God ought to take care to represent
   him as great, and pure, and without mixture; he adds, "Thus does he who
   gave laws to the Jews, who was an extraordinary man, who conceived and
   spoke worthily of the power of God, when he writes in the beginning of
   his laws, God spake: What? Let there he light, and there was light: Let
   there be earth, and it was so." Chalcidius took many things out of
   Moses, of whom he .speaks thus: "Moses was the wisest of men, who, as
   they say, was enlivened not by human eloquence, but by divine
   inspiration."

   [131] In the Gemara, in the title, Concerning Oblations, and the
   chapter, All the Oblations of the Synagogue. To which add the Tanchuma,
   or Ilmedenu. Mention is there made of the chief of Pharaoh's magicians,
   and their discourse with Moses is related. Add also Numenius, book iii.
   concerning the Jews: Eusebius quotes his words, book viii. chap, 8.
   "Afterwards Jamnes and Mambres, Egyptian scribes, were thought to be
   famous for magical arts, about the time that the Jews were driven out
   of Egypt; for these were they who were chosen out of the multitude of
   the Egyptians, to contend with Musæus the leader of the Jews, a man
   very powerful with God by prayers; and they seemed to be able to repel
   those sore calamities which were brought upon Egypt by Musæus." Where
   Moses is called Musæus, a word very near it, as is customary with the
   Greeks; as others call Jesus, Jason; and Saul, Paul. Origen against
   Celsus refers us to the same place of Numenius. Artaparnus, in the same
   Eusebius, book ix. ch. 27. calls them the priests of Memphis, who were
   commanded by the king to be put to death, if they did not do things
   equal to Moses.

   [132] In the fore-cited place.

   [133] In his second Apologetic.

   [134] As in Strabo, Tacitus, and Theophrastus, quoted by Porphyry, in
   his second book, against eating living creatures, where he treats of
   priests and burnt-offerings; and in the fourth book of the same work,
   where he speaks of fishes, and other living creatures, that were
   forbidden to be eaten. See the place of Hecatæus, in Josephus's first
   book against Appion, and in Eusebius's Preparat. book in, chap. 4, You
   have the law of avoiding the customs of strange nations, in Justin's
   and Tacitus's histories; of not eating swine's flesh, in Tacitus,
   Juvenal, Plutarch's Sympos. iv. and Macrobius from the ancients. In the
   same place of Plutarch, you will find mention of the Levites, and the
   pitching of the tabernacle.

   [135] Hermippus, in the life of Pythagoras, quoted by Josephus against
   Appion, b. ii. "These things he said and did, imitating the opinions of
   the Jews and Thracians, and transferring them to himself; for truly
   this man took many things into his own philosophy from the Jewish
   laws." To abstain from creatures that die of themselves, is put among
   the precepts of Pythagoras, by Hierocles, and Prophyry in his epistle
   to Anebo, and Ælian, book iv.; that is out of Levit. iv. 15. Deut. xiv.
   21. "Thou shalt not engrave the figure of God on a ring," is taken out
   of Pythagoras, in Malchus's or Porphyry's exhortation to philosophy,
   and in Diogenes LaCrtius: and this from the second commandment. "Take
   not away that which thou didst not place," Josephus, in his second book
   against Appion, puts amongst the Jewish precepts, and Philostratus
   amongst the Pythagorean. Jamblicus says, "A tender and fruit-fill tree
   ought not to be corrupted or hurt," which he had out of Deuteronomy xx.
   19. The fore-mentioned Hermippus ascribes this to Pythagoras, not to
   pass by a place where an ass has set upon his knees; the foundation of
   which is the story in Numb. xxii. 27. Porphyry acknowledges that Plato
   took many things from the Hebrews, as Theodoret observes in his first
   discourse against the Greeks. You will see part of them in Eusebius's
   Preparation.--(I suspect that Hermippus, or Josephus, instead of Jews,
   should have said Idæans, that is, the priests of Jupiter Idæus in
   Crete, whom Pythagoras envied. See sir John Marsham's collection of
   these, in his tenth age of the Egyptian affairs. Le Clerc.)

   [136] Strabo, in his fourteenth book, after the history of Moses, says,
   "That his followers for a considerable time kept his precepts, and were
   truly righteous and godly." And a little after he says, that those, who
   believed in Moses, "worshipped God, and were lovers of equity." And
   Justin says thus, book xxxvi, c. 2. " Whose righteousness (viz. the
   kings and priests) mixed with religion, increased beyond belief."
   Aristotle also (witness Clearchus in his second book of sleep, which
   Josephus transcribed) gives a great character of a Jew, whom he had
   seen, for his wisdom and learning. Tacitus, amongst his many falsities,
   says this one truth, that the Jews worshipped "that Supreme and Eternal
   Being, who was immutable and could not perish," that is, God, as Dion
   Cassius speaks, treating of the same Jews), "who is ineffable and
   invisible."

   [137] Concerning whose prophecy, Eusebius says, Prep. book ix. chap.
   30. that Eupolemns wrote a book. In the 39th chapter of the same book,
   Eusebius quotes a place of his concerning the prophecies of Jeremiah.

   [138] The verses are these:--

   "Of that three-nighted lion, whom of old

   Triton's fierce dog with furious jaws devour'd,

   Within whose bowels, tearing his liver,

   He rolled, burning with heat, though without fire,

   His head with drops of sweat bedew'd all o'er."
   Upon which place Tzetses says, "because he was three days within the
   whale." And Æneas Gazeus in Theophrastus: "According to the story of
   Hercules, who was saved by a whale swallowing him up, when the ship in
   which he sailed was wrecked."

   [139] And Servius, as Varro and Verrius Flaccus affirm.

   [140] Book iii. in Cyril.

   [141] Julian, in the tenth book of Cyril: "Ye refuse to bring
   sacrifices to the altar, and offer them, because the fire does not
   descend from heaven and consume the sacrifices, as it did in Moses's
   time; this happened once to Moses, and again long after to Elijah the
   Tishbite." See what follows concerning the fire from heaven. Cyprian,
   in iii. of his testimonies, says, "That, in the sacrifices, all those
   that God accepted of, fire came down from heaven, and consumed the
   things sacrificed." Menander also, in his Phoenician history, mentions
   that great drought which happened in the time of Elias, that is, when
   Ithobalus reigned amongst the Tyrians. See Josephus in his ancient
   history, book viii. chap. 7.

   [142] See Deut. xiii. 5. xviii. 20. and the following.

   [143] Nobody dared to do it after David.

   [144] The Hebrews used to remark upon those times, "Hitherto the
   prophets, now begin the wise men."

   [145] Therefore, in the first book of Maccabees, iv. 46. we read, that
   the stones of the altar which was defiled were laid aside, "until there
   should come a prophet to shew what should be done with them." And, in
   the ixth chap. ver. 27. of the same book: "So was there a great
   affliction in Israel, the like whereof had never been, since the time
   that there were no prophets amongst them." The same we find in the
   Talmud, in the title concerning the council.

   [146] See Exodus xxviii. 30. Levit. viii. 8. Numb. xxvii. 21. Deut.
   xxxiii. 9. 1 Sam. xxi. 2. xxii. 10, 13, 15. xxiii. 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12.
   xxviii. 6. Add Nehem. vii. 65.; and Josephus, book iii. 9. This is what
   is meant by the words ero'tema de'lon, "the consulting, (an oracle),
   where you will have an answer as clear as light itself;" in the Son of
   Sirach, xxviii. 3.; for the word dela, clear, answers to the Hebrew
   'vrym Urim; and so the Seventy translate it in the fore-cited places,
   Numb. xxvii. 21. 1 Sam. xxviii. 6. and elsewhere de'losin, making
   clear, as Exod. xxviii. 26. Lev. viii. 8. They also translate tmym
   Thumin, ale'theian, truth. The Egyptians imitated this, just as
   children do men. Diodorus, book i. relating the affairs of the
   Egyptians, says of the chief judge, "that he hath truth banging about
   his neck." And again afterwards, "The king commands that all things
   necessary and fitting should be provided for the subsistence of the
   judges, and that the chief judge should have great plenty. This man
   carries about his neck an image of precious stones, hanging on a golden
   chain, which they call Truth, and they then begin to hear cases, when
   the chief judge has fixed this image of truth." And Ælian, book xiv.
   chap. 24, of his various history: "The judges in old time amongst the
   Egyptians were priests, the oldest of which was chief priest, who
   judged every one; and he ought to be a very just man, and one that
   spared nobody. He wore an ornament about his neck, made of sapphire
   stone, which was called Truth." The Babylonish Gemara, chap. i. of the
   book called Joma, says, that some things in the first temple were
   wanting in the second, as the ark with the mercy-seat, and the
   cherubims, the fire coming from heaven, the Schecinah, the Holy Ghost,
   and the Urim and Thumin.

   [147] This is a conjecture of the rabbins, without any foundation from
   scripture. It is much more credible, that the priest pronounced the
   oracle with his mouth. See our observations on Exod. xxviii. 30. Numb.
   xxvii. 21. Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XVII. The same proved also from predictions.

   THERE is another argument to prove the providence of God, very like to
   this of miracles, and no less powerful, drawn from the foretelling of
   future events, and was very often and very expressly done amongst the
   Hebrews; such as the man's being childless who should rebuild Jericho;
   [148] the destroying the altar of Bethel, by king Josiah by name, above
   three hundred years before it came to pass: [149] so also Isaiah
   foretold the very name and principal acts of Cyrus; [150] and Jeremiah
   the event of the siege of Jerusalem, after it was surrounded by the
   Chaldeans; and Daniel the translation of the empire from the Assyrians
   to the Medes and Persians, [151] and from them to Alexander of Macedon,
   [152] whose successors to part of his kingdom were to be the posterity
   of Lagus and Seleucus: [153] and what evils the Hebrews should undergo
   from all these, particularly the famous Antiochus; [154] so very
   plainly, that Porphyry, [155] who compared the Grecian histories,
   extant in his time, with the prophecies, could not make it out any
   other way, but by saying, that the things ascribed to Daniel were wrote
   after they came to pass; which is the same as if any one should deny,
   that what is now extant under the name of Virgil, and was always
   thought to be his, was writ by him in Augustus's time. For there was
   never any more doubt amongst the Hebrews concerning the one, than there
   was amongst the Romans concerning the other. To all which may be added,
   the many and express oracles amongst those of Mexico and Peru, which
   foretold the coming of the Spaniards into those parts, and the
   calamities that would follow. [156]

   And by other arguments.. [157]

   To this may be referred very many dreams, exactly agreeing with the
   events; which, both as to themselves and their causes, were so utterly
   unknown to those that dreamed them, that they cannot without great
   shamelessness be attributed to natural causes: of which kind the best
   writers afford us eminent examples. Tertullian [158] has made a
   collection of them in his book of the soul; and ghosts have not only
   been seen, but also heard to speak, [159] as we are told by those
   historians who have been far from superstitious credulity; and by
   witnesses in our own age, who lived in Sina, Mexico, and other parts of
   America; neither ought we to pass by that common method of examining
   persons' innocence, by walking over red-hot ploughshares, viz. fire
   ordeal, mentioned in so many histories of the German nation, and in
   their very laws. [160]

   [157] What is here said, does not so much prove the existence of God,
   who takes care of the affairs of men; as that there are present with
   them some invisible beings, more powerful than men, which whoever
   believes, will easily believe that there is a God. For there is no
   necessity that all things, which come to pass different from the common
   course of nature, should be ascribed to God himself; as if whatever
   cannot be effected by men, or the power of corporeal things, must be
   done by Him himself. Le Clerc.

   daughter of Polycrates Samius, whom Cicero calls his nurse, of
   Cleonomus Pieta, of Sophocles, of Neoptolemus the tragedian. Some of

   There are many remarkable things in Tully's books of divination;
   neither ought we to forget that of Pliny, book xxv. chap. 2. concerning
   the mother of one that was fighting in Lusitania. And also those of
   Antigonus and Artucules, who was the first of the race of the Osmanidæ,

   Celsus.

   [160] See the testimonies of this matter, collected by Francis Juret,
   upon the 74th epistle of Ivon, bishop of Chartres. Sophocles's Antigone
   tells us how old this is, where the Theban relations of OEdipus speak
   thus:--

   "We are prepared to handle red-hot iron,
   To pass through fire, or to invoke the gods,
   That we are innocent, and did not do it."
   Which we learn also from the report of Strobe, book v. and Pliny's
   natural hist. book vii. chap. 2. and Servius upon Virgil's eleventh
   Æneid. Also those things which were seen of old, in Feronia's grove
   upon the mountain Soracte. To these things which happened contrary to
   the common course of nature, we may add, I think, those we find made
   use of to preserve men's bodies from being wounded by arrows. See also
   the certain testimonies concerning those who have spoke after their
   tongues were cut out upon the account of religion, such as Justinian,
   book i. chapter of the prætorian office, concerning a prefect in
   Africa; Procopius in the first of his Vandalics; Victor Uticensis, in
   his book of persecutions and Æneas Gaza in Theophrastus.

  SECT. XVIII. The objection, of miracles not being seen now, answered.

   NEITHER is there any reason why any one should object against what has
   been said, because no such miracles are now seen, nor any such
   predictions heard. For it is sufficient to prove a Divine Providence,
   that there ever have been such. Which being once established, it will
   follow, that we ought to think God Almighty forbears them now, for as
   wise and prudent reasons as he before did them. Nor is it fit that the
   laws given to the universe for the natural course of things, and that
   what is future might be uncertain, should always, or without good
   reason, be suspended, but then only, when there was a sufficient cause:
   as there was at that time when the worship of the true God was banished
   almost out of the world, being confined only to a small corner of it,
   viz. Judæa; and was to be defended from the wickedness which surrounded
   it, by frequent assistance: or when the Christian religion, concerning
   which we shall afterwards particularly treat, was, by the determination
   of God, to be spread all over the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XIX. And of there being so much wickedness.

   SOME men are apt to doubt of a Divine Providence, because they see so
   much wickedness practised, that the world is in a manner overwhelmed
   with it, like a deluge: which, they contend, should be the business of
   Divine Providence, if there were any, to hinder or suppress. But the
   answer to such is very easy. When God made man a free agent, and at
   liberty to do well or ill, (reserving to himself alone a necessary and
   immutable goodness), it was not fit that he should put such a restraint
   upon evil actions as was inconsistent with this liberty. [161] But
   whatever means of hindering them were not repugnant to such liberty;
   as, establishing and promulging a law, external and internal warnings,
   together with threatenings and promises; none of these were neglected
   by God: neither would he suffer the effects of wickedness to spread to
   the furthest; so that government was never utterly subverted, nor the
   knowledge of the divine laws entirely extinguished. And even those
   crimes that were permitted, as we hinted before, were not without their
   advantages, when made use of either to punish those who were equally
   wicked, or to chastise those who were slipped out of the way of virtue,
   or else to procure some eminent example of patience and constancy, in
   those who had made a great progress in virtue. Lastly, even they
   themselves, whose crimes seemed to be overlooked for a time, were for
   the most part punished with a proportionable punishment, that the will
   of God might be executed against them who acted contrary to his will.
   [162]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [161] Thus Tertullian against Marcian, ii. "An entire liberty of the
   will is granted him either way, that he may always appear to be the
   master of himself, by doing of his own accord that which is good, and
   avoiding of his own accord that which is evil. Because man, who is in
   other respects subject to the determination of God, ought to do that
   which is just, out of the good pleasure of his own free will. But,
   neither the wages of that which is good or evil can justly be paid to
   him who is found to be good or evil out of necessity, and not out of
   choice. And for this reason was the law appointed, not to exclude, but
   to prove liberty, by voluntarily performing obedience to it, or by
   voluntarily transgressing it; so that, in either event, the liberty of
   the will is manifest." And again afterwards; "Then the consequence
   would have been, that God would have withdrawn that liberty which was
   once granted to man; that is, would have retained within himself his
   fore-knowledge and exceeding power, whereby he might have interposed,
   to hinder man front falling into danger, by trying to make an ill use
   of his liberty. For, if he had interposed, he would then have taken
   away that liberty which his reason and goodness had given them."
   Origen, in his fourth book against Celsus, handles this matter, as he
   uses to do others, very learnedly; where, amongst other things, he
   says, "That you destroy the nature of virtue, if you take away
   liberty."

   [162] Concerning this whole matter, see the note at sect. viii.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XX. And that so great, as to oppress good men.

   AND if at any time vice should go unpunished, or, which is wont to
   offend many weak persons, some good men, oppressed by the fury of the
   wicked, should not only lead a troublesome life, but also undergo an
   infamous death; we must not presently from hence conclude against a
   Divine Providence; which, as we have before observed, is established by
   such strong arguments; but rather, with the wisest men, draw this
   following inference:--
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XXI. This may be turned upon them, so as to prove, that souls survive
  bodies.

   THAT, since God has a regard to human actions, who is himself just, and
   yet those things come to pass in the mean time, we ought to expect a
   judgment after this life, lest either remarkable wickedness should
   continue unpunished, or eminent virtue go unrewarded, and fail of
   happiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XXII. Which is confirmed by tradition.

   In order to establish this, we must first shew, that souls remain after
   they are separated from their bodies: [163] which is a most ancient
   tradition, derived from our first parents (whence else could it come?)
   to almost all civilized people; as appears from Homer's verses, [164]
   and from the philosophers, [165] not only the Greeks, but also the
   ancient Gauls, which were called Druids, [166] and from the Indians
   called Brachmans, [167] and from those things, which many writers have
   related, concerning the Egyptians, [168] and Thracians, and also of the
   Germans. [169] And, moreover, concerning a divine judgment after this
   life, we find many things extant, not only among the Greeks, but also
   among the Egyptians, [170] and Indians, [171] as Strabo, Diogenes
   Laërtius, and Plutarch, [172] tell us: to which we may add a tradition,
   that the world should be burnt; which was found of old, in Hystaspes
   and the Sibyls, [173] and now also in Ovid [174] and Lucan, [175] and
   amongst the Indians in Siam; [176] a token of which is the sun's
   approaching nearer to the earth, observed by astronomers. [177] So
   likewise, upon the first going into the Canary Islands and America, and
   other distant places, the same opinion concerning souls and judgment
   was found there.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [163] Whoever has a mind to read this argument more largely handled, I
   refer him to Chrysostom on 2 Cor. ch. iv. and to his Ethics, tome vi.
   against those who affirm that human affairs are regulated by daemons;
   and to his fourth discourse upon Providence.

   [164] Especially in that part called nekuia, "concerning those that are
   departed:" to which may be added, the like in Virgil, in Seneca's
   OEdipus, Lucan, Statius, and that in Samuel, 1 Sam. xxviii.

   [165] Pherecydes, Pythagoras, and Plato, and all the disciples of them.
   To these Justin adds Empedocles, and many oracles in his second
   Apologetic; and Xenocrates.

   [166] These taught that souls did not die. See Cæsar, book vi. of the
   war with the Gauls; and Strabo, book iv. of the same. "These and others
   say, that souls are incorruptible." (See also Lucan, book i. 455.)

   [167] Whose opinion Strabo explains to us thus, book xv. "We are to
   think of this life, as of the state of a child before it be born; and
   of death, as a birth to that which is truly life and happiness to wise
   men." See also a remarkable place concerning this matter, in Porphyry's
   fourth book, against eating living creatures.

   [168] Herodotus, in his Euterpe, says, that it was the opinion of the
   Egyptians, "That the soul of man was immortal." The same is reported of
   them by Diogenes Laërtius, in his preface, and by Tacitus, book v. of
   his history of the Jews. "They buried rather than burnt their bodies,
   after the manner of the Egyptians; they having the same regard and
   persuasion concerning the dead." See Diodorus Siculus, concerning the
   soul of Osiris; and Servius on the sixth Æneid, most of which is taken
   from the Egyptians.

   [169] See again here, the places of Hermippus, concerning Pythagoras,
   which we before quoted out of Josephus. Mela, book ii. concerning the
   Thracians, says, "Some think, that the souls of those who die return
   again; others, that though they do not return, yet they do not die, but
   go to a more happy place." And Solinus, concerning the same, chap. x.
   "Some of them think, that the souls of those who die return again;
   others, that they do not die, but are made more happy." Hence arose
   that custom of attending the funerals with great joy, mentioned by
   these writers, and, by Valerius Max. book i. ch. v. 12. That which we
   before quoted out of the Scholiast upon Aristophanes, makes this the
   more credible, viz. that some of the Hebrews of old came into Thrace.

   [170] Diodorus Siculus, book i. says, that what Orpheus delivered
   concerning souls departed, was taken from the Egyptians. Repeat what we
   now quoted out of Tacitus.

   [171] Amongst whose opinions, Strabo, book xv. reckons that "concerning
   the judgments that are exercised amongst the souls departed."

   [172] Concerning those whose punishment is deferred by the gods, and
   concerning the face of the moon's orb, see a famous place of his,
   quoted by Eusebius, book xi. ch. 38. of his Gospel Preparat. out of the
   dialogue concerning the soul.

   [173] (See Justin's second Apologetic, and Clemens, Strom. vi. whence
   is quoted that from the Tragoedian:--

   "For certainly the day will come, 'twill come,

   When the bright sky shall from his treasure send

   A liquid fire, whose all-devouring flames,

   By laws unbounded, shall destroy the earth,

   And what's above it; all shall vanish then.

   The water of the deep shall turn to smoke,

   The earth shall cease to nourish trees; the air,

   Instead of bearing up the birds, shall burn."

   [174] Metamorphoses, book i.

   "For he remember'd, 'twas by fate decreed

   To future times, that sea, and earth, and heav'n

   Should burn, and this vast frame of nature fail."

   [175] Book i.

   "So, when this frame of nature is dissolv'd,

   And the last hour, in future times, approach,

   All to its ancient chaos shall return:

   The stars, confounded, tumble into sea;

   The earth refuse its banks, and try to throw

   The ocean off; the moon attack the sun,

   Driving her chariot through the burning sky,

   Enrag'd, and challenging the rule of day:

   The order of the world's disturb'd throughout."
   Lucan was preceded by his uncle Seneca, in the end of his book to
   Marcia: "The stars shall ran upon each other; and, every thing being on
   a flame, that which now shines regularly, shall then burn in one fire."

   [176] See Ferdinand Mendesius.

   [177] See Copernicus's Revolutions, book iii. chap. 16. Joachim
   Rhæticus on Copernicus, and Goma Frisius. See also Ptolemy, book iii.
   chap. 4. of his mathematical syntax. That the world is not now upheld
   by that power it was formerly, as itself declares; "and that its ruin
   is evidenced, by the proof, how the things in it fail," says Cyprian to
   Demetrius.--(Tbe earth is nearer to the sun in its perihelions, that
   is, when it is in the extreme parts of the lesser axis of its parabola,
   though the earth always approaches at the same distances; yet it is
   manifest from hence, that, at the will of God, it may approach still
   nearer, and, if it so pleases him, be set on fire by the sun, as it
   happens to comets. Le Clerc.)--"It were to be wished that the learned
   remarker had left out this and some other notes of this kind, unless he
   had studied such sort of things more."
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XXIII. And no way repugnant to reason.

   NEITHER can we find any argument drawn from nature, which overthrows
   this ancient and extensive tradition: [178] for all those things, which
   seem to us to be destroyed, are either destroyed by the opposition of
   something more powerful than themselves, as cold is destroyed by the
   greater force of heat; or by taking away the subject upon which they
   depend, as the magnitude of a glass, by breaking it; or by the defect
   of the efficient cause, as light by the absence of the sun. But none of
   these can be applied to the mind. Not the first, because nothing can be
   conceived contrary to the mind; nay, such is the peculiar nature of it,
   that it is capable equally, and at the same time, of contrary things in
   its own, that is, in an intellectual, manner. Not the second, because
   there is no subject upon which the nature of the soul depends; for if
   there were any, it would be a human body; [179] and that it is not so,
   appears from hence, that when the strength of the body fails by action,
   the mind only does not contract any weariness by acting. Also, the
   powers of the body suffer, by the too great power of the things which
   are the objects of them, as sight by the light of the sun. [180] But
   the mind is rendered the more perfect, by bow much the more excellent
   the things are about which it is conversant; as about figures
   abstracted from matter, and about universal propositions. [181] The
   powers of the body are exercised about those things which are limited
   by time and place, but the mind, about that which is infinite and
   eternal. Therefore, since the mind, in its operations, does not depend
   upon the body, so neither does its existence depend upon it; for we
   cannot judge of the nature of those things which we do not see, but
   from their operations. Neither has the third method of being destroyed
   any place here: for there is no efficient cause from which the mind
   continually flows: not the parents, because the children live after
   they are dead. If we allow any cause at all, from whence the mind
   flows, it can be no other than the first and universal cause, which, as
   to its power, can never fail; and as to its will, that that should
   fail, that is, that God should will the soul to be destroyed, this can
   never be proved by any arguments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] This matter might be handled more exactly, and upon better
   principles of philosophy, if our room would allow it. I. We ought to
   define what we mean by the death of the soul, which would happen, if
   either the substance of the soul were reduced to nothing, or if there
   were so great a change made in it, that it were deprived of the use of
   all its faculties; thus, material things are said to be destroyed, if
   either their substance ceases to be, or if their form be so altered,
   that they are no longer of the same species; as when plants are burnt
   or putrefied; the like to which befals brute creatures. II. It cannot
   be proved that the substance of the soul perishes: for bodies are net
   entirely destroyed, but only divided, and their parts separated front
   each other. Neither can any man prove, that the soul ceases to think,
   which is the life of the soul after the death of the man; for it does
   not follow, that, when the body is destroyed, the mind is destroyed
   too, it having never yet been proved that it is a material substance.
   III. Nor has the contrary yet been made appear, by certain philosophic
   arguments, drawn from the nature of the soul; because we are ignorant
   of it. It is true, indeed, that the soul is not, by its own nature,
   reduced to nothing; neither is the body; this must be done by the
   particular act of their Creator. But it may possibly be without any
   thought or memory; which state, as I before said, may be called the
   death of it. But, IV. If the soul, after the dissolution of the body,
   should remain for ever in that state, and never return to its thought
   or memory again, then there can be no account given of Divine
   Providence, which has been proved to be by the foregoing arguments.
   God's goodness and justice, the love of virtue, and hatred to vice,
   which every one acknowledges in him, would be only empty names; if he
   should confine his benefits to the short and fading good things of this
   life, and make no distinction betwixt virtue and vice; both good and
   bad men equally perishing for ever, without seeing in this life any
   rewards or punishments dispensed to those who have done well or ill:
   and hereby God would cease to be God, that is, the most perfect being;
   which, if we take away, we cannot give any account of almost any other
   thing, as Grotius has sufficiently shewn, by those arguments whereby he
   has demonstrated, that all things were created by God. Since,
   therefore, there is a God, who loves virtue and abhors vice, the souls
   of men must be immortal, and reserved for rewards or punishments in
   another life. But this requires further enlargement. Le Clerc.--The
   proof of the soul's immortality, drawn from the consideration of the
   nature of it, may be seen in its full force in dr. Clarke's letter to
   mr. Dodwell, and the defences of it.

   [179] That there is none, Aristotle proves very well from old men, book
   i. ch. 4. concerning the soul. Also, book iii. ch. 4. he commends
   Anaxagoras for saying, that mind was simple and unmixed, that it might
   distinguish other things.

   [180] Aristotle, book iii. of the soul; "that there is not the like
   weakness in the intellectual part that there is in the sensitive, is
   evident from the organs of sense, and from sensation itself; for there
   can be no sensation, where the object of such sensation is too strong;
   that is, where the sound is too loud, there is no sound; and where the
   smell is too strong, or the colours too bright, they cannot be smelt,
   nor seen. But the mind, when it considers things most excellent to the
   understanding, it is not hindered by them from thinking, any more than
   it is by meaner things, but rather excited by them: because the
   sensitive part cannot be separated from the body, but the mind may."
   Add to this, the famous place of Plotinus, quoted by Eusebius, in his
   Preparat. book xv. chap. 22. Add also, that the mind can overcome those
   passions which arise from the body, by its own power; and can choose
   the greatest pains, and even the death of it.

   [181] And those are the most excellent actions of the mind which call
   it off most from the body.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XXIV. But many things favour it.

   NAY, there are many not inconsiderable arguments for the contrary; such
   as, the absolute power every man has over his own actions; [182] a
   natural desire of immortality; the power of conscience, which comforts
   him when he has performed any good actions, though never so difficult;
   and, on the contrary, torments him when he has done any bad thing;
   [183] especially at the approach of death, as it were, with a sense of
   impending judgment; the force of which many times could not be
   extinguished by the worst of tyrants, [184] though they have
   endeavoured it never so much; as appears by many examples.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [182] And over all other living creatures, to which may be added, the
   knowledge of God, and of immortal beings. "An immortal creature is not
   understood by any mortal one," says Sallust the philosopher. One
   remarkable token of this knowledge is, that there is nothing so
   grievous, which the mind will not despise, for the sake of God. Beside,
   the power of understanding and acting is not limited, as it is in other
   creatures, but unwearied, and extends itself infinitely, and is by this
   means like unto God; which difference of man from other creatures was
   taken notice or by Galen.

   [183] See Plato's first book of his commonwealth: "When death seems to
   approach any me, fear and solicitude come upon him about those things
   which before he did not think of."

   [184] Witness that epistle of Tiberius to the senate: "What should
   write to you, O senators, or how I should write, or what I should not
   write, at this time, let the gods and goddesses destroy me, worse than
   I now feel myself to perish, if I know." Which words, after Tacitus had
   recited in the sixth of his annals, he adds, "So far did his crimes and
   wickedness turn to big punishment. So true is that assertion of the
   wisest of men, that, if the breasts of tyrants were laid open, we might
   behold the gnawings and stingings of them; for as the body is bruised
   with stripes, so the mind is torn with rage, and lust, and evil
   designs." The person which Tacitus here means is Plato, who says of a
   tyrant, in book ix. of his commonwealth; "He would appear to be in
   reality a beggar, if any one could but see into his whole soul; full of
   fears all his life long, full of uneasiness and torment." The same
   philosopher has something like this in his Gorgias. Suetonius, ch. 67.
   being about to recite the fore-mentioned epistle of Tiberias,
   introduces It thus "At last, when he was quite wearied out, in the
   beginning of such an epistle as this, he confesses almost all his
   evils." Claudian had an eye to this place of Plato, when he describes
   Rufinus in his second poem:--

   ------Stains within

   Deform his breast, which bears the stamp of vice.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XXV. From whence it follows, that the end of man is happiness after this
  life.

   IF then the soul be of such a nature as contains in it no principles of
   corruption; and God has given us many tokens, by which we ought to
   understand, that his will is it should remain after the body; there can
   be no end of man proposed more worthy of him, than the happiness of
   that state; and this is what Plato and the Pythagoreans said, that the
   end of man was to be made most like to God. [185] Thus, what happiness
   is, and how to be secured, men may make some conjectures; but if there
   be any thing concerning it revealed from God, that ought to be esteemed
   roost trite and most certain.

  SECT. XXVI. Which we must secure, by finding out the true religion.

   Now, since the Christian religion recommends itself above all others;

   the second part of this work to examine.

CHRISTIAN RELIGION

BOOK II.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. I. That the Christian religion is true.

   THE design, then, of this second book (after having put up our
   petitions to Christ the King of heaven, that be would afford us such
   assistances of his holy Spirit, as may render us sufficient for so
   great a business) is not to treat particularly of all the opinions in
   Christianity, but only to shew that the Christian religion itself is
   most true and certain; which we attempt thus:--
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. II. The proof that there was such a person as Jesus.

   THAT Jesus of Nazareth formerly lived in Judæa, in the reign of
   Tiberius the Roman emperor, is constantly acknowledged, not only by
   Christians dispersed all over the world, but also by all the Jews which
   now are, or have ever wrote since that time: the same is also testified
   by heathens, that is, such as did not write either of the Jewish or of
   the Christian religion, Suetonius, [186] Tacitus, [187] Pliny the
   younger, [188] and many after these.

   That he died an ignominious death.

   THAT the same Jesus was crucified by Pontius Pilate, the president of
   Judæa, is acknowledged by all the same Christians, notwithstanding it
   might seem dishonourable to them who worship such a Lord. It is also
   acknowledged by the Jews, [189] though they are not ignorant how much
   they lie under the displeasure of the Christians, under whose
   government they every where live, upon this account, because their
   ancestors were the cause of Pilate's doing it. Likewise, the heathen
   writers we mentioned have recorded the same to posterity; and, a long
   time after, the acts of Pilate were extant, to which the Christians
   sometimes appealed. [190] Neither did Julian, or other opposers of
   Christianity, ever call it in question. So that no history can be
   imagined more certain than this; which is confirmed by the testimonies,
   I don't say, of so many men, but of so many people, which differed from
   each other. Notwithstanding which, we find him worshipped as Lord
   throughout the most distant countries of the world. [191]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [186] In his Claudius, chap. 25. where Chresto is put for Christo,
   because that name was more known to the Greeks and Latins.

   [187] Book xv. where he is speaking of the punishment of the
   Christians. "The author of that name was Christ, who, in the reign of
   Tiberius, suffered punishment under his procurator Pontius Pilate."
   Where the great crimes, and hatred to human-kind, they are charged
   with, is nothing else but their contempt of false gods; which same
   reason Tacitus had to curse the Jews; and Pliny the elder, when be
   calls the Jews "a people remarkable for contempt of the gods." That is,
   very many of the Romans were come to this, that their consciences were
   not affected by that part of their theology which was civil, (which
   Seneca commends), but they feigned it in their outward actions, and
   kept it as a command of the law; looking upon worship as a thing of
   custom, more than in reality. See the opinion of Varro and Seneca about
   this matter, which is the same with that of Tacitus, in Augustine, book
   v. chap. 33. and book vi. chap. 10. of his city of God. In the mean
   time, it is worth observing, that Jesus, who was punished by Pontius
   Pilate, was acknowledged by many at Rome, in Nero's time, to be the
   Christ. Compare that of Justin in his second Apologetic concerning this
   history; where he addresses himself to the emperors and Roman senate,
   who might know those things from the Acts.

   [188] The epistle is obvious to every one, viz. book x. chap. 97. which
   Tertullian mentions in his Apologetic, and Eusebius in his Chronicon;
   where we find, that the Christians were used to say a hymn to Christ as
   God, and to bind themselves not to perform any wicked thing, but to
   forbear committing theft, robbery, or adultery; to be true to their
   word, and strictly perform their trust. Pliny blames their stubbornness
   and inflexible obstinacy in this one thing; that they would not invoke
   the gods, nor do homage with frankincense and wine before the shrines
   of deities, nor curse Christ; nor could they be compelled to do it by
   any torments whatsoever. The epistle in answer to that of Trajan says,
   that he openly declares himself to be no Christian who supplicates the
   Roman gods. Origen, in his fourth book against Celsus, tells us, there
   was a certain history of Jesus extant in Numenius the Pythagorean.

   [189] Who call him tlvy, that is, hanged. Benjaminis Tudelensis, In his

   [190] See Epiphanius in his Tessarescædecatitæ.--(It were better to
   have omitted this argument, because some imprudent Christians might
   appeal to some spurious acts; for it does not appear there were any
   genuine ones. Le Clerc.)

  SECT III. And yet, after his death, was worshipped by wise men.

   AND that not only in our age, or those immediately foregoing, but also
   even in the first, the age next to that in which it was done, in the
   reign of the emperor Nero; at which time the fore-mentioned Tacitus and
   others attest, that very many were punished because they professed the
   worship of Christ.

  SECT. IV. The cause of which could be no other but those miracles which were
  done by him.

   AND there were always very many amongst the worshippers of Christ who
   were men of good judgment, and of no small learning; such as (not to
   mention Jews) Sergius the president of Cyprus, [192] Dionysius the
   Areopagite, [193] Polycarp, [194] Justin, [195] Irenæus, [196]
   Athenagoras, [197] Origen, [198] Tertullian, [199] Clemens
   Alexandrinus, and others: [200] who being such men, why they should
   themselves be worshippers of a man that was put to an ignominious
   death, especially when almost all of them were brought up in other
   religions, and there was neither honour nor profit to be had by the
   Christian religion; why, I say, they should do thus, there can be no
   reason given but this one; that upon a diligent inquiry, such as
   becomes prudent men to make, in a matter of the highest concern to
   them, they found, that the report which was spread abroad, concerning
   the miracles that were done by him, was true, and founded upon
   sufficient testimony; such as healing sore diseases, and those of a
   long continuance, only by a word, and this publicly; restoring sight to
   him that was born blind; increasing bread for the feeding of many
   thousands, who were all witnesses of it; restoring the dead to life
   again, and many other such like.

  SECT. V. Which miracles cannot be ascribed to any natural or diabolical power,
  but must be from God.

   WHICH report had so certain and undoubted a foundation, that neither
   Celsus, [201] nor Julian, [202] when they wrote against the Christians,
   dared to deny that some miracles were done by Christ; the Hebrews also
   confess it openly in the books of the Talmud. [203] That they were not
   performed by any natural power, sufficiently appears from hence, that
   they are called wonders or miracles; nor can it ever be that grievous
   distempers should be healed immediately, only by a word speaking, or a
   touch, by the power of nature. If those works could have been accounted
   for by any natural efficacy, it would have been said so at first, by
   those who either professed themselves enemies of Christ when he was
   upon earth, or of his gospel. By the like argument, we gather, that
   they were not juggling tricks, because very many of the works were done
   openly, in the sight of all the people; [204] and amongst whom were
   many learned men, who bore no good-will to Christ, who observed all his
   works. To which we may add, that the like works were often repeated,
   and the effects were not of a short continuance, but lasting. All
   which, rightly considered, as it ought to be, it will plainly follow,
   according to the Jews' own confession, that these works were done by
   some power more than human, that is, by some good or bad spirit; that
   these works were not the effects of any bad spirit, is from hence
   evident, that this doctrine of Christ, for the proof of which these
   works were performed, was opposite to those evil spirits: for it
   forbids the worship of evil spirits; it draws men off from all
   immorality, in which such spirits delight. It appears also, from the
   things themselves, that wherever this doctrine has been received, the
   worship of demons and magical arts have ceased; [205] and the one God
   has been worshipped, with an abhorrence of demons; whose strength and
   power, Porphyry acknowledges, were broken upon the coming of Christ.
   [206] And it is not at all credible, that any evil spirits should be so
   imprudent, as to do those things, and that very often, from which no
   honour or advantage could arise to them, but, on the contrary, great
   loss and disgrace. Neither is it any way consistent with the goodness
   or wisdom of God, that he should be thought to suffer men, who were
   free from all wicked designs, and who feared him, to be deceived by the
   cunning of devils; and such were the first disciples of Christ, as is
   manifest from their unblameable life, and their suffering very many
   calamities for conscience-sake. If any one should say, that these works
   were done by good beings, who yet are inferior to God; this is to
   confess, that they were well-pleasing to God, and redounded to his
   honour; because good beings do nothing but what is acceptable to God,
   and for his glory. Not to mention that some of the works of Christ were
   such as seem to declare God himself to be the author of them, such as
   the raising more than one of those that were dead to life. Moreover,
   God neither does nor suffers miracles to be done without a reason; for
   it does not become a wise lawgiver to depart from his laws without a
   reason, and that a weighty one. Now, no other reason can be given why
   these things were done, but that which is alleged by Christ, viz. to
   give credit to his doctrine; [207] nor could they who beheld them
   conceive any other reason in their minds: amongst whom, since there
   were many of a pious disposition, as was said before, it would be
   profane to think God should do them, to impose upon such. And this was
   the sole reason why many of the Jews, who lived near the time of Jesus,
   who yet could not be brought to depart from any thing of the law given
   by Moses, [208] (such as they who were called Nazarenes and Ebionites),
   nevertheless owned Jesus to be a teacher sent front heaven.

   mankind embraced the Christian religion, shows that it was a thing so
   worthy of God, as for him to confirm it with miracles at the beginning.
   If he did so many for the sake of one nation, and that no very great
   one, I mean the Jewish; how much more agreeable to his goodness was it
   to bestow this heavenly light to so great a part of mankind, who lay in
   the thickest darkness! Le Clerc.

   law; and the church had a priest out of those of the circumcision." See

   was a name not for any particular part, but all the Christians in

  SECT. VI. The resurrection of Christ proved from credible testimony.

   CHRIST'S coming to life again in a wonderful manner, after his
   crucifixion, death, and burial, affords us no less strong an argument
   for those miracles that were done by Lim. For the Christians of all
   times and places assert this not only for a truth, but as the principal
   foundation of their faith: which could not be, unless they, who first
   taught the Christian faith, had fully persuaded their hearers that the
   thing did conic to pass. Now, they could nut fully persuade men of any
   judgment of ibis, unless they affirmed themselves to be eye-witnesess
   of it; for, without such an affirmation, no man in his senses would
   have believed them, especially at that time, when such a belief was
   attended with so many evils and dangers. That this was affirmed by them
   with great constancy, their own books, and the books of others, [209]
   tell us; nay, it appears from those books, that they appealed to five
   hundred witnesses, who saw Jesus after he was risen from the dead.
   [210] Now, it is not usual for those that speak untruths to appeal to
   so many witnesses. Nor is it possible so many men should agree to bear
   a false testimony. And if there had been no other witnesses but those
   twelve known first propagators of the Christian doctrine, it had been
   sufficient. Nobody has any ill design for nothing. They could not hope
   for any honour, from saying what was not true, because all the honours
   were in the power of the heathens and Jews, by whom they were
   reproached and contemptuously treated: nor for riches, because, on the
   contrary, this profession was often attended with the loss of their
   goods, if they had any; and if it had been otherwise, yet the gospel
   could not have been taught by them, but with the neglect of their
   temporal goods. Nor could any other advantages of this life provoke
   them to speak a falsity, when the very preaching of the gospel exposed
   them to hardship, to hunger and thirst, to stripes and imprisonment.
   Fame, amongst themselves only. was not so great, that for the sake
   thereof, men of upright intentions, whose lives and tenets were free
   from pride and ambition, should undergo so many evils. Nor had they any
   ground to hope that their opinion, which was so repugnant to nature,
   (which is wholly bent upon its own advantages), and to the authority
   which every where governed, could make so great a progress, but from a
   divine promise. Further, they could not promise to themselves that this
   fame, whatever it was, would be lasting; because (God on purpose
   concealing his intention in this matter from them) they expected that
   the end of the whole world was just at hand, as is plain from their own
   writings, and those of the Christians that came after them. [211] It
   remains, therefore, that they must be said to have uttered a falsity,
   for the sake of defending their religion; which, if we consider the
   thing aright, can never be said of them; for either they believed from
   their heart that their religion was true, or they did not believe it.
   If they had not believed it to have been the best, they would never
   have chosen it from all other religions, which were more safe and
   honourable. Nay, though they believed it to be true, they would not
   have made profession of it, unless they had believed such a profession
   necessary; especially when they could easily foresee, and they quickly
   learnt by experience, that such a profession would be attended with the
   death of a vast number; and they would have been guilty of the highest
   wickedness, to have given such occasion, without a just reason. If they
   believed their religion to be true, nay, that it was the best, and
   ought to be professed by all means, and this after the death of their
   Master; it was impossible this should be, if their Master's promise
   concerning his resurrection had failed them; for this had been
   sufficient to any man, in his senses, to have overthrown that belief
   which he had before entertained. [212] Again, all religion, but
   particularly the Christian religion, forbids lying and false witness,
   especially in divine matters: [213] they could not therefore be moved
   to tell a lie out of love to religion, especially such a religion. To
   all which may be added, that they were men who led such a life as was
   not blamed even by their adversaries; [214] and who had no objection
   made against them, but only their simplicity, the nature of which is
   the most distant that can be from forging a lie. And there was none of
   them who did not undergo even the most grievous things for their
   profession of the resurrection of Jesus. Many of them endured the most
   exquisite death for this testimony. Now, suppose it possible, that any
   man in his wits could undergo such things for an opinion he had
   entertained in his mind; yet for a falsity, and which is known to be a
   falsity, that not only one man, but very many, should be willing to
   endure such hardships, is a thing plainly incredible. And that they
   were not mad, both their lives and their writings sufficiently testify.
   What has been said of these first, the same may also be said of Paul,
   who openly declared that he saw Christ reigning in heaven, [215] and he
   did not want the learning of the Jews, but had great prospect of
   honour, if he had trod in the paths of his fathers. [216] But, on the
   contrary, he thought it. his duty, for this profession, to expose
   himself to the hatred of his relations; and to undertake difficult,
   dangerous, and troublesome, voyages all over the world, and at last to
   suffer an ignominious death.

  SECT. VII. The objection drawn from the seeming impossibility of a
  resurrection, answered.

   INDEED, nobody can withstand the credibility of so many and so great
   testimonies, without saying, that a thing of this nature is impossible
   to be, such as we say all things that imply a contradiction are. But
   this cannot be said of it. [217] It might indeed, if any one should
   affirm, that the same person was alive and dead at the same time: but
   that a dead man should be restored to life, by the power of him who
   first gave life to man, there is no reason why this should be thought
   impossible. [218] Neither did wise men believe it to be impossible: for
   Plato relates it of Er the Armenian; [219] Heraclides Ponticus, of a
   certain woman; [220] Herodotus, of Aristæus; [221] and Plutarch, of
   another: [222] which, whether they were true or false, shews the
   opinion of learned men, concerning the possibility of the thing.

   The truth of Jesus's doctrine proved from his resurrection.

   IF it be not impossible that Christ should return to life again, and if
   it be proved from sufficient testimonies, such as convinced Bechai, a
   teacher of the Jews, so far as to acknowledge the truth of it; [223]
   and Christ himself (as both his own disciples and strangers confess)
   declared a new doctrine, as by a divine command, it will certainly
   follow, that this doctrine is true; because it is repugnant to the
   justice and wisdom of God to bestow such endowments upon him who had
   been guilty of a falsity, in a matter of so great moment. Especially
   when he had, before his death, declared to his disciples that he should
   die, and what manner of death; and also that he should return to life
   again; and that these things should therefore come to pass, that they
   might confirm the truth of his doctrine. [224]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [217] See the seventh answer to the objections concerning the
   resurrection, in the works of Justin. "An impossibility in itself is
   one thing; and an impossibility in any particular is another; an
   impossibility in itself is, that the diagonal of a square should be
   commensurate with the side; a particular impossibility is, that nature
   should produce an animal without seed. To which of these two kinds of
   impossibles do unbelievers compare the resurrection? If to the first,
   their reasoning is false; for a new creation is not like making the
   diagonal commensurate with the aide; but they that rise again, rise by
   a new creation. If they mean a particular impossibility; surely all
   things are possible with God, though they may be impossible to any one
   else." Concerning this difference of impossibilities, see the learned
   notes of Maimonides, in his guide to the doubting, part iii. ch. 15.

   [218] All those, who are skilful in the true philosophy, acknowledge
   that it is as hard to understand how the foetus is formed in the
   mother's womb, as how the dead should be raised to life. But ignorant
   men are not at all surprised at the things which they commonly see; nor
   do they account them difficult, though they know not the reason of
   them: but they think those things which they never saw are impossible
   to be done, though they are not at all more difficult than those things
   they see every day. Le Clerc.

   [219] The place of Plato concerning this matter is extant in his tenth
   book of Republics, transcribed by Eusebius, in his Gospel Preparat.

   book i. chap. 8. the first foreign example; in the hortatory discourse
   among the works of Justin; in Clemens, Strom v.; in Origen, book ii.
   against Celsus; in Plutarch, Symposiac ix. 5.; and in Macrobius, in the
   beginning, upon Scipio's dream.

   [220] There was a book of his "concerning the dead," mentioned by
   Diogenes Laërtius in his preface, and in his Empedocles; and by Galen,
   in the sixth, concerning the parts that are affected. Pliny speaks thus
   of him, book vii. chap. 52. "That noble volume of Heraclides amongst
   the Greeks, of a woman's being restored to life, after she had been
   dead seven days." And Diogenes Laërtius, in the latter place, assigns
   her thirty days.

   [223] It were to be wished that Grotius had quoted the place; for
   though his reasoning, drawn from the resurrection of Christ, does rot
   want the approbation of R. Bechai, yet perhaps the Jews might be
   affected with his authority. Le Clerc.

  SECT. VIII. That the Christian religion exceeds all others.

   THESE arguments are drawn from matters of fact; we come now to those
   which are drawn from the nature of the doctrine. Certainly all manner
   of worship of God must be rejected; (which can never enter into any
   man's mind, who has any sense of the existence of God, and of his
   government of the creation; and who considers the excellency of man's
   understanding, and the power of choosing moral good or evil, with which
   he is endued; and consequently that the cause, as of reward, so of
   punishment, is in himself); or else we must receive this religion, not
   only upon the testimony of the facts which we have now treated of, but
   likewise for the sake of those things that are intrinsical in religion;
   since there cannot be any produced, in any age or nation, whose rewards
   are more excellent, or whose precepts are more perfect, or the method
   in which it was commanded to be propagated more wonderful.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. IX. The excellency of the reward proposed.

   To begin with the reward, that is, with the end proposed to man;
   because, as we are used to say, that which is the last in execution is
   the first in intention.--Moses, [225] in his institution of the Jewish
   religion, if we regard the express condition of the law, made no
   promises beyond the good things of this life; such as a fruitful land,
   abundance of riches, victory over their enemies, long life and health,
   and hope of their posterities surviving them. And if there be any thing
   more, it is only obscurely hinted, and must be collected from wise and
   strong arguing: which is the reason why many, who professed to follow
   the law of Moses, (as the Sadducees, [226] ) cast off all hope of
   enjoying any good after this life. The Greeks, who derived their
   learning from the Chaldeans and Egyptians, and who had some hope of
   another life after this, spoke very doubtfully concerning it, [227] as
   is evident from the disputes of Socrates, [228] and from the writings
   of Tully, [229] Seneca, [230] and others. [231] And, though they
   searched diligently for arguments to prove it, they could offer nothing
   of certainty. For those which they allege hold generally as strong for
   beasts as they do for men. [232] Which when some of them considered, it
   is no wonder that they imagined that souls passed out of men into
   beasts, and out of beasts into men. [233] Again; because this could not
   be proved by any testimonies, nor by any certain arguments, and yet it
   could not be denied but that there must be some end proposed for man;
   therefore others were led to say, that virtue was its own reward, and
   that a wise man was very happy, though in Phalaris's bull. [234] But
   others disliked this, and not without reason; for they saw very well,
   that happiness, especially in the highest degree, (unless we regard
   only the sound of words, without any meaning), could not consist in
   that which is attended with danger, loss, torment, and death: [235] and
   therefore they placed the chief good and end of man in sensual
   pleasure. And this opinion likewise was solidly confuted by very many,
   as a thing which overthrew all virtue, the seeds of which are planted
   in the mind; and degraded man, who was made for nobler purposes, to the
   rank of brute creatures, who look no further than the earth. In so many
   doubts and uncertainties did mankind at that time wander, till Christ
   discovered the true knowledge of their end; promising to his disciples
   and followers another life after this, in which there should be no more
   death, pain, or sorrow, but accompanied with the highest joy; and this
   not only to one part of man, that is, his soul, of whose happiness
   after this life there was some hope, partly front conjecture, and
   partly from tradition; but also to the body, and that very justly, that
   the body, which oftentimes ought to endure great losses, torments, and
   death, for the sake of the divine law, might not go without a
   recompence. And the joys which are promised are not such mean things as
   those feasts which the duller Jews hoped for after this life, [236] and
   the embraces which the Mahometans promise to themselves; [237] for
   these are only proper remedies for the mortality of this frail life;
   the former, for the preservation of particular animals, and the latter,
   for the continuance of their species: but the body will be in a
   perpetual vigour, and its brightness will exceed the stars. The mind
   will have a knowledge of God and of Divine Providence, and of whatever
   is now hidden from it, without any mistake; the will will be calm,
   employed in wonder and praises, in beholding God; in a word, all things
   will be much greater and better than can be convinced by comparing them
   with the greatest and best here.

   [226] Matt. xxii. 23. Luke, in Acts xxiii. 8. Josephus: "The Sadducces
   argue, that the soul perishes with the body." And, in another place,
   "They deny the soul's immortality, and rewards and punishments in
   another life." Jerom says of them, "That they believe the soul perishes
   with the body."

   [227] This is observed by Chrysostom, on 1 Cor. i. 25.

   [228] In Plato's Phædon: "Now I would have you to understand, that I
   hope to go amongst good men; but I will not be too positive in
   affirming it." And afterwards, "If those things I am speaking of should
   prove true, it is very well to be thus persuaded concerning them; but
   if there be nothing after death, yet I shah always be the less
   concerned for the present things of this life; and this my ignorance
   will not continue long, (for that would be bad), but will shortly
   vanish." And Tertullian, concerning the soul: "From such a firm
   steadiness and goodness of mind did that wisdom of Socrates proceed,
   and not from any certain discovery of the truth." The same is observed
   of Socrates, in the exhortation among the works of Justin.

   [229] In his first Tusculan question; "Shew me first, if you can, and
   it be not too troublesome, that souls remain after death; or, if you
   cannot prove this, (for it is difficult), declare how there is no evil
   in death." And a little after: "I know not what mighty thing they have
   got by it, who teach, that, when the time of death comes, they shall
   entirely perish; which, if it should be, (for I do not say any thing to
   the contrary), what ground of joy or glorying does it afford?" And
   again, "Now suppose the soul should perish with the body, can there be
   any pain, or can there be any sense at all in the body after death?
   Nobody will say so." Lactantius, book vii. chap. 8. cites the following
   passage out of the same Cicero, spoken after a dispute about the soul:
   "Which of these opinions is true, God only knows."

   [230] Epistle lxiii. "And perhaps (if the report of wise men be true,
   and any place receives us) that which we think perishes, is only sent
   before."

   [231] Justin Martyr says in general, in his dialogue with Trypho: "The
   philosophers knew nothing of these things, nor can they tell what the
   soul is."

   [232] As that argument of Socrates to Plato, that "that which moves of
   itself is eternal." See Lactantius, in the fore-mentioned place.

   [233] As the Brachmans of old, and now also; from whom Pythagoras and
   his scholars had it.

   [234] See Tully's second Tusc. question; and Lactantius's institutions,

   and Augustin, epist. lii.

   [235] Lactantius, boor iii. chap. 12. "Virtue Is not its own happiness,
   because the whole power of it consists, as I said, in bearing evils."
   And a little after, when he had quoted a place of Seneca's, he adds:
   "But the stoics, whom he follows, deny that any one can be happy
   without virtue. Therefore the reward of virtue is a happy life; if
   virtue, as is rightly said, makes life happy. Virtue, therefore, is not
   to be desired for its own sake, as they affirm, but for the sake of a
   happy life, which necessarily attends virtue: which argument might
   instruct them what is the chief good. But this present bodily life
   cannot be happy, because it is subject to evils, by means of the body."
   Pliny, in his nat. hist. book vii. chap. 40. says well, "That no mortal
   man is happy."

  SECT. X. A solution of the objection taken from hence, that the bodies after
  their dissolution cannot be restored.

   BESIDES the objection which we have now answered, it is commonly
   alleged, that the bodies of men, after their dissolution, cannot be
   restored to the same frame again; but this is said without the least
   foundation. For most philosophers agree, that, though the things be
   ever so much changed, the matter of them still remains, capable of
   being formed into different shapes; [238] and who will affirm, that God
   does not know at what places, though ever so far distant, the parts of
   that matter are, which go to the making up of a human body? or, that he
   has not power to bring them back and reunite them? and do the same in
   the universe, that we see chemists do in their furnaces and vessels,
   collect those particles which are of the same kind, though separated
   from one another? And there are examples in nature, which shew, that
   though the shape of things be ever so much changed, yet the things
   themselves return to their original form; as in seeds of trees and
   plants. Neither is that knot, which is objected by so many, such as
   cannot be loosed, viz. concerning human bodies passing into nourishment
   of wild beasts and cattle; who, after they are thus fed, are eaten
   again by men. For the greatest part of what is eaten by us is not
   converted into any part of our body, but goes into excrements or
   superfluities, such as spittle and choler: and much of that which has
   nourishment in it is consumed by diseases, internal heat, and the
   ambient air. Which being thus, God, who takes such care of all kinds,
   even of dumb creatures, may have such a particular regard to human
   bodies, that if any part of them should come to be food for other men,
   it should no more be converted into their substance, than poison or
   physic is; and so much the rather, because human flesh was not given to
   be food for men. And if it were otherwise, and that something which
   does not belong to the latter body must be taken from it, this will not
   make it a different body; for there happens a greater change of its
   particles in this life: [239] nay, a butterfly is contained in a worm;
   [240] and the substance of herbs, or of wine, in some very little
   thing, from whence they are again restored to their true bigness, [241]
   Certainly, since these, and many other such like suppositions, may be
   made without any absurdity, there is no reason why the restoring of a
   body, after it is dissolved, should be reckoned amongst the things that
   are impossible; especially since learned men, such as Zoroaster amongst
   the Chaldeans, [242] almost all the stoics, [243] and Theopompus, [244]
   among the peripatetics, believed that it could be, and that it would
   be.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [238] If any one be not satisfied with this account of Grotius, he may
   be answered, that it is not at all necessary that the matter which is
   raised should be numerically the same with that which the dying man
   carried to the grave with him; for he will be as much the same man,
   though his soul were joined to matter which it was never before joined
   to, provided it be the same soul, as a decrepit old man is the same as
   he was when a child crying in the cradle, though perhaps there is not
   in the old man one particle of that matter there was in the infant, by
   reason of the continual effluvia which fly from the body. It may very
   well be called a resurrection of the body, when a like one is formed by
   God out of the earth, and joined to the mind; therefore there is no
   need of reducing ourselves to so great straits, in order to defend too
   stitily the sameness of the matter. Le Clerc.

   [239] See Alfenus, in lib. Proponebar. D. de Judiciis: "If any one
   should think, that, by altering the parts, any thing is made different
   from what it was before; according to such reasoning, we ourselves
   should be different from what we were a year since: because, as
   philosophers say, those small parts, of which we consist, continually
   fly off from our bodies, and other foreign ones come in their room."
   And Seneca, ep. lviii. "Our bodies are in a continual flux, like a
   river; all that we see runs away as time does: none of those things we
   see are durable. I myself am changed, while I am speaking of their
   change." See Methodius's excellent dissertation upon this subject,
   whose words Epiphanius has preserved in his confutation of the
   Origenists, number xii. xiii. xiv. xv.

   [240] See Ovid in the last book of his Metamorphoses:--

   "Wild moths (a thing by countrymen observ'd)

   Betwixt the leaves in tender threads involv'd,

   Transform their shape into a butterfly."
   We may add something out of Pliny's natural history, book ix. chap. 51.
   concerning frogs: he says, "For half a year of their life they are
   turned into mud, and cannot be seen; and, by the waters in the spring,
   those which were formerly bred, are bred again afresh." And in book x.
   chapter 9. "The cuckow seems to be made of a hawk, changing his shape
   in the time of year." And book xi. chap. 20. "There are who think, that
   some creatures which are dead, if they be kept in the house in water,
   will come to life again, after the sun shines hot upon them in the
   spring, and they be kept warm all day in wood ashes." And again, chap.
   22. speaking of silk-worms, "Another original of them may be from a
   larger sort of worm, which shoots forth a double kind of horns; these
   are called canker-worms, and afterwards become what they call the
   humble-bee; from whence comes another sort of insect. termed Necydalus,
   which, in six months time, turns into a silkworm." And again, chap. 23.
   speaking of the silk-worm of Coos, he says, "They were first small and
   naked butterflies." And chap. 26. concerning the grasshopper; " It is
   first a small worn, but afterwards comes out of what they call
   Tettygometra, whose shell being broke, they fly away about midsummer."
   Chap. 30. "Flies drowned in liquor, if they be buried in ashes, return
   to life again." And chap. 32. "Many insects are bred in another manner.
   And first the horse-fly, out of the dew: in the beginning of the
   spring, it sticks to a radish-leaf, and being stiffened by the sun, it
   gathers into the bigness of a millet. Out of this springs a small worm,
   and, in three days after, a canker-worm, which increases in g few days,
   having a hard shell about it, and moves at the touch of a spider; this
   canker-worm, which they call a chrysalis, when the shell is broken,
   flies away a butterfly."

   [241] If Grotius had lived till our days, he would have spoken more
   fully; since it is evident that all animals, of whatever kind, spring
   from an egg, in which they are formed, as all plants do from seeds,
   though never so small. But this is nothing to the resurrection, for
   bodies will not rise again out of such principles. Le Clerc.

   [242] See Clemens, Strom. v.

   [243] Clemens, Strom. v. "He (Heraclitus) knew, having learnt it from
   the barbarian philosophy, that men who lived wickedly should be
   purified by fire, which the stoics call ekpu'rosin, whereby they
   imagine every one shall rise again such a one as he really is: thus
   they treat of the resurrection." And Origen, book v. against Celsus:
   "The stoics say, that, after a certain period of time, the universe
   shall be burnt, and after that shall be a renovation, in which all
   things shall continue unchangeable." And afterwards: "They have not the
   name of the resurrection, but they have the thing." Origen here adds
   the Egyptians. Chrysippus, concerning Providence, quoted by Lactantius,
   book vi. of his Institutions, has these words; "Which being thus there
   is evidently no impossibility, but that we also, when we are dead,
   after a certain period of time is past, may be restored again to the
   same state in which we now are." He that is at leisure may look into
   Nathaniel Carpenter's sixteenth exercise of free philosophy.

   [244] Concerning whom, see Diogenes Laërtius in the beginning of his
   book. "And Theopompus in his eighth Philippic relates, as the opinion
   of the wise men, that men shall live again, and become immortal, and
   every thing shall continue what it is."

  SECT. XI. The exceeding purity of its precepts, with respect to the worship of
  God.

   ANOTHER thing, in which the Christian religion exceeds all other
   religions that ever were, are, or eau be imagined, is the exceeding
   purity and holiness of its precepts, both in those things which concern
   the worship of God, and also in all ether particulars. The rites of the
   heathens, almost all over the world, were full of cruelty; as Porphyry
   has largely shewn; [245] and as we are convinced, by those in our age,
   who have sailed to those places. For it is an established principle,
   almost every where, that the gods are to he pacified with human blood;
   which custom neither the Greek learning, nor the Roman laws, abolished:
   as appears from what we read concerning sacrifices offered up to
   Bacchus Omesta, amongst the Greeks; [246] concerning a Grecian man and
   a Grecian woman, and concerning a man and woman amongst the Gauls, that
   were sacrificed to Jupiter Latialis. [247] And the most holy mysteries,
   both of Ceres and of Bacchus, were full of lewdness; as was plain, when
   once the secrets of their religion began to be publicly discovered; as
   is at large declared by Clemens Alexandrinus, [248] and others. [249]
   And there were such sights shewn upon those days, that were consecrated
   to the honour of their gods, that Cato was ashamed to be present at
   them. [250] In the Jewish religion, indeed, there was nothing unlawful
   or immoral; but to prevent that people, who were prone to idolatry,
   [251] from revolting from the true religion, it was burthened with many
   precepts, concerning things that were in themselves neither good nor
   bad: such as the sacrifices of beasts, circumcision, strict rest on the
   sabbath day, and the forbidding many sorts of meats; some of which the
   Mahometans have borrowed, and added to them a prohibition of wine. But
   the Christian religion teaches us to worship God, who is a most holy
   Being, with a pure mind, [252] and with such actions as are in their
   own nature virtuous, if they had not been commanded. [253] Thus, it
   does not bid us to circumcise our flesh, but our desires and
   affections: [254] not to abstain from all sorts of works, but only from
   all such as are unlawful: [255] not to offer the blood and fat of
   beasts in sacrifice to God; but, if there be a just occasion, to offer
   our own blood for a testimony of the truth: [256] and whatever share of
   our goods we give to the poor, we are to look upon as given to God:
   [257] not to forbear certain kinds of meat or drink, but to use both of
   them with such temperance as may most secure our health; [258] and
   sometimes, by fasting, to render our bodies more subservient to the
   mind, that it may with more freedom advance itself towards higher
   objects. [259] But the chief part of religion is every where declared
   to consist in such a godly faith, [260] by which we may be framed to
   such a sincere obedience, [261] as to trust wholly upon God, [262] and
   have a firm belief of his promises; [263] whence arises hope, [264] and
   a true love both of God and of our neighbour, which causes obedience to
   his commands; [265] not a servile obedience, [266] proceeding from the
   fear of punishment, but because it is well-pleasing to him, [267] and
   because he is our Father, [268] and rewarder, [269] out of his
   exceeding goodness towards us. And we are commanded to pray, [270] not
   to obtain riches or honours, and such other things, which many have
   desired to their own hurt; but, in the first. place, for such things as
   are for the glory of God; and so much only for ourselves of those
   perishable things as nature requires, permitting the rest to Divine
   Providence; being contented, which way soever they happen: but for
   those things that lead to eternity we are to pray with all earnestness,
   viz. for pardon of our past sins, and for the assistance of the Spirit
   for the future; that, being established firmly against all threats and
   temptations, we may continue on in a godly course. This is the worship
   of God required by the Christian religion, than which certainly nothing
   can be conceived more worthy of him.

   [247] Dionysius Halicarnassensis tells us in his first book, that it
   was a very ancient custom in Italy to sacrifice men. How long it
   remained, Pliny says, book xxviii. ch. 2. "Our age hath seen in the
   beast-market a Grecian man and woman slain, or these of some other
   nation with whom they dealt." This custom remained till Justin's and
   Tatian's time: for Justin, in his first Apologetic, addresses the
   Romans thus: "That idol which you worship, to whom not only the blood
   of irrational creatures is poured out, but also human blood; which
   blood of slain men is poured out by the most noble and eminent person
   among you." And Tatian: "I find among the Romans, that Jupiter Latialis
   was delighted with human blood; and with that which flows from men that
   are slain." Porphyry tells us, that these rites remained till Adrian's
   time. That there was a very ancient custom amongst the Gauls of
   offering human sacrifices, we learn from Tully's oration in defence of
   M. Fonteius; and out of Plutarch, concerning superstition. Tiberius
   abolished it, as we find in Pliny, book xxx. chap 1. See the same Pliny
   there, concerning the Britons, and Dion in Nero, and Solinus; also
   Hermoldus concerning the Sclavonians, book i. chap. 3. Porphyry, in his
   second book against eating living creatures, says, that it remained
   till his time in Arcadia, in Carthage, and "in the great city," that
   is, Rome, where he instances in the rite of Jupiter Latialis.

  SECT. XII. Concerning those duties of humanity which owe to our neighbour,
  though he has injured us.

   THE duties towards our neighbour, required of us, are also of the like
   sort. The Mahometan religion, which was bred in arms, breathes nothing
   else; and is propagated by such means only. Thus, Aristotle takes
   notice of, and blames, the laws of the Laconians, [271] (which were so
   highly commended above any other in Greece, even by the oracle of
   Apollo), because they tended directly to force of arms. But the same
   philosopher affirms, that war against barbarians was lawful: whereas
   the contrary is true amongst men, who were designed by nature for
   friendship and society. For, what greater iniquity can there be, than
   to punish single murders, but expose to public view, in their triumphs,
   whole nations whom they had slain, as a glorious exploit? [272] And yet
   that most celebrated city of Rome, how did it procure that title, but
   by wars, and those many times very unjust; [273] as they themselves
   confess concerning the wars against Sardinia [274] and Cyprus? [275]
   And in general, as the most famous compilers of annals have related,
   very many nations did not account it infamous to commit robberies out
   of their own bounds. [276] Executing of revenge is, by Aristotle and
   Cicero, made a part of virtue. [277] The gladiators tearing one another
   to pieces was one of the public entertainments amongst the heathens:
   [278] and to expose their children was a daily practice. [279] The
   Hebrews, indeed, had a better law, a more holy discipline; but yet
   there were some things overlooked or allowed in that people, whose
   passion was ungovernable; such as the giving up to their power seven
   nations, [280] though indeed they deserved it: with which they not
   being contented, persecuted with cruel hatred all that differed from
   them; [281] the marks of which remain even to this day, in their
   prayers uttered against Christians: [282] and the law itself allowed a
   man to revenge an injury by the punishment of retaliation, [283] and
   that a man-slayer might be killed by the private hand of the next
   relation. But the law of Christ forbids requiting any injury that hath
   been done us, either by word or deed; [284] lest, by imitating that
   malice we condemn in others, we should on the contrary approve it. It
   would have us do good, in the first place, to those that are good; and
   then to the bad also, after the example of God, from whom we receive,
   in common with all other men, such gifts as the sun, the stars, the
   air, the winds, and the rain. [285]

   declared their opinions in their writings. For in praising the
   government of the Lacedæmonians, they commend the design of the
   lawgiver, because the whole establishment tended to power and war:
   which may easily be confuted by reason, and is now confuted by fact."
   Euripides, in Andromache, said it before Aristotle,

   ------"If war, and glory,
   And the sword, were from the Spartans taken,

   confiscate the king, though alive, and their ally." Plutarch mentions

   inhabited the islands, after they began to hold correspondence with one
   another by sailing, fell to robbing, led on by great men, either for
   the sake of gain to themselves, or to procure victuals for them that
   wanted. And happening upon cities which were not walled, but inhabited
   like villages, they plundered them, and the greatest part made their
   advantage of them, being not ashamed as yet of doing thus, but rather
   accounting it glorious. This is evidently the practice of some that
   dwell upon the continent now, who account it honourable to do thus;
   and, amongst the ancient poets, it is very frequent for them who met
   sailors, to ask them if they were pirates; knowing that they who were
   so asked would not disown it; nor they who asked them think it any
   reproach. Nay, they robbed one another, upon the very continent; and a
   great many of the Greeks live now in this ancient manner, as the Ozolan
   Locrians, the Ætolians, the Acarnanians, and those of the adjoining
   continent." The question Thucydides here mentions is in Homer's Odyss.

   belong to the law of nature: "Whereby, either in our own defence, or by
   the way of revenge, we keep off force or reproach." And to Atticus: "I
   hate the man, and will hate him: I wish I could revenge myself upon
   him." And against Antony: "I would revenge every single crime,

  SECT. XIII. About the conjunction of male and female.

   THE conjunction of man and woman, whereby mankind is propagated, is a
   thing that highly deserves to be taken care of by law; which that the
   heathen neglected is no wonder, when they relate stories of the
   whoredom and adulteries of those gods which they worshipped. [286] And,
   which is worse, the conjunction of males with one another is defended
   by the examples of their gods; [287] in the number of which, Ganymedes
   of old, and Antinous afterwards, were reckoned upon this account: [288]
   which horrid crime is also often esteemed lawful amongst the
   Mahometans, Chinese, and other nations. The Greek philosophers seem to
   take great pains to put a virtuous name upon a vicious thing. [289] The
   most eminent of which same Greek philosophers, recommending intercourse
   with women, [290] what did they do else but turn a whole city into one
   common stew, when even brute creatures observe some sort of conjugal
   league? [291] How much more reasonable is it then, that man, who is the
   most divine creature, should not be born from an uncertain original,
   whereby the mutual affection betwixt parents and children is destroyed?
   The Hebrew law indeed forbade all uncleanness, but a man was allowed to
   have more wives than one at a time, [292] and the husband had a power
   to put away his wife for any cause whatsoever; [293] which is the
   custom at this day among the Mahometans: and formerly the Greeks and
   Latins took so great a liberty, that the Laconians and Cato permitted
   others to have their wives for a time. [294] But the law of Christ,
   which is most perfect, strikes at the very root of vice, and accounts
   him guilty before God (who can see into and judge the hearts or men)
   that lusts after, though he has not committed, the crime; [295] or that
   attempts the chastity of any woman, or looks upon her with such
   desires. And, because all true friendship is lasting, and not to be
   broke, it would, with very good reason, have that to be so which
   contains the union of their bodies, as well as the agreement of their
   minds; [296] and which, without doubt, is more convenient for a right
   education of their children. Among the heathen, some few nations were
   content with one wife, as the Germans and Romans; and in this they are
   followed by the Christians: [297] namely, that the wife, having
   resigned herself entirely to her husband, may be recompensed with a
   like return; [298] that the government of the family may be better
   managed by one governor, and that different mothers might not bring a
   disturbance in amongst the children. [299]

   [286] See Euripides's Ione:--

   "I can't forbear

   The lewdness of Apollo to reprove,

   Who forces virgins to his nuptial bed,

   And murders his own children privately:

   Is this to practise virtue you enjoin?

   If mortals sin, you gods revenge the wrong;

   And is it just that you, who laws prescribe

   To all mankind, should live by none yourselves?

   Though it will never be, yet I must speak;

   If Phoebus, Neptune, and the King of gods,

   Should punish all unlawful marriages,

   None would remain to worship at their shrines."
   See this matter fully handled by Clemens, in his hortatory discourse;
   by Athenagoras, Tatian, Arnobius, book iv. Nazianzen, in his first
   against Julian, and Theodoret, discourse iii.

   [287] See this also, in the fore-mentioned places of Clemens and
   Theodoret.

   [288] Mentioned by Justin in his second Apologetic; by Clemens In his
   hortatory discourse; by Origen in his second and eighth books against
   Celsus; by Eusebius in his ecclesiastical history, iv. 8. by Theodoret,
   8. and the historians of those times.

   [289] So indeed it was thought, not only by Lucian, in his little book
   concerning love but by Gregory Nazianzen, orat. iii. against Julian;
   and by Elias Cretensis, and Nonnus, upon him. And also by Cyril in his
   sixth book against Julian; and by Theodoret, very largely, in his
   thirteenth book to the Greeks. I cannot omit a place of Philo's, who
   had a great opinion of Plato, out of his book concerning a
   contemplative life: "Plato's feast is spent almost wholly upon love,
   not only of men eager after women, and women eager after men; for such
   desires may be satisfied by the law of nature; but of men after men,
   differing from themselves only in age; and if any thing be speciously
   said concerning love and heavenly Venus, those names are used only for
   a cover." Tertullian, concerning the soul, preferring the Christian
   wisdom to that of Socrates, adds, "Not bringing in new demons, but
   driving out the old; not corrupting youth, but instructing them in all
   the goodness of modesty."

   [290] See Plato, as in other places, so more particularly in his fifth
   Republic.

   [291] See Pliny, book x. chap. 34. "The actions of doves are mightily
   taken notice of by these, upon the same account; their customs are the
   same, but the highest degree of modesty belongs specially to them;
   adulteries are not known to either of them; they do not violate the
   fidelity of wedlock." Concerning the conjugal chastity of ring-doves,
   see Porphyry in his third book against eating living creatures.

   [292] This appears from Deut. xvii. 16, 17. xxi. 15. 2 Sam. xii. 8. So
   the Hebrews understood the law; and Chrysostom, 1 Cor. xi. and
   Augustine, book iii. chap. 12. concerning the Christian doctrine; and
   others of the ancients. Josephus, who best understood the law, says in
   the seventeenth of his Antiquities, "It was due custom of our fathers
   to have many wives."

   [298] Sallust well expresses it in his Jugurthine war. "Amongst those
   that have many wives there is but little affection, because the mind is
   distracted with a multitude, so as to have none of them for an intimate
   companion; but they are all equally esteemed of no value." Ammianus,
   concerning the Persians, book xxiii. "By means of various lusts,
   divided love grows faint." And Claudian, in his Gildonic war:--

   ----" They have a thousand marriages,
   For they regard no ties, no sacred pledge,
   But their affection is in number lost."

   [299] Euripides, in his Andromache, rightly apprehends and expresses
   them both.

  SECT. XIV. About the use of temporal goods.

   TO come now to the use of those things which are commonly called goods;
   we find theft allowed by some heathen nations, as the Egyptians [300]
   and Spartans; [301] and they who did not allow it in private persons,
   did scarce any thing in the public; as the Romans, of whom the Roman
   orator said, if every one should have his due restored to him, they
   must go back again to their cottages. [302] Indeed, there was no such
   thing amongst the Hebrews; but they were permitted to take usury of
   strangers, that the law might in some measure be fitted to their
   disposition; [303] (and therefore, amongst other things, it promised
   riches to them that obeyed it. [304] But the Christian law not only
   forbids all kind of injustice towards any persons; [305] but also
   forbids us setting our affections upon perishing things; [306] because
   our mind is of such a nature, that it cannot diligently attend to the
   care of two things, each of which requires the whole man, and which
   oftentimes draw him contrary ways: and besides, solicitousness in
   procuring and preserving riches, [307] is attended with a certain
   slavery and uneasiness, which spoils that very pleasure which is
   expected from riches: but nature is satisfied with a very few things,
   [308] and those such as can easily be procured, without any great
   labour or charge. And, if God has granted us something beyond this, we
   are not commanded to cast it into the sea, as some philosophers
   imprudently did; [309] nor to let it lie useless by us, nor yet to
   lavish it away: but, out of it, to supply the wants of other men,
   either by giving [310] or lending to those that ask it; [311] as
   becomes those who believe themselves not to be proprietors of these
   things, [312] but only stewards and deputies of the most high God their
   parent; for a kindness well bestowed is a treasure full of good hope,
   [313] against which neither the wickedness of thieves, nor variety of
   accidents, can prevail any thing. An admirable example of which sincere
   and undissembled charity the first Christians afford us; when things
   were sent from so great a distance as Macedonia and Achaia, [314] in
   order to supply the want of those in Palestine; as if the whole world
   had been but one family. And here this caution is added also, in the
   law of Christ, that no hope of recompence or honour ought to diminish
   from our liberality; [315] because, if we have regard to any thing else
   but God, it takes away his acceptance. [316] And, lest any one should
   pretend, as is commonly done, to cloke his sparingness, as if he were
   afraid he should want what he has, when he comes to be an old man, or
   if any misfortune should befall him, the law promises, that a
   particular care shall be taken of those who keep these precepts: [317]
   and, that they may the more rely upon it, reminds them of the
   remarkable providence of God, [318] in providing for wild beasts and
   cattle, in adorning herbs and flowers; and that it would be an unworthy
   thing in us, not to believe so good, so powerful a God, nor to trust
   him any further than we would do a bad debtor, of whom we never think
   ourselves secure without a pledge.

   OTHER laws forbid perjury; but this would have us entirely to abstain

   requiring an oath of us. [320]

   AND, indeed, there is nothing excellent to be found in the philosophic

   divine authority. For instance; concerning modesty, [321] temperance,
   [322] goodness, [323] moral virtue, [324] prudence, [325] the duty of
   governors and subjects, [326] parents and children, [327] masters and
   servants, [328] husbands and wives: [329] and particularly, abstaining
   from those vices which, under a spew of virtue, deceived many of the
   Greeks and Romans, viz. the desire of honour and glory. [330] The sum
   of it is wonderful for its substantial brevity--that we should love God
   above all things, and our neighbour as ourselves; [331] that is, we
   should do to others as we would have them do to us. [332] Perhaps some
   may object against what we have now said of the excellency of Christ's
   commands, the great difference of opinions amongst Christians, from
   whence have arisen so many various sects: --

  SECT. XVII. An answer to time objection drawn from the many controversies
  amongst Christians.

   BUT the answer to this is evident: there are scarce any arts but the
   same thing happens to them, partly through the weakness of human
   nature, and partly because men's judgment is hindered by prejudices:
   but, for the most part, this variety of opinion is limited within
   certain bounds, in which men are agreed, and whereby they determine
   doubts: as in the mathematics, it is a dispute whether the circle can
   be squared or no; but whether, if you take equals from equals, the
   remainder will be equal, this admits of no dispute: and thus it is in
   natural philosophy, physic, and other arts. So the difference of
   opinions that is amongst Christians cannot hinder their agreement in
   the principal things; that is, those commands by which we have now
   recommended the Christian religion: [333] and the certainty of these
   appears from hence, that those who, being highly enraged against one
   another, have sought for matter of disagreement, never ventured to go
   so far as to deny that these were the precepts of Christ; no, not even
   they who would not direct their lives according to this rule. And if
   any should attempt to contradict these, he ought to be looked upon to
   be like those philosophers who denied that snow was white. For as these
   were confuted by their senses, so are they by the consent of all
   Christian nations, and by those books which were wrote by the first
   Christians; and those after them, who were followed by learned men; and
   such who bore testimony to the faith of Christ by their death. For that
   which all these acknowledge to be the doctrine of Christ, ought to be
   accounted so, by all fair and equal judges; for the same reason that we
   believe Plato, Xenophon, and other disciples of Socrates, concerning
   the opinions of Socrates; and the schools of the stoics, for what Zeno
   delivered.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [333] We may add also in those opinions that are necessary, and upon
   which the observation of commands depends; such as are mentioned in the
   most ancient creeds which are extant, in Irenæus and Tertullian, and
   what we now call the apostles' creed, as I have somewhat more fully
   shewn in that little piece annexed hereto, concerning the choice of our
   opinion, &c. sect. iv. Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XVIII. The excellency of the Christian religion farther proved from the
  excellency of its Teacher.

   THE third thing wherein we said the Christian religion exceeds all
   other religions that are, or can be imagined, is the manner in which it
   was delivered and propagated: in the consideration of which particular,
   the first thing that offers itself is the Author of this doctrine. The
   authors of the Grecian wisdom and knowledge themselves confessed, that
   they alleged scarce any thing for certainty, because truth was sunk, as
   it were, to the bottom of a well; [334] and the mind as dim-sighted, in
   regard to divine things, as the eyes of an owl in the sun-shine. [335]
   Beside, there was hardly any of them, but was addicted to some
   particular vice: [336] some were flatterers of princes, [337] others
   devoted to the embraces of harlots, [338] others to snarling impudence,
   [339] and one great argument of the envy and hatred they all had
   against one another is, their quarrelling about words or things of no
   moment; [340] and as good an argument of their coldness and
   indifferency in the worship of God is, that they who believed that
   there was really but one God, did yet lay him aside, and paid divine
   worship to others, whom they believed to be no gods; making that only
   the rule of their religion which was publicly received. [341] And as
   for the reward of piety, they could affirm nothing for certain; as
   appears from the last dispute of Socrates, a little before his death.
   [342] Mahomet, the author of that religion which has spread itself so
   far, abandoned himself to lust all his life long, [343] which his
   friends themselves do not deny. Neither did he give any assurance
   whereby it might appear that those rewards he promised, which consisted
   in feasts and women, would ever really be; since they do not pretend to
   say that he is restored to life again in his body; so far from that,
   that it now lies buried in Medina. But Moses, the Hebrew lawgiver, was
   an excellent person: however, entirely free from faults; for with great
   reluctance he would scarce undertake an embassy to the king of Egypt,
   though at the command of God; [344] and he discovered some distrust of
   God's promise, concerning striking water out of the rock, [345] as the
   Hebrews acknowledge. And he himself partook of scarce any of those
   rewards which he promised to his people by the law, being driven to and
   fro in desert places, by continual tumults, [346] and never entering
   the happy land. [347] But Christ is described by his disciples to be
   without any manner of sin: [348] nor could he ever be proved to have
   committed any, by the testimonies of others: [349] and whatever he
   commanded others, he performed himself; [350] for he faithfully
   fulfilled all things that God commanded him; he was most sincere in the
   whole course of his life; [351] he was the most patient of injuries and
   torments, as is evident from his punishment on the cross; [352] he was
   so great a lover of mankind, of his enemies, even of those by whom he
   was led to death, that he prayed to God for them. [353] And the reward
   that he promised to his followers, he was possessed of himself, in a
   most eminent manner; as is declared and proved by certain testimony.
   Many saw, heard, and handled him, after he was returned to life again:
   [354] he was taken up into heaven in the sight of twelve; [355] and
   that he there obtained the highest power, is manifest from hence, that
   he endued his disciples with a power to speak those languages which
   they had never learned; [356] and with other miraculous gifts, [357] as
   he promised them, when he departed from them: [358] all which put
   together shew, that there is no reason to doubt of his faithfulness, or
   of his power to recompense us with that reward he has promised. And
   hence it is we collect, that this religion exceeds all others in this
   particular also, that the Author of it performed himself what he
   commanded, and was possessed of what he promised.

   From the wonderful propagation of this religion.

   WE come now to the effects of the doctrine by him delivered; which,
   indeed, if rightly considered, are such, that if God has any regard or
   care of human affairs, this doctrine cannot possibly but be thought
   divine. It was agreeable to Divine Providence to cause that to spread
   the furthest, which is in itself best. And this has happened to the
   Christian religion, which we ourselves see is taught all over Europe;
   even the further corners of the north not exempted; [359] and no less
   throughout all Asia, [360] even in the islands in the sea belonging to
   it; [361] through Egypt also, [362] and Ethiopia, [363] and some other
   parts of Africa, [364] and at last through America. [365] Nor is this
   done now only, but was so of old; as the history of all ages testify,
   the books of the Christians, and the acts of synods; and at this day
   there is a tradition preserved amongst the barbarians, of the journeys
   and miracles of Thomas [366] and Andrew, [367] and the other apostles.
   And Clemens, [368] Tertullian, [369] and others, have observed, how far
   the name of Christ was famous in their times, amongst the Britons,
   Germans, and other distant nations. [370] What religion is there that
   can can compare with it for the extent of its possession? If you
   answer, heathenism; that, indeed, has but one name, but is not one
   religion: for they do not all worship the same thing; for some worship
   the stars, others the elements, others beasts, others things that have
   no existence; neither are they governed by the same law, nor under one
   common master. The Jews, indeed, though very much scattered, are but
   one nation; however, their religion has received no remarkable increase
   since Christ: nay, their own law is made more known by the Christians
   than by themselves. Mahometanism is settled in very many countries, but
   not alone; for the Christian religion is cultivated in those same
   countries, and in some places by a greater number: whereas, on the
   contrary, there are no Mahometans to be found in many parts where the
   Christian religion is.

   Considering the weakness and simplicity of those who taught it in the
   first ages.

   We come next to examine in what manner the Christian religion made such
   a progress, that in this particular also it may be compared with
   others. We see most men are disposed to comply with the examples of
   kings and rulers, especially if they he obliged to it by law, or
   compelled by force. To these the religions of the pagans, and that of
   the Mahometans, owe their increase. But they who first taught the
   Christian religion were not only men without authority, but of low
   fortune, fishers, tent-makers, and the like: and yet, by the industry
   of these men, that doctrine, within thirty years, or thereabouts,
   spread not only through all parts of the Roman empire, but as far as
   the Parthians and Indians. [371] And not only in the very beginning,
   but, for almost three hundred years, by the industry of private
   persons, without any threats, without any enticements, nay, opposed as
   much as possible by the power of those who were in authority, this
   religion was propagated so far, that it possessed the greatest part of
   the Roman empire, before Constantine professed Christianity. [372] They
   among the Greeks, who delivered precepts of morality, at the same time
   rendered themselves acceptable by other arts; as the Platonics, by the
   study of geometry; the peripatetics, by the history of plants and
   animals; the stoics, by logical subtilty: the Pythagoreans, by the
   knowledge of numbers and harmony. Many of them were endued with
   admirable eloquence, as Plato, Xenophon, and Theophrastus. But the
   first teachers of Christianity had no such art: their speech was very
   plain, without any enticements: [373] they declared only the precepts,
   promises, and threats in bare words; wherefore, since they had not in
   themselves any power, answerable to such a progress, we must of
   necessity allow that they were attended with miracles; or that the
   secret influence of God favoured their undertaking; or both.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [334] It was a saying of Democritus, "That truth lay at the bottom of a
   well," as we find in Tully's Academical Questions, and in other
   writers.

   [335] See Aristotle's Metaphysics, book ii. chap. 1. "As the eyes of a
   bat are dazzled at the light in the day-time, so is the understanding
   in our soul confounded at the plainest things in the world."

   [336] Socrates is most commended, by the consent of all; yet Cyril, in
   his sixth book against Julian, sets before us, in the words of
   Porphyry, the high degree of anger he discovered in his words and
   sayings.

   [337] Plato and Aristippus.

   [338] Zeno, the chief of the stoics, was addicted to the love of men;
   and Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Aristippus, and almost all of them, to
   the love of women; witness Athenæus's books, xii. and xiii. Laërtius
   and Lactantius. Theognis mentions it of himself in many places.

   [339] Whence they were called Cynics.

   [340] This is well observed by Timon Phliasius:

   "O wretched mortals, nought but sin and flesh,
   Always deceiv'd with words and fierce contests;
   Vain men, like empty bladders, puff 'd with wind."
   And again,

   "Sharp contest walks about with mighty noise;
   Sister of mortal hatred and confusion;
   Till, wandering to and fro, at last she fix
   Herself in human breasts, and raise their hopes."
   And again,

   "Who has enflam'd them with such deadly strife? The noisy multitude,
   who silence hate,
   From whom the plague of tattle has its rise."
   You will find these verses in Clemens, Strom. v. in Eusebius, at the
   end of his Preparation, and in Theodoret's second discourse.

   [341] Xenophon, in his sixth Memorab. recites the oracle by which the
   gods are commanded to be worshipped according to the laws of every
   city. Here we may repeat the words of Seneca, before quoted out of
   Augustine; after which Augustine adds these: "He worshipped that which
   he blamed; he did that which he condemned; and that which he found
   fault with, he paid adoration to." According to what Plato says, in his
   Timæus, and other places; and Porphyry in that place of Eusebius's
   Preparat. book iv. ch. 8. that it is dangerous to speak the truth, in
   divine matters, before the vulgar. The fear a which danger, both in the
   Greek and Latin, and barbarian philosophers, prevailed over the sincere
   profession of the truth; which thing alone is sufficient to hinder any
   one from thinking that such men were to be followed in every thing.
   Justin Martyr, in his exhortation to the Greeks, observes this of
   Plato.

   [369] In his first book against the Jews. "In whom else have all
   nations believed, but in Christ, who lately came? In whom have all
   these nations believed--Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and the dwellers of
   Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia; the inhabitants of Pontus,
   and Asia, and Pamphylia; they that dwell in Egypt, and they who live in
   the country of Africa, beyond Cyrene; Romans and strangers; Jews and
   other nations in Jerusalem; the different sorts of people in Getulia;
   the many countries of the Moors; all the borders of Spain; the
   different nations of Gaul? And those places of Britain, which the
   Romans could not come at, are yet subject to Christ; the Sarmatæ, and
   Dæci, and Germans, and Scythians; and many other obscure nations, and
   many provinces and islands unknown to us, so many that they cannot be
   reckoned. In all which places the name of Christ, who lately came,
   reigns." Presently after, he shews how much larger the kingdom of
   Christ was in his time, that is, the end of the second century, than
   those of old, Nebuchadnezzar's, Alexander's, or the Romans: "The
   kingdom of Christ overspreads all places, is received every where, in
   all the above-named nations (he had mentioned the Babylonians,
   Parthians, Indians, Ethiopia, Asia, Germany, Britain, the Moors,
   Getulians, and Romans) it is in great esteem; he reigns every where, is
   adored in all places, is divided equally amongst them all."

   [370] Irenæus, who was ancienter than Tertullian, book. i. chap. 3.
   "For though there be different languages, the power of tradition is the
   same; neither the churches founded in Germany have any other belief, or
   any other tradition; nor yet those in Iberia, nor those among the
   Celtæ, nor those which are in the east, nor those in Egypt, nor those
   in Libya, nor those that are established in the middle of the world;
   but, like the sun, which God created, and is one and the same
   throughout the whole world, so the light, the preaching of the truth,
   shines every where, and enlightens all men, who are willing to come to
   the knowledge of the truth." And Origen's homily upon the ivth of
   Ezekiel: "The miserable Jews confess, that these things were foretold
   of the presence of Christ; but they are foolishly ignorant of his
   person, though they see what is said of him fulfilled; for when did the
   British land, before the coming of Christ, agree in the worship of one
   God? when did the country of the Moors, when did the whole world
   together, do so?" And Arnobius, book ii. "The powers which they saw
   with their eyes, and those unheard-of effects, which were openly
   produced, either by him, or which were proclaimed by his disciples,
   throughout the whole world, subdued those violent appetites, and caused
   nations and people, and those whose manners were very different, to
   consent, with one mind, to the same belief: for we might enumerate, and
   take into our account, those things which were done in India among the
   Seræ, Persians, and Medes, in Arabia, Egypt, in Asia, Syria, among the
   Galatians, Parthians, Phrygians, in Achaia, Macedonia, Epirus; in those
   islands and provinces surveyed by the east and western sun; and lastly
   in Rome, the mistress of the world." And Athanasius, In his synodical
   epistle, which we find in Theodoret, book iv. ch. 3. mentions the
   Christian churches in Spain, Britain, Gaul, Italy, Dalmatia, Mysia,
   Macedonia, Greece, Africa, Sardinia, Cyprus, Crete, Pamphylia, Lysia,
   Isauria, Egypt, Libya, Pontus, and Cappadocia. And Theodoret, in his
   eighth discourse against the Greeks, speaks thus concerning the
   apostles: "When they were conversant in the body, they went about,
   sometimes to one sort, and sometimes to another; sometimes they
   discoursed to the Romans, sometimes to the Spaniards, and sometimes to
   the Celtans; but after, they returned to him that sent them: all
   enjoyed their labours without exception; not only the Romans and they
   that love the Roman yoke, and were subject to their government, but
   also the Persians, and Scythians, and Massagetæ, and Sauromatæ, and
   Indians, and Ethiopians; and, to speak in one word, the borders of the
   whole world." And again, in his ninth book, amongst the converted
   nations he reckons the Persians, the Massagetæ, the Tibareni, the
   Hyrcani, the Caspians, and Scythians. Jerom, in the epitaph of
   Nepotian, reckons among the Christians, the Indians, Persians, Goths,
   Egyptians, Bessians, and the people clothed with skins: in his epistle
   to Læta, he reckons up the Indians, Persians, Ephiopians, Armenians,
   Huns, Scythians, and Getans: and, in his dialogue between an Orthodox
   man and a Luciferian, he mentions the Britons, Gauls, the east, the
   people of India, the Iberians, the Celtiberians, and the Ethiopians.
   And Chrysostom, in his sixth homily upon 1 Cor. says, "If they were not
   worthy to be believed in what they said, how should their writings have
   spread all over barbarous countries, even to the Indians, and those
   countries beyond the sea?" And again, in his last homily upon
   Pentecost: "The Holy Spirit descended in the shape of tongues, divided
   its doctrine among the several climates of the world; and by this gift
   of tongues, as it were by a particular commission, made known to every
   one the limits of that command and doctrine that was committed to him."
   And again, in his famous oration concerning Christ's being God: "We
   must say then, that a mere man could not, in so short a time, have
   overspread the world, both sea and land; nor have so called men to such
   things, who were withheld by evil customs, nay, possessed with
   wickedness; yet he was sufficient to deliver mankind from all these,
   not only Romans, but also Persians, and all barbarous nations." See
   also what follows, which is highly worth reading.

   [371] Rom. xv. 19.

   [372] Tertullian said in his time, apology ii. "We are but of
   yesterday, and have filled all places belonging to you, your cities,
   islands, castles, towns, councils, your very camps, tribes, companies,
   the palace, senate and forum; we have left you only your temples."

   [373] This was wisely observed by Chrysostom, on 1 Cor. i. 17. and by
   Theodorot, after the words now quoted.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XIX. And the great impediments that hindered men from embracing it, or
  deterred them from professing it.

   To which consideration we may add this; that the minds of those who
   embraced the Christian religion, taught by these men, were not entirely
   free and unprejudiced from any established rule of religion, and
   consequently very pliable; as they were who first embraced the heathen
   rites and the law of Mahomet; and much less were they prepared by any
   foregoing institution; as the Hebrews were rendered fit for the
   reception of the law of Moses, by circumcision, and the knowledge of
   one God: but, on the contrary, their minds were filled with opinions,
   and had acquired habits, which are a second nature, repugnant to these
   new instructions; having been educated and confirmed by the authority
   of laws, and of their parents, in the heathen mysteries and Jewish
   rites. And besides this, there was another obstacle as great, namely,
   the most grievous sufferings, which it was certain they who professed
   Christianity must endure, or be in fear of, upon that account: for,
   since such sufferings are highly disagreeable to human nature, it
   follows, that those things which are the cause of such sufferings
   cannot be received without great difficulty. The Christians, for a long
   time, were kept out of all places of honour, and were moreover fined,
   had their goods confiscated, and were banished: but these were small
   things; they were condemned to the mines; had the most cruel torments,
   that it was possible to invent, inflicted upon them; and the
   punishments of death were so common, that the writers of those times
   relate, that no famine, no pestilence, no war, ever consumed more men
   at a time. Neither were they the ordinary kinds of death: but burning
   of them alive, crucifying them, and such like punishments; [374] which
   one cannot read or think of without the greatest horror; and this
   cruelty, which, without any long interruption, and that not every
   where, continued in the Roman empire almost till the time of
   Constantine, and in other places longer, was so far from diminishing
   them, that, on the contrary, their blood was called the seed of the
   church, they so much more increased as they were cut off. Here,
   therefore, let us compare other religions with Christianity. The Greeks
   and other heathens, who are wont to magnify their own matters, reckon a
   very few that suffered death for their opinions; some Indian
   philosophers, Socrates, and not many more; and it can hardly be denied,
   but that, in these famous men, there was some desire of transmitting
   their fame to posterity. But there were very many of the common people,
   scarce known to their neighbours, among the Christians, who suffered
   death for their opinion; women, virgins, young men, who had no desire,
   nor probable hopes, that their name would continue long after them;
   and, indeed, there are but a few whose names remain in the
   martyrologies, in comparison of the number of them that suffered for
   this cause, and are reckoned only by the heap. [375] Further, very many
   of them might have escaped this punishment by some small dissimulation,
   such as throwing a little frankincense upon the altar; which cannot be
   affirmed of them who, whatever private opinions they had in their
   minds, yet in their outward actions conformed themselves to the customs
   of the vulgar. So that to suffer death for the honour of God could
   scarce be allowed to any but the Jews and Christians; and not to the
   Jews after Christ's time; and before, only to a very few, compared with
   the Christians; more of which suffered punishment for the law of Christ
   in one province, than ever there did Jews; all whose sufferings of this
   kind may almost be reduced to the times of Manasses and Antiochus.
   Wherefore, seeing the Christian religion, in this particular also,
   infinitely exceeds others, it ought justly to be preferred before them.
   It must be inferred from such a multitude, of every age and sex, in so
   many different places and times, who refused not to die for this
   religion, that there was some great reason for such a constant
   resolution; which cannot be imagined to be any other but the light of
   truth, and the Spirit of God.

   An answer to those who require more and stronger arguments.

   IF there be any one who is not satisfied with the arguments hitherto
   alleged for the truth of the Christian religion, bat desires more
   powerful ones, he ought to know that different things must have
   different kinds of proof: [376] one sort in mathematics, another in the
   properties of bodies, another in doubtful matters, and another in
   matters of fact. And we are to abide by that whose testimonies are void
   of all suspicion: which, if it be not admitted, not only all history is
   of no further use, and a great part of physic; but all that natural
   affection which is betwixt parents and children is lost, who can be
   known no other way. [377] And it is the will of God, that those things
   which he would have us believe, so as that faith should be accepted
   from us as Obedience, should not be so very plain as those things we
   perceive by our senses, and by demonstration; but only so far as is
   sufficient to procure the belief, and persuade a man of the thing, who
   is not obstinately bent against it; [378] so that the gospel is, as it
   wore, a touchstone, to try men's honest dispositions by. For since
   those arguments, which we have brought, have gained the assent of so
   many good and wise men, it is very manifest that the cause of
   infidelity in others is not from the want of proof, but from hence,
   that they would not have that seem true which contradicts their
   passions and affections. [379] It is a hard thing for them lightly to
   esteem of honours and other advantages; which they must do, if they
   would receive what is related concerning Christ, and, for that reason,
   think themselves bound to obey the precepts of Christ. And this is to
   be discovered by this one thing, that they receive many other
   historical relations as true, the truth of which is established only
   upon authorities of which there are no marks remaining at this time; as
   there is in the history of Christ, partly by the confession of the Jews
   which are now left, partly by the congregation of Christians every
   where to be found; for which there must of necessity have been some
   cause. And since the long continuance of the Christian religion, and
   the propagation of it so far, cannot be attributed to any human power,
   it follows, that it must be attributed to miracles; or, if any one
   should deny it to have been done by miracles, this very thing, that it
   should, without a miracle, gather so much strength and power, ought to
   be looked upon as greater than any miracle. [380]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [374] Domitius Ulplanus, a famous lawyer, wrote seven books about the
   punishments that Christians ought to have inflicted on them. Lactantius
   mentions them, book. v. chap. 11.

   [375] As the innocent company of three hundred at Carthage, mentioned
   in the xxivth Roman martyrology of Augustus; very many in Africa under
   Severus; under Valerian at Antioch; and in Arabia, Cappadocia, and
   Mesopotamia, in Phrygia, in Pontes, under Maximin; at Nicomedia, in
   Numidia, at Rome, in Thebais, Tyre, Trevers under Dioclesian, in Persia
   under Cabada and Sapores. All which are mentioned in the martyrology,
   without any names.

   [376] See Aristotle's ethics to Nicomachus, book i. "It is sufficient,
   if a thing be made appear according to the subject matter of it; for
   the same evidence is not to be expected in all things." And in the
   latter part of his first Metaphys. the last chapter: "Mathematical
   certainty is not to be met with in all things." And Chalcidius on the
   Timæus, according to the opinion of Plato: "A disposition to believe
   precedes all doctrines; especially if they be asserted, not by common,
   but by great and almost divine men."

   [377] Thus Homer:-- "No man for certain knows whose son he is." That
   is, with the most exact kind of knowledge.

   [378] There are two sorts of propositions in the Christian religion;
   one sort of which may be philosophically demonstrated, the other
   cannot. Of the former are inch as these: the existence of God, the
   creation of the world, a Divine Providence; the goodness and advantage
   of the precepts of religion; all which are capable of a demonstration,
   and are actually demonstrated by Grotius and others; so that a man must
   renounce his reason, or else admit them. But those passions which are
   contrary to them hinder unbelievers from receiving them, because, if
   they should own them to be true, they must subdue those passions, which
   they are unwilling to do, because they have been so long accustomed to
   them. Of the latter sort are the historical facts upon which the truth
   of the gospel depends, and which are explained by Grotius, and proved
   by historical arguments. Which same arguments would he allowed to be
   good by unbelievers, in the same manner as they do the proofs of all
   those histories which they believe, though they did hot see the facts,
   if they were not hindered by the prevalence of their passions; and
   which they must entirely subdue, if such arguments came once to take
   place. See a little book of mine, in French, concerning infidelity. Le
   Clerc.

   [379] Chrysotsom treats very handsomely of this, in the beginning of 1
   Cor. chap. 3. And to Demetrius he says; "that they do not believe the
   commandments, proceeds from their unwillingness to keep them."

   [380] Chrysostom handles this argument on 1 Cor. ch. i. towards the
   end; and Augustin, concerning the city of God, book xxii. chapter 6.

THE TRUTH

    OF THE

CHRISTIAN RELIGION.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

BOOK III.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. I. Of the authority of the books of the New Testament.

   HE who is persuaded of the truth and excellency of that religion which
   Christians profess, having been convinced either by the arguments
   before offered, or by any other besides them, in order to understand
   all the several parts of it, he must go to the most ancient books which
   contain this religion; and they are what we call the books of the New
   Testament, or rather Covenant: for it is unreasonable for any one to
   deny that that religion is contained in those books, as all Christians
   affirm; since it is fit that every sect, good or bad, should be
   believed in this assertion, that their opinions are contained in this
   or that book; as we believe the Mahometans, that the religion of
   Mahomet is contained in the Alcoran: wherefore, since the truth of the
   Christian religion has been proved before, and at the same time it was
   evident that it was contained in these books, the authority of these
   books is sufficiently established by this single thing: however, if any
   one desire to have it more particularly made appear to him, be must
   first lay down that common rule amongst all fair judges, that he who
   would disprove any writing, which bas been received for many ages, is
   obliged to bring arguments that may diminish the credibility of such a
   writing; which, if he cannot, the book is to be defended, as in
   possession of its own authority. [381]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [381] See Baldus in his rubric concerning the credibility of writings;
   and Gailus, book ii. Obs. cxlix. numb. 6 and 7, and those he there
   cites.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. II. The books, that have any names affixed to them, were writ by those
  persons whose names they bear.

   We say then, that the writings, about which there is no dispute amongst
   Christians, and which have any particular person's name affixed to
   them, are that author's whose title they are marked with; because the
   first writers, such as Justin, Irenæus, Clemens, [382] and others after
   them, quote these books under those names; and besides, Tertullian
   says, [383] that in his time some of the original copies of those books
   were extant: and because all the churches received them as such, before
   there were any public councils held: neither did any heathens or Jews
   raise any controversy, as if they were not the works of those whose
   they were said to be. And Julian openly confesses, [384] that those
   were Peter's, Paul's, Matthew's, Murk's, and Luke's, which were read by
   the Christians under those names. Nobody in his senses makes any doubt
   of Homer's or Virgil's works being theirs, by reason of the constant
   testimony of the Greeks concerning the one, and of the Latins
   concerning the other: how much more then ought we to stand by the
   testimony of almost all the nations in the world for the authors of
   these books?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [382] There is only Clemens s epistle to the Corinthians extant, in
   which he quotes places of the New Testament, but does not name the
   writers: wherefore Clemens's name might have been omitted; and so might
   Justin's, who is not used to add the names. Le Clerc.

   [383] In his prescription against the heretics: "Let any one, who would
   exercise his curiosity principally in the affair of his salvation, let
   him run over the apostolical churches, over which the seats of the
   apostles have now the rule, in their respective places; in which the
   authentic letters themselves are recited." And why might not the hand
   of the apostles be then extant, when Quintilian says, that in his time
   Cicero's hand was extant; and Gellius says the same of Virgil's in his?

   [384] The place is to be seen in Cyril's tenth book.--(See also out
   annotations, in the dissertation on the four Evangelists, added to the
   Harmony of the Gospels. Le Clerc.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. III. The doubt of those books that were formerly doubtful, taken away.

   THERE are, indeed, in the volume we now use, some books which were not
   equally received from the beginning; as the second of Peter, [385] that
   of James and Jude, two under the name of John the presbyter, the
   Revelations, and the epistle to the Hebrews: however, they were
   acknowledged by ninny churches, as is evident from the ancient
   Christians, who use their testimony as sacred; which makes it credible,
   that those churches, which had not those books from the beginning, did
   not know of them at that time; or else were doubtful concerning them;
   but, having afterwards learned the truth of the thing, they began to
   use those books, after the example of the rest; as we now see done in
   almost all places: nor can there be a sufficient reason imagined why
   any one should counterfeit those books, when nothing can be gathered
   from them but what is abundantly contained in the other books that are
   undoubted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [385] However, Grotius himself doubted of this; the reason, of Which
   doubt he himself gives us, in the beginning of his annotations upon
   this epistle. But, though one or two epistles could be called in
   question, this would not render the rest doubtful; nor would any part
   of the Christian faith be defective, because it is abundantly delivered
   in other places. Le Clerc.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. IV. The authority of those books which hare no name to them evident from
  the nature of the writings.

   THERE is no reason why any one should detract from the credibility of
   the epistle to the Hebrews upon this account only, because we do not
   know who wrote it; and so likewise of the two epistles of John, and the
   Revelation, because some have doubted whether John the apostle wrote
   them, or another of the same name. For, in writers, [386] the nature of
   the writings is more to be regarded than the name. Wherefore we receive
   many historical books, whose authors we are ignorant of, as that of
   Cæsar's Alexandrian war, viz. because we see, that, whoever the author
   was, he lived in those times, and was present at those matters; so
   likewise ought we to be satisfied, when those who wrote the books we
   are now speaking of, testify that they lived in the first age, and were
   endued with the apostolical gifts. And if any one should object against
   this, that these qualities may be feigned, as may the names in other
   writings, he would say a thing that is by no means credible, viz. that
   they, who every where press the study of truth and piety, should
   without any reason bring themselves under the guilt of a lie, which is
   not only abhorred by all good men, bat was punished with death by the
   Roman laws. [387]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [386] It had been more proper to say in writings, or books, which is
   the meaning of Grotius, as appears from what follows. Le Clerc.

   [387] See L. Falsi Nominis. D. de Lege Cornelia; and Paul, book v.
   Sent. tit. xxv. sect. 10 and 11. See examples of this punishment, at
   the end of the books of Valerius Maximus, and in Capitolinus in
   Pertinax.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. V. That these authors wrote what was true, because they knew the things
  they wrote about.

   IT is certain, therefore, that the books of the New Testament were
   wrote by those whose names they bear, or by such persons as they
   profess themselves to be; and it is moreover evident that they had a
   knowledge of things they wrote about, and had no desire to say what was
   false; whence it follows, that what they wrote must be true, because
   every falsity either proceeds from ignorance, or from n ill intention.
   Matthew, John, Peter, and Jude, wore of the company of those twelve
   which Jesus chose to be witnesses of his life and doctrines; so that
   they could not want the knowledge of those things they relate: [388]
   The same may be said of James, who either was an apostle, or, as others
   would have it, a near relation of Jesus, [389] and made bishop of
   Jerusalem by the apostles. Neither could Paul be deceived, through
   ignorance, concerning those doctrines, which he professes were revealed
   to him by Jesus himself reigning in heaven; neither could he be
   deceived in the things which he performed himself; no more could Luke,
   who was his inseparable companion in his travels. [390] This same Luke
   could easily know what he wrote concerning the life and death of Jesus,
   because he was born in a neighbouring place, and had travelled through
   Palestine, where, he says, he spake with them who were eye-witnesses of
   these things. [391] Without doubt there were many others (besides the
   apostles with whom he was acquainted) who were then alive, having been
   healed by Jesus, and who had seen him die, and come to life again. If
   we believe Tacitus and Suetonius, concerning those things which
   happened long before they were born, because we rely upon their
   diligent inquiry, how much more reasonable is it to believe this
   author, who says he had every thing from eye-witnesses? It is a
   constant tradition that Mark was a continual companion of Peter; [392]
   so that what he wrote is to be esteemed as if Peter himself, who could
   not be ignorant of those things, had dictated it: besides, almost every
   thing which he wrote is to be found in the writings of the apostles.
   Neither could the writer of the Revelations be deceived in those
   visions which he says were caused from heaven, [393] nor he to the
   Hebrews, in those things which he professes he was taught either by the
   Spirit of God, or by the apostles themselves. [394]

  SECT. VI. And because they would not say what was false.

   THE other thing we affirmed, viz. that they would not speak an untruth,
   belongs to what was before treated of, when we shewed the credibility
   of the Christian religion in general, and of the history of Christ's
   resurrection. They, who would disprove witnesses in this particular
   relating to the disposition of their mind and will, must of necessity
   allege something to make it credible, that they set their mind against
   the truth. But this cannot be said here: for if any one should object
   that their own cause was concerned, he ought to examine upon what
   account it was their cause; certainly nor for the sake of getting any
   advantage, or shunning any danger; when, on the account of this
   profession, they lost all advantages, and there were no dangers which
   they did not expose themselves to. It was not therefore their own
   cause, unless out of reverence to God, which certainly does not induce
   any man to tell a lie, especially in a matter of such moment, upon
   which the eternal salvation of mankind depends. We are hindered from
   believing such a wicked thing of them, both by their doctrines, which
   are in every part full of piety; [395] and by their life, which was
   never accused of any evil fact, no, not by their enemies, who only
   objected their unskilfulness against them, which is not at all apt to
   produce a falsity. If there had been in them tile least dishonesty,
   they would not have set down their own faults to be eternally
   remembered; as in the flight of them all, when Christ was in danger,
   [396] and in Peter's thrice denying him. [397]

  SECT. VII. The credibility of these writers further confirmed, from their
  being famous for miracles.

   BUT, on the contrary, God himself gave remarkable testimonies to the
   sincerity of them, by working miracles, which they themselves and their
   disciples publicly avouched, with the highest assurance; [398] adding
   the names of the persons and places, and other circumstances; the truth
   or falsity of which assertion might easily have been discovered by the
   magistrate's inquiry; amongst which miracles, this is worthy
   observation, which they constantly affirmed, [399] viz. their speaking
   languages they had never learned, before many thousand people, and
   healing in a moment bodies that were diseased, in the sight of the
   multitude; nor were they at all afraid, though they knew at that time
   that the Jewish magistrates were violently set against them, and the
   Roman magistrates very partial, who would not overlook any thing that
   afforded matter of traducing them as criminals, and authors of a new
   religion: nor did any of the Jews or heathens, in those nearest times,
   dare to deny that miracles were done by these men: nay, Phlegon, who
   was a slave of the emperor Adrian, mentions the miracles of Peter in
   his annals: [400] and the Christians themselves, in those books wherein
   they give an account of the grounds of their faith, before the
   emperors, senate, and rulers, speak of these facts as things known to
   every body, and about which there could he no doubt: [401] moreover,
   they openly declared, that the wonderful power of them remained in
   their graves for some ages; [402] when they could not but know, if it
   were false, that they could easily be disproved by the magistrates, to
   their shame and punishment. And these miracles (now mentioned) at their
   sepulchres were so common, and had so many witnesses, that they forced
   Porphyry to confess the truth of them. [403] These things which we have
   now alleged ought to satisfy us; but there are abundance more of
   arguments, which recommend to us the credibility of these books:--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [398] See the Acts of the Apostles throughout, and 2 Cor. xii. 12.

   [399] The places are quoted before.

   [400] Book xiii. As Origen says in his second book against Celsus. This
   is that Phlegon whose remains we have yet concerning miracles, and
   long-lived men.

   [401] The places are very many, especially in Origen. See the whole
   eighth chapter of Augustine's twenty-second book of the city of God.

   [402] The miracles at the sepulchres of holy men then began to be
   boasted of, when the Christians, having the power in their hands, began
   to make an advantage of the dead bodies of martyrs and others that were
   buried in their churches. Wherefore I would not have this argument made
   use of, lest we diminish from the credibility of certain miracles, by
   these doubtful or fictitious ones. Every one knows how many stories are
   related after the fourth century about this matter. But Origen does not
   mention any such miracles; but, in his seventh book against Celsus,
   says, "Very many miracles of the Holy Spirit were manifested at the
   beginning of Jesus's doctrine, and after his ascension, but afterwards
   they were fewer; however, there are now some footsteps of them in some
   few, whose minds are purified by reason, and their actions agreeable
   thereto." Who can believe that so many miracles should be done in one
   or two centuries after Origen, when there was less need of them?
   Certainly it is as reasonable to derogate from the credibility of the
   miracles of the fourth and fifth centuries, as it would be impudent to
   deny the miracles of Christ and his apostles. These miracles could not
   be asserted without danger; those could not be rejected without danger,
   nor be believed without profit to those who perhaps forged them; which
   is a great difference. Le Clerc.

  SECT. VIII. And of their writings; because in them are contained many things
  which the event proved to be revealed by a Divine Power.

   FOR we find in them many predictions concerning things which men could
   not possibly know of themselves, and which were wonderfully confirmed
   by the event; such as the sudden and universal propagation of this
   religion; [404] the perpetual continuance of it; [405] that it should
   be rejected by very many of the Jews, [406] and embraced by strangers;
   [407] the hatred of the Jews against those who professed this religion;
   [408] the severe punishments they should undergo, upon the account of
   it; [409] the siege and destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, [410]
   and the sore calamities of the Jews. [411]

  SECT. IX. And also from the care, that it was fit God should take, that false
  writings should not be forged.

   TO what has been said may be added, that, if it be granted that God
   takes care of human affairs, and especially those that concern his own
   honour and worship, it is impossible he should suffer such a multitude
   of men, who had no other design than to worship him with sincerity, to
   be deceived by false books. And, after there did arise several sects in
   Christianity, there was scarce any found, who did not receive either
   all or most of these books, except a few which do not contain any thing
   particular in them; which is a very good argument why we should think
   that nothing in these books could be contradicted; because those sects
   were so inflamed with hatred against each other, that whatsoever
   pleased one, for that very reason displeased another.

   SECT. X. A solution of that objection, that many books were rejected by
   some.

   THERE were, indeed, amongst those who were willing to he called
   Christians, a very few who rejected all those books which seem to
   contradict their particular opinion; such as they who, out of hatred to
   the Jews, spoke ill of the God of the Jews, of the Maker of the world,
   and of the law; [412] or, on the contrary, out of fear of the hardships
   that the Christians were to undergo, sheltered themselves under the
   name of Jews, [413] that they might profess their religion without
   punishment. [414] But these very men were disowned by all other
   Christians, [415] every where, in those times when all pious persons,
   that differed from one another, were very patiently born with,
   according to the command of the apostles. [416] The first sort of these
   corrupters of Christianity are, I think, sufficiently confuted above,
   where we have shown that there is but one true God, whose workmanship
   the world is: and indeed it is sufficiently evident from those very
   books which they, that they might in some measure appear to be
   Christians, receive; such as the gospel of St. Luke in particular:
   [417] it is, I say, evident that Christ preached the same God which
   Moses and the Hebrews worshipped. We shall have a better opportunity to
   confute the other sort, when we come to oppose those who are hews, and
   willing to be called so. In the mean time I shall add only this; that
   the impudence of those men is very surprising who undervalue the
   authority of Paul, when there was not any one of the apostles who
   founded more churches, nor of whom there were so many miracles related,
   at that time when, as was before observed, the facts might be easily
   inquired into. And, if we believe his miracles, what reason is there
   why we should. not believe him in his heavenly visions, and in his
   receiving his instructions from Christ? If he was so beloved of Christ,
   it cannot possibly be that he should teach any thing disagreeable to
   Christ, that is, any thing false; and that one thing which they find
   fault with in him, namely, his opinion concerning the freedom procured
   to the Hebrews, from the rites formerly enjoined by Moses, there could
   be no reason for his teaching it but the truth; for he was circumcised
   himself, [418] and observed most of the law of his own accord: [419]
   and, for the sake of the Christian religion, he performed things much
   more difficult, and underwent things much harder than the law
   commanded, or than he had reason to expect. upon the account of it;
   [420] and he was the cause of his disciples doing and bearing the same
   things: [421] whence it is evident, he did not deliver any thing to
   please the ears of his hearers. or for their profit; when he taught
   them, instead of the Jewish sabbath, to spend every day in divine
   worship; [422] instead of the small expence the law put them to, to
   bear the loss of all their goods; [423] and instead of offering beasts
   to God, to offer their own blood to him. [424] And Paul himself openly
   assures us, that Peter, John, and James, gave him their right hands, in
   token of their friendship with him; [425] which, if it had not been
   true, he would not have ventured to say so, when they were alive, and
   could have convicted him of an untruth. Except only these, therefore,
   which I have now mentioned, who scarce deserve the name of Christians,
   the manifest consent of all other assemblies, in receiving these books,
   beside what has been already said concerning the miracles which were
   done by the writers of them, and the particular care of God about
   things of this nature, is sufficient to induce all impartial men to
   give credit to these relations; because they are ready to believe many
   other historical books which have not any testimonies of this kind;
   unless very good reason can be given to the contrary; which cannot be
   done here:--

   FOR, if any one should say, that there are some things related in these
   books that are impossible to be done, we have before shewn, that there
   are some things which are impossible to be done by men, but are
   possible with God; [426] that is, such as do not include any
   contradiction in themselves; amongst which things are to be reckoned
   those which we account most wonderful, the power of working miracles,
   and calling the dead to life again: so that this objection is of no
   force.

  SECT. XII. Or disagreeable to reason.

   NOR is there more heed to be given to them who say, that there are some
   doctrines to be found in these books which are inconsistent with right
   reason: for, first, this may be disproved by that great multitude of
   ingenious, learned, and wise men, who have relied on the authority of
   these books from the very beginning: also, every thing that has been
   shown in the first book to be agreeable to right reason, viz. that
   there is a God, and but one, a most perfect Being, all-powerful,
   loving, wise, and good; that all things which are, were made by him;
   that his care is over all his works, particularly over men; that he can
   reward those that obey him after this life; that we are to bridle
   sensual appetites; that there is a natural relation betwixt men, and
   therefore they ought to love one another: all these we may find plainly
   delivered in these books. To affirm any thing more than this for
   certain, either concerning the nature of God, or concerning his will,
   by the mere direction of human reason, is an unsafe and fallible thing;
   [427] as we may learn from the many opinions of the schools different
   from one another, and of all the philosophers. Nor is this at all to be
   wondered at; for, if they who dispute about the nature of their own
   minds, fall into such widely different opinions, [428] must it not
   necessarily be much more so with them who would determine any thing
   concerning the Supreme Mind, which is placed so much out of our reach?
   If they who understand human affairs affirm it dangerous to pry into
   the councils of princes, [429] and that therefore we ought not to
   attempt it, who is sagacious enough to hope, by his own conjectures, to
   find out which it is that God will determine of the various kinds of
   those things that he can freely will! Therefore Plato said very well,
   that none of these things could be known without a revelation: [430]
   and there can be no revelation produced, which can be proved truly to
   be such by greater testimonies than those contained in the books of the
   New Testament. There is so far from being any proof, that it has never
   yet been asserted that God ever declared any thing to man, concerning
   his nature, that was contradictory to these books; nor can there be any
   later declaration of his will produced that is credible. And if any
   thing was commanded or allowed, before Christ's time, of those sort of
   things which are plainly indifferent, or certainly not at all
   obligatory of themselves, nor plainly evil, this does not oppose these
   books; because, in such things, the former laws are nulled by the
   latter. [431]

   and laws, in compacts and bargains, the latter are esteemed stronger

  SECT. XIII. An answer to this objection, that some things are contained in
  these books which are inconsistent with one another.

   IT is objected by some, that the sense of these books is sometimes very
   different: but whoever fairly examines this matter will find, that, on
   the contrary, this is an addition to the other arguments for the
   authority of these books; that in those places which contain any thing
   of moment, whether in doctrine or history, there is every where such a
   manifest agreement, as is not to be found in any other writers of any
   sect, whether they be Jews, [432] or Greek philosophers, [433] or
   physicians, [434] or Roman lawyers; [435] in all which we very often
   find, that not only they of the same sect contradict one another, as
   Plato and Xenophon do, [436] but very often the same writer sometimes
   asserts one thing, and sometimes another; [437] as if be had forgot
   himself, or did not know which to affirm: but these writers, of whom we
   are speaking, all urge the same things to be believed, deliver the same
   precepts concerning the life of Christ, his death, and return to life
   again: the main and principal things are every where the same. And as
   to some very minute circumstances, which make nothing towards the main
   thing, we are not wholly at such a loss for a fair reconciliation of
   them, but that it may easily be made; though we are ignorant of some
   things, by reason of the similitude of things that were done at
   different times, the ambiguity of names, one man's or place's having
   many names, and such like. Nay, this very thing ought to acquit these
   writers of all suspicion of deceit; because they who bear testimony to
   that which is false are used to relate all things so by agreement, that
   there should not be any appearance of difference. [438] And if, upon
   the account of some small difference, which cannot be reconciled, we
   must immediately disbelieve whole books, then there is no book,
   especially of history, to be believed; and yet Polybius,
   Halicarnassensis, Livy, and Plutarch, in whom such things are to be
   found, keep up their authority amongst us in the principal things; how
   much more reasonable then is it, that such things should not destroy
   the credibility of those whom we see, from their own writings, have
   always a very great regard to piety and truth! There remains another
   way of confuting testimonies--from contrary external testimonies:--

   [432] The different opinions amongst whom, as they are to be seen in
   other places, so likewise in Manasses, the son of Israel, a very
   learned man in this sort of learning, in his books of the creation and
   resurrection.

   [434] See Galen of sects, and of the best sect; and Celsus of physic,
   is the beginning; to which the Spagirici may be added.

   [435] There was a remarkable difference of old between the Sabiniani
   and Proculiani; and now betwixt those who follow Bartolus and his
   followers, and those who follow Cujacius and others who were more
   learned. See Gabriel's common, more common, and most common sentences.

   [436] See Xenophon's epistle to Æschines, the disciple of Socrates.

   [437] Many have shewn this of Aristotle; and others, of the Roman
   lawyers.

   examine whether they offer one and the same premeditated speech; L.

     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XIV. An answer to the objection from external testimonies: where it is
  shewn that they make more for these books.

   BUT I confidently affirm that there are no such things to be found;
   unless any one will reckon amongst these what is said by those who were
   born a long while after, and they such who professed themselves enemies
   to the name of Christ, and who therefore ought not to be looked upon as
   witnesses. Nay, on the contrary, though there is no need of them, we
   have many testimonies which confirm some parts of the history delivered
   in these books. Thus, that Jesus was crucified, that miracles were done
   by him and his disciples, both Hebrews and heathens relate. Most clear
   testimonies of Josephus, published a little more than forty years after
   Christ's death, are now extant, concerning Herod, Pilate, Festus,
   Felix, John the baptist, Gamaliel, and the destruction of Jerusalem;
   which are exactly agreeable to what we find amongst the writers of the
   Talmud concerning those times: the cruelty of Nero towards the
   Christians is mentioned by Tacitus: and formerly there were extant
   books of private persons, such as Phlegon, [439] and the public acts,
   to which the Christians appealed; [440] wherein they agreed about the
   star that appeared after the birth of Christ; [441] about the
   earthquake, and the preternatural eclipse of the sun at full moon,
   about the time that Christ was crucified.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [439] Book xiii. of his Chronicon or Olympiads, in these words, "In the
   fourth year of the CCIId Olympiad, there happened the greatest eclipse
   of the sun that ever was known; there was such a darkness of night at
   the sixth hour of the day, that the stars were seen in the heavens; and
   there was a great earthquake in Bithynia, which overturned a great part
   of Nicæa." These words are to be seen in Eusebius's and Jerom's
   Chronicon. And Origen mentions the same thing, Tract xxxv. upon Matt.
   and in his second against Celsus.

   [440] See Tertullian's apology, c. xxi. "This event which has befallen
   the world, you find related in your mystical books."

   [441] Chalcidius the Platonist, in his commentary on Timæus: "There is
   another more holy and more venerable history, which relates the
   appearance of a new star, not to foretel diseases and death, but the
   descent of a venerable God; who was to preserve mankind, and to shew
   favour to the affairs of mortals; which star the wise men of Chaldæa
   observing as they travelled in the night, and being very well skilled
   in viewing the heavenly bodies, they are said to have sought after the
   new birth of this God and having found that majesty in a child, they
   paid him worship, and made such vows as were agreeable to so great a
   God."
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XV. An answer to the objection of the Scripture being altered.

   I SEE no other objection can be made against these books, unless it be
   that they have not continued to be the same as they were at the
   beginning. It must be owned, that, as in other books, so in these it
   might happen, and has happened, that, through carelessness or
   perverseness in the transcribers, some letters, syllables, or words,
   may be changed, omitted, or added. But it is very unreasonable, that,
   because of such a difference of copies, [442] which could not but
   happen in so long time, there should arise any controversy about the
   Testament or book itself; because both custom and reason require that
   that should be preferred before the rest which is to be found in the
   most ancient copies. But it can never be proved that all the copies are
   corrupted by fraud, or any other way, especially in those places which
   contain any doctrine, or remarkable point of history; for there are no
   records that tell us that they were so, nor any witnesses in those
   times: and if, as we before observed, any thing be alleged by those who
   lived a long time after, and who shew the most cruel hatred against
   those who were defenders of these books; this is to be looked upon as
   reproach, and not testimony. And this which we have now said may
   suffice in answer to those who object that the scripture may have been
   altered: because he that affirms this, especially against a writing
   which has been received so long and in so many places, ought himself to
   prove that which he presumes. [443] But, that the folly of this
   objection may more plainly appear, we will shew that that which they
   imagine to be, neither is, nor can be done. We have before proved these
   books to have been wrote by those whose names they bear; which being
   granted, it follows that one book is not forged for the sake of
   another. Neither is any remarkable passage altered; for such an
   alteration must have something designed by it, and then that part would
   plainly differ from those other parts and books which are not altered,
   which is no where to be seen; nay, as we observed, there is a wonderful
   harmony in the sense every where. Moreover, as soon as any of the
   apostles, or apostolical men, published any thing, doubtless the
   Christians took great care to have many copies of it, as became pious
   persons, and such as were desirous of preserving and propagating the
   truth to posterity; and these were therefore dispersed as far as the
   name of Christ extended itself, through Europe, Asia, and Egypt, in
   which places the Greek language flourished; and, as we before observed,
   some of the original copies were preserved for two hundred years. Now,
   no book, of which so many copies had been taken, that were kept, not by
   some few private persons, but by the care of whole churches, can be
   corrupted. [444] To which we may add, that in the very next ages these
   books were translated into the Syriac, Ethiopic, and Latin tongues:
   which versions are now extant, and do not any where differ from the
   Greek books in any thing of moment. And we have the writings of those
   who were taught by the apostles themselves, or their disciples, who
   quote a great many places of these books, in that sense which we now
   understand them. Nor was there at that time any one in the church of so
   great authority as to have been obeyed, if he had designed to alter any
   thing; as is sufficiently manifest from the liberty taken by Irenæus,
   Tertullian, and Cyprian, to differ from those who were of the highest
   rank in the church. And, after the times now mentioned, many others
   followed, who were men of great learning and as great judgment, who,
   after a diligent inquiry, received those books, as retaining their
   original purity. And further, what we now said concerning the different
   sects of Christians may be applied here also; that all of them, at
   least all that own God to be the Creator of the world, and Christ to be
   a new lawgiver, make use of these books as we now have them. If any
   attempted to put in any thing, they were accused of forgery by the
   rest. And that no sect was allowed the liberty to alter these books
   according to their own pleasure, is sufficiently evident from hence,
   that all sects fetched their arguments against the rest from hence. And
   what we hinted concerning the Divine Providence, relates as much to the
   principal parts as to the whole books; that it is not agreeable thereto
   that God should suffer so many thousand men, who were regardful of
   piety, and sought after eternal life with a sincere intention, to fall
   into an error that they could not possibly avoid. And thus much may
   suffice for the books of the New Testament, which, if they were alone
   extant, were sufficient to teach us the true religion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [442] This is now very manifest, from the most accurate collection of
   the various readings of the New Testament, and especially from the
   edition of dr. Mills. Though there is a great variety, yet no new
   doctrine can be raised from thence, nor no received one confuted; no
   history of any moment, in regard to the truth of the Christian
   religion, which was before believed from the books of the New
   Testament, is on that account to be rejected; nor any that was before
   unknown, to be collected from the various readings. And what is said of
   the books of the New Testament, the same we are to conceive said of the
   Old Testament. Le Clerc.

   [444] That is, so as that it should run through all the copies, and
   corrupt all the versions: for otherwise wicked men, who are obstinately
   bent on their own opinions, may here and there corrupt their own

   a better judgment; as we have shewn in our Ars Critica, part iii. sect.

  SECT. XVI. The authority of the books of the Old Testament.

   BUT, since God has been pleased to leave us the records of the Jewish
   religion, which was of old the true religion, and affords no small
   testimony to the Christian religion, it is not foreign to our purpose
   to see upon what foundation the credibility of these is built. That
   these books are theirs to whom they are ascribed, appears in the same
   manner as we have proved of our books. And they, whose names they bear,
   were either prophets, or men worthy to be credited; such as Esdras, who
   is supposed to have collected them into one volume, at that time when
   the prophets Haggai, Malachi, and Zecharias, were yet alive. I will not
   here repeat what was said before in commendation of Moses. And not only
   that first part delivered by Moses, as we have shewn in the first book,
   but the later history, is confirmed by many pagans. Thus, the
   Phoenician annals mention the names of David and Solomon, [445] and the
   league they made with the Tyrians. And Berosus, as well as the Hebrew
   books, mention Nabuchadonosor, [446] and other Chaldeans. [447]
   Vaphres, [448] the king of Egypt in Jeremiah, is the same with Apries
   in Herodotus. [449] And the Greek books are filled with Cyrus and his
   successors, [450] down to Darius; [451] and Josephus, in his book
   against Appion, quotes many other things relating to the Jewish nation:
   to which may be added that we above took out of Strabo and Trogus.
   [452] But there is no reason for us Christians to doubt of the
   credibility of these books, because there are testimonies in our books,
   out of almost every one of them, the same as they are found in the
   Hebrew. Nor did Christ, when he blamed many things in the teachers of
   the law, and in the Pharisees of his time, ever accuse them of
   falsifying the books of Moses and the prophets, or of using
   supposititious or altered books. And it can never be proved or made
   credible, that, after Christ's time, the scripture should be corrupted
   in any thing of moment; if we do but consider how far and wide the
   Jewish nation, who every where kept those books, was dispersed over the
   whole world. For, first, the ten tribes were carried into Media by the
   Assyrians, and afterwards the other two. And many of these fixed
   themselves in foreign countries, after they had a permission from Cyrus
   to return; the Macedonians invited them into Alexandria with great
   advantages; [453] the cruelty of Antiochus, the civil war of the
   Asmonæi, and the foreign wars of Pompey and Sossius, scattered a great
   many; the country of Cyrene was filled with Jews; [454] the cities of
   Asia, [455] Macedonia, [456] Lycaonia, [457] and the isles of Cyprus,
   [458] and Crete, [459] (and others, were full of them; and that there
   was a vast number of them in Rome, [460] we learn from Horace, [461]
   Juvena1, [462] and Martial. [463] It is impossible that such distant
   bodies of men should be imposed upon by any art whatsoever, or that
   they should agree in a falsity. We may add further that, almost three
   hundred years before Christ, by the care of the Egyptian kings, the
   Hebrew books were translated into Greek, by those who are called the
   seventy; [464] that the Greeks might have them in another language, but
   the sense the same in the main; upon which account they were the less
   liable to be altered: and the same books were translated into Chaldee,
   and into the Jerusalem language, that is, half Syriac, partly a little
   bcfore, [465] and partly a little after, Christ's time. [466] After
   which followed other Greek versions, that of Aquila, Symmachus, and
   Theodotion; which Origen, and others after him, compared with the
   seventy interpreters, and found no difference in the history, or in any
   weighty matters. Philo flourished in Caligula's time, and Josephus
   lived till Vespasian's. Each of them quote out of the Hebrew books the
   same things that we find at this day. By this time the Christian
   religion began to be more and more spread, and many of its profession
   were Hebrews: [467] many had studied the Hebrew learning, [468] who
   could very easily have perceived and discovered it, it the Jews had
   received any thing that was false, in any remarkable subject; I mean,
   by comparing it with more ancient books. But they not only do this, but
   they bring very many testimonies out of the Old Testament, plainly is
   that sense in which they are received amongst the He. brews, which
   Hebrews may be convicted of any crime sooner than (I will not say of
   falsity, but) of negligence, in relation to these books; because they
   used to transcribe and compare them so very scrupulously, that they
   could tell how often every letter came over. [469] We may add, in the
   first place, an argument, and that no mean one, why the Jews did not
   alter the scripture designedly; because the Christians prove, and, as
   they think, very strongly, that their Master Jesus was that very
   Messiah who was of old promised to the forefathers of the Jews; and
   this from those very books which were read by the Jews. Which the Jews
   would have taken the greatest care should never have been, after there
   arose a controversy between them and the Christians, if it had ever
   been in their power to have altered what they would.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [445] See what Josephus cites out of them, book viii. chap. 2. of his
   ancient history; where he adds, that if any one would see the copies of
   those epistles which Solomon and Hirom wrote to each other, they may be
   procured of the public keepers of the records at Tyrus. (We must be
   cautious how we believe this; however, see what I have said upon 1
   Kings v. 3.) There is a remarkable place concerning David, quoted by
   Josephus, book vii. chap. 6. of his ancient history, out of the fourth
   of Damascenus's history: "A long while after this, there was a certain
   man of that country, who was very powerful, his name was Adadus, who
   reigned in Damascus, and the other parts of Syria, except Phoenice: he
   waged war with David, king of Judæa, and having fought many battles,
   the last was at Euphrates, where he was overcome: he was accounted one
   of the best kings, for strength and valour: after his death, his
   children reigned for ten generations, each of them continuing his
   father's government and name, in the same manner as the Egyptian kings
   are called Ptolemies. The third being the most potent of them all,
   being willing to recover the victory his grandfather had lost, made war
   upon the Jews, and laid waste that which is now called Samaria." The
   first part of this history we have in 2 Sam. viii. 5. 1 Chron. xviii.
   and the latter part in 1 Kings xx. This Adadus is called by Josephus,
   Adar; and Adores by Justin, out of Trogus. Eusebius, in his Gospel
   Preparation, book iv. chapter 30. tells us more things concerning
   David, out of Eupolemus. And the fore-mentioned Josephus. in the same
   chapter, and in his first against Appion, brings this place oat of
   Dius's Phoenician history: "After Abibalus's death, his son Hirom
   reigned; this man increased the eastern part of the city, and much
   enlarged the city; and he joined Jupiter Olympius's temple to the city,
   which before stood by itself in an island, by filling up the space
   between; and he adorned it with the gifts of gold offered to the gods;
   he also went up to Libanus, and cat down wood to adorn the temple with.
   And they say that Solomon, who reigned in Jerusalem, sent riddles to
   Hirom, and received some from him; and he that could not resolve the
   riddles was to pay a large stun of money. Afterwards Abdemonus, a man
   of Tyre, resolved the riddles that were proposed, and sent others,
   which Solomon not resolving, paid a large sum of money to Hirom." He
   afterwards adds a famous place of Menander, the Ephesian, who wrote the
   affairs of the Greeks and barbarians. "After Abibalus's death, his son
   Hirom succeeded in the government; he lived thirty-four years, and
   inclosed a large country, and erected the golden pillar in Jupiter's
   temple. He afterwards cut down wood from the mountain called Libanus,
   cedar trees for the roof of the temple, and pulled down the old
   temples, and built new. He consecrated the grove of Hercules and
   Astarte. He first laid the foundation of Hercules's in the month
   Peritius, and afterwards Astarte's, about the time that he invaded the
   Tityans for not paying tribute, and returned after having reduced them.
   About this time there was one Abdemonus, a young man, who overcame, in
   explaining the riddles proposed by Solomon, the king of Jerusalem. The
   time from this king, to the building of Carthage, is reckoned thus:
   After Hirom's death, Beleazar his son succeeded in the kingdom; who
   lived forty-three years, and reigned seven. After him was his son
   Abdastratus, who lived twenty-nine years, and reigned nine. This man
   was slain by the four children of his nurse, who lay in ambush for him;
   the eldest of which reigned twelve years. After these was Astartus, the
   son of Delæstartus, who lived fifty-four years, and reigned twelve.
   After him came his brother Asergmus, who lived fifty-four years, and
   reigned nine; this man was killed by his brother Pheletes, who seized
   the kingdom, and reigned eight months; he lived fifty years; he was
   slain by Ithobalus, the priest of Astarte, who reigned thirty-two
   years, and lived sixty-eight. He was succeeded by his son Badezorus,
   who lived forty-five years, and reigned six. His successor was Matgemus
   his son, who lived thirty-two years, and reigned nine. He was succeeded
   by Pygmalion, who lived fifty-six years, and reigned forty-seven. In
   his seventh year, his sister, who fled from him, built the city of
   Carthage in Libya." Theophilus Antiochenus, in his third book to
   Autolychus, has set down this place of Menander, but has contracted it.
   Tertullian, in his apology, chap. 19. says, "We must look into the
   records of the most ancient nations, Egyptians, Chaldæans, Phoenicians,
   by whom we are supplied with knowledge; such as Manethon the Egyptian,
   or Berosus the Chaldæan, or Hirom the Phoenician, king of Tyre; and
   their followers, Mendesius Ptolemæus, and Menander the Ephesian, and
   Demetrius Phalereus, and king Juba, and Appion, and Thallus." This
   Hirom, and Solomon, who was cotemporary with him, are mentioned also by
   Alexander Polyhister, Menander, Pergamenus, and Lætus in the Phoenician
   accounts, as Clemens affirms, Strom. i. whence we may correct Tatian,
   who wrote Chaitos Chætus, for laitos Lætus, who is reported to have
   translated into Greek what Theodotus, Hypsicrates, and Mochus wrote
   about Phoenicia. The memory of Hazael king of Syria, whose name is in 1
   Kings xix. 15. 2 Kings viii. 13. xii. 17. xiii. 3, 24. is preserved at
   Damascus, with divine worship, as Josephus relates, book ix. chap. 2.
   of his ancient history. The same name is in Justin, out of Trogus.
   Concerning Salmanasar, who carried the ten tribes into captivity, as it
   is related in 2 Kings xvii. 3, &c. and who took Samaria, 2 Kings xviii.
   9. there is a place of Menander the Ephesian, which I mentioned before,
   in Josephus, book ix. ch.14. "Elulæus reigned thirty-six years: this
   man with a fleet reduced the Cittæans, who revolted from him. But the
   king of Assyria sent an army against them, and brought war upon all
   Phoenicia; and having made peace with them all, returned back again.
   But Sidon, Arce, Palætyrus, and many other cities, who had yielded
   themselves to the king of Assyria, revolted from the Tyrian government;
   yet the Tyrians not submitting, the king of Assyria returned upon them
   again, after he had received from the Phoenicians sixty ships and eight
   hundred rowers. Against which the Tyrians coming out with twelve ships,
   broke their enemies ships in pieces, and took five hundred men
   prisoners: hereupon the price of every thing was raised in Tyre. Then
   the king of Assyria departed, and placed guards upon the river, and
   upon the water-pipes, that they might hinder the Tyrians from drawing
   any; and this they did for fire years, and they were forced to drink
   out of wells which they digged." Josephus adds in the same place, that
   Salmanasar, the name of this king, remained till his time in the Tyrian
   records. Sennacherib, who subdued almost all Judæa, except Jerusalem,
   as it is related, 2 Kings xviii. 13. 2 Chron. xxxii. 1. Isaiah xxxvi.
   l. his name and expeditions into Asia and Egypt are found in Berosus's
   Chaldaics, as the same Josephus testifies, book x. chap. 1. and
   Herodotus, in his second book, mentions the same Sennacherib, and calls
   him king of the Arabians and Assyrians. Baladan king of Babylon is
   mentioned in 2 Kings xx. 12. and Isaiah xxxix. And the same name is in
   Berosus's Babylonics, as Josephus testifies in his ancient history,
   book x. chap. 3. Herodotus mentions the battle In Mageddo, in which
   Nechao king of Egypt overcame the Jews, (which history is in 2 Chron.
   xxxv. 22. Zech. xii. 1.) in the fore-said second book, in these words:
   "And Necho encountered the Syrians" (for so Herodotus always calls the
   Jews, as do others also) "in a land battle, and overcame them in
   Magdolus.

   [446] Concerning him, Josephus has preserved us a place of Berosus, in
   the tenth of his ancient history, and in his first book against Appion;
   which may be compared with Eusebius, who, in his Chronicon about these
   times, and in his Prepar. book ix. chap. 40 and 41. produces this and
   the following place of Abydenus: "Nabopallasarus his father, hearing
   that he who was appointed governor over Egypt, and the places about
   Coelo-Syria and Phoenice, had revolted, being himself unable to bear
   hardships, he invested his son Nabuchadonosor, who was a young man,
   with part of his power, and sent him against him. And Nabuchadonosor,
   coming to a battle with the rebel, smote him, and took him, and reduced
   the whole land to his subjection again. It happened about this time
   that his father Nabopallasarus fell sick, and died, in the city of
   Babylon, after he had reigned twenty-nine years. Nabuchadonosor in a
   little time hearing of the death of his father, after he had put in
   order his affairs in Egypt, and the rest of the country, and committed
   to some of his friends the power over the captives of the Jews,
   Phoenicians, Syrians, and the people about Egypt, and ordered every
   thing that was left of any use to be conveyed to Babylon, he himself
   with a few came through the wilderness to Babylon; where he found
   affairs settled by the Chaldæans, and the government maintained under
   one of the most eminent amongst them, so that he inherited his father's
   kingdom entire; and having taken a view of the captives, he ordered
   them to be dispersed by colonies, throughout all the proper places in
   the country about Babylon. And he richly adorned the temple of Belus,
   and others, with the spoils of the war; and he renewed the ancient city
   of Babylon, by adding another to it; so as that afterwards, in a siege,
   the river might never be turned out of its course, to assault the city.
   He also encompassed the city with three walls within, and three
   without, some made of tile and pitch, others of tile alone. The city
   being thus well walled, and the gates beautifully adorned, he added to
   his father's palace a new one, far exceeding it in height and
   costliness; to relate the particulars of which would be tedious.
   However, as exceeding great and beautiful as it was, it was finished in
   fifteen days; on this palace he built very high walks of stone, which
   to the sight appeared like mountains, and planted them with all sorts
   of trees, and made what they call a pensile garden, for his wife, who
   was brought up in Media, to delight herself with the prospect of the
   mountainous country. After he had begun the fore-mentioned wall, he
   fell sick and died, having reigned forty-three years." This wife of
   Nabuchadonosor is Nitocris, according to Herodotus, in his first book,
   as we learn from the great Scaliger, in his famous appendix to the
   Emendation of Time. These things are explained by Curtius, in his fifth
   book, to which I refer you, and partly by Strabo, book xv. and
   Diodorus, book ii. Berosus, out of whom we have quoted these things,
   and those before, was the priest of Belus, after Alexander the great's
   time; to whom the Athenians erected a statue with a golden tongue, in
   the public gaming place, for his divine predictions. This is mentioned
   by Pliny, book vii. chap. 37. of his natural history. Athenæus, in his
   fifteenth, calls his book Babylonica. Tatian (who himself also affirms
   that Berosus mentions Nabuchadonosor) and Clemens call it Chaldaica.
   King Juba confesses, that he took out hence what he wrote concerning
   the affairs of Syria, as Tatian observes. He is also mentioned by
   Vitruvius, and by Tertullian in his apology, and by the writer of the
   Alexandrian Chronicon. Eusebius, both in his Chronicon and in the end
   of the ninth of his Preparation, tells us, that Nabuchadonosor is
   mentioned also by Abydenus, who wrote of the Assyrians: the words are
   these: "Megasthenes says, that Nabuchodrosorus was stronger than
   Hercules, and waged war against Libya and Iberia, and having overcome
   them, he planted them in several colonies on the right shore of the
   sea. And the Chaldæans relate moreover concerning him, that as he was
   going into his palace on a certain time, he was inspired by a god, and
   spake the following words: I Nabuchodrosorus foretel a sad calamity
   that will befal you, O Babylonians; which neither Belus, our
   forefather, nor queen Beltia, could persuade the fates to avert: there
   shall come a Persian mule, who, assisted by your gods, shall bring
   slavery upon you; Medus, the glory of the Assyrians, will also help to
   do this. I wish, that, before he betrays his countrymen, some
   Charybdis, or sea, would swallow him up, and destroy him; or that he
   were directed another way, through the wilderness, where there are no
   cities, or footsteps of men, where the wild beasts feed, and the birds
   fly about; that he might wander solitary amongst the rocks and dens;
   and that a happy end had overtaken me, before these things were put
   into my mind. Having prophesied this, he suddenly disappeared." Compare
   this last with that which is said of this Nabuchadonosor in the book of
   Daniel; the first, out of Megasthenes, we have also in Josephus, book
   x. chap. 11. of his ancient history; and he says it is in the fourth of
   his Indian history. Eusebius likewise has this concerning
   Nabuchadonosor, out of Abydenus: "It is reported (of the place where
   Babylon stands) that at first it was all water, called sea, but Belus
   drained it, and allotted to every one his portion of laud, and
   encompassed Babylon with a wall, which time has worn out. But
   Nabuchadonosor walled it again, which remained till the Macedonian
   empire; and it had brazen gates." And a little after: "When
   Nabuchadonosor came to the government, in fifteen days time he walled
   Babylon with a triple wall, and be turned out of their course the
   rivers Armacale and Acracanus, which is an arm of Euphrates. And, for
   the city of the Sipparenians, he digged a pool forty furlongs round,
   and twenty fathoms deep; and made sluices to open and water the fields;
   they call them guides to the aquæducts. He also built up a wall to
   exclude the Red sea; and he rebuilt Teredon, to hinder the incursions
   of the Arabians; and he planted his palace with trees, called the
   pensile gardens." Compare this with Dan. iv. 30. And &mho, book xv.
   quotes these words also out of the same Magasthenes: "Nabuchadonosor,
   whose fame amongst the Chaldæans is greater than Hercules, went as far
   as the pillars." There were others who touched upon the history of this
   king, but we have only the names of them remaining. Diocles in the
   second of his Persian history, and Philostratus in that of the Indians
   and Phoenicians, who says that Tyre was besieged by him thirteen years,
   as Josephus tells us, in the fore-cited place of his ancient history,
   and in his first book against Appion, where he quotes the following
   words out of the public acts of the Phoenicians: "When Ithobalus was
   king, Nabuchadonosor besieged Tyre thirteen years. After him, Baal
   reigned ten years; after him, judges were appointed to govern Tyre;
   Eccibalus, the son of Baslacus, two months; Chelbes, the son of
   Abdaius, ten months; Abbarus, the high priest, three months; Mutgonus
   aud Gerastratus, the sons of Abdelinus, were judges six years; betwixt
   whom Belatorus reigned one. After his death they sent and fetched
   Cerbalus from Babylon; he reigned four years. After his death they sent
   for his brother Hirom, who reigned twenty years. In his time Cyrus the
   Persian flourished." For the exact agreement of this computation with
   the sacred books, see Josephus in the fore-cited book against Appion:
   where follows in Josephus these words concerning Hecatæus "The
   Persians," says he, "drew many millions of us to Babylon." And
   concerning the war of Sennacherib, and Nabuchadonosor's captivity, see
   the place of Demetrius in Clemens, Strom. i. Hecatæus's authority is
   very little to the purpose, because he is a spurious writer. See Ger.
   J. Vossius upon the Greek historians. Le Clerc.

   [447] After the fore-cited words of Berosus, follow these, according to
   Josephus, in both the places now mentioned: "His son Evilmaradoch was
   made head of the kingdom; he managed affairs unjustly and wantonly;
   after he had reigned two years, he was treacherously slain by
   Neriglissoroorus, who married his sister: after his death,
   Neriglissoroorus, who thus killed him, possessed the government, and
   reigned four years. His son Laborosoarchodus, a youth, reigned nine
   months: but, because there appeared In him many evil dispositions, he
   was slain by the treachery of his friends. After his death, they who
   killed him agreed to devolve the government upon Nabonnidus, a certain
   Babylonian, who was also one of the conspirators. In this reign, the
   walls of the city Babylon, along the river, were beautified with burnt
   brick and pitch. In the seventeenth year of his reign, Cyrus came out
   of Persia with a great army, and, having subdued all the rest of Asia,
   he came as far as Babylon; Nabonnidus, hearing of his coming, met him
   with a great army also, but he was overcome in the battle, and fled
   away with a few, and shut up himself in the city of the Borsippeni.
   Then Cyrus, having taken Babylon, ordered the outward walls of the city
   to be rated, because the people appeared to be very much given to
   change, and the town hard to be taken; and went from thence to
   Borsippus, to besiege Nabonnidus; but he not mining the siege, yielded
   himself immediately; whereupon Cyrus treated him kindly, and, giving
   him Carmania to dwell in, he sent him out of Babylonia; and Nabonnidus
   passed the reminder of his days in that country, and died there."
   Eusebius, to the fore-mentioned place, has preserved the following
   words of Abydenus, immediately after those now quoted concerning
   Nabuchadonosor: "After him reigned his son Evilmaruruchus: his wife's
   brother Neriglasarus, who slew him, left a son, whose name was
   Labossoarascus. He dying by a violent death, they made Nabannidachus
   king, who was nut related to him. Cyrus, when he took Babylon, made
   this man governor of Carmania." This Evilmerodach is mentioned by name
   in 2 Kings xxv. 27. Concerning the rest, see Scaliger. That of Cyrus's
   taking Babylon agrees with this of Herodotus: "So Cyrus made an
   irruption as far as Babylon; and the Babylonians having provided an
   army, expected him: as soon as he approached the city, the Babylonians
   fought with him; but, to save themselves from being beaten, they shut
   themselves up in the city." Compare this with the fifty-first of
   Jeremiah, 29, 30, 31. Concerning the flight at Borsippe, see Jeremiah
   li. 30. Concerning the drying up the river's channel, Herodotus agrees
   with Jeremiah li. 32. The words of Herodotus are: "He divided the
   river, bringing it to a standing lake, so that he made the ancient
   current passable, having diverted the river." It is worth considering,
   whether what Diodorus relates in his second book, concerning Belesis
   the Chaldæan, may not have respect to Daniel, whose name in Chaldee was
   Beltashazzar, Dan. i. 7. The truth of what we read in scripture,
   concerning the Chaldæan kings, is strongly confirmed by the chronology
   of the astronomical canon of Nabonassar, as you may see in sir John
   Marsham's chronological canon. Le Clerc.

   Chephre. He was contemporary with Nabuchadonosor.

   this time lived Hecatæus Abderita, so famous in Plutarch, in his book
   concerning Isis; and Laërtius in Pyrrho; he wrote a single book
   concerning the Jews, whence Josephus, in book ii. against Appion, took
   a famous description of the city and temple of Jerusalem; which place
   we find in Eusebius, b. ix. c. 4. of his Gospel Preparation; and in
   each of them there is a place of Clearchus, who commends the Jewish
   wisdom, in the words of Aristotle. And Josephus, in the same book,
   names Theophilus, Theodoret, Mnaseas, Aristophanes, Hermogenes,

   Jews, and gave testimony concerning the Jewish affairs.

   may add that of Philo against Flaccus; "There are no less than ten
   hundred thousand Jews, inhabitants of Alexandria, and the country about
   it, from the lower parts of Libya, to the borders of Ethiopia." See

   Which is taken out of Seneca, who said of the same Jews, "The customs
   of the must wicked nation have prevailed so far, that they are embraced
   all the world over; so that the conquered give Laws to the conquerors."
   The place is in Augustine, book vi. ch. 11. of his city of God. He
   calls them the most wicked nation, only for this reason, because their
   laws condemned the neglect of the worship of one God, as we observed
   before; upon which account Cato Major blamed Socrates. To which may be
   added the testimony of Philo, in his embassy, on the vast extent of the
   Jewish nation. "That nation consists of so great a number of men, that
   it does not, like other nations, take up one country only, and confine
   itself to that; but possesses almost the whole world; for it
   overspreads every continent and island, that they seem not to be much
   fewer than the inhabitants themselves." Dion Cassius, book xxxvi.
   concerning the Jewish nation, says, "That though it has been often
   suppressed it has increased so much the more, so as to procure the
   liberty of establishing its laws."

   for it was otherwise before, in the time of their commonwealth: and
   after it was overturned by the Chaldæans, they were not so accurate as
   is commonly thought. This is evident from Lud. Cappellus's critics upon
   the Bible, and from the commentaries of learned men upon the Old
   Testament, and likewise from Grotius's own annotations. And we have
   also shewn it to be so on the historical books of the Old Testament. Le

THE TRUTH

    OF THE

CHRISTIAN RELIGION.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

BOOK IV.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. I. A particular confutation of the religions that differ from
  Christianity.

   THE fourth book (beginning with that pleasure men, for the most part,
   take at the sight of the other men's danger, when they themselves are
   placed out of the reach of it) shews, that the principal aim of a
   Christian ought to be, not only a satisfaction upon his having found
   out the truth himself, but also an endeavour to assist others, who
   wander in various crooked paths of error, and to make them partakers of
   the same happiness. And this we have, in some measure, attempted to do
   in the foregoing books, because the demonstration of the truth contains
   in it the confutation of error. But, however, since the particular
   sorts of religion which are opposed to Christianity, as Paganism,
   Judaism, or Mahometanism, for instance, besides that which is common to
   all, have some particular errors, and some special arguments, which
   they use to oppose us with; I think it may not be foreign to our
   present purpose to attempt a particular examination of every one of
   them; in the mean time, beseeching our readers to free their judgment
   from all passion and prejudice, which clog the understanding; that they
   may the more impartially determine concerning what is to be said.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. II. And, first, of Paganism. That there is but one God. That created
  beings are either good or bad. That the good are not to be worshipped without
  the command of the supreme God.

   AND, first, against the heathens we say,--If they suppose many gods,
   eternal and equal, this is sufficiently confuted in the first book;
   where we have shewn that there is but one God, the cause of all things.
   If by gods they mean created beings superior to man, these are either
   good or bad; if they say they are good, they ought, in the first place
   to be very well assured of this, lest they fall into great danger, by
   entertaining enemies instead of friends; deserters instead of
   ambassadors. [470] And reason also requires that there should be some
   manifest difference in the worship betwixt the Supreme God and these
   beings: and further, we ought to know of what rank these beings are,
   what benefit we may expect from any of them, and what honour the
   Supreme King would have us pay to them. All which things being wanting
   in their religion, it sufficiently appears from thence, that there is
   nothing of certainty in it; and it would be much safer for them to
   betake themselves to the worship of the one Supreme God: which even
   Plato [471] owned to be the duty of a wise man; because as good beings
   are the ministers of the Supreme God, they cannot but be assisting to
   such as are in favour with him. [472]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [470] 2 Cor. xi. 14. Porphyry, in his second book about abstaining from
   eating animals, says, that "by those who are opposite (to the gods) all
   witchcraft is performed; for both these and their chief are worshipped
   by all such as work evil upon men's fancies, by enchantments; for they
   have a power to deceive, by working strange things: by them evil
   spirits prepare philtres and love-potions, all incontinence, and love
   of riches and honour, and especially deceit, proceed from them; for it
   is natural for them to lie: they are willing to be thought gods, and
   the highest of them in power to be esteemed God." And afterwards
   concerning the Egyptian priests: "These put it past all dispute, that
   there are a kind of beings who give themselves up to deceive, of
   various shapes and sorts; dissemblers, sometimes assuming the form of
   gods or daemons, or of souls of dead men; and by this means they can
   effect any seeming good or evil: but as to things really good in
   themselves, such as those belonging to the soul; of producing these
   they have no power, neither have they any knowledge of them; but they
   abuse their leisure, mock others, and hinder those who walk in the way
   of virtue; they are filled with pride, and delight in perfumes and
   sacrifice." And Arnobius, book iv. against the Gentiles; "Thus the
   magicians, brethren to the soothsayers is their actions, mention
   certain beings, opposite to God, who often impose upon men for true
   gods. And these are certain spirits of grosser matter, who feign
   themselves to be gods." Not to transcribe too much, we find something
   to the same purpose in Jamblichus, concerning the Egyptian mysteries,
   book iii. ch. 31. and book iv. chap. 7, 13.

   [471] "Jupiter is worshipped by us, and other gods by others." The
   words are quoted by Origen, in his eighth book against Celsus.

   [472] This is very well prosecuted by Arnobius, book iii.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. III. A proof that evil spirits were worshipped by the heathen, and the
  unfitness of it shewn.

   BUT that the spirits to which the heathen pain their worship were evil,
   and not good, appears from many substantial arguments. First, because
   they did not direct their worshippers to the worship of the Supreme
   God; [473] but did as much as they could to suppress such worship, or,
   at least, were willing in every thing to be equalled with the Supreme
   God in worship. Secondly, because they were the cause of the greatest
   mischiefs coming upon the worshippers of the one Supreme God, provoking
   the magistrates and the people to inflict punishments upon them: for
   though they allowed their poets the liberty to celebrate the murders
   and adultries of their gods; and the Epicureans to banish the Divine
   Providence out of the world; nor was there any other religion so
   disagreeable in its rites, but they admitted it into their society, as
   the Egyptian, Phrygian, Greek, and Tuscan rites at Rome; yet the Jews
   were every where ridiculed, [474] as appears from their satires and
   epigrams, and were sometimes banished; [475] and the Christians had
   moreover the most cruel punishments inflicted upon them; [476] for
   which there can be no other reason assigned, but because these two
   sects worshipped one God, whose honour the gods they established
   opposed, being more jealous of him than of one another. Thirdly, from
   the manner of their worship, such as is unworthy of a good and virtuous
   mind; by human blood, [477] by men's running naked about their temples,
   [478] by games and dancings, [479] filled with uncleanness; such as are
   now to be seen amongst the people of America and Africa, who are
   overwhelmed in the darkness of heathenism. Nay, more than this, there
   were of old, and still are, people who worship evil spirits, which they
   know and own to be such; as the Arimanes of the Persians, [480] the
   Cacodæmons of the Greeks, and the Vejoves of the Latins: [481] and some
   of the Ethiopians aad Indians now have others; than which, nothing can
   be imagined more impious. For what else is religious worship, but a
   testimony of the exceeding goodness which you acknowledge to be in him
   whom you worship; which, if it be paid to an evil spirit. is false and
   counterfeit, and comprehends in it the sin of rebellion; because the
   honour due to the king is not only taken from him, but transferred to a
   deserter and his enemy. And it is a foolish opinion, to imagine that a
   good God will not revenge this, because that is not agreeable to his
   goodness; for clemency, if it be reasonable, hath its proper bounds;
   [482] and where the crimes are very great, justice itself forces
   punishment, as it were. necessarily. Nor are they less blameable who
   say, that they are driven by fear to pay obedience to evil spirits; for
   he who is infinitely good. is also in the highest degree ready to
   communicate; and therefore all other beings were produced by him. And
   if it be so, it will follow that he hath an absolute right over all
   creatures, as his own. workmanship; so that nothing can be done by any
   of them, if he desires to binder it: which being granted, we may easily
   collect, that evil spirits cannot hurt him who is in favour with the
   most high God, who is infinitely good, any further than that God
   suffers it to be done for the sake of some good. Nor can any thing be
   obtained of evil spirits, but what ought to be refused; because a bad
   being, when he counterfeits one that is good, is then worst; [483] and
   the gifts of enemies are only snares. [484]

  SECT. IV. Against the heathen worship paid to departed men.

   THERE have been, and now are, heathens, who say that they pay worship
   to to the souls of men departed this life. But here, in the first
   place, this worship is also to be distinguished, by manifest tokens,
   from the worship of the Supreme God. Besides, our prayers to them are
   to no purpose, if those souls cannot assist us in any thing; and their
   worshippers are not assured of this; nor is there any more reason to
   affirm that they can, than that they cannot: and what is worst of all
   is, that those men who are thus had in honour, are found to have been
   men remarkable for very great vices. A drunken Bacchus, an effeminate
   Hercules, a Romulus, unnatural to his brother, and a Jupiter, as
   unnatural to his father. So that their honour is a reproach to the true
   God, and that goodness which is well-pleasing to him; because it adds a
   commendation, from religion, to those vices which are sufficiently
   flattering of themselves. [485]

   gratitude that is due to Divine Providence from men for their original
   and birth, they return sacrilege." See the whole place.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. V. Against the worship given to the stars and elements.

   MORE ancient than this was the worship of the stars, and what we call
   the elements, fire, water, air, and earth; [486] which was, indeed, a
   very great error: For prayers are a principal part of religious
   worship, which to put up to any but beings that have understanding is
   very foolish; and that what we call the elements are not such, is
   evident in a good measure from experience. If any one affirms otherwise
   of the stars, he has no proof of it, because no such thing can he
   gathered from their operations, which are the only signs to judge of
   beings by. But the contrary may be sufficiently collected from the
   motion of them, which is not various, like that of creatures endued
   with freedom of will, but certain and determinate. [487] We have
   elsewhere shewn that the course of the stars is adapted to the use of
   man; whence man ought to acknowledge, that he, in his better part,
   bears a nearer resemblance to God, and is dearer to him; and therefore
   ought not to derogate so much from his own high birth, as to place
   himself below those things which God has given him; and he ought to
   give God thanks for them, which is more than they can do for
   themselves, or at least more than we are assured of.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [486] There are reasons to persuade us that idolatry began with the
   worship of angels and the souls of men, as you may see in the in the
   index to the Oriental Philosophy, at the word Idololatria. Le Clerc.

   [487] By which argument a certain king of Peru was persuaded to deny
   that the sun could be a god. See the history of the Incas.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VI. Against the worship given to brute creatures.

   BUT that which is of all things most abominable, is, that some men,
   particularly the Egyptians, fell into the worship even of beasts. [488]
   For though in some of them there do appear, as it were, some shadow of
   understanding, yet it is nothing compared with man; for they cannot
   express their inward conceptions either by distinct words or writings;
   nor do they perform actions of different kinds, nor those of the same
   kind, in a different manner; and much less can they attain to the
   knowledge of number, magnitude, and of the celestial motions. But, on
   the other hand, man, by his cunning and subtlety, can catch the
   strongest creatures, wild beasts, birds, or fishes; and can in some
   measure bring them under rules, as elephants, lions, horses, and oxen;
   [489] he can draw advantage to himself out of those that are most
   hurtful, as physic from vipers: and this use may be made of them all,
   which themselves are ignorant of, that by viewing the structure and
   situation of the parts of their bodies, and comparing together their
   several species and kinds, he learns his own excellency, and how much
   more perfect and noble the frame of the human body Is than others;
   which, if rightly considered, is so far from inclining him to worship
   other creatures, that he should rather think himself appointed their
   god in a manner, under the Supreme God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [488] Concerning whom, Philo, in his embassy, says, "They esteem dogs,
   wolves, lions, crocodiles, and many other wild creatures iv the water
   and on the land, and birds, as gods." To which may be added, a long
   discourse of this matter, in the first book of Diodorus Siculus.

   [489] Euripides in Æolus:--

   Man has but little strength,

   Yet can, by various arts,

   Tame the wildest creatures

   In sea, or earth, or air."
   And Antiphon:-- "They us in strength, we them in art, exceed." Which
   affords us no bad explication of Genesis i. 26. and Psalm viii. 6. He
   that desires a larger discourse of this matter, may look into Oppianus,
   in the beginning of his fifth book of fishing, and Basil's tenth homily
   on the six days of creation. Origen, in his fourth book against Celsus,
   has these words: "And hence you may learn, for how great a help our
   understanding was given us, and how far it exceeds all the weapons of
   wild beasts: for our bodies are much weaker than those of other
   creatures, and vastly less than some of them; yet, by our
   understanding, we bring wild beasts under our power, and hunt huge
   elephants; and those whose nature is such that they may be tamed, we
   make subject to us; and those that are of a different stature, or the
   taming of which seems to be of no use to us, we manage these wild
   beasts with such safety, that, as we will, we keep them shut up, or, if
   we want their flesh for meat, we kill them as we do other creatures
   that are not wild. Whence it appears that the Creator made all living
   creatures subject to him who is endued with reason, and a nature
   capable of understanding him." Claudius Neapolitanus, in Porphyry's
   first book against eating living creatures, speaks thus concerning man:
   "He is lord over all creatures void of reason, as (sod is over man."
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VII. Against the worship given to those things which have no real
  existence.

   We read that the Greeks and Latins, and others likewise, worshipped
   things which had no real existence, but were only the accidents of
   other things. For, not to mention those outrageous things, fever,
   impudence, and such like; [490] health is nothing else but a just
   temperature of the parts of the body; and good fortune, a
   correspondence of events with the wishes of men; and the affections,
   such as love, fear, anger, hope, and the like, arising from the
   consideration of the goodness or badness, the easiness or difficulty of
   a thing, are certain motions in that part of the mind, which is most
   closely connected with the body, by means of the blood; and they have
   no power of their own, but are subject to the command of the will,
   which is mistress of them, at least as far as respects their
   continuance and direction. So likewise the virtues, which have
   different names. Prudence, which consists in the choice of what is
   advantageous; fortitude, in undergoing dangers; justice, in abstaining
   from what is not our our own. Temperance, in moderating pleasure, and
   the like: there is also a certain disposition or inclination towards
   that which is right, which grows upon the mind by long exercise; which,
   as it may be increased, so it may be diminished by neglect, nay, it may
   entirely be destroyed in a man. And honour, [491] to which we read of
   temples being dedicated, is only the judgment of one concerning
   another, as endued with virtue; which often happens to the bad, and not
   to the good, through the natural aptness of mankind to mistake. Since,
   therefore, these things have no real existence, and cannot be compared
   in excellence with those that have a real existence; [492] nor have any
   knowlege of our prayers or veneration of them; it is most disagreeable
   to right reason to worship them as God; and he is rather to be
   worshipped upon their account, who can give us them, and preserve them
   for us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [490] See Tully's third book of the laws.

   [491] Tully in the fore-mentioned place; and Livy, book xxvii.

   [492] Perhaps some may explain this worship of the heathens in this
   manner; as to say, that it was not so much the things, which were
   commonly signified by those words, that they worshipped, es a certain
   divine power, from which they flowed, or certain ideas In the divine
   understanding. Thus they might be said to worship a fever; not the
   disease itself, which is seated in the human body, but that power which
   is in God, of sending or abating a fever: to worship impudence; not
   that vice which is seated in the minds of men, but the will of God,
   which sometimes allows men's impudence to go on, which he can restrain
   and punish; and the. same may be said of the rest, as love, fear,
   anger, hope, which are passions, which God can either excite or
   restrain; or of virtues, which are perfect in the divine nature, and of
   which we see only some faint resemblances in men, arising from the
   ideas of those virtues which are most complete in God: and of honour,
   which does not consist so much in the esteem of men, as in the will of
   God, who would have virtue honourable amongst men. But the heathens
   themselves never interpreted this matter thus; and it is absurd to
   worship the attributes and ideas of God, as real persons, under obscure
   names, such as may deceive the common people. It is much more sincere
   and honest to worship the Deity himself without any perplexities. Le
   Clerc.

  SECT. VIII An answer to the objection of the heathens taken from the miracles
  done amongst them.

   THE heathens used to recommend their religion by miracles; but they
   were such as were liable to many exceptions. For the wisest men amongst
   the heathens themselves rejected many of them, as not supported by the
   testimony of sufficient witnesses. [493] but plainly counterfeit: [494]
   and those that seem to have been done, came to pass in some secret
   place, in the night, before one or two persons, whose eyes might easily
   be deceived with a false appearance of things, by the cunning of the
   priests. There were some, which only caused the people, who did not
   understand the nature of things, especially their occult qualities, to
   wonder at them; much in the same manner as if any one should draw iron
   with a loadstone, before people who knew nothing of it; and it is
   related by many, that these were the arts [495] in which Simon and
   Apollonius Tyanæus were so skilful. I do not deny but that some greater
   than these were seen, which could not be the effect of natural causes,
   by human power alone; but they were such as did not require a power
   truly divine, that is, omnipotent; for these spirits, who were inferior
   to God, and superior to man, were sufficient for these things; because,
   by their swiftness, strength, and cunning, they could easily remove
   distant things, and so compound different sorts of things, as to
   produce effects which should be very surprising to men. But the spirits
   by whom this was effected were not good, and consequently neither was
   their religion good; as is evident from what was said before, and from
   this consideration also, because they said that they were compelled, by
   certain enchantments, against their will: [496] and yet the wisest
   heathens agree, that there could not possibly be any such force in
   words; but that they could only persuade, and this according to the
   manner of their interpretation. And a further sign of their wickedness
   is, that they would undertake many times to entice some to the love of
   others, notwithstanding their own endeavours against it, either by
   false promises, or by doing them some hurt; [497] which things were
   forbidden by human laws, as witchcraft. [498] Neither ought any one to
   wonder that the Supreme God should suffer some miracles to be done by
   evil spirits; because they who were already fallen from the worship of
   the true God, deserved to be deluded by such deceits. [499] But this is
   an argument of their weakness, that their works were not attended with
   any remarkable good; for if any seemed to be called to life again, they
   did not continue long in it, nor exercise the functions of living
   persons. If at any time any thing proceeding from a divine power
   appeared in the sight of the heathen; yet it was not foretold that it
   would come to pass, in order to prove the truth of their religion; so
   that nothing hinders but the Divine Power might propose to itself some
   other end widely different from this. For instance; suppose it true,
   that a blind man was restored to his sight by Vespasian; it might he
   done, to render him more venerable upon this account; and that he might
   thereby the more easily obtain the Roman empire; and was therefore
   chosen by God, to be the executioner of his judgments upon the Jews:
   [500] and other like reasons there might be for other wonders, which
   had no relation at all to religion. [501]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [493] So Livy, in the beginning: "I do not design either to affirm or
   deny those things related before, or upon, the building of the city, as
   fitter for poetic fables, than the sincere memorials of affairs that
   were transacted: thus much must be allowed antiquity, that by mixing
   human things with divine, the original of cities was rendered the more
   venerable."

   [494] It were much better to acquiesce in this answer, than to allow of
   their miracles, or that such things were done, as men could not
   commonly distinguish from miracles, such as oracles, wonders, curing of
   diseases, which, if they were done, could scarce be distinguished from
   true miracles, at least by the common people. See what I have said upon
   this matter in the prolegomena to my ecclesiastical history, sect. ii.
   chap. 1. Le Clerc.

   [495] Tatian: "There are certain diseases and contrarieties of the
   matter of which we are compounded; when these happen, the dæmons
   ascribe the causes of them to themselves."

   [496] Thus the oracle of Hecate in Porphyry:-- "I come, invoked by
   well-consulted prayers,
   Such as the gods have to mankind reveal'd." And again, "Why have you
   call'd the goddess Hecate
   From heaven, and forc'd her by a charm divine?" And that of Apollo in
   the same writer, "Hear me, for I am forc'd to speak against my will."
   These are the rites of their secret arts by which they address
   themselves to I know not what powers, as Arnobius expresses it, as if
   they compelled them by charms to be their servants; so Clemens
   (explains it. There is a form of their threats in Jamblichus, book vi.
   chap. 5, 6, 7. of his Egyptian mysteries. The same we meet with in
   Lucan, book ix. in the words of Pompey the less; and in Eusebius out of
   Porphyry, book v. chap. 10. of his gospel preparation. Other forms of
   threatenings you have in Lucan, where he speaks of Erichthon, and in
   Papinius about Tiresias.

   confession of Porphyry in Eusebius, book v. chap. 7. of his Preparat.

   previous good luck, the empire was decreed to Vespasian and his
   children, by the secret law of fate, and by wonders and oracles."
   Suetonius ushers in his relation of the same miracles thus, chap. 7.
   "There was a certain authority and majesty wanting, viz. in a new and
   unthought-of prince; to which this was added." See the same Suetonius a
   little before, chap. 5. Josephus says of the same Vespasian, book iii.
   chap. 27. of the wars of the Jews, "That God raised him up to the
   government, and foretold him of the sceptre by other signs."

  SECT. IX. And from oracles.

   AND almost all the same things may be applied to solve that which they
   allege concerning oracles; especially what was before said, that such
   men deserved to be imposed upon, who despised that knowledge which
   reason and ancient tradition suggested to every man. Moreover the words
   of the oracles were for the most part ambiguous, and such as might be
   interpreted of the event, be it what it would. [502] And if any thing
   was more particularly foretold by them, there is no necessity of its
   proceeding from an omniscient Being; because either they were such as
   might be perceived beforehand, from natural causes then appearing, as
   some physicians foretel future diseases; [503] or they might with
   probability be conjectured, from what we usually see come to pass;
   which we read was often done by those who were skilful in civil
   matters. [504] And if at any time God made use of any of those works,
   done by the diviners among the heathen, to foretel such things as could
   have no other real foundation but the will of God, it did not tend to
   confirm the heathen religion, but rather to overthrow it; such as those
   things we find in Virgil's fourth eclogue, taken out of the Sibylline
   verses; [505] in which, though unknown to himself, he describes the
   coming of Christ, and the benefits we should receive from him: [506]
   Thus, in the same Sibyls, that he was to be acknowledged as king, who
   was to be truly our king; [507] who was to rise out of the east, and be
   lord of all things. [508] The oracle of Apollo [509] is to beseen in
   Porphyry; [510] in which be says, the other gods were aërial spirits,
   and that the one God of the Hebrews was to be worshipped: which words
   if the worshippers of Apollo obeyed, they ceased to be his worshippers;
   if they did not obey him, they accused their god of a lie. To which may
   be added, that if these spirits would in their oracles have consulted
   the good of mankind, they would, above alt things, have proposed to
   them a general rule of life, and assured them of a reward, which they
   who so lived might expect; but they did neither of them. On the
   contrary, they many times in their Verses applauded kings, though never
   so wicked: [511] decreed divine honours to champions, [512] enticed men
   to unlawful embraces, [513] to pursue unjust gain, [514] and to commit
   murder; [515] which may be evidenced by many instances.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [502] See the places of OEnomaus, concerning this subject, in Eusebius,
   book iv. chap. 20, 21, 22, 23, 21, 25, 26. Hence Apollo was by the
   Greeks called Loxi'as. Ambiguous. Cicero, in his second book of
   divination, says, the oracles of Apollo were ambiguous and obscure.
   "Whichsoever of them came to pass, (says he), the oracle was
   true."--(Perhaps many of the oracles were counterfeited after the
   event; and there are many reasons to suspect that abundance of frauds
   were used by diviners; concerning which D. de Fontenelle has written an
   excellent book in French, which I refer you to, and what is said in
   defence of it, vol. xiii. of the Choice Library; and what Antony Van
   Dale has written of this matter above all others, in his book of
   oracles. (Le Clerc).

   [503] Chalcidius on Timæus. "Men are forewarned either by the flying of
   birds, or by entrails, or by oracles, some propitious Dæmons
   foretelling, who knew all things that will afterwards come to pass;
   just as a physician, according to the rules of physic, de. dares either
   death or health, and as Anaximander and Pherecydes did an earthquake."
   Pliny, book ii. chap. 79.

   [504] See the writers of the life of Atticus. "A plain evidence of this
   thing, besides those books wherein he (Cicero) mentions it expressly,
   (which are published among the common people), are sixteen volumes of
   epistles sent to Atticus, from his consulship to the end of his days;
   which whoever reads, will not think that he wants a complete and
   regular history of those times; there is such a full description of the
   inclinations of princes, of the vices of great men, and of the
   alterations in the republic, that there is no. thing which is not laid
   open; so that one would easily be led to think prudence to be a kind of
   divination. For Cicero did not only foretel future things that would
   happen in his own lifetime, but, like a diviner, declared those also
   that came to pass lately." Cicero affirms truly of himself, in his
   sixth epistle of his sixteenth book: "In that war, nothing happened ill
   which I did not foretel. Wherefore, since I who am a public augur, like
   other augurs and astrologers, by my former predictions, have confirmed
   you in the authority of augury and divination, you ought to believe
   what I foretel. I do not make my conjecture from the flying of birds
   nor from the manner of their chirping, as our art teaches us, not from
   the rebounding of the corn that falls from the chickens' mouths, nor
   from dreams; but I have other signs, which I observe." Thus Solon
   foretold that great calamities would come upon Athens, from Munichia.
   And Thales, that the forum of the Milesii would one time be in a place
   then despised. Plutarch in Solon.

   [505] See Augustine's city of God, book x. chap. 27.

   [506] It is now sufficiently evident, that all the prophecies of the
   Sibyls are either doubtful or forged; wherefore I would not have
   Virgil, an interpreter of the Sibyl, be thought to have declared a kind
   of prophecy, without any design like Caiaphas, who was ignorant of what
   he prophesied: I know not what Sibyl, or rather person under the
   disguise of such a one, predicted, that the golden age was a-coming;
   from the opinion of those who thought that there would be a renovation
   of all things, and that the same things would come to pass again. See
   what Grotius has said of this matter, book ii. sect. 10. and the notes
   upon that place. Wherefore in this, the Sibyl was not a prophetess, nor
   did Virgil write thence any prophecies of Christ. See Servius upon the
   place, and Isaac Vossius's interpretation of that eclogue. Le Clerc.

   [507] Cicero mentions him in his second book of divination.

   [508] Suetonius of Vespasian, chap. 4. Tacitus, Hist. v.

   [509] 5 See Augustine of the city of God, book xix. chap. 23. and
   Eusebius's Preparat. book iv. chap. 4. And the same Porphyry, in his
   book of Oracles, says, "the god (Apollo) testifies that the Egyptians,
   Chaldæans, Phoenicians, Lydians, and Hebrews, are they who have found
   out the truth." He that wrote the exhortation to the Greeks, amongst
   the works of Justin, quotes this oracle:--

   "The Hebrews only and Chaldees are wise,
   Who truly worship God the Eternal King."
   And this, "Who the first mortal form'd, and call'd him Adam." There are
   two oracles of Cato's concerning Jesus, which Eusebius in his gospel
   demonstration, transcribed out of Porphyry:--

   "Souls, of their bodies stript, immortal are;
   This wise men know; and that which is endued
   With greatest piety, excels the rest."
   "The souls of pious men to heaven ascend,
   Though various torments do their bodies vex."
   The same are mentioned by Augustine, book xix. chap. 23. of his city of
   God, out of the same Porphyry: where he brings another oracle, in which
   Apollo said, that the Father whom the pious Hebrews worshipped, was a
   law to all the gods.

   [510] This is justly enough said upon Porphyry, and those who are of
   the same opinion with him, concerning those oracles; and may be brought
   as an argument ad hominem, as logicians call it; but since it does not
   appear that these oracles were not feigned, nay, there are very good
   reasons to think they were fictitious, they ought to be of no weight
   amongst Christians. Le Clerc.

   book v. chap. 23, and 35.

   [512] See his same author, chap. 34. of Cleomedes; which we find also
   in Origen's third book against Celsus.

   fore-mentioned book of Eusebius, chap 19, and 27.

  SECT. X. The heathen religion rejected, because it failed of its own accord,
  as soon as human assistance was wanting.

   BESIDES those things already alleged, the heathen religion affords us a
   very strong argument against itself, in that wheresoever human force
   was wanting, it immediately fell, as if its only support were then
   taken away. For, if you turn your eyes towards all the Christian or
   Mahometan empires, you will find heathenism no where mentioned but in
   books: nay, history informs us, that in those times when the emperors
   made use of force and punishment, as the first emperors did, or of
   learning and cunning, as Julian did, to support the heathen religion;
   even then it continually decreased; no force being made use of against
   it, no greatness of family, (for it was commonly believed that Jesus
   was the son of a carpenter), no flourish of words, no bribes, (for they
   were poor), no flattery, for they on the contrary despised all
   advantages, and said there was no adversity but they ought to undergo,
   upon account of their law. And now, how weak must the heathen religion
   be, to be overthrown by such weak forces? Nor did the vain credulity of
   the heathens only vanish at this doctrine, but spirits themselves came
   out of men, at the name of Christ; [516] were silenced; and being asked
   the reason of their silence, were forced to own, that they could do
   nothing when Christ was invoked. [517]

     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XI. An answer to this, that the rise and decay of religion is owing to
  the stars.

   THERE were some philosophers who ascribed the rise and decay of all
   religion to the stars; but this starry science, which they profess to
   know and understand, is delivered in such different rules, that there
   is nothing certain to be found in it, but this one thing, that there is
   no certainly in it. [518] I do not speak of those effects which
   naturally follow from necessary causes; but of such as proceed from the
   will of man, which is in its own nature so far free, as that no
   external necessity can be laid upon it; [519] for if the act of willing
   Bowed from such a necessary impression, that power which we experience
   in the soul, of deliberating and choosing, would be given us to no
   purpose: [520] and the justice of all laws, and of rewards and
   punishments, would be entirely taken away; because there is neither
   blame nor desert due to that which is plainly unavoidable. [521]
   Further, since some actions of the will are evil, if they are caused by
   a certain necessity of the heavens, and because God has given such a
   power to the heavens and the heavenly bodies, it will follow, that God,
   who is perfectly good, is the true cause of moral evil; [522] and at
   the same time that be professes his utter abhorrence of wickedness in
   his positive law, he has planted the efficient and inevitable cause of
   it in the nature of things; therefore he wills two things contrary to
   each other, viz. that the same thing should be, and not be; and that
   that should be a sin which is done by a divine impulse. It is said by
   others, with a greater shew of probability, that first the air, and
   afterwards our bodies, are affected by the influence of the stars, and
   so imbibe certain qualities, which for the most part excite in the soul
   desires answerable to them; that by these the will is enticed, and
   oftentimes yields to them. [523] But if this be granted, it makes
   nothing to the question in hand: for the religion of Christ could not
   possibly have its rise from the affections of the body, nor
   consequently from the power of the stars; which, as was said, act upon
   the mind no otherwise than by such affections; because this religion,
   in the highest degree, draws men off from those things that delight the
   body. The wisest astrologers do except truly knowing and good men from
   the law of the stars; [524] and such were they who first proposed the
   Christian religion, as their lives plainly shew: and if we allow a
   power in learning and knowledge to hinder their bodies from being thus
   infected, there always were amongst Christians some who might be
   commended upon this account. Further, the effects of the stars, as the
   most learned confess, respect only particular parts of the world, and
   are temporary: but this religion has continued already for above
   sixteen hundred years, not only in one, but in very distant parts of
   the world, and such as are under very different positions of the stars.

   SECT. XII. The principal things of the Christian religion were approved
   of by the wisest heathens: and if there be any thing in it hard to be
   believed, the like is to be found amongst the heathen.

   THERE is the less reason for the heathens to oppose the Christian
   religion; because all the parts of it are so agreeable to the rules of
   virtue, that, by their own light, they do in a manner convince the
   mind; insomuch that there have not been wanting some amongst the
   heathen who have said those things singly, which in our religion are
   all put together. For instance, that religion does not consist in
   ceremonies, but is in the mind; [525] that he who has it in his heart
   to commit adultery, is an adulterer; [526] that we ought not to return
   an injury; [527] that a husband ought to have but one wife; [528] that
   the bands of matrimony ought not to be dissolved; [529] that it is
   every man's duty to do good to another, [530] especially to him that is
   in want; [531] that, as much as possible, men ought to abstain from
   swearing; [532] that in meat and clothes, they ought to be content with
   what is necessary to supply nature. [533] And if there be any thing in
   the Christian religion difficult to be believed, the like is to be
   found amongst the wisest of the heathens, as we have before made
   appear, with respect to the immortality of the soul, and bodies being
   restored to life again. Thus Plato, taught by the Chaldeans,
   distinguished the divine nature into the Father; the Father's Mind,
   which he also calls a branch of the Deity, the Maker of the world; and
   the soul, which comprehends and contains all things. [534] That the
   Divine nature could be joined with the human, Julian, that great enemy
   to the Christians, believed, and gave an example in Æsculapius, [535]
   who be thought came from heaven to deliver to men the art of physic.
   Many are offended a the cross of Christ; but what stories are there
   which the heathen authors do not tell of their gods! Some were servants
   to kings; others were struck with thunderbolts, ripped up, wounded. And
   the wisest of them affirmed, that the more virtue cost, the more
   delightful it was. Plato, in his second Republic, says, in a manner,
   prophetically, [536] that for a man to appear truly good, it is
   necessary that his virtue be deprived of all its ornaments, so that he
   may be looked upon by others as a wicked man, may be derided, and at
   last hanged: and certainly to be an example of eminent patience, is no
   otherwise to be obtained.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [518] See the excellent dissertation of Bardesanes, the Syrian,
   concerning this matter; which you may find in the Philocalia collected
   from Origen, and in Eusebius's Preparat. book vi. chap. 10.

   [519] See Alexander Aphrodisæus's book concerning this matter.

   [520] See Eusebius's gospel preparat. book vi. chap. 6.

   [521] See Justin, apology ii. "If mankind ho not endued with a power of
   choosing freely; to avoid that which is bad, and to comply with that
   which is good; the cause of either of them cannot be said to be from
   himself." See also what follows. And thus Tatian: "The freedom of the
   will consists in this; that a wicked man is justly punished, because
   his wickedness is from himself; and a good man is rewarded, because he
   has not voluntarily transgressed the will of God." To this may be added
   Chalcidius's disputation concerning this matter in Timæus.

   [522] Plato speaks against this, in his second republic; "The cause is
   from him that chooses; God is not the cause." Thus Chalcidius
   translates it in Timæus, which Justin, in the fore-mentioned place,
   says, agrees with Moses.

   [523] But they speak most truly who deny any such influences at all,
   and acknowledge nothing else in the stars but heat and light; to which
   we may add, their weight resulting from their bigness; but these have,
   properly speaking, no relation to the mind. Le Clerc.

   [524] Thus Zoroaster: "Do not increase your fate." And Ptolemais: "A
   wise man may avoid many influences of the stars."

   [525] Menander:--

   "With a clean mind do sacrifice to God;
   Not so much neat in clothes, as pure in heart."
   Cicero in his second book of the nature of the gods: "The best worship
   of the gods, which is also the most innocent, the most holy, and the
   most full of piety, is to reverence them always with a pure, sincere,
   uncorrupted mind and expression." And again, in his second book of
   laws: "The law commands us to approach the gods sincerely, that is,
   with our minds, which is all in all." Persius, Sat. ii.

   "This let us offer to the gods: (which blear'd
   Messala's offspring can't, with all their cost):
   Justice and right in all our secret thoughts,
   An undissembled virtue from the breast:
   Bring these, and what you please then sacrifice."
   These verses seem to have respect to the Pythian oracle, which we find
   in Porphyry's second book against eating living creatures; where any
   thing offered by a pious man is preferred to hecatombs of another. In
   the same book Porphyry has these words to the like purpose: "Now, they
   esteem him not fit to offer sacrifice worthily, whose body is not
   clothed with a white and clean garment; but they do not think it any
   great matter, if some go to sacrifice, having their bodies clean, and
   also their garments, though their minds be not void of evil: as if God
   were not most delighted with the purity of that which in us is most
   divine, and bears the nearest resemblance to him. For it is written in
   the temple of Epidaurus,

   "Let all who come to offer at this shrine
   Be pure; so we command."
   "New, purity consists in holy thoughts." And a little after: "No
   material things ought to be offered or dedicated to God, who, as the
   wise man said, is above all; for every thing material is impure to him
   who is immaterial: wherefore words are not proper to express ourselves
   by to him, not even internal ones, if polluted by the passions of the
   mind." And again: "For it is not reasonable that in those temples which
   are dedicated to the gods by men, they should wear clean shoes without
   any spots; and in the temple of the Father, that is, in this world, not
   keep their inner clothes (which is the body) neat, and converse with
   purity in the temple of their Father." Neither can I omit what follows
   out of the same book: "Whoever is persuaded that the gods have no need
   of these, (sacrifices), but look only to the manners of those who
   approach them, esteeming right notions of them and of things, the best
   sacrifices; how can such a one be otherwise than sober, godly, and
   righteous?" Where we find these three known words of Paul, Tit. ii. 2.
   soberly, righteously, and godly. Charondas, in his preface to the laws:
   "Let your mind be void of all evil: for the gods delight not in the
   sacrifices and expences of wicked men, but in the just and virtuous
   actions of good men." Seneca, quoted by Lactantius in his institutions,
   book vi. chap. 25. "Would you conceive God to be great, propitious, and
   to be reverenced, as meek in majesty, as a friend, and always at hand;
   you must not worship him with sacrifices, and abundance of blood, but
   with a pure mind, and an upright intention." To the same sense is that
   of Dion Prusæensis, orat. 3. Thucydides, book i. "There is no other
   festival, but a man's doing his duty." Diogenes: "Does not a good man
   think every day a festival?"

   [526] Thus Ovid:--

   "He who forbears only because forbid,
   Does sin; hilt body's free, his mind is staked;
   Were be alone, he'd be an adulterer."
   Seneca the father: "There is such a thing as incest, without the act of
   whoredom; viz. the desire of it." And in another place: "She is
   reckoned amongst sinners, and not without reason, who is modest out of
   fear, and not for virtue's sake."

   [527] See Plato's Criton, and Maximus Tyrius's second dissertation.
   Menander:--

   "O Gorgias, he's the very best of men,
   Who can forgive the greatest injuries."
   Ariston Spartianus: "To a certain person, who said that it was princely
   thing to do good to friends, and evil to enemies: Rather, answered he,
   to do good to friends, and to make enemies friends." And the same Dion,
   the deliverer of Sicily, in Plutarch says, that a true demonstration of
   a philosophical disposition consists not in any one's being kind to his
   friends; but, when he is injured, is being easily entreated, and
   merciful towards those who have offended him.

   [528] See what is before quoted out of Sallust and others, about this
   matter. Euripides in his Andromache:--

   ----"It is by no means fit
   One man should o'er two women have the rule:
   One nuptial bed will a wise man suffice,
   Who would have all things regulated well."
   And more to the same purpose, in the chorus of the same tragedy.

   [529] So it was amongst the Romans till the five hundred and twentieth
   year of the city, as Valerius Maximus informs us, book iii. chap.1.
   Anaxandrides to the same purpose:--

   "'Tis shameful thus for men to ebb and flow."

   [530] Terence's self-tormentor:-- "I am a man, and think every thing
   humane belong to me." "We are by nature related to each other," says
   Florentinus the lawyer, L. ut vim. D. de Justitia. And this is the
   meaning of the proverb, "One man is a kind of god to another." Cicero,
   in his first book of offices, says, there is a mutual society betwixt
   men, all of them being related to one another.

   [531] Horace, book ii.-- "Wretch, why should any want, when you are
   rich?" In Mimus:-- "Mercy procures strong security."

   [532] Pythagoras: "We ought not to swear by the gods, but endeavour to
   make ourselves believed without an oath:" which is largely explained by
   Hierocles, on his golden verses. Marcus Antoninus, book iii. in his
   description of a good man, says, "Such a one needs no oath." Sophocles
   in his OEdipus Coloneus:-- "I would not have you swear, because 'tis
   bad." Clinius the Pythagorean would sooner lose three talents in a
   cause, than affirm the truth with an oath. This story is related by
   Basilius concerning reading Greek authors.

   [533] Euripides:--

   "There are but two things which mankind do want,
   A crust of bread, and draught of springing water;
   Both which are near, and will suffice for life."
   And Lucan:-- "There is enough of bread and drink for all." And
   Aristides:-- " We want nothing but clothes, houses, and food."

   [534] See Plato's epistle to Dionysius. Plato calls the first principle
   the Father; the second principle the Cause or Governor of all things,
   in his epistle to Hermias, Erastus, and Coriscus. The same is called
   the Mind by Plotinus, in his book "of the Three Principal Substances."
   Numenius calls it the Workman, and also the Son: and Amelius the Word,
   as you may see in Eusebius, book xi. chap. 17, 19, 19. See also Cyril's
   third, fourth, and eighth books against Julian. Chalcidius on Timæus,
   calls the first the Supreme God; the second, the Mind, or Providence;
   the third, the Soul of the World, or the Second Mind. In another place
   he distinguishes these three thus: the Contriver, the Commander, and
   the Effecter. He speaks thus of the second: "The reason of God is God
   consulting the affairs of men; which is the cause of men's living well
   and happily, if they do not neglect that gift which the Supreme God has
   bestowed on them."--"The Pythagoreans assign to the Supreme God the
   number three, as perfect," says Servius, on the seventh eclogue. Not
   much differing from which is that of Aristotle, concerning the same
   Pythagoreans, in the beginning of his first book of the heavens.--(This
   is more largely handled by the very learned R. Cudworth, in his English
   work of the intellectual system of the world, book. i. chap. 4. which
   you will not repent consulting. Le Clerc.)

   [535] Book vi. "Amongst those things which have understanding, Jupiter
   produced Æsculapius from himself, and caused him to appear upon earth,
   by means of the fruitful life of the sun; he, taking his journey from
   heaven to earth, appeared in one form in Epidaurus." Thus Porphyry, as
   Cyril relates his words in his fore-mentioned eighth book: "There is a
   certain kind of gods, which in a proper season are transformed into
   men." What the Egyptians' opinion of this matter was, see Plutarch,
   Sympos. viii. quæst. i. to which may be added that place of Acts xiv.
   11.

   [536] 2 The words are these, translated from the Greek: "He will be
   scourged, tormented, bound, his eyes burnt out, and die by crucifixion,
   after he has endured all those evils." Whence he had that, which he
   relates in his third book of Republic: "That a good man will be
   tormented, furiously treated, have his hands cut off, his eyes plucked
   out, will be bound, condemned, and burnt." Lactantius, in his
   institutions, book vi. chap. 17. has preserved this place of Seneca:
   "This is that virtuous man, who, though his body suffer torments in
   every part, though the flame enter into his mouth, though his hands be
   extended on a cross, does not regard what he suffers, but how well."
   Such a one Euripides represents to us in these verses;--

   Burn, scald this tender flesh; drink your full glut
   Of purple blood. Sooner may heaven and earth
   Approach each other, and be join'd in one,
   Than I to you express a flattering word."
   To which that of Æschylus, mentioned by Plato in the fore-cited place,
   exactly agrees:--

   "He strives to be, not to be thought, the best;
   Deep-rooted in his mind he bears a stock,
   Whence all his wiser counsels are derived."

  SECT. I. A confutation of Judaism, beginning with an address to the Jews.

   NOW we are coming out of the thick darkness of heathenism: the Jewish
   religion, which is a part and the beginning of truth, appears to us,
   much like twilight to a person gradually advancing out of a very dark
   cave: wherefore I desire the Jews, that they would not look upon us as
   adversaries. We know very well, that they are the offspring of holy
   men, whom God often visited by his prophets and his angels; [537] that
   the Messiah was born of their nation, as were the first teachers of
   Christianity: they were the stock into which we were grafted: to them
   were committed the oracles of God, which we respect as much as they;
   and with Paul put up our hearty prayers to God for them, beseeching him
   that that day may very speedily Dome when the veil which now hangs over
   their faces, [538] being taken off, they, together with us, may clearly
   perceive the fulfilling of the law; [539] and when, according to the
   ancient prophecies, many of us, who are strangers, shall lay hold of
   the skirt of a Jew, praying him, that with equal piety we may worship
   that one God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. [540]

  SECT. II. That the Jews ought to look upon the miracles of Christ as
  sufficiently attested.

   FIRST, therefore, they are requested not to esteem that unjust in
   another's cause, which they think just in their own: if any heathen
   should ask them, why they believe the miracles done by Moses, they can
   give no other answer, but that the tradition concerning this matter has
   been so continual and constant amongst them, that it could not proceed
   from any thing else but the testimony of those who saw them. Thus, that
   the widow's oil was increased by Elisha, [541] and the Syrian
   immediately healed of his leprosy, [542] and the son of her who
   entertained him raised to life again, [543] with many others, are
   believed by the Jews, for no other reason but because they were
   delivered to posterity by credible witnesses; and, concerning Elijah's
   being taken up into heaven, [544] they give credit to the single
   testimony of Elisha, as a man beyond all exception. But we bring twelve
   witnesses, [545] whose lives were unblameable, of Christ's ascending
   into heaven; [546] and many more, of Christ's being seen upon earth
   after his death; which, if they be true, the Christian doctrine must of
   necessity be true also; and it is plain that the Jews can say nothing
   for themselves, but what will hold as strong or stronger for us. But,
   to pass by testimonies, the writers of the Talmud, and the Jews
   themselves, own the miraculous things done by Christ, which ought to
   satisfy them: [547] For God cannot more effectually recommend the
   authority of any doctrine delivered by man, than by working miracles.

  SECT. III. An answer to the objection, that those miracles were done by the
  help of devils.

   BUT some say, that these wonders were done by the help of devils: but
   this calumny has been already confuted from hence; that as soon as the
   doctrine of Christ was made known, all the power of the devils was
   broken. What is added by some, that Jesus learned magical arts in
   Egypt, carries a much less appearance of truth, than the like objection
   of the heathen against Moses, which we find in Pliny, [548] and
   Apuleius. [549] For it does not appear, but from the books of his
   disciples, that Jesus ever was in Egypt; and they add, that he returned
   from thence a child. But it is certain that Moses spent a great part of
   his time, when he was grown up, in Egypt, both from his own account,
   [550] and the relation of others. [551] But the law of each of them
   strongly clears both Moses and Jesus from this crime, because they
   expressly forbid such arts as odious in the sight of God. [552] And if,
   in the times of Christ and his disciples, there had been any such
   magical art any where, either in Egypt, or other places, whereby those
   things related of Christ could be done; such as dumb men's being
   suddenly healed, the lame walking, and sight given to the blind; the
   emperors Tiberius, [553] Nero, [554] and others, who would not have
   spared any cost in inquiring after such things, would undoubtedly have
   found it out. And if it be true, what the Jews report, [555] that the
   counsellors of the great council were skilled in magical arts, in order
   to convict the guilty; certainly they who were so great enemies to
   Jesus, and so much envied his reputation, which continually increased
   by his miracles, would have done the like works by some art; or have
   made it plain by undeniable arguments, that his works could proceed
   from nothing else.

  SECT. IV. Or by the power of word.

   Some of the Jews ascribe the miracles of Jesus to a certain secret
   name, which was put into the temple by Solomon, and kept by two lions
   for above a thousand years, but was conveyed thence by Jesus; which is
   not only false, but an impudent fiction. For, as to the lions, which is
   so remarkable and wonderful a thing, neither the books of the Kings,
   nor the Chronicles, nor Josephus, mention any thing of them: nor did
   the Romans, who before the times of Jesus entered the temple with
   Pompey, find any such thing.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. V. That the miracles of Jesus were divine, proved from hence, because he
  taught the worship of one God, the Maker of the world.

   Now, if it be granted that miracles were done by Christ, which the Jews
   acknowledge; we affirm, that it follows from the law of Moses itself,
   that we ought to give credit to him: for God has said in the xviiith
   chapter of Deuteronomy, that he would raise up other prophets besides
   Moses, which the people were to hearken to; and threatens heavy
   punishments if they did not. Now the most certain token of a prophet is
   miracles; [556] nor can any thing be conceived more flagrant. Yet it is
   said, Deut. xiii. that if any one declares himself to be a prophet, by
   working wonders, he is not to be hearkened to, if he entices the people
   to the worship of new gods: for God permits such wonders lo be done,
   only to try whether his people be firmly established in the worship of
   the true God. From which places, compared together, the Hebrew
   interpreters rightly collected [557] that every one who worked miracles
   was to be believed, [558] if he did not draw them off from the worship
   of the true God, for in that instance only it is declared, that no
   credit is to be given to miracles, though never so remarkable ones. Now
   Jesus did not only not teach the worship of false gods, but on the
   contrary did expressly forbid it as a grievous sin: [559] and taught us
   to reverence the writings of Moses, and those prophets which followed
   him: so that nothing can be objected against his miracles; for what
   some object, that the law of Jesus in some things differs from that of
   Moses, is not sufficient.

  SECT. VI. An answer to the objection, drawn from the difference betwixt the
  law of Moses and the law of Christ; where it is shewn, that there might be
  given a more perfect law than that of Moses.

   FOR the Hebrew doctors Themselves lay down this rule for the extent of
   a prophet's power, [560] that is, of one that works miracles: that he
   may securely violate any sort of precept, except that of the worship of
   one God, and, indeed, the power of making laws, which is in God, did
   not cease upon his giving precepts by Moses; nor is any one, who has
   any authority to give laws, thereby hindered from giving others
   contrary to them. The objection of God's immutability is nothing to the
   purpose, for we do not speak of the nature and essence of God, but of
   his actions. Light is turned into darkness, youth into age, summer into
   winter 1 which are all the acts of God. Formerly God allowed to Adam
   all other fruit, except that of one tree, which he forbade him, [561]
   viz. because it was his pleasure. He forbade killing men in general,
   yet he commanded Abraham to slay his son. [562] He forbade some, and
   accepted other sacrifices, distant from the tabernacle. [563] Neither
   will it follow, that because the law given by Moses was good, therefore
   a better could not be given. Parents are wont to lisp with their
   children, to wink at the faults of their age, to tempt them to learn
   with a cake; but as they grow up, their speech is corrected, the
   precepts of virtue instilled into them, and they are shewn the beauty
   of virtue, and what are its rewards. Now, that the precepts of the law
   were not absolutely perfect, [564] appears from hence; that some holy
   men in those times led a life more perfect than those precepts
   required. Moses, who allowed revenging an injury, partly by force and
   partly by demanding judgment; when himself was afflicted with the worst
   of injuries, prayed for his enemies. [565] Thus David was willing to
   have his rebellious son spared, [566] and patiently bore the curses
   thrown upon him. [567] Good men are no where found to have divorced
   their wives, though the law allowed them to do it. So that laws are
   only accommodated to the greater part of the people; [568] and in that
   state it was reasonable some things should be overlooked, which were
   then to be reduced to a more perfect rule, when God, by a greater power
   of his spirit, was to gather to himself a new people out of all
   nations. And the rewards which were expressly promised by the law of
   Moses, do all regard this mortal life only; whence it must be
   confessed, that a law better than this might be given, which should
   propose everlasting rewards, not under types and shadows, but plainly
   and openly, as we see the law of Christ does. [569]

   measure good and evil by external things, which concern the body if, I

     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VII. The law of Moses was observed by Jesus when on earth; neither was
  any part of it abolished afterwards, but only those precepts which had no
  intrinsic goodness in them.

   We may here observe by the way, to shew the wicked. ness of those Jews
   who lived in our Saviour's time, that Jesus was very basely treated by
   them, and delivered up to punishment, when they could not prove that he
   had done any thing contrary to the law. He was circumcised, [570] made
   use of the Jewish meats, [571] was clothed like them; [572] those who
   were cleansed from their leprosy he sent to the priests; [573] he
   religiously observed the Passover, and other festival days. [574] If he
   healed any on the Sabbath day, be made it appear, not only from the
   law, [575] but from their received opinions, that such works were not
   forbidden on the Sabbath [576] He then first began to discover the
   abrogating some laws, [577] when be had overcome death, was ascended
   into heaven, had endued his disciples with remarkable gifts of the Holy
   Spirit, and had shewn by those things, that he had obtained a kingly
   power, [578] in which is included an authority to make laws, [579]
   according to that prophecy of Daniel, chap. iii. and vii. the viii. and
   xith being compared together; who foretold that after the overthrow of
   the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt, (the latter of which came to pass
   under Augustus), God would give to a man, who should appear to be an
   ordinary person, [580] a kingdom, extending to the people of all
   nations and languages, and which should never have an end. Now that
   part of the law, the necessity of which was taken away by Christ, did
   not contain in it any thing in its own nature virtuous; but consisted
   of things indifferent in themselves, and therefore not unalterable: for
   if there had been any thing in the nature of those things to enforce
   their practice, God would have prescribed them to all the world, and
   not to one people only; [581] and that from the very beginning, and two
   thousand years, and more, after mankind had been created. Abel, Enoch,
   Noah, Melehisedech, Job, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the eminently
   pious men, who were so beloved of God, were ignorant of all, or almost
   all, this part of the law: and nevertheless they received testimony of
   their faith towards God, and of his divine love towards them. Neither
   did Moses advise his father-in-law Jethro to perform these rites, nor
   Jonas the Ninevites, nor did the other prophets reprove the Chaldæans,
   Egyptians, Sidonians, Tyrians, Idumæans, and Moabites, to whom they
   wrote, for not embracing them, though they particularly enumerate their
   crimes. These precepts, therefore, were particular, and introduced
   either to hinder some evil, to which the Jews were especially inclined,
   or for a trial of their obedience, or to signify some future things.
   [582] Wherefore, there is no more reason to wonder at their being
   abolished, than at a king's abrogating some municipal laws, in order to
   establish the same ordinances all over a nation: neither can there be
   any thing alleged to prove that God had obliged himself to make no
   alteration herein. For if it be said, that these precepts are styled
   perpetual; men very often make use of this word, [583] when they would
   signify only, that what they command in this manner, is not limited for
   a year's continuance, or to a certain time: [584] suppose of war or
   peace, accommodated to the scarceness of provision; now this does not
   hinder but that they may appoint new laws concerning these matters,
   whenever the public good requires it. Thus the precepts which God gave
   to the Hebrews, were some of them temporary, only during the
   continuance of that people in the wilderness; [585] others confined to
   their dwelling in the laud of Canaan. [586] That these might. be
   distinguished from the other, they are called perpetual; by which may
   be meant, that they ought not to be neglected any where, nor at any
   time, unless God should signify his will to the contrary. Which manner
   of speaking, as it is common to all people, the Hebrews ought the less
   to wonder at, because they know that, in their law, that is called a
   perpetual right, and a perpetual servitude, which continued only from
   jubilee to jubilee. [587] And the coming of the Messiah is by
   themselves called the fulfilling of the jubilee, or the great jubilee.
   [588] And, moreover, the promise of entering into a new covenant is to
   be found amongst the old prophets, as Jeremiah xxxi. [589] where God
   promises that he will make a new covenant, which shall be writ upon
   their hearts, and men will have no need to learn religion of each
   other, for it shall be evident to them all: and moreover, that he would
   pardon all their past transgressions: which is much the same, as if a
   prince, after his subjects had been at great enmity with each other, in
   order to establish a peace, should take away their different laws, and
   impose upon them all one common law, and that a perfect one; and for
   the future, promise them pardon for all their past transgressions, upon
   their amendment. Though what has been said might suffice, yet we will
   go through every part of the law that is abolished; and shew that the
   things are not such as are in their own nature well-pleasing to God, or
   such as ought to continue always.

  SECT VIII. As sacrifices, which were never acceptable to God upon their own
  account.

   THE principal, and which first offer themselves to us, are sacrifices;
   concerning which many Hebrews are of opinion that they first proceeded
   from the invention of men, before they were commanded by God. [590]
   Thus much certainly is evident, that the Hebrews were desirous of very
   many Liles; which was a sufficient reason why God should enjoin them
   such a number, upon this account, lest the memory of their dwelling in
   Egypt should cause them to return to the worship of false gods. [591]
   But when their posterity set a greater value upon them than they ought,
   as if they were acceptable to God upon their own account, and a part of
   true piety, they are reproved by the prophets: As to sacrifices, [592]
   says God in David's fiftieth Psalm, according to the Hebrew, I will not
   speak to you at all concerning them, viz, that you shall slay
   burnt-offerings, upon burnt-offerings, or that I will accept young
   bullocks or goats out of thy fold; for all the living creatures which
   feed in the forests, and wander upon the mountains, are mine; I number
   both the birds, and the wild beasts; so that if I be hungry, I need not
   come to declare it to you; for the whole universe, and every thing in
   it, is mine. Do you think I will eat the fat of flesh, and drink the
   blood of goats? No; sacrifice thanksgiving, and offer thy vows unto
   God. There are some amongst the Hebrews, who affirm, that this was
   said, because they who offered these sacrifices were unholy in their
   hearts and lives. But the words themselves, which we have quoted, tell
   us the contrary, viz, that the thing was not at all acceptable to God
   in itself. And if we consider the whole tenour of the Psalm, we shall
   find that God addresses himself to holy men; for he had before said,
   Gather my saints together; and afterwards, Hear, O my people. These are
   the words of a teacher. Then having finished the words before cited,
   he, turns his discourse as is usual to the wicked: But to the wicked,
   said God: and in other places, we find the same sense; as Psalm li. To
   offer sacrifices is not acceptable to thee, neither art thou delighted
   with burnt-offerings: but the sacrifice which thou truly delightest in
   is a mind humbled by the sense of its faults; for thou, O God, wilt not
   despise a broken and contrite heart. The like of which is that of Psalm
   xl. Sacrifices and oblations thou dost not delight in, but thou
   securest one to thyself, as if I were bored through the ear; [593] thou
   dost not require burnt-sacrifices, or trespass-offerings; therefore
   have I answered, Lo, I come; and I am as ready to do thy will, as any
   covenant can make me; for it is my delight. For thy law is fired in my
   whole heart; the praises of thy mercy I do not keep close in my
   thoughts, but I declare thy truth and loving kindness every where; but
   thy compassion and faithfulness do I particularly celebrate in the
   great congregation. In chap. i. of Isaiah, God is introduced speaking
   in this manner: What are so many sacrifices to me? I am filled with the
   burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of feel beasts; I do not love the
   blood of young bullocks, of lambs, or of goats, that you should appear
   with it before me: for who hath required this of you, that you should
   thus pollute my courts? And Jeremiah vii. which is a like place, and
   may serve to explain this. Thus saith the Lord of angels, the God of
   Israel; Ye heap up your burnt-offerings with your sacrifices, and
   yourselves eat the flesh of them. For at the time when I first brought
   your fathers up out of Egypt, I neither required nor commanded them any
   thing about sacrifices, or burnt-offerings, But that which I earnestly
   commanded them was, that they should be obedient to me; so would I be
   their God, and they should be my people; and that they should walk in
   the way that I should teach them, so should all things succeed
   prosperously to them. And these are the words of God in Hosea, ch. vi.
   Loving-kindness towards men is snuck more acceptable to me than
   sacrifice; [594] to think aright of God is above all burnt-offerings.
   And in Micah, when the question was put, how any man should render
   himself most acceptable to God; by a vast number of rams, by a huge
   quantity of oil, or by calves of a year old? God answers, I will tell
   you what is truly, good and acceptable to me; viz. that you render to
   every man his due, that you do good to others, and that you become
   humble and lowly before God. [595] Since, therefore, it appears from
   these places, that sacrifices are not reckoned amongst those things
   which are primarily and of themselves acceptable to God; but the
   people, gradually, as is usual, falling into wicked superstition,
   placed the principal part of their piety in them, and believed that
   their sacrifices made a sufficient compensation for their sins: it is
   not to be wondered at, if God in time abolished a thing in its own
   nature indifferent, but by use converted into evil; especially when
   king Hezekiah broke the brazen serpent erected by Moses, [596] because
   the people began to worship it with religious worship. Nor are there
   wanting prophecies, which foretold that those sacrifices about which
   the controversy now is, should cease: which any one will easily
   understand, who will but consider, that according to the law of Moses,
   the sacrificing was committed entirely to the posterity of Aaron, and
   that only in their own country. Now in Psalm cx. according to the
   Hebrew, a king is promised, whose kingdom should be exceeding large,
   who should begin his reign in Sion, and who should be a king and a
   priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedeck. And Isaiah, chap.
   xix. saith, that an altar should be seen in Egypt, where not only the
   Egyptians, but the Assyrians, and also Israelites should worship God;
   and, chap. lxvi. he saith, that the most distant nations, and people of
   all languages, as well as the Israelites, should offer gifts unto God,
   and out of them should be appointed priests and Levites; all which
   could not be, whilst the law of Moses continued. [597] To these we may
   add that place in Malachi, chap. i. [598] where God, foretelling future
   events, says, that the offerings of the Hebrews would be an abomination
   to him; that from the east to the west his name should be celebrated
   among all nations; and that incence and the purest things should be
   offered him. And Daniel, in chap. ix. relating the prophecy of the
   angel Gabriel concerning Christ, says, that he shall abolish sacrifices
   and offerings: and God has sufficiently signified, not only by words,
   but by the things themselves, that the sacrifices prescribed by Moses
   are no longer approved by him; since he has suffered the Jews to be
   above sixteen hundred years without a temple, or altar, or any
   distinction of families, whence they might know who those are who ought
   to perform the sacred rites.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [590] Chrysostom xii. concerning statues, speaking of Abel, says, "That
   he offered sacrifices which he did not learn from any other person, nor
   did be ever receive any law that established any thing about first
   fruits; but he had it from himself, and was moved to it by his own
   conscience only." In the answer to the orthodox, in the words of
   Justin, to the eighty-third query; "none of those who sacrificed beasts
   to God before the law, sacrificed them at the Divine command; though it
   is evident that God accepted them, and by such acceptance discovered
   that the sacrifices were well-pleasing to him."--(This matter is
   largely handled by dr. Spencer, concerning the Ritual Law of the Jews,
   book iii. discourse 2. to which I refer you. Le Clerc).

   [591] This very reason for the law of sacrifices is alleged by
   Maimonides, in his Guide to the Doubting, book iii. chap. 32.
   Tertullian against Marcion, book ii. "Would you have nobody find fault
   with the labour and burthen of sacrifices, and the busy scrupulousness
   of oblations, as if God truly desired such things, when Ile so plainly
   exclaims against them? To what purpose is the multitude of your
   sacrifices? And who hath required them at your hands But let such
   observe the care God has taken, to oblige a people, prone to idolatry
   and sin, to be religious, by such duties as that superstitious age was
   most conversant in, that he might call them off from superstition, by
   commanding those things to be done upon his account, as if be desired
   it, lest they should fall to making images."

   [592] This is Grotius's paraphrase upon Psalm i. not a literal
   translation; and so are the following. Le Clerc.

   [593] A mark of servitude amongst the Hebrews.

   [594] So the Chaldee interpreter explains this place.

   [595] Therefore the Jews say, that the six hundred and two precepts of
   the law are by Isaiah contracted into six, chap. xxxiii. 15. by Micah
   into three in this place; by Isaiah into two, chap. lvi. 1. by Habakkuk
   into one, chap. ii. 4. as also by Amos, v. 6.

   [596] 2 Kings xviii. 4.

   [597] Add this place of Jeremiah, chap. iii. 16. "In those days, saith
   the Lord, they shall say no more, the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
   neither shall it some into their minds, neither shall they remember it,
   neither shall they visit it, neither shall that be done any
   more."--(Even the Jews themselves could no longer observe their law,
   after they were so much scattered. For it is impossible that all the
   males should go up thrice in a year to Jerusalem, according to the law,
   Exodus xxiii. 17. from all those countries which were inhabited by
   them. This law could be given to no other than a people not very great,
   nor much distant from the tabernacle. Le Clerc.).

   [598] See Chrysostom's excellent paraphrase upon this place, in his
   second discourse against the gentiles.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. IX. And the difference of meats.

   WHAT has been said concerning the law of sacrifices, the same may be
   affirmed of that in which different kinds of meat are prohibited. It is
   manifest, that after the universal deluge, God gave to Noah and his
   posterity a right to use any sort of food; [599] which right descended
   not only to Japhet and Ham, but also to Shem and his posterity,
   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But afterwards, when the people in Egypt
   were tinctured with the vile superstition of that nation; then it was
   that God first prohibited the eating some sort of living creatures;
   either because for the most part such were offered by the Egyptians to
   their gods, [600] and they made divination by them; or because in that
   typical law, the particular voices of men were represented by certain
   kinds of living creatures. [601] That these precepts were not
   universal, appears from the instance of what is appointed concerning
   the flesh of a beast that died of itself, Deut. xiv. that it was not
   lawful for the Israelites to eat it, but it was lawful for strangers,
   which strangers the Jews were commanded to perform all good offices to,
   as esteemed of God. [602] And the ancient Hebrew teachers openly
   declare, that in the times of the Messiah, the law of the prohibition
   of meats should cease, and that swine's flesh should be as clean as
   that of an ox. [603] And certainly since God designed to gather a
   people to himself out of all nations, it was more reasonable that he
   should make liberty, and not bondage, in such things common to all. Now
   follows an examination of festival days.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [599] The mention of clean and unclean creatures seems to be an
   objection against this, in the history of the deluge; but either that
   was said by way of prolepsis to those who knew the law; or, by unclean,
   ought to be understood, those which men naturally avoid for food, such
   as Tacitus calls profane, Hist. iv. Unless any one had rather
   understand by clean, those which are nourished by herbs; and by
   unclean, those which feed on other living creatures.

   [600] Origen, in his fourth book against Celsus: "Some wicked dæmons,
   and (as I may call them) Titanic or gigantic ones, who were rebellious
   against the true God, and the heavenly angels, and fell from heaven,
   and are continually moving about gross and unclean bodies here on
   earth, having some fore-sight of things to come, by reason of their
   freedom from earthly bodies; and being conversant in such things, and
   being desirous to draw off mankind from the true God, they enter into
   living creatures, especially those that are ravenous, wild, and
   sagacious, and move them to what they will: or else, they stir up the
   fancies of such living creatures to fly or move in such a manner; that
   men, taken by the divination in these dumb creatures, might not seek
   the God that comprehends the universe, nor enquire after the pure
   worship of God; but suffer their reason to degenerate into earthly
   things; such as birds and dragons, foxes and wolves. For it is observed
   by those who are skilful in these things, that future predictions are
   made by such living creatures as these; the daemons having no power to
   effect that in tame creatures, which, by reason of their likeness in
   wickedness, not real, but seeming wickedness in such creatures, they
   are able to effect in other creatures. Whence, if any thing he
   wonderful in Moses, this particularly deserves our admiration, that,
   discerning the different natures of living creatures, and whether
   instructed by God concerning them, and the dæmons appropriated to every
   one of them; or whether he understood by his own wisdom, the several
   ranks and sorts of them; he pronounced them unclean, which were
   esteemed by the Egyptians and other nations to cause divination, and he
   declared the other to be clean." The like to which we find in
   Theodoret, book vii. against the Greeks: and not very different from
   this is that of Manetho, "having established in the law many other
   things, particularly such as were contrary to the customs of the
   Egyptians." And that which Tacitus says of the Jews: "All things are
   profane amongst them which are sacred amongst us." And afterwards:
   "They slay a ram in contempt of Jupiter Ammon; and sacrifice an ox,
   which the Egyptians worshipped the god Apis by."

   [601] Barnabas in his epistle: "Moses said, Ye shall not eat a swine,
   nor an eagle, nor a hawk, nor a raven, nor any fish which hath no fins.
   By which he meant three opinions figuratively expressed. What he aims
   at is evident from these words in Deuteronomy: And my judgments shall
   be established amongst my people. Now the commandment of God is not
   literally to prohibit eating them; but Moses spake of them in a
   spiritual sense. He mentions swine for this end, that they should not
   converse with men who resemble swine; for when they live in luxury,
   they forget their master; but when they want, they own their master:
   thus a swine, while he is eating, will not know his master; when he is
   hungry, he cries out, and when he is full, he is quiet. Again, Thou
   shalt not, says he, eat the eagle, or the hawk, or the kite, or the
   raven. As much as to say, you shall not converse with such men, who
   know not how to get their food by labour and pains, but unjustly steal
   it from others; and who walk about as if they were sincere, when they
   lie in wait for others; Thus these slothful creatures contrive how they
   may devour the flesh of others, being pestilent by their wickedness.
   Again, Thou shalt not eat, says be, the lamprey, nor the pourcontrel,
   nor the cuttle; that is to say, you shall not converse with those men
   who are finally wicked, and condemned to death; as these sort of fish
   alene are doomed to swim at the bottom of the sea, not like others to
   hover on the top of the water, but to dwell on the ground at the
   bottom. Also, he says, thou shalt not eat the coney: wherefore? that
   you may not be a corrupter of children, nor such like; for the hare has
   a new place to lay her excrements in every year; for so many years as
   she lives, so many holes bas she under ground. Further, thou shalt not
   eat the hyæna; that is, thou shalt not be au adulterer, or unclean
   person, or such like: for what reason? because this creature changes
   its nature every year, and sometimes is a male, and sometimes a female.
   And he justly hated the weasel; as much as to say, you shall not be
   like such persons, who, we have heard, have committed iniquity in their
   mouths, by uncleanness; neither shall you have correspondence with such
   workers of iniquity; for this animal conceives in its mouth. Concerning
   meats, therefore, Moses meant three things spiritually; but they,
   through fleshly inclinations, understood him of meats. But David knew
   these three opinions, and therefore agreeably thereto he says, Blessed
   is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, as fishes
   wander in darkness at the bottom of the sea; and hath not stood in the
   way of sinners, viz. like them, who, though they would seem to fear
   God, sin like swine: and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful, like
   birds watching for their prey. Thus you have the end and the meaning of
   them. But Moses commanded to eat every creature that is cloven-footod,
   and that chew. etb the cud. And what does he mean by this? He that
   receiveth meat, knoweth him that feeds him, and is satisfied with it,
   and seems to rejoice: which is very well said, if we consider the
   command. What, therefore, is the meaning of it? Why, converse with
   those who fear their master; with those who meditate in their hearts
   upon the word they have received; with those who speak of and keep the
   judgments of their master; with those who know that meditation is a
   pleasant work, and belongs to those who thoroughly consider their
   master's word. But what means cloven-footed? That a man should walk
   uprightly in this world, in expectation of another life. See what
   excellent laws are established by Moses." Clemens commends this of
   Barnabas, in his fifth Strome. You may find also many things partly
   alike, and partly the same with these, in Philo's book of agriculture;
   and in the book entitled, "The wicked lay snares for the righteous;"
   which are too long to be transcribed. The like is to be seen in
   Eusebius, out of Aristæus, book viii. chap. 9.

   [602] Holy men, but not circumcised, which you find mentioned, Levit.
   xxii. 25. and xxv. 40, 47. and in the Talmud, chap. of the king, and of
   the council; and in Maimonides's book of idolatry.

   [603] Thus R. Samuel in Mecor Chaim. The Talmud, entitled Nida, says,
   the law was to continue but till the times of the Messiah. We may
   moreover observe, that some Hebrew teachers, amongst whom is Bachai,
   were of opinion that the laws concerning forbidden meats, were peculiar
   to the land of Canaan, nor was any one obliged to observe them out of
   the bounds thereof. And beside, the Jews themselves are ignorant, or at
   least dispute about the signification of many of the names of those
   animals; which we cannot think God would have permitted, if the
   obligations to observe that law were to have continued till this time.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. X. And of days.

   THESE were all instituted in memory of the benefit they had received
   from God, when they were delivered front the Egyptian bondage, and
   brought into the promised land. Now the prophet Jeremiah says, chap.
   xvi. and xxiii. that the time would come when new and much greater
   benefits should so eclipse the memory of that benefit, that there would
   scarce be any mention made of it. And, moreover, what we now said of
   sacrifices, is as true of festivals; the people began to put their
   trust in them so far, that if they rightly observed them, it was no
   great matter how they offended in other respects. Wherefore, in Isaiah,
   chap. i. God says, that he hated their new moons and feast-days, they
   were such a burden to him, that he was not able to bear them.
   Concerning the Sabbath, it uses particularly to be objected, that it is
   an universal and perpetual precept, not given to one people only, but,
   in the beginning of the world, to Adam the father of them all. To which
   I answer, agreeably to the opinions of the most learned Hebrews, that
   this precept concerning the Sabbath is two-fold; a precept of
   remembrance, Exodus xx. 8. [604] and a precept of observation, Exodus
   xxxi. 31. [605] The precept of remembrance is fulfilled in a religious
   memory of the creation of the world; the precept of observation
   consists in an exact abstinence from all manner of labour. The first
   precept was given from the beginning, and without doubt the pious men
   before the law obeyed it, [606] as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob;
   the latter of whom, though we have a relation of many of their travels,
   yet there is no sign of their stopping their journey on account of the
   Sabbath; [607] which thing we frequently meet with, after their coming
   out of Egypt. For after the people were brought out of Egypt, and had
   safely passed through the Red Sea, they kept the first day a Sabbath of
   rest, and sung a hymn to God upon that account; and from this time that
   exact rest of the Sabbath was commanded, the first mention of which is
   in the gathering of manna, Exodus xxxv. 2. Levit. xxiii. 3. And in this
   sense, the reason alleged, Deut. v. 15. for the law of the Sabbath is
   the deliverance out of Egypt. And further, this law had regard to
   servants against the severity of those masters, who allowed them no
   respite from their labours, as you find it in the fore-cited places. It
   is true, indeed, that strangers were obliged by this law, and that for
   this reason, that there might be an universal rest of all the people.
   [608] But that this law of perfect rest was not given to other people,
   appears from hence, that in many places it is called a sign, and a
   particular covenant between God and the Israelites, Exod. xxxi. 13, 16.
   And, further, Mat those things which were instituted in memory of the
   coming out of Egypt are not such as ought never to cease, we have
   before shewn, from the promise of much greater benefits. To which may
   be added, that if the law concerning rest on the Sabbath had been given
   from the beginning, and in such a manner as never to be abolished;
   certainly that law would have prevailed over all other laws, the
   contrary to which we now find. For it is evident, that children were
   rightly circumcised on the Sabbath-day: [609] and while the temple
   stood, the sacrifices were slain on the Sabbath-day, as well as on
   other days. [610] The Hebrew teachers themselves shew, that this law is
   changeable, when they say that work may justly be done on the Sabbath
   at the command of a prophet, which they prove by the example of the
   taking of Jericho on the Sabbath-day by the command of Joshua. And
   that, in the time of the Messiah, the difference of days should be
   taken away, some of them shew very well, from that place of Isaiah
   lxvi. 23. where it is foretold, that there should be a continual
   worship of God from Sabbath to Sabbath, from new moon to new moon.

  SECT. XI. And circumcision of the flesh.

   WE come now to circumcision, which is, indeed, ancienter than Moses, as
   being commanded to Abraham and his posterity; but this very precept was
   the beginning of the covenant declared by Moses. Thus we find God said
   to Abraham, Genesis xvii. I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after
   thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, even the land of Canaan,
   for an everlasting possession; therefore keep my covenant, thou and thy
   seed for ever. This is the covenant betwixt me and thee and thy seed;
   Every male shall be circumcised. But we have before seen, that there
   was to succeed anew covenant in the room of this covenant, such as
   should be common to all people; for which reason the necessity of a
   mark of distinction must cease. And this is further evident, that there
   was some mystical and higher signification contained under this precept
   of circumcision; as appears from the prophets, when they command the
   heart to be circumcised, to which all the precepts of Christ tend.
   [611] So likewise the promises added to circumcision, must of necessity
   relate to something further; namely, that of an earthly possession, to
   the revelation of an everlasting possession; [612] which was never made
   more manifest than by Jesus; and that of making Abraham a father of
   many nations; [613] till that time when not only some few people, but
   innumerable of them, spread all over the world, should imitate that
   memorable faith of Abraham towards God; which never yet came to pass,
   but by the gospel. Now it is no wonder, that when the work is finished,
   the shadow of the work that was designed should be taken away. And that
   God's mercy was not confined to this sign, is from hence manifest;
   [614] that not only those who lived before Abraham, but even Abraham
   himself was acceptable to God before he was circumcised; and
   circumcision was omitted by the Hebrews all the while they journeyed
   through the deserts of Arabia, without being reproved of God for it.

   their hearty thanks to Jesus and his ambassadors, in that he freed them
   from that heavy burden of rites, and secured their liberty to them, by
   miracles and gifts no way inferior to those of Moses. [616] But yet
   they who first delivered this doctrine, did not require this of them,
   that they should acknowledge such their happiness; but if they would
   perform the precepts of Jesus, which were full of all virtue, they
   easily allowed them, in indifferent things, to follow what course of
   life they would, [617] provided they did not impose the observation of
   it, as necessary, upon strangers, to whom the ritual law was never
   given; [618] which one thing sufficiently shews, that the Jews very
   unjustly reject the doctrine of Jesus, under pretence of the ritual
   law. Having answered this objection, which is almost the only one
   commonly opposed to the miracles of Jesus, we come now to other
   arguments suited to convince the Jews.

  SECT. XIII. A proof against the Jews, taken from their own confession of the
  extraordinary promise of the Messiah.

   BOTH they and we are agreed, that in the predictions of the prophets
   there is a promise, that amongst the many persons who should make known
   to the Jews, from heaven, very great advantages, there should be one,
   far exceeding the rest, whom they called the Messiah; which, though a
   common name, did more eminently agree to this person only. We assert,
   that he came long since: they expect that he is yet to come. It
   remains, therefore, that we put an end to the controversy, from those
   books, the authority of which is equally acknowledged by both.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XIV. That he is already come, appears from the time foretold.

   DANIEL, a testimony of whose great piety Ezekiel affords us, [619]
   could neither deceive us, nor be deceived himself by the angel Gabriel:
   and be, according to the direction of the angel, has left us upon
   record, chap. ix. that there should not pass above five hundred years
   between the publication of the edict for rebuilding the city of
   Jerusalem, and the coming of the Messiah. [620] But there are above two
   thousand years passed, since that time to this day, and he, whom the
   Jews expect, is not yet come; neither can they name any other to whom
   that time will agree. But it agrees so well to Jesus, that a Hebrew
   teacher, Nehemiah, [621] who lived five hundred years before him, said
   openly then, that the time of the Messiah, signified by Daniel, could
   not be deferred above five hundred years. There is another mark before
   hinted at, which agrees with this of the time; and that is, that a
   government over all nations should be appointed from heaven, [622]
   after the posterity of Seleucus and Lagus should cease to reign; [623]
   the latter of which ended in Cleopatra, not long before Jesus was born.
   A third token is in the fore-mentioned chap. ix. of Daniel; that after
   the coming of the Messiah, the city of Jerusalem should be razed; which
   prophecy of the destruction of that city, Josephus himself refers to
   his own age. [624] From whence it follows, that the time limited for
   the coming of the Messiah was then past. To this may be referred that
   of Haggai, chap. ii. where God comforts Zerubbabel, a heathen prince,
   and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high-priest, upon their sorrow
   because the temple built by them did not answer the greatness of the
   former temple, with this promise, that there should be greater honour
   done to that temple, than to the former: which could be said neither of
   the bigness of the work, nor of the materials, nor of the workmanship,
   nor of the ornaments, as is very plain from the history of those times
   in the sacred writings, and in Josephus, compared with that of the
   temple of Solomon: to which we may add, which is observed by the Hebrew
   teachers, that there was wanting two very great endowments in the
   latter temple, which were in the former, viz. a visible light, as a
   token of the divine Majesty, and a divine inspiration. [625] But
   wherein this latter temple was to exceed the former, God briefly
   declares, when he says, that he would establish his peace, [626] that
   is, his favour and goodwill, in that temple, as it were, by a firm
   covenant. This is further prosecuted by Malachi, chap. iii. Behold, I
   will send my messenger, who shall prepare my way; and the Lord whom ye
   seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, [627] (now Malachi lived after
   the latter temple was built), even the messenger of the covenant whom
   ye delight in. Therefore the Messiah ought to come while the second
   temple stood; in which account is reckoned by the Hebrews all the time
   from Zerubbabel to Vespasian; [628] for the temple in the time of Herod
   the great was not rebuilt from the foundation, but only gradually
   renewed by parts; [629] notwithstanding which alteration, it might be
   called the same temple. And, indeed, there was so firm an expectation
   of the Messiah at that time amongst the Hebrews, and their neighbours,
   that Herod was thought by some to be the Messiah, [630] Judas Gaulonita
   by others, [631] and some more by others, who lived about the time of
   our Saviour. [632]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [619] xiv. 14. xxviii. 3. Josephus concerning Daniel, at the end of the
   tenth book, says, "That the spirit of God was with him." And
   afterwards, "That he was endued with every thing in an incredible
   manner, as being one of the greatest of the prophets. In his life-time
   he was had in great honour and esteem, both by the kings and the
   people; and after his death he was had in everlasting remembrance; the
   books wrote by him, and left to us, we read at this day, and their
   testimony convinces us that he had a communication with God."

   [620] The great Hebrew doctors, such as Salomon Jarchi, rabbi Josue,
   quoted by Abenesdras and Saadias, agree, that the Son of Mau in Daniel
   is the Messiah: thus rabbi Josue, who saw the raising of the temple,
   said that the time of the Messiah was then past, as R. Jacob in
   Caphthor testifies.

   [621] Grotius ought to have told us whence he had this. If I remember
   right, in some epistle of his to his brother William Grotius, he says,
   he received it from a Jew. Le Clerc.

   [622] R. Levi Ben Gerson tells us, that that stone, by the blow whereof
   that image which represented the empires should be broken to pieces,
   was the Messiah. Rabbi Solomon, r. Abenesdras, and r. Saadia, say, that
   that kingdom, which would consume the rest of the kingdoms, was the
   kingdom of the Messiah. R. Levi Ben Gerson and Saadia affirm the Son of
   Man in Daniel to be the Messiah.

   [623] See the annotations upon this in the first book.

   [624] Book x. chap. 12. "Daniel wrote concerning this time, and
   concerning the Roman empire, and that (our nation) should be destroyed
   by it. God having discovered all these things to him, he left them us
   in writing; so that whoever reads them, and considers what has come to
   pass, cannot but admire the honour God did to Daniel." Iacchiades also
   upon Dan. ix. 24. tells us, that the seventy weeks of years were
   finished in the destruction of Jerusalem.

   [625] In the title concerning instruction, and the Jerusalem Gemara,
   chap. 3.

   [626] We must observe what goes before. "The desire of all nations
   shall come and I will fill this house with glory." Which wonderfully
   agrees with what we have taken out of Malachi: so that these two
   prophets may serve for interpreters of each other. Rabbi Akiba, and
   many others, as rabbi Solomon testifies, were of opinion, that the
   Messiah ought to come in the second temple.

   [627] This place of Malachi, the Jews commonly explain of the Messiah.

   that entitled Juma, and that entitled Rosch Haschana.

   the Herodians, who said that Herod was the Christ." And Epiphanius says
   the same of them: agreeable to which, is that of the ancient scholiast
   on Persius; "Herod reigned amongst the Jews, in the time of Augustus,
   in the parts of Syria; therefore, the Herodians keep the birth-day of
   Herod, as they do the Sabbath, upon which day they put lighted candles
   crowned with violets on their windows."

  SECT. XV. (With an answer to what is alleged, that his coming was deferred
  upon the account of the sins of the people.)

   THE Jews see themselves put to difficulties by these arguments: that
   they may elude the force of them, therefore, some say, that their sins
   were the cause why he did not come at the promised time. Now, not to
   mention, that, in the fore-cited prophecies, [633] what is determined
   by them, has no signs of being suspended upon any conditions; how could
   his coming be deferred on the account of their sins, when this also was
   foretold, that for the many and great sins of the people, the city
   should be destroyed, a little after the time of the Messiah? [634]
   Further, the Messiah was to come for this very reason, that be might
   bring a remedy for the most corrupt age; [635] and, together with the
   rules of reforming their lives, assure them of pardon of their sins.
   Whence it is said in Zechariah, chap. xiii. concerning his time, that a
   fountain should then be opened to the house of David and to all in
   Jerusalem, to wash away their sins; and it is a common thing among the
   Jews, to call the Messiah, ISCH COPHER, that is, the Appeaser. [636] It
   is therefore very repugnant to reason to say, that that was deferred
   upon the account of the disease, which was directly appointed for that
   disease.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [633] This is expressly affirmed by r. Jochanan, in Schemoth Rabba, and
   r. David Kimchi, on Psalm cviii. 5. Josephus book x. towards the end,
   says well of Daniel: "That in his prophecies, he not only foretold what
   was to come, like the other prophets; but he determined the time in
   which those things should come to pass." That the decree of the
   Messiah's being sent at that time was not suspended upon any
   conditions, appears also from Mal. iii. 1. Besides, seeing that the
   Messiah was to be the author of the new covenant, as Malachi in that
   place and other prophets shew, his coming could not be suspended on the
   condition of observing that covenant he came to abolish.

     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XVI. Also from the present state of the Jews, compared with the promises
  of the law.

   AS to what we said, that the Messiah is long since come upon earth,
   even experience might convince the Jews. God promised them, in the
   covenant made with Moses, [637] a quiet possession of the land of
   Palestine, so long as they conformed their lives to the precepts of the
   law: and, on the contrary, if they sinned grievously against it, he
   threatened to drive them out; [638] and such like evils: yet,
   notwithstanding this, if at any time, when under the pressure of these
   calamities, and led by repentance of their sins, they returned to
   obedience, he would be merciful towards his people, and cause them to
   return into their own country, though dispersed into the furthest parts
   of the world; as you may see in many places, particularly Deut. xxx.
   and Nehemiah i. But now it is above fifteen hundred years since the
   Jews have been out of their own country, and without a temple: and if
   at any time they attempted to build a new one, they were always
   hindered. [639] Nay, Ammianus Marcellinus, [640] who was not a
   Christian writer, reports that balls of fire broke out of the
   foundation, and destroyed their work. When of old, the people had
   defiled themselves with the greatest wickedness, every where sacrificed
   their children to Saturn, looked upon adultery as nothing, spoiled the
   widows and the orphans, shed innocent blood in great plenty: all which
   the prophets reproach them with; [641] they were driven out of their
   country; but not longer than seventy years: [642] and in the mean time
   God did not neglect speaking to them by prophets, [643] and comforting
   them with hopes of their return, telling them the very time. [644] But
   now, ever since they have been driven out of their country, [645] they
   have continued vagabonds and despised, no prophet has come to them, no
   signs of their future return; their teachers, as if they were inspired
   with a spirit of giddiness, have sunk into low fables and ridiculous
   opinions, with which the books of the Talmud abound; which yet they
   presume to call the oral law, and to compare them, nay, to prefer them,
   above what is written by Moses. For what we there find of God's
   mourning, because be suffered the city to be destroyed, [646] of his
   daily diligence in reading the law, [647] of the behemoth and
   leviathan, [648] and many other things, is so absurd that it is
   troublesome to relate them. [649] And yet in this long space of time,
   the Jews have neither gone aside to the worship of false gods, nor
   defiled themselves with murder, nor are accused of adultery; but they
   endeavour to appease God by prayers and fasting, and yet they are not
   heard: [650] which being thus, we must of necessity conclude one of
   these two things, that either that covenant made by Moses is entirely
   dissolved, or that the whole body of the Jews are guilty of some
   grievous sin, which has continued for so many ages: and what that is,
   let them tell us themselves; or, if they cannot say what, let them
   believe us, that that sin is, their despising the Messiah, who came
   before these evils began to befall them.

  SECT. XVII. Jesus proved to be the Messiah, from those things that were
  predicted of the Messiah.

   AND these things do indeed prove, as was before said, that the Messiah
   did come so many ages since; to which I add, that he was no other than
   Jesus; for all others, who were willing to have themselves thought the
   Messiah, or were really thought so, left no sect in which that opinion
   continued. None now profess themselves to be followers of Herod, or
   Judas Gaulonita, or of Barchochebas, [651] who, in the times of Adrian,
   declared himself to be the Messiah, and deceived many learned men.
   [652] But there have been such as owned Jesus, ever since be was upon
   earth, to this very day, and they a great many, not in one country, but
   all the world over. [653] I might here allege many other things,
   formerly predicted, or believed of the Messiah, which we believe to
   have been completed in Jesus, and which were not so much as affirmed of
   any other; such as these, that he was of the seed of David; [654] that
   he was born of a virgin; [655] that this thing was discovered from
   heaven, [656] to him who had married that virgin, and would not keep
   her in marriage because she was big with child by another; that he was
   born in Bethlehem; [657] that he began to spread his doctrine first in
   Galilee; [658] that he healed all kinds of diseases; [659] made the
   blind to see, and the lame to walk: but I shall content myself with
   one, the effects of which remains to this day; and is manifest from the
   prophecies of David, [660] Isaiah, [661] Zechariah, [662] and Hosea,
   [663] viz. that the Messiah was to be the instructor of all nations;
   that the worship of false gods should be overthrown by him; [664] and
   that he should bring a vast multitude of strangers to the worship of
   one God. Before the coming of Jesus, almost the whole world was subject
   to false worship: which began to vanish afterwards by degrees, and not
   only particular persons, but whole nations and kings, were converted to
   the worship of one God. These things are not owing to the Jewish
   rabbles, but to the disciples of Jesus and their successors. Thus they
   were made the people of God who were not so before, [665] and that
   prediction of Jacob, Gen. xlix. was fulfilled, that before the civil
   power was taken from the posterity of Judah, Shiloh should come, whom
   the Chaldee and other interpreters explain to be the Messiah, [666]
   whom foreign nations also were to obey. [667]

  SECT. XVIII. An answer to what is alleged, that some things were not
  fulfilled.

   HERE the Jews commonly object, that there were some things predicted of
   the times of the Messiah, which we do not see fulfilled. But those
   which they allege are obscure, and may have a different signification;
   for which we ought not to reject those that are plain; such as the
   holiness of the precepts of Jesus; the excellency of the reward; the
   plainness of speech in which it was delivered; to which we may add the
   miracles; and all together ought to engage us to embrace his doctrine.
   In order to understand aright the prophecies of the sealed book, [668]
   as it is commonly called, there is many times need of some divine
   assistance, which is justly withheld from those who neglect those
   things that are plain. Now, that those places, which they object, may
   be variously explained, they themselves are not ignorant of: and if any
   one cares to compare the ancient interpreters, who were in the
   Babylonish captivity, [669] or elsewhere, concerning the limes of
   Jesus, with those who wrote after the name of the Christians began to
   be hated amongst the Jews, he will find that partiality was the cause
   of new explications; and that those which were formerly received,
   agreed very well with the sense of the Christians. They are not
   ignorant themselves, that many things in the sacred writings are not to
   be understood according to the strict propriety of the words, but in a
   figurative sense; [670] as when God is said to have descended; [671]
   when mouth, [672] ears, [673] eyes, [674] and nose are ascribed to him.
   [675] And what hinders but that many things, spoken of the times of the
   Messiah, may be explained in this manner? As that the wolf and the
   lamb, the leopard and the kid, the lion and the calf, should lie down
   together; [676] that a young child should play with the snakes; that
   the mountain of God should rise higher than the rest of the mountains:
   [677] that strangers should come thither to perform holy rites. There
   are some promises, which appear, from the foregoing and following
   words, or from their own sense, to contain in them a tacit condition.
   Thus God promised many things to the Hebrews, if they would receive and
   obey the Messiah when he cattle: which if they do not come to pass,
   they must impute it to themselves. And if there be any which are
   expressly and unconditionally promised, and are not yet fulfilled, they
   may yet be expected. For it is agreed even amongst the Jews, that the
   time or kingdom of the Messiah was to continue to the end of the world.

  SECT. XIX. And to that which is objected of the low condition and death of
  Jesus.

   MANY are offended at the mean condition of Jesus, but without any
   reason; for God says every where in the sacred writings, that he
   exalteth the humble, and casteth down the proud. [679] Jacob went over
   Jordan, [680] carrying nothing with him but his staff, and returned
   thither again enriched with great plenty of cattle. Moses was banished,
   and poor, and a feeder of cattle, when God appeared to him in the bush,
   and made him leader of his people; [681] David also, when he was
   feeding his flock, was called to be king; [682] and the sacred history
   is full of other such like examples. And of the Messiah, we read that
   he was to be a joyful messenger to the poor; [683] that he should not
   lift up his voice in the street, nor make use of contention, but should
   act mildly, so as to spare a shaking reed, and to cherish the heat
   which remained in the smoking flax. [684] Neither ought his other
   hardships, and death itself, to render him more odious to any one. For
   God often permits pious men not only to be vexed by the wicked, as Lot
   was by the men of Sodom; [685] but also to be killed, as is manifest in
   the example of Abel, slain by his brother; [686] of Isaiah, who was cut
   in pieces; [687] of the Maccabees brethren, tormented to death with
   their mother. [688] The Jews themselves sing the lxxixth Psalm: in
   which are these words: They have given the dead bodies of thy servants
   to the fowls of the air, and the remains of them, whom thou lovest, to
   the beasts: they have poured out their blood within the walls of
   Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them; and so on. And that the
   Messiah himself was to arrive at his kingdom, and to the power of
   bestowing on his disciples the greatest good things, through troubles
   and death, nobody can deny, who reads those words of Isaiah with an
   attentive mind, chap. liii. [689] Who hath believed our report, and who
   hath acknowledged the power of God? And that for this reason, because
   he hath arisen in the sight of God as a tender plant, as grass out of
   the sandy ground: there is no beauty or comeliness in his countenance,
   neither if you look upon hint is there any thing delightful: he was
   exposed to contempt, and was as the most despised amongst men: he
   endured many sorrows, many griefs: all men turned away themselves from
   him: he was so much despised as to be thought of no value; but, indeed,
   he hath endured our diseases, he kink borne our calamities. [690] We
   esteemed him as struck from heaven, as smitten and afflicted of God:
   but he was wounded for our sins, he was bruised for our crimes; the
   punishment which should procure safety for us, was laid on him; [691]
   his stripes were a remedy for us, for assuredly we have all wandered to
   and fro like sheep: God hath inflicted on him the punishment due to our
   crimes. And yet, when he was afflicted and grievously tormented, he did
   not lift up his voice, but was silent as a lamb going to be slain, and
   a sheep to be shorn. After bonds, after judgment, he was taken from
   amongst men; but now who can worthily declare the continuance of his
   life? He was taken out of this place wherein we live; but this evil
   befel him for the sins of my people. He was delivered into the hands of
   powerful and wicked men, even unto death and burial, when he had done
   no injury to any one nor was deceit ever found in his speech. But
   although God permitted him to be thus far bruised and afflicted with
   pains, yet because he has made himself a sacrifice for sin, [692] he
   shall see his posterity, he shall live a long life; [693] and those
   things which are acceptable to God, shall happily succeed through him.
   Seeing himself freed from evil, says God, he shall be satisfied with
   pleasure, [694] and that principally for this reason, because by his
   doctrine my righteous servant shall acquit many, bearing himself their
   sins. I will give him a large portion when the spoil shall be divided
   amongst the warriors; [695] because he submitted himself to death, and
   was reckoned amongst the wicked; and when he bore the punishment of
   other men's crimes, he made himself a petitioner for the guilty. Which
   of the kings or prophets can be named, to whom these things will agree?
   Certainly none of them. And as to what the modern Jews conceit, that
   the Hebrew people themselves are here spoken of, who being dispersed
   into all nations, should by their example and discourse make
   proselytes; this sense, in the first place, is inconsistant with many
   testimonies of the sacred writings, which declare, that no misfortunes
   should befal the Jews, [696] which, and much greater than which, they
   have not deserved by their actions. Further, the order itself of the
   prophetic discourse, will not bear such all interpretation. For the
   prophet, or, which seems more agreeable to that place, God, says, This
   evil hath happened to him for the sins of my people. Now Isaiah's
   people, or God's people, are the Hebrew people; wherefore, he who is
   said by Isaiah to have endured such grievous things, cannot be the same
   people. The ancient Hebrew teachers more rightly confessed, that these
   things were spoken of the Messiah; which when some of the latter saw,
   they imagined two Messiahs; [697] one of which they call the son of
   Joseph, who endured many evils, and a cruel death; the other the son of
   David, to whom all things succeeded prosperously; though it is much
   easier, and more agreeable to the writings of the prophets, [698] to
   acknowledge one, who arrived at his kingdom through adversity and
   death, which we believe concerning Jesus, and which the thing itself
   shews us to be true.

  SECT. XX. And as though they were good men who delivered him to death.

   MANY are withheld from embracing the doctrine of Jesus, out of a
   prejudiced notion they have entertained of the virtue and goodness of
   their forefathers, and especially of the chief priests; who condemned
   Jesus, and rejected his doctrine, without any just reason. But what
   sort of persons their forefathers often were, that they may not think I
   falsely slander them, let them hear in the very words of their law, and
   of the prophets, by whom they are often called uncircumcised in ears
   and heart; [699] a people who honoured God with their lips, [700] and
   with costly rites, but their mind was far removed from him. It was
   their forefathers, who were very near killing their brother Joseph, and
   who actually sold him into bondage; [701] it was their forefathers
   also, who made Moses, their captain and deliverer, [702] whom the
   earth, sea, and air obeyed, weary of his life, by their continual
   rebellions; who despised the bread sent from heaven; [703] who
   complained as if they were in extreme want, [704] when they could
   scarce contain within them the birds they had eaten. It was their
   forefathers who forsook the great and good king David, to follow his
   rebellious son: [705] it was their forefathers who slew Zacharias, the
   son of Jehoiada, [706] in the most holy place, making the very priest
   himself a sacrifice of their cruelty. And as to the high-priests, [707]
   they were such as treacherously designed the death of Jeremiah, and had
   effected it, if they had not been hindered by the authority of some of
   the rulers; however, they extorted thus much, that he should be held a
   captive till the very moment the city was taken. [708] If any one think
   that they who lived in the times of Jesus were better, Josephus can
   free them from this mistake, who describes their most horrid crimes,
   and their punishments, which were heavier than any that were ever heard
   of; and yet, as he himself thinks, beneath what they deserved. [709]
   Neither are we to think better of the council, especially when at that
   time the members of it were not admitted, according to the ancient
   custom, by the imposition of bands, but were wont to be chosen at the
   will of great men; [710] as the chief priests also were, whose dignity
   was not now perpetual, but yearly, and oftentimes purchased. [711] So
   that we ought not to wonder that men swelled with pride, whose avarice
   and ambition were insatiable, should be enraged at the sight of a man,
   who urged the most holy precepts, and reproved their lives by their
   difference from his. Nor was he accused of any thing, but what the best
   men of old were: thus Micaiah, [712] who lived in the time of
   Jehosaphat, was delivered to prison, for resolutely asserting the truth
   against four hundred false prophets. Ahab charged Elijah, just as the
   chief priests did Jesus, with being a disturber of the peace of Israel.
   [713] And Jeremiah was accused, as Jesus was, of prophesying against
   the temple. [714] To which may be added, what the ancient Hebrew
   teachers have left us in writing, [715] that in the times of the
   Messiah, men would have the impudence of dogs, the stubbornness of an
   ass, and the cruelty of a wild beast. And God himself, who saw long
   before what sort of men many of the Jews would be in the times of the
   Messiah, foretold that they who were not his people, should be admitted
   to be his people; [716] and that out of every city and village of the
   Jews, not above one or two should go up to the holy mountain; [717] but
   that what was wanting in their number should be tilled up by strangers.
   And also that the Messiah should be the destruction of the Hebrews;
   [718] but that this stone, which was rejected by the master-builders,
   should be put in the chief place, to hold the whole fabric together.

  SECT. XXI. An answer to the objection of the Christians worshipping many gods.

   IT remains that we answer two accusations, which the Jews assault the
   doctrine and worship of the Christians with. The first is this; they
   affirm that we worship many gods: but this is no more than an odious
   explication of a doctrine which appears strange to them. For there is
   no more reason why this should be objected against the Christians, than
   against Philo the Jew, [719] who often affirms, that there are three
   things in God; and he calls the reason, or word of God, the name of
   God, [720] the Maker of the world, [721] not unbegotten as is God the
   Father of all; [722] nor yet begotten in like manner as men are: the
   same is likewise called the angel, or the ambassador, [723] who takes
   care of the universe by Philo himself, and by Muses the sun of
   Nehemannus: [724] or against the cabalists, [725] who distinguish God
   into three lights, and some of them by the same names as the Christians
   do, of the Father, Son or Word, and Holy Ghost. And to take that which
   is chiefly allowed amongst all the Hebrews; that spirit by which the
   prophets were moved is not any created thing, and yet is distinguished
   from him that seat it; as likewise that which is commonly called the
   Schechinah. [726] Now, many of the Hebrews have this tradition, [727]
   that that divine power, which they call Wisdom, should dwell in the
   Messiah, whence the Chaldee paraphrast calls the Messiah the Word of
   God; [728] as the Messiah is also called by David, and others, by the
   venerable name of God, [729] and also of Lord. [730]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [719] Concerning the sacrifices of Abel and Cain. "When God, attended
   with his two principal powers, government and goodness; himself, who is
   one only, being between them, he framed three conceptions in the
   contemplative soul: each of which can by no means be comprehended, for
   his powers are unlimited; they each contain the whole." Afterwards he
   calls government, power; and goodness, he calls beneficence; and says,
   that they are not pronounced by a pious mind, but kept in silent
   secrecy. And the same we find in his book of Cherubim. In the second
   book of the husbandry of Noah, he mentions existence, the governing
   power, the merciful power. Maimonides, in the beginning of his book of
   fundamentals, and after him Joseph Albo, distinguish in God, "that
   which understandeth; that by which any thing is understood; and the
   understanding." We find something belonging to this matter in
   Abenesdras, on Gen. xviii. and Maimonides's guide to the doubting, part
   i. chap. 68.

   [720] In his Allegories, and of the Confusion of Tongues.

   [721] In his Allegories: "His word, by making use of which, as of an
   instrument, he made the world." Concerning Cain: "The word of God was
   the instrument by which it (the world) was made."--(The word lo'gon
   might better be translated reason, here in Philo, as I have abundantly
   shewn in the dissertation on the beginning of St. John. Le Clerc.)

   [722] The place is in the book, entitled, Who shall inherit divine
   things. The same word is called by Philo, the image of God, in his book
   of monarchy: and in that of dreams sent by God; sometimes apeiko'nisma,
   the resemblance, as in the book entitled, The wicked lay snares for the
   righteous. Sometimes charakte`r, the form, as in book ii. of
   agriculture. Compare John i. Heb. i. 3.

   [723] He calls him Angelon, angel, in his Allegories, and in his book
   of Cherubim; Archa'ngelon, archangel, in his book entitled, Who shall
   inherit divine good things, and in his book of The confusion of
   tongues. And the same is called angel and yhvh Jehovah by r. Samuel in
   Mecor Chaim.

   [724] The learned Masius has translated his words thus, on the vth
   chapter of Joshua: "That angel, to speak the truth, is the angel, the
   Redeemer, of whom it is written, because my name is in him. That angel,
   I say, who said to Jacob, I am the God of Bethel. He of whom it is
   said, And God called Moses out of the bush. And he is called an angel,
   because he governs the world. For it is written, Jehovah (that is, the
   Lord God) brought us out of Egypt: and in other places, He sent his
   angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Besides it is written, And the
   angel of his presence hath made them safe; namely, that angel which is
   the presence of God, concerning whom it is said, My presence shall go
   before, and I will cause thee to rest. Lastly, this is that angel of
   whom the prophet said, and suddenly the Lord whom ye seek shall come
   into his temple, even the angel of the covenant, whom ye desire." And
   again, other words of the same person to this purpose "Consider
   diligently what those things mean; for Moses and the Israelites always
   wished for the first angel; but they could not rightly understand who
   he was. For they had it not from others, nor could they arrive fully at
   it by prophetic knowledge. But the presence of God signifies God
   himself, as is confessed by all interpreters; neither could any one
   understand those things by dreams, unless he were skilled in the
   mysteries of the law." And again; "My presence shall go before, that
   is, the angel of the covenant whom ye desire, in whom my presence will
   be seen. Of whom it is said, I will hear thee in an acceptable time;
   for my name is in him, and I will make thee to rest; or I will cause
   him to be kind and merciful to thee. Nor shall he guide thee by a rigid
   law, but kindly and gently." Compare with this, what we find in
   Manasses Conciliator, in the xix. quest. on Genesis.--(The name of this
   rabbi's father may better be pronounced Nachman, for it is written
   nchmn. Nahhman. Le Clerc.)

   [725] See the appendix to Schindler's Hebrew Lexicon, in the characters
   'kv. And the book called Schep-tal says sphrvt Siperoth. Number in God
   does not destroy his unity.

   [726] And they distinguish it from the Holy Ghost. See the Jerusalem
   Gemara, entitled concerning instructions, chap. 3. And the Babylonish
   Gemara, entitled Joma, chap. 1. R. Jonathan, in his preface to Ecka
   Rabthi, says, that the Schechinah remained three years and a half upon
   mount Olivet, expecting the conversion of the Jews; which is very true,
   if we apprehend him right.

   [727] Rabbi Solomon, on Genesis xix. 18. acknowledges, that God can
   take upon him human nature, which he thinks was formerly done for a
   time; to which agrees the Talmud, entitled Schebuoth and Sabbathoth.

   [728] As Hosea i. 7.--(But they are mistaken who think that the Chaldee
   paraphrast means any thing else by the Name of God, but God himself; as
   a very learned man hath shewn, in the balance of truth, published in
   the year 1700, a long time after the author's death. Le Clerc.)

   [729] Namely, yhvh Jehovah; Jonathan and David Kimchi, on Jeremiah
   xxiii. 6. with which agrees Abba in Ecka Rabthi. yhvh tsv'vt. Jehovah
   Sabaoth, Zachariah xiv. 16. The Talmud in Taanith, from Isaiah xxv. 9.
   saith, in that time God, yhvh Jehovah, shall be shewn, as it were, with
   the finger.

   [730] 'lhym Elohim, Psalm xlv. 7. which psalm, the Chaldee paraphrast
   there owns, treats of the Messiah, as he did before in that place of
   Isaiah now cited. Also 'dvny Adonai, in Psalm cx. which treats of the
   Messiah, as will presently appear.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XXII. And that human nature is worshipped by them.

   To the other objection they make against us, namely, that we give the
   worship due to God to a being made by God; the answer is ready: for we
   say, that we pay no other worship or honour to the Messiah but what we
   are commanded in Psalm ii. and cx. [731] the former of which was
   fulfilled in David only in an incomplete manner, and belonged more
   eminently to the Messiah, as David Kimchi, a great enemy to the
   Christians, acknowledges; [732] and the latter cannot be explained of
   any other but the Messiah: for the fictions of the latter Jews, some of
   Abraham, some of David, and others of Hezekiah, are very trifling. The
   Hebrew inscription skews us, that it was a psalm of David's own.
   Therefore, what David says was said to his Lord, cannot agree to David
   himself, nor to Hezekiah, who was of the posterity of David, and no way
   more excellent than David. And Abraham had not a more excellent
   priesthood; nay, Melchisedech gave him his blessing, as inferior to
   himself. [733] But both this, and that which is added, concerning a
   sceptre's coming out of Sion, [734] and extending to the most distant
   places, plainly agrees to the Messiah; as is clear from those places
   which, without doubt, speak of the Messiah; [735] neither did the
   ancient Hebrews and parsphrasts understand them otherwise. Now that
   Jesus of Nazareth was truly the person in whom these things was
   fulfilled, I could believe upon the affirmation of his disciples only,
   upon the account of their great honesty; in the same manner as the Jews
   believe Moses, without any other witness, in those things which he says
   were delivered to him from God. But there are very many and very strong
   arguments besides this, of that exceeding power which we affirm Jesus
   to have obtained. [736] He himself was seen by many after he was
   restored to life: he was seen to be taken up into heaven: moreover
   devils were cast out, and diseases healed, by his name only; and the
   gift of tongues was given to his disciples: which things Jesus himself
   promised, as signs of his kingdom. Add to this, that his sceptre, that
   is, the word of the gospel, came out of Sion, and, without any human
   assistance, extended itself to the utmost limits of the earth, by the
   divine power alone; and made nations and kings subject unto it, as the
   psalms expressly foretold. The cabalistical Jews made the son of Enoch
   a certain middle person betwixt God and men, who had no token of any
   such great power. [737] How much more reasonable then is it for us to
   do it to him who gave us such instructions! Neither does this at all
   tend to the lessening of God the Father, from whom this power of Jesus
   was derived, [738] and to whom it will return, [739] and whose honour
   it serves. [740]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [731] The very learned rabbi Saadia, explains these places, and
   Zachariah ix. 9. of the Messiah.

   [732] The same second psalm is expounded of the Messiah, by Abraham
   Esdras, and r. Jonathan in Beresith Rabba.

   [733] And received the tithe of him by a sacerdotal right. Gen. xiv.19,
   20.

   [734] Psalm cx. 2.

   [735] As Gen. xlix. 10. and those before cited out of the prophets.

   [736] See them handled before in the second book; and what is said in
   the beginning of this book.

   [737] The name which the Hebrews give him is vvttry Metator. So the
   Latins call him who prepares the way for the king. Thus Lucan:-- As
   harbinger to the Hesperian fields, I boldly come. Vegetius, book ii.
   says, "They were called metatores, harbingers in the camps, who went
   before and chose a place fit for the camp." And thus Suidas; "Meta'tor,
   a harbinger, is a messenger, who is sent before from the prince."--(The
   rabbies rather call it Metatron vvmtrvn, pious, concerning which see
   John Buxtorf's Chaldee and Rabbinical Lexicon. Le Clerc.)

   [738] As himself confesses, John v. 19, 30, 36, 43. vi. 38, 57. xiii.
   28, 49. x. 18, 29. xiv. 28, 31. xvi. 28. xx. 21. And the apostle to the
   Heb. v. 5. Rom. vi. 4. 1 Cor. xi. 3.

   [739] As the apostle confesses, 1 Cor. xv. 24.

   [740] John xiii. 31. xiv. 13. Rom. xvi. 27. Therefore the Talmud,
   entitled concerning the council, denies Jesus to be the name of an
   idol; seeing the Christians in honouring him have a regard to God the
   Maker of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XXIII. The conclusion of this part, with a prayer for the Jews.

   IT is not the design of this treatise, to examine more nicely into
   these things: nor had we treated of them at all, but to make it appear,
   that there is nothing in the Christian religion either impious or
   absurd, which any man can pretend against embracing a religion
   recommended by so great miracles, whose precepts are so virtuous, and
   whose promises are so excellent. For he who has once embraced it, ought
   to consult those books, which we have before shewn to contain the
   doctrines of the Christian religion, for particular questions. Which
   that it may be done, let us beseech God, that he would enlighten the
   minds of the Jews, with his own light, and render those prayers
   effectual, which Christ put up for them when he hung upon the cross.

BOOK VI.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. I. A confutation of Mahometanism: the original thereof.

   INSTEAD of a preface to this sixth book, which is designed against the
   Mahometans, it relates the judgments of Cod against the Christians,
   down to the original of Mahometanism; namely, how that sincere and
   unfeigned piety, which flourished amongst the Christians, who were most
   grievously afflicted and tormented, began by degrees to abate: [742]
   after Constantine and the following emperors had made the profession of
   the Christian religion not only safe, but honourable, by having, as it
   were, brought the world into the church. [743] First, the Christian
   princes waged war without measure, even when they might have enjoyed
   peace. [744] The bishops quarrelled with each other most bitterly about
   the highest places: [745] and, as of old, the preferring the tree of
   knowledge to the tree of life, was the occasion of the greatest
   evils;Gen. ii. and iii. so then nice inquiries were esteemed more than
   piety, and religion was made an art. [746] The consequence of which
   was, that after the example of them who built the tower of Babel, [747]
   their rashly affecting matters, produced different languages and
   confusion among them; which the common people taking notice of, many
   times not knowing which way to turn themselves, cast all the blame upon
   the sacred writings, and began to avoid them, as if they were infected.
   And religion began every where to be placed, not in purity of mind, but
   in rites, as if Judaism were brought back again: and in those things,
   which contained in them more of bodily exercise, than improvement of
   the mind; [748] and also in a violent adhering to the party they had
   chosen; [749] the final event of which was, that there were every where
   a great many Christians in name, but very few in reality. [750] God did
   not overlook these faults of his people; but from the farthest corners
   of Scythia, [751] and Germany, [752] poured vast armies, like a deluge,
   upon the Christian world: and when the great slaughter made by these,
   did nut suffice to reform those which remained; by the just permission
   of God, Mahomet planted in Arabia a new religion directly opposite to
   the Christian religion; [753] yet such as did, in a good measure,
   express in words, the life of a great part of the Christians. This
   religion was first embraced by the Saracens, who revolted from the
   emperor Heraclius; whose arms quickly subdued Arabia, Syria, Palestine,
   Egypt, Persia; and afterwards they invaded Africa, and came over sea
   into Spain. But the power of the Saracens was derived to others,
   particularly to the Turks, a very warlike people; [754] who after many
   long engagements with the Saracens, being desired to enter into a
   league, they easily embraced a religion agreeable to their manners, and
   transferred the imperial power to them selves. Having taken the cities
   of Asia and Greece, and the success of their arms increasing, they came
   into the borders of Hungary and Germany.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [742] See Ammianus Marcellinus, at the end of the twenty-first book
   concerning Constantino: "And above all, he was very ready to take away
   what he had given; counfounding the Christian religion, which is
   perfect and sincere, with old wives' fables; by more intricately
   searching into which, rather than seriously settling them, he caused a
   great many differences: which spreading further, be kept up by
   quarrelling about words; that the body of prelates, who were the public
   pack-horses, running here and there in synods, as they call them, might
   cut the nerves of their carriage, by endeavouring to make every rite
   conformable to their own opinion."

   [743] See what is excellently said about this, in Chrysostom's second
   moral discourse on the xiith chapter of 2 Cor. after ver. 10.

   [744] It is a commendable saying of Marcian in Zonaras, "That a king
   ought not to take up arms, so long as he can maintain peace."

   [745] Ammianus, book xxvii. "The cruel seditions of the quarrel. some
   people, which gave rise to this business, frighted this man also
   (Viventius, chief commissioner of the palace). Damasus and Ursicinus,
   being above all reasonable measure desirous of seizing the episcopal
   chair, contended with each other most vehemently by different
   interests; their accomplices on each side carrying on their differences
   as far as death and wounds; which Viventius not being able to correct
   or soften, being compelled by a great force, retired into the suburbs;
   and Damasus overcame in the contest, the party which favoured him
   pressing hard. And it is evident, that in the palace of Sicininus,
   where the assemblies of the Chris. liens used to be, there were found
   the dead bodies of one hundred and thirty-seven, slain in one day; and
   it was a long time before the enraged common people could be appeased.
   Nor do I deny, when I consider the city's pomp, but that they, who are
   desirous of such things, may lawfully contend, by stretching their
   lungs to the utmost, in order to obtain what they aim at. Because when
   they are arrived at it, they will be so secure, that they may enrich
   themselves with the gifts of matrons, may sit and ride in their
   chariots, be neatly dressed, have large feasts provided, insomuch that
   their banquets will exceed the royal tables; but such persons might
   have been more truly happy, if they had despised the grandeur of the
   city, which flattered their vices; and had lived after the manner of
   some of the provincial bishops, whose sparingness, in eating and
   drinking moderately, and meanness in clothes and eyes fixed on the
   ground continually, recommend them as pure and modest to the Deity, and
   to those that worship him." And a little after; "The chief justice,
   whilst he takes care of the govern. went in a higher degree, amongst
   other things, by manifold acts of integrity and goodness, for which he
   has been famous from the beginning of his youth, has obtained that
   which seldom happens; that at the same time that he is feared, he does
   not lose the love of his subjects; which is seldom very strong towards
   those judges they are afraid of. By whose authority and just
   determinations of truth, the tumult, raised by the quarrels of the
   Christians, was appeased; and Ursicinus being driven away, the Roman
   subjects grew into a firm peace jointly, and with one mind; which is
   the glory of an eminent ruler, regulating many and advantageous
   things." This was that chief justice of whom Jerome tells a story, not
   unworthy to be mentioned here, to Pammachius, against the errors of
   John of Jerusalem. "The chief justice, that died when he was designed
   for consul, used to say jestingly to the holy pope Damasus, Make me
   bishop of the city of Rome, and I will be a Christian immediately." See
   also what the same Ammianus says, book xv. The African council did not
   without reason admonish the bishop of the city of Rome thus: "That we
   may not seem to bring the vain arrogance of the age into the church of
   Christ, which affords the light of simplicity, and the day of humility,
   to them who desire to see God." To which we may add the noble epistles
   of the Roman bishop Gregory, truly styled the great, book iv. 32, 34,
   36. book vi. 30. book vii. Indict. 1. Epist. 30.

   [746] See what was before quoted out of the twenty-first book of
   Ammianus. The same historian, book xxii. in the history of Julian,
   says, "And that his disposition of things might produce a more certain
   effect, having admitted the disagreeing prelates of the Christians,
   together with the divided multitude, into the palace; he admonished
   them that every one, laying aside their civil discords, should apply
   himself without fear to his religion; which he urged the more
   earnestly, because liberty is apt to increase dissensions; that he
   might have the less reason to fear the common people, when they were
   all of one mind, knowing that no beasts are so mischeivous to mankind,
   as very many of the Christians were, who were so outrageous against one
   another." See also Procopius, in the first of his gothics, to be read
   with some abatement here, as in other places. "Ambassadors came from
   Byzantium, to the bishop of Rome, viz. Hypatius, bishop of Ephesus, and
   Demetrius, bishop of Philippi, in Macedonia, concerning an opinion,
   which was controverted amongst the Christians. Though I know what
   opposition they made, yet I ant very unwilling to relate it; for I
   think it the maddest folly so search nicely into the nature of God, and
   wherein it consists. For, as I conceive, man cannot fully comprehend
   human things, much less those that appertain to the divine nature, I
   may therefore securely pass by these things in silence, and not disturb
   what they reverence. As for myself I can say nothing more of God, but
   that he is every way good, and upholds all things by his power; he that
   knows more, whether he be a priest, or one of the common people, let
   him speak it." Gregoras, book viii. cites the saying of Lysis the
   Pythagorean, and afterwards of Synesius; "That talking philosophy among
   the vulgar, was the cause of men's so much contemning divine things."
   So also book the xth, he much dissuades men from such disputes; and
   speaking of the Latins of his time, he says, "I blame and condemn the
   Italians highly, because they run into divine matters with great
   arrogance." Afterwards he adds; "Amongst them the mechanics utter the
   mysteries of divinity, and they are all as eager of reasoning
   syllogistically, as the cattle are of food and grass. Both they who
   doubt of what they ought to believe rightly, and they who know not what
   they ought to believe, nor what they say they believe; these fill all
   the theatres, forums, and walks, with their divinity, and are not
   ashamed to make the sun a witness of their impudence."

   Christians, particularly in Azoara xxvi. xxxii.

  SECT. II. The Mahometans' foundation overturned, in that they do not examine
  into religion.

   THIS religion, which was plainly calculated for bloodshed, delights
   much in ceremonies, and would be believed, without allowing liberty to
   enquire into it: [755] for which reason the vulgar are prohibited
   reading those books which they account sacred; which is a manifest sign
   of their iniquity. For those goods may justly be suspected, which are
   imposed upon us with this condition, that they must not be looked into.
   It is true, indeed, all men have not like capacities for understanding
   every thing; many are drawn into error by pride, others by passion, and
   some by custom; but the Divine Goodness will not allow us to believe,
   that the way to eternal salvation cannot be known by those who seek it,
   without any regard to profit or honour; submitting themselves, and all
   that belong to them, to God and begging assistance from him. [756] And,
   indeed, since God has planted in the mind of man a power of judging; no
   part of truth is more worthy to employ it about, than that which they
   cannot be ignorant of, without being in danger of missing eternal
   salvation.

   him that knocks, it shall be opened." And Origen in his eighth book

   is willing to worship him; and he will render to every one of these the
   fruit of his piety."
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. III. A proof against the Mahometans, taken out of the sacred books of
  the Hebrews and Christians; and that they are not corrupted.

   MAHOMET and his followers confess, that both Moses [757] and Jesus were
   sent by God; [758] and that they who first propagated the institution
   of Jesus were holy men. [759] But there are many things related in the
   Alcoran, [760] which is the law of Mahomet, directly contrary to what
   is delivered by Moses, and the disciples of Jesus. To instance in one
   example out of many: all the apostles and disciples of Jesus entirely
   agree in this testimony, that Jesus died upon the cross, returned to
   life upon the third day, and was seen of many: on the contrary, Mahomet
   says, that Jesus was privately taken up into heaven, [761] and that a
   certain resemblance of him was fixed to the cross; and consequently
   Jesus was not dead, but the eyes of the Jews were deceived. This
   objection cannot be evaded, unless Mahomet will say, as indeed he does,
   that the books both of Moses, and of the disciples of Jesus, [762] have
   not continued as they were, but are corrupted; but this fiction we have
   already confuted in the third book. Certainly, if any one should say,
   that the Alcoran is corrupted, the Mahometans would deny it, and say,
   that that was a sufficient answer to a thing which was not proved. Bat
   they cannot easily bring such arguments for the uncorruptedness of
   their book, as we bring for ours, viz. that copies of them were
   immediately dispersed all over the world; and that not, like the
   Alcoran, in one language only; and were faithfully preserved, by so
   many sects, who differed so much in other things. The Mahometans
   persuade themselves, that in the xivth chapter of St. John, which
   speaks of sending the Comforter, there was something written of
   Mahomet, which the Christians have put out: but here we may ask them;
   do they suppose this alteration of the Scripture to have been made
   after the coming of Mahomet, or before? It is plainly impossible to
   have been done after the corning of Mahomet, because at that time there
   were extant, all over the world, very many copies, not only Greek, but
   Syriac, Arabic, and in places distant from Arabia, Ethiopic and Latin,
   of more versions than one. Before the coming of Mahomet, there was no
   reason for such a change; for nobody could know what Mahomet would
   teach; further, if the doctrine of Mahomet had nothing in it contrary
   to the doctrine of Jesus, the Christians would as easily have received
   his books, as they did the books of Moses and the Hebrew prophets. Let
   us suppose on each side, that there was nothing written either of the
   doctrine of Jesus, or of that of Mahomet; equity will tell us, that
   that is to be esteemed the doctrine of Jesus, in which all Christians
   agree; and that the doctrine of Mahomet, in which all Mahometans agree.

  SECT. IV. From comparing Mahomet with Christ.

   LET ns now compare the adjuncts and circumstances of each doctrine
   together, that we may see which is to be preferred to the other: and
   first let us examine their authors, Mahomet himself confessed that
   Jesus was the Messiah promised in the law and the prophets; [763] he is
   called by Mahomet himself the word, [764] mind, [765] and wisdom of
   God; [766] he is also said by him to have had no father amongst men.
   [767] Mahomet is acknowledged by his own disciples, to have been
   begotten according to the common course of nature. [768] Jesus led an
   innocent life, against which no objection can be made. Mahomet was a
   long time a robber, [769] and always effeminate. [770] Jesus was taken
   up into heaven, by the confession of Mahomet; [771] but Mahomet remains
   in the grave. And now can any one doubt which to follow?

  SECT. V. And the works of each of them.

   LET us now proceed to the works of each of them. Jesus gave sight to
   the blind, made the lame to walk, and recovered the sick; [772] nay, as
   Mahomet confesses, he restored the dead to life. Mahomet says, that he
   himself was not sent with miracles, but with arms; [773] however, there
   were some afterwards, who ascribed miracles to him, but what were they?
   None but such as might easily be the effects of human art; as that of
   the dove flying to his ear; or such as had no witnesses, as that of the
   camel's speaking to him by night; or else such as are confuted by their
   own absurdity, as that of a great piece of the moon falling into his
   sleeve, and sent back again by him, to make the planet round. [774] Who
   is there that will not say, but that in a doubtful cause, we are to
   stick to that law, which has on its side the most certain testimony of
   the Divine approbation? Let us also examine them, who first embraced
   each of these laws.

  SECT. VI. And those who first embraced each of these religions.

   THEY who embraced the law of Christ were men who feared God, and led
   innocent lives; and it is not reasonable that God should suffer such
   persons to be deceived with cunning words, or with a shew of miracles.
   But they who first embraced Mahometanism were robbers, and men void of
   humanity and piety. [775]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [775] This the word Saracen shews, which signifies robber. See
   Scaliger's emendation of the times, book iii. chap. of the Arabian
   period.--(The first followers of Mahomet were, indeed, truly robbers;
   but the Arabian word, to which Scaliger refers, signifies to steal
   privately, not to rob; nor is it credible that they would take upon
   themselves such an infamous name; not to mention that this was more
   ancient than Mahomet, for we find it in Ptolemy and Philostorgius;
   wherefore, I rather follow the opinion of those who deduce the name
   Saracen from the word srq Schark, which signifies Eastern, whence comes
   srqyyn, Sharkiin, Saracens, or people dwelling in the east, as the
   Arabians are called in Scripture. About which see Edward Pocock on the
   specimen of the history of the Arabians, in the beginning. Le Clerc).
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VII. And of the methods by which each law was propagated.

   NEXT let us see the method by which each religion was propagated. As
   for the Christian religion, we have already said several times that its
   increase was owing to the miracles not only of Christ, but of his
   disciples and their successors; and also to their patiently enduring of
   hardships and torments. But the teachers of Mahometanism did not work
   any miracles, did not endure any grievous troubles, nor any severe
   kinds of death, for that profession. But that religion follows where
   arms lead the way; [776] it is the companion of arms; nor do its
   teachers bring any other arguments for it, [777] but the success of
   war, and the greatness of its power; than which nothing is more
   fallacious. They themselves condemn the Pagan rites, and yet we know
   how great the victories of the Persians, Macedonians, and Romans were,
   and how far their enemies extended themselves. Neither was the event of
   war always prosperous to the Mahometans; there are remarkable
   slaughters which they have received in very many places, both by land
   and sea. [778] They are driven out of all Spain. That thing cannot be a
   certain mark of true religion, which has such uncertain turns, and
   which may be common both to good and bad: and so much the less, because
   their arms were unjust, and often taken up against a people who no ways
   disturbed them, [779] nor were distinguished for any injury they had
   done; so that they could have no pretence for their arms but religion,
   which is the most profane thing that can be; for there is no worship of
   God, but such as proceeds from a willing mind. [780] Now the will is
   inclined only by instruction and persuasion, not by threats and force.
   He that is compelled to believe a thing, does not believe it, but only
   pretends to believe it that he may avoid some evil. He that would
   extort assent, from a sense of evil, or from fear, shews by that very
   thing that he distrusts arguments. And again, they themselves destroy
   this very pretence of religion, when they suffer those who are reduced
   to their obedience to be of what religion they please: nay, and
   sometimes they openly acknowledge, that Christians may be saved by
   their own law. [781]

   [778] And greater since the time of Grotius. For they were driven,
   after many slaughters, from the Austrian dominions, from Hungary,
   Transylvania, and Peloponnesus, not many years since. And since that
   time, the Turkish empire seems to decrease. In the year 1715, after
   these short notes were first published, the Turks recovered the Morea,
   which was poorly defended by the Venetian governors; but in the
   following year, 1716, when they attempted to invade Hungary and the
   island of Corsica, they were first overthrown in a great fight by the
   Germans, under the command of prince Eugene of Savoy, and lost
   Temeswaer, which was forced to yield after a stout siege; then being
   repulsed by the valour of count Schulembourg, not without loss, they
   retired to their fleet. While I was writing this, April 1717, they
   threatened they would attempt the same again with new forces, but the
   Germans did not seem to be much affected with it. Le Clerc.

     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VIII. And of their precepts compared with one another.

   LET us also compare their precepts together. The one commands patience,
   nay kindness, towards those who wish ill to us: the other, revenge. The
   one commands that the bonds of matrimony should be perpetual, that they
   should bear with each other's behaviour; the other gives a liberty of
   separating. [782] Here, the husband does the same himself, which he
   requires of his wife; and shews by his own example, that love is to be
   fixed on one: there, women upon women are allowed, as being always new
   incitements to lust. [783] Here, religion is reduced inwardly to the
   mind; that, being well cultivated there, it may bring forth fruits
   profitable to mankind there, almost the whole force of it is spent in
   circumcision, [784] and things indifferent in themselves. [785] Here, a
   moderate use of wine and meat is allowed: there, the eating swine's
   flesh, [786] and drinking wine, is forbidden; [787] which is the great
   gift of God, for the good of the mind and body, if taken moderately.
   And, indeed, it is no wonder, that childish rudiments should precede
   the most perfect law, such as that of Christ is; but it is very
   preposterous, after the publication thereof, to return to figures and
   types. Nor can any reason be given, why any other religion ought to be
   published, after the Christian religion, which is far the best.

  SECT. IX. A solution of the Mahometans' objection concerning the Son of God.

   THE Mahometans say, they are offended, because we ascribe a Son to God,
   who makes nu use of a wife; as if the word son, as it refers to God,
   could not have a more divine signification. But Mahomet himself
   ascribes many things to God, no less unworthy of him, than if it were
   said he had a wife; for instance, that he has a cold hand, and that
   himself experienced it by a touch; [788] that he is carried about in a
   chair, and the like. [789] Now we, when we call Jesus the Son of God,
   mean the same thing that he did, when he calls him the Word of God:
   [790] for the word is in a peculiar manner produced from the mind:
   [791] to which we may add, that he was born of a virgin, by the help of
   God alone, who supplied the power of a father; that he was taken up
   into heaven by the power of God; which things, and those that Mahomet
   confesses, shew, that Jesus may and ought to be called the Son of God,
   by a peculiar right. [792]

  SECT. X. There are many absurd things in the Mahometan books.

   BUT, on the other hand, it would be tedious to relate bow many things
   there are in the Mahometan writings that do not agree to the truth of
   history; [793] and how many that are very ridiculous. Such as the story
   of a beautiful woman, [794] who learnt a famous song from angels
   overtaken with wine; by which she used to ascend up into heaven, and to
   descend from thence; who when she was ascended very high into the
   heavens, was apprehended by God, and fixed there, and that she is the
   star Venus. Such another is that of the mouse in Noah's ark, that
   sprung out of the dung of an elephant; [795] and, on the contrary, that
   of a cat bred out of the breath of a lion. [796] And particularly that
   of death's being changed into a ram, [797] which was to stand in the
   middle space betwixt heaven and hell; and that of getting rid of
   banquets in the other life by sweat; [798] and that of a company of
   women's being appointed to every one, for sensual pleasure. [799] Which
   things are really all of them such, that they are deservedly given over
   to senselessness who eau give any credit to them, especially when the
   light of the gospel shines upon them.

  SECT. XI. The conclusion to the Christians; who are admonished of their duty
  upon occasion of the foregoing things.

   HAVING finished this last dispute, I come now to the conclusion, which
   regards not strangers but Christians of all sorts and conditions:
   briefly shewing the use of those things which have been hitherto said;
   that those which are right may be done, and those which are wrong may
   be avoided. First, that they lift up undefiled hands [800] to that God
   who made all things, visible and invisible, out of nothing; [801] with
   a firm persuasion that he takes care of mankind, [802] since not a
   sparrow falls to the ground without his leave: [803] and that they do
   not fear them who can only hurt the body, [804] before him who hath an
   equal power over both body and soul: that they should trust not only on
   God the Father, but also on Jesus, [805] since there is none other name
   on earth by which we can be saved: [806] which they will rightly
   perform, [807] if they consider that not they, who call one by the name
   of Father, and the other by the name of Lord shall live eternally; but
   they who conform their lives to his will. They are moreover exhorted
   carefully to preserve the holy doctrine of Christ, as a most valuable
   treasure; [808] and to that end, often to read the sacred writings;
   [809] by which no one can possibly be deceived, who has not first
   deceived himself. For the authors of them were more faithful, [810] and
   more full of the divine influence, than either willingly to deceive us
   in any necessary truth, or to hide it in obscurity; but we must bring a
   mind prepared to obey, [811] which if we do, none of those things will
   escape us, which we are to believe, hope, or do; [812] and by this
   means, that spirit will be cherished and excited in us, [813] which is
   given us as a pledge of future happiness. [814] Further, they are to be
   deterred from imitating the heathen; first, in the worship of false
   gods, [815] which are nothing but empty names; [816] which evil angels
   make use of [817] to turn us from the worship of the true God; [818]
   wherefore, we cannot partake of their rites, [819] and at the same time
   be profited by the sacrifice of Christ. Secondly, in a licentious way
   of living. [820] having no other law but what lust dictates, which
   Christians ought to be the furthest from; [821] because they ought not
   only far to exceed the heathen, [822] but also the scribes and
   pharisees among the Jews; [823] whose righteousness, which consisted in
   certain external acts, was not sufficient to secure them a heavenly
   kingdom. The circumcision made with hands availeth nothing now, [824]
   but that other internal circumcision of the heart, obedience to the
   commands of God, [825] a new creature, [826] faith which is effectual
   by love, [827] by which the true Israelites are distinguished, [828]
   the mystical Jews, that is, such as praise God. [829] The differences
   of meats, [830] sabbaths, [831] festival days, [832] were the shadows
   of things, which really are in Christ and Christians. [833]
   Mahometanism gave occasion for mentioning the following admonitions: it
   was foretold by our Lord Jesus, that alter his time there should come
   some who should falsely say they were sent of God; [834] but though an
   angel should come from heaven, [835] we are not to receive any other
   doctrine than that of Christ, confirmed by so many testimonies. [836]
   In times past, indeed, God spake in many and various manners to the
   pious men that then were; [837] but last of all he was pleased to call
   us by his Son, the Lord of all things, [838] the brightness of his
   Father's glory, [839] and the express image of his substance; by whom
   all things were made, [840] which were or shall be; who acts and
   upholds all things by his power; [841] and who having made atonement
   for our sins, [842] is advanced to the right hand of God, having
   obtained a higher dignity than the angels; [843] and therefore nothing
   more noble can be expected than such a lawgiver. [844] They may also
   take occasion from hence to remember, that the weapons appointed for
   the soldiers of Christ are not such as Mahomet depends upon, but proper
   to the Spirit, [845] fitted for the pulling down of strong holds,
   erected against the knowledge of God, the shield of faith, [846] which
   may repel the fiery darts of the devil; the breastplate of
   righteousness, or holiness of life; for a helmet which covers the
   weakest part, the hope of eternal salvation; and for a sword, the word
   delivered by the Sprit, [847] which can enter into the innermost parts
   of the mind. Next follows an exhortation to mutual agreement, [848]
   which Christ seriously commended to his disciples when he was about to
   leave them: we ought not to have amongst us many masters, but only
   Jesus Christ: [849] all Christians were baptized into the same name,
   [850] therefore there ought to be no sects or divisions amongst them:
   [851] to which that there may be some remedy applied, those words of
   the apostle are suggested, to be temperate in our wisdom, [852]
   according to the measure of the knowledge God has afforded us: [853] if
   any have not so good an understanding of all things, [854] that we bear
   with their infirmities, that they may quietly, and without quarrelling,
   unite with us: [855] if any exceed the rest in understanding, it is
   reasonable he should exceed in goodwill towards them: [856] and as to
   those who in some things think otherwise than we do, [857] we are to
   wait till God shall make the hidden truth manifest unto them: in the
   mean time, we are to hold fast, and fulfil those things We are agreed
   in. [858] Now we know in part; [859] the time will come when all things
   shall be most certainly known. [860] But this is required of every one,
   that they do not unprofitably keep by them the talent committed to
   their charge, [861] but use their utmost endeavours to gain others unto
   Christ; [862] in order whereunto, we are not only to give them good and
   wholesome advice, [863] but to set before them an example of
   reformation of life; [864] that men may judge of the goodness of the
   master by the servant, and of the purity of the law by their actions.
   In the last place, we direct our discourse, as we did in the beginning,
   to common readers, beseeching them to give God the glory, if they
   receive any good from what has been said; [865] and if there be any
   thing they dislike, [866] let them impute it to the errors all mankind
   are prone to fall into; and to the place and time in which this was
   delivered, more according to truth than elaborately. [867]

BOOK I.

  CONCERNING THE CHOICE OF OUR OPINION AMONGST THE DIFFERENT SECTS OF
  CHRISTIANS.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. I. We must enquire amongst what Christians the true doctrine of Christ
  flourisheth most at this time.

   WHOEVER reads over the books of the New Testament, with a desire to
   come at the knowledge of the truth, and does not want judgment, will
   not be able to deny, bat that every one of the marks of truth, alleged
   by Hugo Grotius, in his second and third books, are to be found there.
   Wherefore, if he has any concern for a blessed immortality, he will
   apprehend it to be his duty to embrace what is proposed to him in those
   books as matter of belief; to do what he is commanded, and to expect
   what he is there taught to hope for. Otherwise, if any one should deny
   that he doubts of the truth of the Christian religion, and at the same
   time thinks the doctrines, precepts, and promises of it not fit to be
   believed or obeyed in every particular; such an one would be
   inconsistent with himself, and manifestly shew that he is not a sincere
   Christian. Now this is one of the precepts of Christ and his apostles,
   [868] that we should profess ourselves the disciples of Christ before
   men, if we would have him own us for his, when he shall pass sentence
   an the quick and dead at the last day; and if we do not, as we have
   denied him to be our Master before men, so he also, in that last
   assembly of mankind, will deny us to be his disciples before God. For
   Christ would not have those that believe on him to he his disciples
   privately; [869] as if they were ashamed of his doctrine, or as if they
   valued the kindnesses, threats, or punishments of men more than his
   precepts, and the promises of eternal life; but be Christians openly
   and before all the world, that they may invite other men to embrace the
   true religion, and render back to God that life which they received
   from him, [870] in the most exquisite torments, if it so seem good to
   him; whilst they openly profess that they prefer his precepts above all
   things. And thus St. Paul teaches us, that if we confess with our mouth
   the Lord Jesus, and believe in our heart that God hath raised him from
   the dead, we shall be saved: [871] for, says he, with the heart man
   believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made
   unto salvation; for the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him
   shall not be ashamed. Which being thus, it is his duty, wits thinks the
   Christian religion to be true, to discover and profess boldly, and
   without fear, this his sincere opinion, upon all occasions that offer
   themselves.

   And it is further necessary for him to enquire, if there be any of the
   same opinion with himself, and to maintain a particular peace and
   friendship with them; [872] for Christ tells us, this is one mark his
   disciples are to be known by, if they love one another, and perform all
   acts of love and kindness towards each other. Moreover, he exhorts them
   to have congregations in his name, that is, such as should be called
   Christian; [873] and promises that he would be present there, where two
   or three are met together upon that account; by this means, beside the
   mutual love and strict friendship of Christians united into one
   society, there is also a provision made for preserving their doctrines;
   [874] which can hardly continue, if every one has a private opinion to
   himself, and does not declare the sense of his mind to another; unless
   for his own advantage; for those things that are concealed, are by
   degrees forgotten, and come in time to be quite extinguished; but
   Christ would have his doctrine, and the churches which profess it, be
   perpetual, that it may not cease lo be beneficial to mankind.

   Wherefore, whoever derives his knowledge of the Christian religion
   front the New Testament, and thinks it true, such an one ought to make
   profession of it, and to join himself with those of the like
   profession. [875] But because there is not at this time (neither was
   there formerly) one sort of men only, or one congregation of such as
   are gathered together in the name of Christ; we are not therefore
   presently to believe that he is a true Christian, who desires to be
   called by that holy name; neither ought we to join ourselves, without
   examination, to any assembly who style themselves Christians. [876] We
   must consider, above all things, whether their doctrines agree with
   that form of sound words, which we have entertained in our mind, from
   an attentive reading of the New Testament; otherwise it may happen,
   that we may esteem that a Christian congregation, which is no further
   Christian than in name. It is, therefore, the part of a prudent man,
   not to enter himself into any congregation, at least for a continuance;
   unless it be such, in which he perceives that doctrine established,
   which he truly thinks to be the Christian doctrine; lest he should put
   himself under the necessity of saying or doing something contrary to
   what he thinks delivered and commanded by Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [868] Thus Christ saith, Matt. x. 32. "Whosoever therefore shall
   confess me (to be his Master) before men, him will I confess also (to
   be my disciple) before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever
   shall deny me (to be his Master) before men, him will I also deny (to
   be my disciple) before my Father which is in heaven." See also 2 Tim.
   ii. 12. Rev. iii. 5.

   [869] Therefore, he says, Matt. v. 14. "That his disciples are the
   light of the world; that a city set an a hill cannot be hid; neither is
   a candle lighted to be put under a bushel, but set in a candle- stick,
   that it may give light to all that are in the house," &c.

   [870] Luke xii. 4. Christ bids us, "not to be afraid of them that kill
   the body, and after that have no more that they can do;" and commands
   us "to fear him, which after we are killed can cast us into hell fire."
   And, moreover, be foretells all manner of evils to his disciples, Matt.
   x. 39. and following; and says, "that be who shall lose his life for
   his sake shall find it, (again)," &c. which precept, were particularly
   observed by the primitive Christians; who, for the testimony they gave
   to the doctrine of the Gospel, are called martyrs., that is, witnesses.

   [871] Rom. x. 9, 10, 11.

   [872] John xiii. 31, 35. "A new commandment give I unto yon, that ye
   love one another; that as I have loved you, so ye love one another: by
   this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one
   towards another." See 1 John ii. 7. iii. 11, 16, 23.

   [873] Matt. xviii. 19, 20.

   [874] Thus likewise all the philosophers transmitted their doctrine to
   posterity, by the help of schools in which it was taught; but the
   Christian churches, which are united by a much firmer and stronger
   bond, will, with more certainty and ease, propagate the doctrine they
   received from their Master, to the end of the world, which ma hardly be
   done without congregations. Pythagoras would Lave effected this, but in
   vain, because his doctrine had nothing divine in it. See Laërtius and
   Jamblichus.

   [875] See the epistles to Timothy and Titus, where they are commanded
   to found churches. And Heb. x. 25.

   [876] See 1 Thess. v. 21. But more expressly, 1 John iv. 1. "Beloved,"
   says he, "believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they be
   of God; for many false prophets are come into the world," &c.

  SECT. II. We are to join ourselves with those who are most worthy the name of
  Christians.

   AMONGST Christians that differ from each other, and not only differ,
   but (to their shame!) condemn one another, and with cruel hatred banish
   them their society; to agree to any of them without examination, or,
   according to their order, to condemn others without consideration,
   shews a man not only to be imprudent, but very rash and unjust. That
   congregation which rejects, though but in part, the true religion, (a
   representation of which he has formed in his mind), and condemns him
   that believes it, cannot be thought by such an one a truly Christian
   congregation in all things; nor can it prevail with him to condemn
   every man which that church shall esteem worthy to be condemned, and
   cast out of the society of Christians. Wherefore a wise and honest man
   ought above all things to examine, in these dissensions amongst
   Christians, who they are which best deserve the holy name of disciples
   of Christ, and to adhere to them. If any one should ask, what we are
   required to do by the Christian religion, supposing there were no such
   Christian society at all, amongst whom the true doctrine of Christ
   seems to be taught, and amongst whom there is not a necessity laid upon
   us of condemning some doctrine which we judge to be true: in this case,
   he who apprehends these errors, ought to endeavour to withdraw others
   from them; in doing of which, he must use the greatest candour, [877]
   joined with the highest prudence and constancy, lest he offend men
   without doing them any advantage, or lest all hopes of bringing them to
   truth and moderation be too suddenly cast off. In the mean time, we are
   to speak, modestly and prudently, what we think to be the truth; nor
   should any one be condemned by the judgment of another, as infected
   with error, who seems to think right. God has never forsaken, nor never
   will forsake, the Christian name so far, as that there shall remain no
   true Christians; or at least none such as cannot be brought back into
   the true way; with whom we may maintain a stricter society, if others
   will not return to a more sound opinion; and openly withdraw ourselves
   from the obstinate, (which yet we ought not to do without having tried
   all other means to no purpose); if it be not allowed you to speak your
   opinion fairly and modestly amongst them, and to forbear condemning
   those whom you think are not to be condemned. [878] The Christian
   religion forbids us speaking contrary to our mind, and falsifying and
   condemning the innocent; nor can he be unacceptable to God, who, out of
   respect and admiration of those divine precepts, can endure any thing
   rather than that they should be broke. Such a disposition of mind
   arising from a sense of our duty, and a most ardent love of God, cannot
   but be highly well-pleasing to him.

   Wherefore, amongst Christians who differ from each other, we are to
   examine which of them all think the most right; nor are we ever to
   condemn any but such as seem to us worthy to be condemned after a full
   examination of the matter; and we are to adhere to those who do not
   require any doctrines to be believed, which are esteemed by us to he
   false, nor any to be condemned which we think to be true. If we cannot
   obtain this of any Christian society, we, together with those who are
   of the same opinion with ourselves, ought to separate from them all,
   that we betray not the truth, and utter a falsity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [877] Here that precept of Christ's takes place, Matt. x. 16. where we
   are commanded "to be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves:" that Is,
   to be as far simple, as not to fall into imprudence; so wise as not to
   be crafty, and offend against sincerity; in which matter, there are but
   few who know how to steer their course in all things, between the rocks
   of imprudence and craftiness.

   [878] Whilst it is allowed to have a different opinion, and to profess
   our disagreement, there is no reason to depart from a public society,
   unless the fundamentals of Christianity be perverted by it; but where
   this is not allowed, and we cannot, without dissembling or denying the
   truth, live in it, then we ought to forsake that society; for it is not
   lawful to tell a lie, or to dissemble the truth, whilst a lie possesses
   the place of it, and claims to itself the honour due to truth only. If
   this be not done, "the candle is put under a bushel." Thus Christ did
   not depart from the assemblies of the Jews, neither did the apostles
   forsake them, so long as they were allowed to profess and teach the
   doctrine of their Master in them. See Acts xiii. 46.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. III. They are most worthy the name of Christians who, in the purest
  manner of all, profess the doctrine the truth of which hath been proved by
  Grotius.

   BUT it is a question of no small importance, and not easily to be
   resolved, who of all the societies of the present Christians have the
   truest opinions, and are most worthy of that name by which they are
   called. All the Christian churches, as well those who have long since
   separated from the Romish church, as the Romish church itself, do every
   one of them claim this to themselves; and if we lay aside all the
   reasons we ought no more to give credit to the one than to the other;
   for it wore a very foolish thing to suffer such a choice to be
   determined by chance, and to decide all controversies as it were by the
   cast of a die. [879]

   Now since Grotius has not proved the truth of the particular opinions
   of any present sect of Christians, but only of that religion which was
   taught mankind by Christ and his apostles; it follows, that that sect
   of Christians is to be preferred before all others, which does most of
   all defend those things which Christ and his apostles taught. In a
   word, that is in every particular truly the Christian religion, which,
   without any mixture of human invention, may be wholly ascribed to
   Christ as the author. To this agree all those arguments of truth, which
   are laid down in the second book Of the Truth of the Christian
   Religion; nor do they agree to any other any further than it agrees
   with that.

   If any one adds to, or diminishes from, the doctrine delivered by
   Christ, the more he adds or diminishes, so much the farther he goes
   from the truth. Now when I speak of the doctrine of Christ, I mean by
   it, the doctrine which all Christians are clearly agreed upon to be the
   doctrine of Christ, that is, which, according to the judgment of all
   Christians, is either expressly to be found in the books of the New
   Testament. or is by necessary consequence to be deduced from them only.
   As to those opinions, which, as some Christians think, were delivered
   by word of mouth, by Christ and his apostles, and derived to posterity
   in a different method, namely, either by tradition, which was done by
   speaking only; or which were preserved by some rite, as they imagine,
   and not set down in writing till a great while after; I shall pass no
   other judgment upon them here, but only this, that all Christians are
   not agreed upon them, as they are upon the books of the New Testament.
   I will not say they are false, unless theyare repugnant to right reason
   and revelation; but only that they are not agreed about the original of
   them, and therefore they are controverted amongst Christians, who in
   other respects agree in those opinions, the truth of which Grotius has
   demonstrated: for no wise man will allow us to depend upon a thing as
   certain, so long as it appears uncertain to us; especially if it be a
   matter of great moment. [880]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [879] See note the 9th, on Section ii.

   [880] This is the very thing St. Paul means, Rom. xiv. 23. where he
   teaches us that "whatsoever is not of faith is sin." On which place we
   have quoted the wards of Philo, out of his book concerning fugitives,
   ed. Paris, p. 469. "The best sacrifice is being quiet, and not meddling
   in those things which we are not persuaded of." And a little after; "To
   be quiet in the dark is most safe;" that is, where we are not agreed
   what is to be done.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. IV. Concerning the agreement and disagreement of Christians.

   THOUGH the controversies amongst Christians be very sharp, and managed
   with great heat and animosity, so that we may hear complaints made on
   all sides, of very obvious things being denied by some of the
   contending parties) yet notwithstanding this, there are some things so
   evident, that they are all agreed in them. And it is no mean argument
   of the truth of such, that they are allowed of by the common consent of
   those who are most set upon contention, and most blinded by passion. I
   do not mean by this, that all other things about which there is any
   contention are doubtful or obscure, because all Christians are not
   agreed in them. It may easily happen that that may be obscure to some,
   which would be very plain, if they were not hindered by passion; but it
   is hardly possible that the fiercest adversaries, who are most eager in
   disputing, should agree about an obscure point.

   First, then, all Christians now alive are agreed concerning the number
   and truth of the books of the New Testament; and though there be some
   small controversies amongst learned men about some epistles of the
   apostles, this is no great matter; [881] and they all acknowledge, that
   there is nothing but truth contained in them, and that the Christian
   doctrine is not at all altered, either by keeping or rejecting them.
   And this consent is of no small moment in a discourse about the
   undoubted original of a divine revelation, under the new covenant. For
   all other records or footsteps of ancient revelation, that have been
   preserved according to the opinions of some, are called in question by
   others.

   Further, Christians are agreed in many articles of faith, which they
   embrace, as things to be believed, practised, and hoped for. For
   instance; all who have any understanding, believe, (I shall mention
   only the principal heads here), I. That there is one God, eternal, all
   powerful, infinitely good and holy; in a word, endued with all the most
   excellent attributes, without the least mixture of imperfection: that
   the world and all things contained in it. and consequently mankind were
   created by this same God; and that by him all things are governed and
   directed with the highest wisdom. II. That Jesus Christ is the only Son
   of the same God; that he was born at Bethlehem, of the virgin Mary.
   without the knowledge of a man, in the latter part of the life of Herod
   the great, in the reign of Augustus Cæsar; that he was afterwards
   crucified and died in the reign of Tiberius, when Pontius Palate was
   governor of Judæa: that his life is truly related in the history of the
   Gospel; that he was therefore sent from the Father, that he might teach
   men the way to salvation, redeem them from their sins, and reconcile
   them to God by his death; and that this his mission was confirmed by
   innumerable miracles; that he died, as I before said, and rose again,
   and, after he had been very often seen by many, who had discoursed with
   him, and handled him, he was taken up into heaven, where he now reigns,
   and from whence he will one day return, to pass a final judgment,
   according to the laws of the Gospel, upon those who were then alive,
   and upon all them that are dead, when they shall be raised out of their
   graves; that all the things that he taught are to be believed, and all
   that he commanded are to be obeyed, whether they relate to the worship
   of God, or to temperance in restraining our passions, or to charity to
   be exercised towards others; that nothing could be appointed more holy,
   more excellent, more advantageous, and more agreeable to human nature,
   than these precepts; however, that all men (Jesus only excepted)
   violate them, and cannot arrive at salvation but through the mercy of
   God. III. That there is a Holy Ghost, who inspired the apostles of
   Jesus Christ, worked miracles to recommend them, and inclines the minds
   of pious men constantly to obey God, and supports them in the
   afflictions of life: that we are to give the same credit, and in all
   things to obey this Spirit speaking by the apostles, as we do the
   Father and the Son. IV. That the Christian church owes its original and
   preservation from the days of Christ to this time, to the Father, Son,
   and Holy Ghost; that all they who believe these things, and observe the
   precepts of the Gospel, shall obtain mercy of God, whereby they shall
   be made partakers of the resurrection, (if they be dead when Christ
   shall come), and of a happy life to eternity; on the contrary, all they
   who have diminished from the faith of the Gospel, and have not.
   observed its precepts, shall rise (if they be dead) to be punished, and
   their punishment shall be eternal death. V. Lastly, That Christians
   ought to profess all these things, both at their baptism, in which we
   declare, that we will lead a life free from the filthiness of iniquity,
   according to the direction of the Gospel; and also at the Lord's
   supper, in which we celebrate the death of Christ, according to his
   command, till he comes; and shew that we are willing to be esteemed his
   disciples, and the brethren of those who celebrate it in like manner;
   moreover, that those rites, if they are observed by us, as is
   reasonable, and are celebrated with a religious mind, convey heavenly
   grace, and the divine Spirit to us.

   These things, and others that are necessarily connected with them, (for
   it is not to our present purpose to mention them all particularly), all
   Christians believe; [882] nor is there any other difference but only
   this, that some add many other things to these, whereby they think the
   foregoing doctrines ought to be explained or enlarged with additions;
   and those such as they imagine were delivered to posterity, not by the
   writings of the apostles, but by the tradition and custom of the
   church, or by the writings of latter ages. Concerning these additions,
   I shall say nothing more than what I before advised; that Christians
   are not agreed upon them, as they are upon toe doctrines now explained,
   which are put beyond all manner of doubt by their own plainness, if we
   allow but the authority of the Holy Scripture, which no Christian in
   his senses can refuse.

   If any one weighs the arguments by which the truth of the Christian
   religion is proved, with these doctrines in his view, he will observe,
   (and if it be well observed, it will be of great use), that all the
   force of the argument is employed about these things, and not about
   those points which divide the Christian world, as was before hinted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [881] The epistle to the Hebrews, the second epistle of Peter, the two
   last epistles of John, the authors of which are disputed by learned
   men.

   [882] In the foregoing explication of the Christian doctrine, we have
   followed the method of that which they call the apostles creed, and
   have avoided all expressions, which have caused any controversies
   amongst Christians; because we are treating of those things in which
   they are agreed: and we do not for this ma-eon condemn as false any
   thing that may be added by way of explication or confirmation; on the
   contrary, we highly approve of their endeavours, who explain and
   confirm divine truths; and we doubt not but that many things have been
   already found, and may yet be found, to illustrate it. Tertullian
   judges rightly of this matter, in the first chapter of his book
   concerning veiling virgins: "The rule of faith is altogether one and
   the same, entirely firm and unalterable; namely, that we believe in one
   all-powerful God, the creator of the world, and in his Son Jesus
   Christ, who was born of the virgin Mary, was sacrificed under Pontius
   Pilate, was raised from the dead the third day, was taken up into
   heaven, sits now at the right hand of the Father, and will come to
   judge the quick and dead by the resurrection of the flesh. Keeping to
   this rule of faith, other matters of discipline (or doctrine) and
   behaviour admit of correction, viz. the grace of Cod operating and
   assisting to the end," &c.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. V. Whence every one ought to learn the knowledge of the Christian.

   IN this agreement and disagreement amongst Christians, prudent men will
   judge it most safe to take their knowledge of the Christian religion
   from the fountain, which is not in the least suspected, and whose
   streams all confess to be pure and undefiled. And this fountain is not
   the creed or the confession of faith of any particular church, but only
   the books of the New Testament, which all acknowledge to be genuine. I
   confess seine Christians do sometimes say, that those books cannot be
   understood but by the doctrine of their church; but others again deny
   it; and (to mention but this one thing) that opinion is very suspicious
   which depends only on the testimony of those that affirm it; and they
   such, whose chief interest it is that it should seem true. Others say,
   that there is need of the extraordinary assistance of the Holy Spirit,
   not only in order to the belief of the Scripture, (which may without
   any great difficulty be allowed), but also in order to understand the
   meaning of the words contained in it; which I do not see how it can be
   proved; but we will grant this also, provided they will acknowledge
   that all men, who read the books of the New Testament with a religious
   mind, intent upon the truth, are afforded this Spirit by the goodness
   of God; there is no need of contending for any thing more than this.
   Every one, therefore, may wisely and safely gather his knowledge of the
   Christian religion from these books; yet making use of those helps that
   are necessary or profitable for the understanding of such books; which
   we will not now enquire after.

   Whoever, therefore, believes that the revelation of the will of God
   made by Christ is faithfully related in the books of the New Testament,
   such an one must of necessity embrace ail things which he there meets
   with, according as he understands them, as matters of faith, practice,
   and hope; for Whoever believes in Christ, ought to receive with a
   religious mind, every thing which he thinks comes from him; he cannot
   defend himself with any excuse, whereby to admit some and reject
   others, of those things which he acknowledges to come from Christ. And
   such are those doctrines I before explained, and concerning which all
   Christians, as I said are agreed.

   As to the rest, about which they contest, since they are not so very
   plain, a religious and pious man may and ought to deliberate concerning
   them, and withhold his judgment till they appear more evident to him:
   for it is very imprudent to admit or reject any thing, before it
   sufficiently appears to be either true or false. Nor is eternal
   salvation, in the books of the New Testament. promised to any one who
   embraces this or that controverted opinion; but to hire who heartily
   receives in his mind, and expresses in his actions, the sum of the
   Christian religion, as we have described it.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VI. Nothing else ought to be imposed upon Christian, but what they can
  gather from the New Testament.

   This, therefore, is the only thing that can justly be imposed upon all
   Christians. [883] viz. that they embrace whatever they think is
   contained in the books of the New Testament, and obey those things
   which they find there commanded, and abstain from those things which
   are there forbidden; if any thing further be required of them as
   necessary, it is without any authority. For would any fair judge
   require a Christian to believe a doctrine came from Christ, which he
   does not find in the only faithful and undoubted records, in which all
   are agreed the revelation of Christ is derived down to us? Let other
   doctrines be true; let us take this for granted a little while; they
   cannot however be esteemed as true by him, who, amongst the different
   sorts of Christians, follows the middle way, and allows of no certain
   record of the revelation of Christ, but the books of the New Testament.
   Whilst he believes this, nothing else can justly he required of him;
   and he will believe this, till it shall be made appear to him by plain
   arguments, that the knowledge of Christianity is safely to he had
   somewhere else, which I believe will never be done.

   If any one, therefore, attempts to take away from Christians the books
   of the New Testament, or to add to them such things as do not appear to
   be true, we are by no means to hearken to such an one; [884] because he
   requires that of us, which no prudent man will allow, viz. that we
   should believe that which we are not certain of, or neglect that which
   all own to be the sure record of the revelation of the Gospel. There is
   no need of examining all controversies singly, and one by one; which
   would be an endless thing, and cannot be done but by very learned men,
   who have abundance of leisure. Whoever imposes any thing upon us, as
   necessary to be believed, which we cannot believe, he derives us from
   himself; because belief cannot be extorted by force; nor will any one
   who fears God, and is a lover of truth, suffer himself to profess what
   he does not believe, for the sake of another.

   But they who differ from this, object, that if every one be left to
   their own liberty, in judging of the meaning of the books of the New
   Testament, there will be as many religions as there are men and truth,
   which is but one, will immediately be oppressed by a multitude of
   errors. But I think, that before an opinion, which is established upon
   Solid arguments, be opposed by objections, the foundation upon which it
   is built ought to be overthrown; because so long as that remains firm,
   the whole superstructure raised Upon it cannot be shaken; as we see
   here. For, if any inconvenience should follow from what has been said,
   it is nevertheless true, till it be made appear not to be fixed on a
   firm bottom. But to pass by this now; it is false that the revelation
   of the New Testament is so obscure, that the sum of the Christian
   religion cannot be truly learned from it, by any one of a sound mind,
   who is desirous of truth. It is evident from experience, that it may be
   truly learned from thence; for all Christians. as has been already
   shewn, agree in the principal parts of it; which was observed by
   Grotius, book II. sect. xvii. We have no regard here to a few simple or
   wicked men; since whole societies of Christians, who, in other
   respects, out of their too great eagerness of contention, are apt to
   differ from one another, and to run into the contrary extremes, are
   here agreed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [883] To this belongs what Christ saith, Matt. xxiii. ver. 8. and
   following: "Be ye not called Rabbi, for one is your Master, even
   Christ, and all ye are brethren. And call no man your Father upon the
   earth, for one is your father which is in heaven; neither be ye called
   Masters, for one is your Master, even Christ." See also James iii. 1.
   To the same purpose, Rev. iii. 7. where Christ Is said to have the "key
   of David," which is thus described, "which opens (namely heaven) and no
   one shuts, and which shutteth and no one openeth." If we are to believe
   Christ only, and there remains no other certain record of the
   revelation made by Christ but the New Testament; it is manifest from
   hence, that in matters of faith we ought to give credit only to these
   books.

   [884] To this relates that saying of Paul, Gal. i. 8. "If we, or an
   angel from heaven preach any other thing for the Gospel, than that
   Gospel we have preached to you, let him be accursed." And indeed it is
   no man's business to add any thing to the Gospel, an necessary; nor to
   diminish any thing from it, as unprofitable.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VII. The providence of God in preserving the Christian doctrine is very
  wonderful.

   In this particular, as in numberless others which relate to the
   government of human affairs, the Divine Providence is very wonderful;
   which notwithstanding so many differences, as were of old, and are at
   this day amongst Christians, yet hath preserved the books of the New
   Testament entire, even to our times; that the Christian doctrine may be
   recovered out of them as often as it happens to be corrupted. Nor has
   it only delivered down to us this treasure entire, hot also in the
   midst of the hottest differences, has so secured the Christian doctrine
   itself, that the sum of religion has never been forgot amongst
   Christians.

   No inconsiderable number of Christians at this day contend, that many
   errors, in former ages, crept by degrees in amongst the sects of
   Christians; which when others denied, in the sixteenth century after
   the birth of Christ, that famous separation in the west was made upon
   that account, by which Christianity was divided into two parts, not
   very unequal. Yet in those ages, whose errors are reproved by that part
   of the Christians which made the separation I now mentioned, and whose
   faults were highly. aggravated by both sides, and that not without
   grounds, the sum of the Christian religion before drawn up by us was
   all along maintained. There is no age so thick clouded with ignorance
   and vice, [885] but the fore-mentioned articles of faith may easily be
   collected from their writings that remain. It must not, indeed, be
   dissembled, that many things foreign and unknown to the books of the
   New Testament have been added and thrust into the Christian theology;
   whence it is, that the true wheat of the sower in the Gospel, hath not
   brought forth so much fruit as it would otherwise have done, had the
   ground been cleared of thorns and hurtful and unprofitable weeds. Many
   vices and faults were not only admitted or borne wills, but applauded
   also. Yet was not sound doctrine ever the less safe, whilst the books
   of the New Testament remained, and whilst Christians were endued with
   common sense; for by this means, very eminent men were often raised up,
   who corrected the errors and vices of their age, and ventured to oppose
   the torrent. Thus, according to the promise of Christ, God hindered the
   gates of death from prevailing against the church; [886] that is, did
   not suffer every society wherein the Christian doctrine was preserved
   entire to be extinguished; though sometimes they were blended and
   obscured with foreign and contrary opinions, and sometimes were more
   sincere and pure. Wherefore, (to observe this by the way), unless this
   doctrine was really sent to us from God, it could never have escaped
   out of such a deluge of vices and errors, but would at length have been
   overwhelmed by the changeableness and folly of human nature, and have
   entirely perished.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [885] None have a worse report than the tenth and eleventh centuries,
   as is granted by those who stick to the see of Rome, as much as by
   those who have made a separation front it. Yet if any one, for his own
   satisfaction, will read amongst the books of the fathers, the writings
   of those centuries, he may easily collect all the doctrines mentioned
   in the fourth section. At the beginning of the twelfth century, lived
   Bernard, abbot of the monastery of Claravallis, whose learning, piety,
   and constancy, are commended by very many, and whose writings were
   often read in the following ages, and never condemned. Now from thence
   an entire body of the Christian doctrine may easily be collected: and
   it is no less certain of the following centuries down to the sixteenth.
   Nor is there any doubt of those that follow.

   [886] So we explain pu'las a'dou, because neither that word, nor the
   Hebrew, s'l Scheol, which answers to it, ever signifies in the sacred
   writings, an evil spirit, but only the grave, or the state of the dead,
   as Grotius and others have observed. Therefore, this one thing may be
   gathered from this place, that it will never happen that the Christian
   church should entirely perish, or that there should be no society left,
   amongst whom the sum of the doctrine of the Gospel should not remain.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. VIII. An answer to that question, Why God permits differences and errors
  to arise amongst Christians.

   PERHAPS some may here object against what has been said, that the
   Divine Providence would have better consulted the preservation of the
   Christian doctrine, if it had prevented the errors that are and have
   been amongst Christians, and maintained truth and constant agreement,
   which is the companion of it, amongst them, by its omnipotence. But it
   is not for us to instruct God how be ought to direct himself in the
   government of human affairs, that they might be better. On the
   contrary, it is our duty to think that God had very wise reasons for
   suffering what he did suffer, though we cannot so much as guess at what
   they are. But if any probable reasons can be given for the things that
   are done, we ought to believe, that God permits those things which
   daily come to pass, to be done for these or more weighty reasons.

   To make a conjecture from the reason of things; we are above all things
   sure, that the design of God was to create men free, and to suffer them
   to continue so to the end; [887] that is, not so good, that they must
   necessarily continue good always; nor so bad that they must of
   necessity always submit to vice; but mutable, so as that they might
   pass from vice to virtue, and again from virtue to vice; and this with
   more or less ease, according as they had longer or shorter time given
   up themselves to virtue or vice. Such we see the Hebrew people of old
   were, and such were the Christians afterwards. Neither of them were
   drawn by an irresistible force either to virtue or vice; but only
   restrained by laws, which proposed reward to the good, and punishment
   to the bad; to which were added, by the Divine Providence, various
   incitements to virtue, and discouragements from vice; but yet neither
   of them deprived man of his native liberty, whereby he had a power of
   obeying or disobeying God, as is evident from experience; for there
   were always good and bad, though the divine laws prescribed virtue, and
   prohibited vice equally to all. That this would be so amongst
   Christians, Christ has plainly signified in two parables, the one of
   the tares which the enemy sowed, after the wheat was sown; [888] the
   other of the net, which took good and bad fish alike; [889] by which he
   signified that there would always be in the church a mixture of good
   and bad Christians; whence it follows, that he very well saw the evils
   that would always be in the Christian church. Moreover, Paul tells the
   Christians, that there must be sects amongst Christians, that they who
   are approved may be made manifest. [890] And, indeed, unless there had
   been differences among Christians concerning doctrine, there had been
   no room left for choice, and for that sort of virtue, by which truth is
   preferred to all other things. [891] Therefore, even is this particular
   also, the divine wisdom shines bright; which caused an excellent virtue
   to flourish out of the midst of the vices of men.

   If any one should object here, as some do, that it were better there
   were no such kind of virtue, [892] than that there should be vices
   contrary to it, form whence so many horrid crimes, so many calamities,
   and so great miseries should befal mankind, and such heavy punishment
   attend them after this life: to this we answer, that these evils were
   not of such a consideration with God, that upon their account be should
   not give an instance of his power in creating free agents. Unless this
   had been done no creature would have believed that it could have been
   done. Nay, God himself would not have been thought to be free, unless
   he himself had planted this opinion of himself by his omnipotence in
   the minds of men, which otherwise they never could have conceived from
   his works. Nor could he have been worshipped, if he had been thought to
   do, or to have done all things, not out of his free goodness, but by a
   certain fatal necessity; unless by a fatal worship also, and such an
   one as is not at all free. The vices and calamities of this or the
   other life are not comparable to so great an evil, as the supposing God
   to be ignorant of any thing; for if we find any difficulty about them,
   we ought to consider that God is most good, just, powerful, and wise,
   and will not act otherwise than agreeable to his perfections; and will
   easily find a way, and go in it, whereby to clear those things which
   seem to us to be entangled; and to shew to all intelligent creatures,
   that nothing was done by him which ought not to have been done. In the
   mean time, till that day-spring, in which all the clouds of our
   ignorance shall be dispersed, be hath given us such experience of
   himself, and such instances of his perfections; on the account of
   which, we may and ought entirely to confide in him, and patiently to
   wait for what he will have come to pass. More might be said on this
   matter, but that it would divert us from that end we are tending to,
   and carry us to what does not belong to this place.

  SECT. IX. They profess and teach the Christian doctrine in the purest manner
  of all, who propose those things only as necessary to be believed, practised,
  or hoped for, which Christians are agreed in.

   TO pass by these things, therefore, and return to the choice of our
   opinion amongst the different sects of Christians; nothing seems
   possible to be done more safe and wise, in this state of affairs, than
   for us to join ourselves with that sect of Christians which
   acknowledges the New Testament only for the rule of their faith,
   without any mixture of human decrees; and who think it sufficient that
   every one should learn their form of faith from thence, conform their
   lives to its precepts, and expect the promises which are there made.
   Which if it be done sincerely, and without any dissimulation, the end
   of such a search will be that very form of sound words, which we have
   made appear to have remained the same, amidst so many and so great
   storms of errors and dissensions, during the passing of so many ages,
   and the changes of kingdoms and cities. In it are contained all things
   that are necessary to faith and practice; to which if any one would
   have any other things added it may lawfully be done, according to the
   circumstances of time and place; provided they be not imposed as
   necessary, (which belongs only to the supreme Lawgiver), [893] nor
   contrary doctrines to these obtruded.

   Christians disposed in the manner we have been speaking of, ought not
   to submit their neck to the yoke of human opinions, nor to profess they
   believe what they do not believe: nor to do that which they cannot
   approve in their own minds, because they think in contrary to the
   precepts of Christ. Therefore, wherever that Christian liberty, which I
   have now mentioned, is not allowed, they must of necessity depart
   thence; not as if they condemned all that are of a different opinion
   from themselves, but because every one is absolutely obliged to follow
   the light of his own mind, and not that of another's; and to do that
   which he judges best to be done, and to avoid that which he thinks to
   be evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [893] See what Paul says upon this matter, Rom. xiv. 1. and so on,
   where he speaks of those who impose rites on others; or who condemn
   those that observe them which right he declares to belong to Christ
   only. And to this may be referred what St. James says, chap. iv.12.
   "There is but one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy."
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. X. All prudent persons ought to partake of the sacrament with those who
  require nothing else of Christians but what every one finds in the books of
  the New Testament.

   SINCE Christ has appointed two signs or symbols of Christianity,
   baptism and the Lord's supper, it was not, indeed, in our power to
   receive baptism where we judged the Christian religion to be most pure,
   because we were baptized very young: but since we do not come to the
   other sacrament till we are of riper age, we may distinguish that
   society of Christians, in which we are willing to be partakers of it;
   which if we have not already done, we ought to do it now.

   There are some who make the sacrament (which according to Christ's
   institution, is a token of that peace and love which is between
   Christians) a mark of distinction; [894] and exclude from it all those
   who do not think it safe to submit to any yoke but what Christ has laid
   upon them; or to receive any things as necessary to be believed,
   practised, or hoped for, but those which they are verily persuaded are
   contained in the books of the New Testament; and who are therefore very
   cautious of admitting any other forms of faith besides that which we
   have mentioned. It is but just and reasonable, indeed, that we should
   maintain peace with such men as these; but for receiving the sacrament
   upon this condition, that we should embrace any other rule of faith and
   practice, beside the books of the New Testament, and think all those
   excluded the church who will not admit them; this a religious and
   prudent man will think very wicked. [895] But all they who are true
   lovers of the Gospel, safely may and ought to approach the sacramental
   table of them who know no other laws of obtaining eternal salvation,
   but those laid down by Christ and his apostles in the books of the
   Gospel covenant, as every one can understand them. For whoever
   acknowledges the books of the New Testament for the only rule of faith
   and practice; who sincerely conform their lives to that rule; in a
   word, who allow of no idolatry, nor treat others ill, that they may
   profess they believe certain doctrines which they do not believe; all
   such are received by these, and also invited to this table. It is
   manifest, indeed, that communion cannot be maintained with him who
   makes use of force to impose his opinions upon others; who worships
   other gods, besides the true God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; or
   who by his conversation shews that he makes light of the precepts of
   the Gospel; or who owns any other laws of salvation, than those wrote
   in the books of the eternal covenant: but he who behaves himself the
   direct contrary, is worthy to have all Christians maintain communion
   with him, and to be preferred to all the rest who are of a different
   opinion. No mortal man, nay, no angel, can impose any new Gospel upon
   Christians, to be believed by them: [896] now according to this Gospel,
   he is a true disciple of Christ, who from his heart believes his
   doctrines, and his only, so as to obey it the best he is able,
   according to the infirmity of this life; who worships one God, loves
   his neighbour as himself, and lives temperately in respect to all
   things. If any thing be diminished from this the laws of the covenant,
   which none but God can abate any thing of, are maimed: and if any thing
   be added, it is an useless yoke, which none ought to impose on
   Christians. Such laws can be received from God only, who alone is the
   determiner of eternal salvation.

   Perhaps some may here ask me by what name these Christian societies,
   which I have now described, may be distinguished? But it signifies
   nothing what denomination they go under: the reader may conceive all
   churches to be meant in which what I have said is to be found.
   Wheresoever that only rule of faith, and that liberty which I have
   described, is, there they may be assured true Christianity is, and they
   need not enquire for a name, which makes nothing to the purpose. I
   believe there are many such societies; and I pray the good and great
   God that there may be more and more every day; that at length his
   kingdom may come into all the earth, and that mankind may obey it only.

   bread." Which words shew, that by the sacrament is signified the mutual
   agreement of Christians; and so the best interpreters understand it.

  SECT. XI. Concerning church-government.

   A SMALL difficulty may here be objected to us, which arises from the
   form of church-government and discipline, commonly called
   ecclesiastical: for no society, such as a church is; can subsist
   without order, and therefore there must be some form of government
   appointed. Now it is debated amongst Christians, what form of
   government was appointed by the apostles; for that seems preferable to
   all others, which was appointed from the beginning; and therefore of
   two churches, in which the Gospel is taught with equal purity and
   sincerity in all other respects, that is to be preferred, in which the.
   form of government is apostolical; though government without the thing
   itself, that is, the Gospel, is only the faint shadow of a church.

   There are now two forms of government, one of which is that wherein the
   church acts under one bishop, who alone has the right of ordaining
   presbyters, or the inferior order of the Gospel ministers; the other is
   that, where the church is governed by an equality of presbyters, joined
   with some lay persons of prudence and honesty. They who without
   prejudice have read over the most ancient Christian writers that now
   remain, very well know that the former manner of discipline, which is
   called episcopal, such as that in the south part of Great Britain,
   prevailed every where in the age immediately after the apostles; whence
   we may collect that it is of apostolical institution. [897] The other,
   which they call presbyterian, was instituted in many places of France,
   Switzerland, Germany, and Holland, by those who in the sixteenth
   century made a separation from the church of Rome.

   They who read with attention the histories of that century, are fully
   satisfied that this latter form of government was introduced for this
   reason only, because the bishops would not allow to them, who contended
   that the doctrine and manners of Christians stood in need of necessary
   amendment, that those things should be reformed, which they complained
   were corrupted. Otherwise, if the bishops every where at that time had
   been willing to do of their own accord, what was not long after done in
   England; that government had prevailed even to this day amongst all
   those who separated from the Romish church; and the numberless
   calamities which happened, when all things were disturbed and
   confounded, had then been prevented. For if we would judge of the
   matter truly, there was no other reason for changing the government but
   this, that whilst the ancient government remained, nothing could be
   procured, however just in itself. Therefore, the presbyterian form is
   appointed in many places; which after it was once done, was so much for
   the interest of all them who presided in the state affairs in those
   places, and is so at this time, not to have it changed, that it must of
   necessity continue; unless any one had rather, upon that account, that
   all the dominions in which it prevails should be put into the most
   dangerous disorders; which prudent men will never allow, nor is it to
   be wished. The form of government was appointed of old to preserve the
   Christian doctrine, and not to disturb the commonwealth, which can
   scarce happen without endangering the religion itself.

   Wherefore prudent men, though they above all things wish for the
   apostolical form of church-government, and that it might be every where
   alike; yet they think things had better be left in the state in which
   they now are, than venture the hazards which always attend the attempt
   of new things. In the mean time, they that are wise, will by no means
   hate, reproach, nor condemn one another upon that account, as the most
   violent men are apt to do; as if eternal salvation depended upon either
   form, which do not seem to be taught any where in the apostolical
   writings, nor can it be gathered from the nature of the Christian
   religion.

  SECT. XII. The ancient church-government was highly esteemed by Grotius,
  without condemning others.

   WHOEVER reads over the works of that great man, Hugo Grotius, and
   examines into his doctrine and practice, will find that be had
   entertained in his mind that form of sound words, the truth of which he
   has proved; [898] nor did he esteem any thing else as true religion;
   but after he had diligently read the writings of Christian antiquity,
   and understood that the original form was that of episcopacy, he highly
   approved of it in the manner it is maintained in England, as appears
   from his own express words, which we have wrote down at the bottom of
   the page. [899]

   Therefore, it is not to be doubted but if it had been in his power, and
   he had not been so vehemently tossed to and fro by adversity, and
   exasperated and vexed by the baseness and reproachfulness of his
   enemies, at whose bands he did not deserve it, he would have joined
   himself with those who maintained the ancient form of discipline, and
   required nothing further than what has been already said, the truth of
   which he has proved excellently well; the arguments for which practice
   appear to us to be so weighty, that we have thought good to add them to
   this little treatise.

   [898] See amongst other things, "The institution of children that are
   baptized," which the author himself translated out of Dutch verse into
   Latin, in his theological works, tom. iv. page 629. And in his latter
   works, he often affirms, that whatever is necessary to salvation, is
   plainly enough contained in the New Testament. See his Annotations on
   Cassander's Consultation, towards the end, where he speaks of the
   sufficiency and plainness of the Scripture. Which being granted, it is
   manifest from thence, that the sum of the Christian religion, as it was
   before produced by us, may be collected thence by any one.

   [899] In his annotations on the consultation of Cassander, art. xiv.
   "Bishops are the heads of the presbyters, and that pre-eminence was
   foreshewn in Peter, and was appointed by the apostles wherever it could
   be done, and approved by the Holy Ghost, in the Revelations. Wherefore,
   as it was to be wished that that superiority were appointed every
   where," &c. See also what follows concerning the ecclesiastical power,
   and the discussion of Rivetus's Apology, p. 714. col. 2. Other things
   are also alleged in the epistles added to this little treatise.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. XIII. An exhortation to all Christians who differ from each other, not
  to require of one another any points of doctrine, but such as every one finds
  in the New Testament, and have always been believed.

   SEEING these things are so, we cannot but earnestly exhort all
   Christians who differ in opinions, to remember that that only is the
   true sum and substance of the Christian religion, the truth of which
   can be proved by the arguments Grotius has alleged; and not those
   controverted points which each side deny, and which have been the cause
   of so many evils: further no one that reads over the New Testament with
   a religious mind, and meditates upon it, can be persuaded that there is
   any other lawgiver but Christ, upon whose law eternal life depends;
   [900] nor that any one who is so disposed, can or ought to persuade
   himself to admit of any thing as necessary to salvation, beside what is
   the doctrine of Christ and his apostles; or to believe that to be true,
   which he thinks is contrary to it: wherefore, there is none more
   certain and present remedy of their differences than this; that nothing
   be imposed upon Christians, but those things which every one is fully
   satisfied in his own mind are revealed; nor need we fear any
   inconvenience from hence, since it is evident, from the experience of
   all ages past from Christ to this time, that the sum of the Christian
   religion before laid down was never rejected by any. If this one thing
   only were at this time required of all Christians as necessary, all
   their differences would immediately cease; [901] and whatever
   disagreement remained in opinions, it would not belong to the body of
   the church, but to private persons; every one of which must render an
   account of their conscience to God. If they did but once understand
   that they were agreed in the principal matters, as they really are
   agreed, and would bear with one another in other things, and would not
   endeavour to bring over others in their opinion or rites, by force, or
   other wicked arts, this would be the only agreement that can be
   expected on earth. In this ignorance and want of knowledge in mankind,
   [902] hindered by so many passions, no prudent person can expect that
   all can be brought, either by force or reason, to think and do the same
   thing. The more generous and understanding minds can never approve of
   force, which is the attendant of lies, and not of truth; nor do they
   who are less learned, or who are blinded by passion, or the prejudices
   of education, or any other thing, as the far greatest part will always
   be, fully understand the force of reason; nor in the mean time are they
   to be compelled to do or speak contrary to what they think. Let them
   who preside in the government of the church think it sufficient. that
   men, through the help of the immortal God, believe the Gospel; that
   that faith alone is to be preached as necessary; that the precepts of
   it are alone to be obeyed, and salvation to be expected from the
   observation of its laws; and all things will go well. Whilst human
   things are made equal with divine, and doubtful things, to say no worse
   of them, equalled with those that are certain, there can be no end of
   contention, no hopes of peace; which all pious men ought with their
   most earnest wishes, to desire of the great God, and to endeavour to
   promote as far as in their power.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [900] The words of James, chap. iv. 12. quoted in sect. i. are very
   express in this matter; where more is said relating hereto. Besides the
   thing itself speaks here; because amongst the different sects of
   Christians, none of them believe their adversaries' authority.

   [901] It This was the opinion of James I. king of Great Britain, if we
   may give credit to Isaac Casaubon, who has these words in his answer to
   cardinal Perron's epistle, on the third observation, pag. 30. edit.
   Loud. 1612. "It is most truly written, in the explication of those
   things which are absolutely necessary, that it is the king's opinion
   that the number of those things which are absolutely necessary to
   salvation is not great. Wherefore, his majesty thinks, that there is no
   shorter way to enter in an agreement, than by carefully separating
   those things that are necessary from those that are not; and that their
   whole care be employed in agreeing about the necessary things; and that
   in those things that are not necessary, there be an allowance made for
   Christian liberty," &c.

   [902] It was very well said by Hilary, concerning the trinity. b. x.
   ch. 70. "that God does not invite us to happiness through difficult
   questions, confound us with various sorts of eloquence. Eternity is
   plain and easy to us, to believe that God raised up Jesus from the
   dead, and to confess him to be Lord."

  AGAINST INDIFFERENCE IN THE CHOICE OF OVR RELIGION.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. I. That we ought to have a love for truth in all things, but more
  especially in such as are of great moment.

   I THINK that person judged very rightly, whoever be was, that said,
   there is an eternal alliance betwixt truth and the mind of man; [903]
   the effects of which, though they may sometimes be, as it were,
   suspended or discontinued for a while, by reason of the inconstancy and
   affections of human nature, yet the alliance itself can never be
   entirely broke. For nobody is desirous of being deceived; nay, there is
   nobody but had rather know the truth in any matter whatsoever, but
   especially in any matter of moment, than be mistaken, though it be only
   in things of mere speculation. We are naturally delighted with truth,
   and have as natural an aversion to error; and if we knew any way in
   which we could certainly arrive at truth, we should most readily enter
   into it. Hence it is, that there always have been found very eminent
   men, whom all the world have most highly applauded, because they spent
   their whole lives in the pursuit of truth. There hove been, and are at
   this day, innumerable natural philosophers and geometricians, who have
   taken incredible pains to come at truth; and who affirm, that they
   never feel so great pleasure as when they find out a truth which they
   have long been in search after. [904] So that the love and the
   knowledge of truth may very justly be reckoned amongst the many other
   things that men excel brutes in.

   But all truths are not of the same moment, and many theoretic notions,
   though they be true, may be laid aside, because little or no advantage
   can be had from them, and therefore it is not worth while to be at much
   pains about them; but, on the other hand, there are some truths of so
   great moment, that we justly think them worth purchasing at any rate.
   Of this sort are all those that relate to our well-being and happiness;
   the knowledge of which is most valued by every body, and most
   diligently pursued by them. To which if we add, that the consequence of
   a well-spent and happy life, (and we must always allow, that what is
   good, that is, agreeable to truth, is also an ingredient of happiness),
   during our short stay here, will be an eternal happiness hereafter, as
   all Christians of every sect whatsoever profess to believe; we cannot
   but own, that the knowledge of the way by which we may arrive at such
   happiness cannot be purchased at too dear a rate.

     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. II. Nothing can be of greater moment than religion; and therefore we
  ought to use our utmost endeavours to come at the true knowledge of it.

   OUR business is not now with such persons as despise all religion;
   these have been sufficiently confuted by that great man Hugo Grotius,
   in the foregoing books; which whosoever has read, with a mind really
   desirous of coming at the truth, can have no doubt but that there is a
   God who would be worshipped by men, and, as things now are, with that
   very worship which is commanded by Christ; and that he has promised
   everlasting happiness, after this mortal life, to all who thus worship
   him.

   Thus much being allowed, nobody can doubt but that religion is a matter
   of the highest concern; and, therefore, as we see that Christians do
   not consist of one entire body, we ought to endeavour to find out which
   sect of them is most agreeable, in its doctrines and precepts, to those
   which are left us by Jesus Christ; for we cannot have an equal regard
   for them all, because some of them are so very different from others
   both in doctrine and worship, that they accuse one another of the
   greatest errors, and of having corrupted the divine worship; nay, some
   of them speak of the rest as absolutely excluded eternal life. Now if
   this could be made plainly appear, without doubt, we ought to withdraw
   ourselves from all other sects, as soon as we can, and join with that
   alone which with truth makes such objections against all others. For
   not only this present short life lies at stake, which is subject to
   innumerable evils and misfortunes, let us live how we will; but we
   render ourselves liable to the punishments which God has threatened to
   those who do not believe the Gospel, and hazard that happiness which
   has no defect, and will have no end. Yet there are some men, not indeed
   very learned, nor very much addicted to reading the scriptures
   seriously, in order to judge of the divisions amongst Christians, and
   to find out on which side the truth lies; for they have no concern at
   all for that; but their notion of these divisions is, that they think
   it all one, let their opinions be what they will, and that it is the
   same thing whatever worship they follow: they imagine it to be quite
   indifferent what party of Christians we really join ourselves with, or
   indeed only profess to join ourselves with. I do not now speak of the
   common people only; there are kingdoms, in which not only the common
   people, but the magistrates and nobility have separated from the see of
   Rome, and yet in a very short time, upon having a new king, have
   returned to it again; and then after this, have been assisting to the
   supreme power in opposing the same see. In the reign of Henry VIII. of
   England, there were many acts made not only by the king, but agreed to
   by the parliament, against the see of Rome, which king Henry was angry
   with, for a reason that few people approved of. After his death, when
   his son, Edward VI. joined in with that party, who had not only
   renounced all the authority of the see of Rome, as his father had done,
   but also had embraced other opinions, which were condemned by that see;
   they likewise openly declared that they approved of them. A little
   after king Edward died, when queen Mary, a great bigot to the pope of
   Rome, succeeded her brother; this very nobility assisted this queen to
   oppress that party who had despised the authority of the pope, and were
   in so flourishing a condition when Edward was king. Some time after,
   upon the death of Mary, queen Elizabeth succeeded, who was of the same
   sect with her brother Edward, and so strongly established it by a long
   reign, that it remains to this day upon the same foundation on which it
   was then built. Whoever peruses the history of those times, will see
   how fluctuating the nobility of that nation were; and he will be hardly
   able to persuade himself, but that they were of the same mind with
   those that believe it to be all one with respect to their eternal
   salvation, what sect of Christians they join themselves with. I agree
   with those who ascribe these changes in a good measure to fear; but
   when I consider the constancy, courage, and contempt of death, which we
   so frequently see in the English nation I can hardly persuade myself,
   but that the love of this present life, and an indifference about
   religion, were the principal causes of these several changes.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. III. That an indifference in religion is in its own nature unlawful,
  forbidden by the laws of God, and condemned by all sects of Christians.

   FOR any one to think that religion is one of those things that are of
   an indifferent nature; so that we may change it as we do our clothes;
   or at least, that we may profess or deny it just as the times change,
   is a most heinous crime; as will appear by many reasons, the principal
   of which we will produce from the nature of the thing, the laws of God,
   and the consent of all Christian nations.

   First, to tell a lie is a very dishonest thing., especially in an
   affair of any great moment, when it is not so much as allowed in
   trifling matters, unless perhaps in such particulars where a lie is
   upon the whole more advantageous than the truth. But, in the affair of
   religion, it must be a very grievous fault for men to lie, or even to
   dissemble; because thereby they do all in their power to confirm a lie,
   in a thing of the greatest importance; to stifle truth, which is
   contrary to it, and to condemn it to perpetual obscurity. It is the
   worst example that can be sot, especially in persons advanced to any
   dignity, which the people of a lower rank are but too apt to imitate;
   whence it comes to pass, that they are not only offenders themselves,
   but they cause others to offend also by their example; which has the
   greatest influence over the common people, because they give a much
   greater attention to the actions of those they have a great respect for
   than to their words.

   It is also a very dishonourable thing, and altogether unworthy a man of
   courage, to tell a lie for the sake of this short life, and to choose
   to displease God rather than men. For this reason the most eminent
   philosophers chose rather to expose themselves to certain death, than
   to do a thing which they thought was displeasing to the Deity; as we
   see in the instance of Socrates, who chose rather to drink a dose of
   poison, than to leave off the study of philosophy, which be had so much
   accustomed himself to, and live. [905] Other philosophers also chose
   rather to go to the plough, than give up those notions which they
   believed to be true, and had undertaken to defend. [906] And there have
   been such valiant men amongst the heathens, who by their good lives
   severely reproached the age they lived in; and thought it much inure
   preferable to die, than to flatter tyrants, and thereby forsake the
   true way of life; of which were Thraseas Pætus [907] and Helvidius
   Priscus, [908] who chose to die rather than to dissemble or approve of
   the vices and wicked actions of the Roman emperors. Now if this was
   done by men who had but faint hopes of another and more happy life
   hereafter, how much more are they obliged to do it, who have so much
   plainer and more certain hope of au eternal happiness afforded them!

   All ages have seen and commended such as have, with an intrepid mind,
   submitted to death for the sake of their earthly country. Now, after
   this, who is it but must applaud all those who prefer a heavenly
   country to an earthly one; and that eternal life which the Scriptures
   have revealed to us, to a temporal one? Who can forbear despising those
   mean creatures that choose to preserve such a life as they have in
   common with brute beasts, and which they must lose in a short time,
   rather than to take the first opportunity of obtaining a life that can
   never be lost? We see soldiers, with great bravery, face the most
   imminent dangers, in order to obtain the favour of kings or princes to
   themselves, or their families after them; and rejoice within themselves
   that they got such wounds as they must in a very short time die of.
   Nay, even hired troops themselves will fight very valiantly, and
   venture their lives for those who employ them, though it be but for
   very small wages; and yet there are some who will not expose themselves
   to any hazard, I do not say of their lives, but of the loss of their
   goods, or of their uncertain dignities, for the defence of truth, which
   will last to eternity, is most acceptable to God, and has the highest
   reward annexed to it.

   Therefore, what Christ has commanded us in this respect is in the
   following words: Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I
   confess also before my Father which is in heaven; but whosoever shall
   deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in
   heaven. [909] In which words be tells us, that he will own all those
   for his disciples, and will give them eternal life at the day of
   judgment, who have not dissembled his doctrine, either in their deeds
   or words. He does, indeed, in another place declare, that this ought to
   be done with prudence, when he says, That we should not cast pearls
   before swine. [910] But this prudence does not extend so far as to
   allow us to play the hypocrite all our lives long, if need be, or so
   much as to to tell a direct lie; but only not to try at an improper
   time and place to convince such persons as obstinately persist in their
   errors, when we see it will have no effect upon them. For he expressly
   declares, a little after the fore-mentioned words concerning confessing
   our religion, that sometimes it ought to be done, though it brings upon
   us the hatred of all those About us, and the imminent danger of certain
   death: He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of
   me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, it not worthy of
   me. [911] And such are all they who dissemble the doctrines and
   precepts which they have received from Christ, for their families'
   sake. Nor has Christ omitted to tell us, that death must be expected
   for such constancy; and yet, notwithstanding, they ought to persist in
   their design; and that he who does lose his life upon this account,
   shall obtain a blessed immortality in the world to come. And he that
   taketh not his cross and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He
   that findeth his life (in this world) shall lose it, (in another), and
   he that loseth his life (on earth) for my sake, shall find it, [912] in
   heaven, and that an infinitely more happy and eternal one.

   This doctrine is so plain and evident, that there are no sects of
   Christians at this time that differ at all about it; they who own the
   pope's authority, and they of all sorts who disown such authority, do
   every one of them, with one consent, affirm it to he a very wicked
   thing to dissemble our sentiments concerning religion; when opinions of
   the greatest moment are debated, and where the thing may be done
   without sedition and tumult. For, in those things in which faith
   towards God and uncorruptness of manners may be preserved, it may be
   right to conceal our notions, rather than raise perpetual contentions
   amongst Christians, when there are so few learned men who think alike
   in every thing. I say conceal, not dissemble; for to conceal your
   opinion is not to lie; but to affirm you believe that which you really
   do not believe, this is to lie. To which may be added, that if any
   opinion be established by the common law, which you think to be false,
   you ought modestly, and without contention or tumult, to declare your
   dissent from it; otherwise, instead of that mild and gentle government
   of Christian churches which does not exclude any dissent, provided it
   be done with charity, we shall run into absolute tyranny, which will
   allow of no dissent at all upon any account. There are innumerable
   obscure speculative questions, especially to those who never took any
   great pains in such sort of studies, in which Christian liberty ought
   to be allowed, as is confessed by all Christians; for there are a
   multitude of places in Scripture, and a vast number of theological
   opinions, in which learned men always have, and still do differ from
   each other with impunity, even amongst those who in other things
   require consent more strictly than they ought to do.

  SECT. IV. We ought not hastily to condemn those who differ from us, as if they
  were guilty of such a crime, or such unlawful worship, as is inconsistent with
  eternal life; so that none who admit such persons should be capable of the
  mercy of God; nor yet, on the other hand, is it lawful for us to profess that
  we believe what we do not really believe, or to do what, at the same time, we
  condemn.

   THEY who have separated from the church of Rome do no more agree with
   each other in all points, than they who continue in it; but, according
   to the judgment of some of the most learned men, they do not differ in
   any thing that is consistent with that faith which is owing to God, and
   that obedience which ought to be paid to him. But they object many
   things to the church of Rome, both in doctrine and worship, which they
   think are plainly false and unlawful. Whether they judge right in this
   or no, I shall not now inquire: however, thus much is evident, that,
   according to the opinion even of that church, it is not lawful for them
   to profess that they approve of what they do not approve of, nor do
   they admit any persons to communion with them who profess to dissent
   from it in such things. However, amongst those that dissent from the
   church of Rome, there are some famous and learned men, [913] who,
   though they think it utterly unlawful to join with that church
   themselves, on the account of those doctrines and that worship in which
   they differ from it; yet, notwithstanding, they do not think it right
   to exclude from eternal happiness all those, both learned and
   unlearned, who live and die in it. They, indeed, who think that there
   is any thing in them which is contrary to the fundamental principles of
   Christianity, judge it to be by no means lawful for themselves to give
   their assent to them, and that it would be the highest crime in them to
   pretend to consent to what they really condemn, and for which crime, if
   they should fall into it, and continue in it to their death, they
   believe they should be excluded eternal happiness. But as to such as do
   sincerely embrace those doctrines, because they believe them to be
   agreeable to divine revelation, or at least not so repugnant to it as
   to subvert the faith or holiness of the gospel; whether it he owing to
   that sort of study which they have employed themselves in from their
   youth, or whether it ariseth from a defect of knowledge or judgment;
   such persons as these, I say, they do not presume to exclude from
   salvation, because they cannot tell how far the mercy of God may
   extend, with respect to such men as these. There are innumerable
   circumstances both of time and place, and various dispositions of mind,
   which are quite unknown to us, which may very much diminish the crimes
   of wretched men in the sight of God, so as to procure pardon for such,
   which would be condemned in men of more learning. Wherefore, they look
   upon it as a part of Christian equity and prudence, al the same time
   that they condemn the doctrine and the worship, to leave the men to the
   wise and merciful judgment of God; though they themselves are
   determined neither to assent to their doctrines, nor to be present at
   their worship, because they think it absolutely unlawful.

   Surely no man can think that, from what has been said, it will follow
   that any person, who is brought up in a different opinion, and has
   employed himself in reading the Scriptures in the manner that the
   reformers do; if he should, contrary to his own conscience, say or do
   any thing which he thinks unlawful or false, for any present advantage;
   that any such person, I say, can hope for pardon from God; if he should
   die with a habit of saying and doing what be himself disapproves of,
   and would have said and done so, if he had lived longer. There is not
   at present, and I hope there never will be, any sect, which shall go
   under the name of Christians, who will allow that such a man can arrive
   at salvation.

   Let hypocrites, therefore, look to themselves, whilst they behave so,
   as shamefully to despise the light of reason and revelation, to resist
   the conviction of them, and to look upon the judgment of all Christians
   whatsoever as nothing. Such persons cannot be thought learned men, or
   such as have thoroughly and maturely considered the thing. There are
   them that so far despise all theological learning, that they will not
   so much as attempt it; but without this there can be no judgment at all
   passed upon the matter. These equally despise that noble philosophy
   which the great men amongst the Romans of old set such a value upon, as
   being deduced from the light of nature, in order to indulge those
   passions which the heathen philosophy would not allow of. Having thus
   secured themselves from the judgment of past ages, despising every
   thing in the present, and having little concern for what is to come,
   they are more like beasts than men endued with reason, which they never
   make use of. They who dissemble and lie in such a manner as this, ought
   not to be looked upon as men of any value or account; they ought not to
   be trusted even in temporal and worldly affairs, because they endeavour
   to impose upon God and man in a matter of the greatest importance.
   There are some amongst these who dare to affirm that we ought always to
   be of the religion that tie state is of, and when that changes, we
   ought to change also; but it is not at all to be wondered at that these
   persons should have so ill an opinion of the Christian faith, when they
   have not so much as the common principles of natural religion in them,
   nor do they shew any regard to right reason or virtue. What a wretched
   condition are those kings and states in, who put their confidence in
   such men as believe neither natural nor revealed religion! Indeed, men
   who are themselves void of learning; who give no credit to the judgment
   of any learned men whatsoever; who have no sort of concern for truth,
   but live in perpetual hypocrisy, are by no means fit to be trusted in
   any matters whatsoever, not even to such as relate to the public.

   Yet these very men, as much despisers as they are of truth and virtue,
   look upon themselves as better subjects and more ingenious persons than
   others; though they be neither, and though it be impossible they should
   be either, whilst they make no distinction betwixt truth and falsehood,
   virtue and vice, and whilst they are ready to say or any thing that may
   be of advantage to themselves. All such men have renounced a right
   temper of mind, and every good action; and therefore ought to be
   despised and avoided by every body.
     __________________________________________________________________

   entitled, The Religion of Protestants, the safe way to Salvation, where
   he mentions others who also think them as safe.
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECT. V. A man that commits a sin by mistake may be accepted of God, but a
  hypocrite cannot.

   THE condition of human nature is such, that a great many men (who, in
   other respects, are not the worst of men, and yet, either by bad
   education, or for want of teachers or books, which might bring them off
   from their errors; or because they have not capacity enough to
   understand the controversies amongst Christians, and to form a judgment
   of them), lead their lives, as it were, in utter darkness. Such
   persons, as they sincerely believe and obey what they are taught
   concerning the Christian religion, so far as their capacity reaches,
   are more the objects of compassion than of anger, considering the
   natural state of mankind. Their religion, indeed, is very lame and
   defective, and abounds with mistakes, but yet they themselves are very
   sincere. Wherefore it is highly probable that He, who does not reap
   where he has not sown, will, out of his abundant equity, pardon those
   who are in such circumstances; or certainly will inflict a much lighter
   punishment upon them.

   But if we consider that there are men to be found who have not wanted
   either education or teachers, either books, or capacity to understand
   who have the best and who the worst side of the question in
   controversies of religion; and yet have followed the wrong side, only
   for the sake of the wealth, or pleasure, or honours, that attend them
   in this present life; we cannot but have great indignation against such
   men, nor can any one presume to excuse them, much less to defend such a
   purpose of life, without the most consummate impudence. Whence it is
   easy to apprehend, that if we ourselves, whose virtue is very
   imperfect, could not pardon such persons, how much more severe will the
   infinite justice of God be against those who have knowingly and
   designedly preferred a lie to the truth, for the sake of the frail and
   uncertain good things of this present life.

   God, out of his abundant mercy, is ready to pardon such ignorance as
   does not proceed from vice; to pity our imperfect virtues; and to allow
   for the errors of such as are deceived; especially if there was no
   previous iniquity, nor no contempt of religion: but, as our Saviour
   assures us, he will never pardon those who, when they knew the truth,
   chose rather to profess a lie. We see that such a hypocrite as this is
   by no means acceptable to men; for nobody would choose a person for a
   friend, who, to gain any small advantage to himself, would trample
   under foot all the rights of ancient friendship. Whence it follows,
   front what has been said, that there is not a baser nor more dangerous
   piece of iniquity, than the crime of those who, in matters of the
   highest moment and concern, dissemble that which they really think is
   the best, and openly favour them who , are in the wrong. This is what
   reason itself teaches us, and what is confirmed by the Christian
   religion, and has the consent of all sects of Christians whatsoever.

TO THE READER.

   HAVING the following letters from that most excellent and learned
   person, Henry Newton, ambassador extraordinary from the most serene
   queen of Great Britain to his royal highness the most serene grand duke
   of Tuscany, to whose singular goodness I am very much indebted; I
   thought I should do a very acceptable thing to all that love the name
   of GROTIUS, and no small honour to the church of England, if I
   published them here. It appears plainly from them, that this very great
   man had the highest opinion of the church of England, and would Most
   willingly have lived in it, if he could. Make the best use of them you
   can therefore, courteous reader, and continue to have a good opinion of
   a man that deserved so well of the whole body of Christians.

LETTER I.

  HENRY NEWTON TO PETER HIERON. BARCELLINUS,
  ABBOT OF ST. EUSEBIUS DE URBE.

   BEING at length returned safe and well to Florence from Leghorn and
   Pisa, where, through the intemperateness of the air, I was very near
   contracting a fever; the first thing I had to do. most excellent
   Barcellinus, being furnished with the most noble library of the
   illustrious Magliahechius, was to discharge my promise concerning that
   great man HUGO GROTIUS, and to shew from his writings, particularly his
   letters, in which truth, candour, integrity of heart, and the inward
   thoughts of his mind are discovered, how highly he thought and wrote
   concerning us all his life-time, and a little before his departure, and
   when death and immortality were in his view. I know what was said of
   him by that principal man of his rank, Petavius, and also Brietius and
   Valesius, and many other celebrated men of your communion, who wished
   well and favourably to a man born for the public good of Christianity.
   It is known to all how greatly he suffered in goods, honour, and
   report, from the Calvinists, both in his own country and in his
   banishment, even after he was advanced to a higher rank by foreigners;
   and how much the heats of controversy (whilst he set his mind upon this
   one thing, to establish peace in the commonwealth and between the
   churches, which highly displeased many; a strange and grievous thing!)
   fretted that disposition which was otherwise peaceable and modest,
   after he saw himself treated in such an unworthy manner by his own
   friends; and sometimes prevailed over that meek wisdom which was in him
   both by nature and judgment. Yet these did not hinder his son, who was
   also a great man, from saying those things which I shall presently add
   concerning his father, to that great prince, Charles the second of
   Great Britain, to whom he dedicated his father's works, and in him to
   all others, and this when he had no reason to flatter or fear him,
   because, in the commonwealth, he was of the contrary part to Charles's
   sister's son; and because he was a private man, wedded to a country and
   learned life, and an old man, not far from death, nor consequently from
   liberty: for he published his father's works but saw them not after
   they were published; and his own life is to be seen and read with the
   life of his father in the same volume. "For thou," says Peter Grotius,
   "art he alone, whom, if not the greater, yet the wiser part of the
   Christian world have for a long time acknowledged for their protector.
   Thou art he to whose protection or defence the Christian faith
   willingly commits itself; in whose kingdoms principally that knowledge
   of the sacred writings, that worship of the Deity, that moderation of
   the too free exercise of liberty, in disputing concerning the secret
   doctrines of faith, is established; whose agreement with which the
   author, my father, has long since declared, and publicly professed in
   his writings."

   Here now Hugo Grotius's own words, how he expresses his own sense, in
   his epistle to Johannes Corvinis, dated ix the year MDCXXXVIII, who was
   not an English, but a Dutch divine, of another church, and also a
   lawyer, and consequently skilled in matters both divine and human;
   concerning the reformation of religion made amongst us in the last
   age:--"You see how great a progress they have made in England, in
   purging out pernicious doctrines; chiefly for this reason, because they
   who undertook that holy work admitted of nothing new, nothing of their
   own, but had their eyes wholly fixed upon another world." Then was it
   in a flourishing condition, before a civil war broke out, before the
   king was vanquished, taken captive, condemned, and beheaded; and it
   afterwards sprung up and flourished again, contrary to all human hopes,
   when his son returned to the throne of his ancestors, to the surprise
   of all Europe, and, after various turns, threats, and fears, continues
   still to flourish secure and unhurt.

   Nor had he only a good opinion of the church of England himself, but
   also advised his friends in Holland, who were of his party, and, which
   was no small thing, who joined with him in partaking of the same danger
   and losses, to take holy orders from our bishops; whom it is certain he
   did not believe, nor would have others believe, to be schismatical, or
   heretical, upon that account. He addressed his brother in these words:
   "I would persuade them (that is, the remonstrants) to appoint some
   amongst them in a more eminent station, such as bishops; and that they
   receive the laying on of hands from the Irish archbishop who is there,
   and that when they are so ordained, they afterwards ordain other
   pastors;" and this in the beginning of the year MDCXLV, which was fatal
   to him, and unfortunate to learning itself. The bishop he here speaks
   of is, if I be not mistaken, John Bramhall, who was at that time bishop
   of Londonderry in Ireland, and, at the restoration of king Charles II.
   archbishop of Armagh, and next to the most learned Usher, primate of
   Ireland, and who afterwards in that country published a vindication of
   our church against Miletorius. See also what is said to the same
   person, April 8, in the year MDCXLV, concerning the public worship of
   God amongst us: "The English liturgy was always accounted the best by
   all learned men."

   It seems very probable that this man, who calls the reformation of the
   church of England a most holy work; who believed that the holy orders
   given and received from the bishops of that church, and the rites
   appointed about holy things, and the prescribed form of worshipping the
   Supreme Deity, exceeded all other churches in the Christian world;
   world have joined himself to that church, as well in outward worship,
   as in the judgment of his mind; and so have become now really, what he
   before was in wish, a member of the Catholic church. But he was never
   able to effect the thing, because death immediately after overtook him;
   for in the same year he went from France to Stockholm to resign his
   ambassadorship, and returning from thence home, and having suffered
   shipwreck, he departed this life at Rostock, on the 28th of August; a
   man never enough to be lamented, because study and learning decayed
   with him; and never enough to be praised, upon the account of what he
   began and finished in all parts of learning. He was a great lover of
   peace, if truth was not injured, (always having regard to times and
   differences), and of the ancient church-government, (freed from
   abuses), as it was settled from the beginning in England, and as it was
   from the very apostles' time, if we may believe ecclesiastical annals.
   He always studied and consulted the peace of empires and churches, both
   in his discourses, and by his example, and in his writings. May he be
   rewarded with God and our common Lord! and may the memory of him be
   ever grateful to posterity Farewell.

LETTER. II.

  HENRY NEWTON TO JOHN CLERC.

   MOST LEARNED SIR,

   I SEND you a new and ample testimony concerning HUGO GROTIUS, more
   weighty than the former, if we consider the author's dignity in the
   commonwealth, or his knowledge of things, or that it was writ while
   Grotius was alive. It is taken from letters to that great prelate,
   William Laud, then archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he often had
   correspondence by letters; they were written from Paris, October 24,
   Gregorian style, in the year MDCXXXIII, and were procured me lately out
   of England, by the kindness of that most illustrious person, John lord
   Sommers, formerly high chancellor of that flourishing kingdom, then
   president of the law, now of the council. In those letters that most
   illustrious viscount Scudamore, at the time ambassador for our nation
   in France, has the following words concerning Grotius:--

   "The next time I see ambassador Grotius, I will not fail to perform
   your commands concerning him. Certainly, my lord, 1 am persuaded that
   he doth unfeignedly and highly love and reverence your person and
   proceedings. Body and soul he professeth himself to be for the church
   of England; and gives this judgment of it, that it is the likeliest to
   last of any church this day in being."

LETTER III.

  FRANCIS CHOLMONDLY TO ALEXANDER FORRESTER.

   THAT which you desire to know of me concerning HUGO GROTIUS, who was
   one of the greatest men that ever any age produced, is this:--It
   happened that I came to Paris a little after the transaction of that
   matter. Being very well acquainted with dr. Crowder, he often told me
   with assurance, that it was the last advice this great man gave to his
   wife, as he thought it was his duty, that he declared he died in the
   communion of the church of England, in which church he wished her to
   live. This she discovered when she came on purpose to our church,
   (which was in the house of Richard Brown, who was then in France upon
   the king of England's account), where she received the sacrament of the
   Lord's supper at the hands of dr. Crowder, then chaplain to the duke of
   York. This was done as soon as matters would permit after the death of
   that man. Archbishop Bramhall, primate of Ireland, in defence of
   himself and the episcopal clergy, against Richard Baxter the
   presbyterian's accusation of popery, speaks thus concerning the
   religion of Grotius, p. 21.--"He was a friend in his affection to the
   church of England, and a true son in his love for it: he commended it
   to his wife and other friends, and was the cause of their family
   adhering to it, as far as they had opportunity. I myself, and many
   others, have seen his wife obeying the commands of her husband, as she
   openly testified, in coming to our prayers, and the celebration of the
   sacrament." When Matthew Turner, a great friend of Grotius, desired to
   know why he did not go over to the communion of the church of England,
   he answered, that he would very willingly have done it, if the office
   of ambassador to Swedeland had not hindered it. Otherwise he very
   highly approved of our doctrine and discipline, and wished to live and
   die in our communion. If any one thinks that he can know Grotius's mind
   better from conjectures and inferences, or that he dissembled it before
   his wife and children, let him enjoy his own opinion; be will not have
   many agree with him. Farewell.

   June 23, MDCCVII.

FROM ANOTHER LETTER,

  DATED OCT. 8, MDCCVII.

   I LATELY told you very fully what I knew of the widow of that great
   man, Hugo Grotius. Afterwards I called to mind, that that pious and
   singular good man, sir Spencer Compton, knight, son of the earl of
   Northampton, told me he was present when Grotius's widow professed
   this, and received the sacrament.

   FINIS.
