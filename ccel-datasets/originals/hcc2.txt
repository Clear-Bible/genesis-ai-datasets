   PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION REVISED

   A few months after the appearance of the revised edition of this
   volume, Dr. Bryennios, the learned Metropolitan of Nicomedia, surprised
   the world by the publication of the now famous Didache, which he had
   discovered in the Jerusalem Monastery of the Most Holy Sepulchre at
   Constantinople. This led me, in justice to myself and to my readers, to
   write an independent supplement under the title: The Oldest Church
   Manual, called the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, etc., which is now
   passing through the press.

   At the same time I have taken advantage of a new issue of this History,
   without increasing the size and the price, to make in the plates all
   the necessary references to the Didache where it sheds new light on the
   post-apostolic age (especially on pages 140, 184, 185, 202, 226, 236,
   239, 241, 247, 249, 379, 640).

   I have also brought the literature up to date, and corrected a few
   printing errors, so that this issue may be called a revised edition. A
   learned and fastidious German critic and professional church historian
   has pronounced this work to be far in advance of any German work in the
   fullness of its digest of the discoveries and researches of the last
   thirty years. ("Theolog. Literatur-Zeitung," for March 22, 1884.) But
   the Bryennios discovery, and the extensive literature which it has
   called forth, remind me of the imperfect character of historical books
   in an age of such rapid progress as ours.

   FIFTH EDITION

   The fourth edition (1886) was a reprint of the third, with a few slight
   improvements. In this fifth edition I have made numerous additions to
   the literature, and adapted the text throughout to the present stage of
   research, which continues to be very active and fruitful in the
   Ante-Nicene period.

   Several topics connected with the catechetical instruction,
   organization, and ritual (baptism and eucharist) of the early Church
   are more fully treated in my supplementary monograph, The Teaching of
   the Twelve Apostles, or The Oldest Church Manual, which first appeared
   in June, 1885, and in a third edition, revised and enlarged, January,
   1889, (325 pages).

   PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

   This second volume contains the history of Christianity from the end of
   the Apostolic age to the beginning of the Nicene.

   The first edict of Toleration, A. D. 311, made an end of persecution;
   the second Edict of Toleration, 311 (there is no third), prepared the
   way for legal recognition and protection; the Nicene Council, 325,
   marks the solemn inauguration of the imperial state-church.
   Constantine, like Eusebius, the theologian, and Hosius, the statesman,
   of his reign, belongs to both periods and must be considered in both,
   though more fully in the next.

   We live in an age of discovery and research, similar to that which
   preceded the Reformation. The beginnings of Christianity are now
   absorbing the attention of scholars.

   During the present generation early church history has been vastly
   enriched by new sources of information, and almost revolutionized by
   independent criticism. Among the recent literary discoveries and
   publications the following deserve special mention:

   The Syriac Ignatius (by Cureton 1845 and 1849), which opened a new
   chapter in the Ignatian controversy so closely connected with the rise
   of Episcopacy and Catholicism; the Philosophumena of Hippolytus (by
   Miller 1851, and by Duncker and Schneidewin, 1859), which have shed a
   flood of light on the ancient heresies and systems of thought, as well
   as on the doctrinal and disciplinary commotions in the Roman church in
   the early part of third century; the Tenth Book of The
   Pseudo-Clementine Homilies (by Dressel, 1853), which supplements our
   knowledge of a curious type of distorted Christianity in the
   post-apostolic age, and furnishes, by an undoubted quotation, a
   valuable contribution to the solution of the Johannean problem; the
   Greek Hermas from Mt. Athos (the Codex Lipsiensis, published by Anger
   and Tischendorf, 1856); a new and complete Greek MS. of the First
   Epistle of the Roman Clement with several important new chapters and
   the oldestwritten Christian prayer (about one tenth of the whole),
   found in a Convent Library at Constantinople (by Bryennios, 1875); and
   in the same Codex the Second (so called) Epistle of Clement, or
   post-Clementine Homily rather, in its complete form (20 chs. instead of
   12), giving us the first post-apostolic sermon, besides a new Greek
   text of the Epistle of Barnabus; a Syriac Version of Clement in the
   library of Jules Mohl, now at Cambridge (1876); fragments of Tatian's
   Diatessaron with Ephraem's Commentary on it, in an Armenian version
   (Latin by Mösinger 1878); fragments of the apologies of Melito (1858),
   and Aristides (1878); the complete Greek text of the Acts of Thomas (by
   Max Bonnet, 1883); and the crowning discovery of all, the Codex
   Sinaiticus, the only complete uncial MS. of the Greek Testament,
   together with the Greek Barnabus and the Greek Hermas (by Tischendorf,
   1862), which, with the facsimile edition of the Vatican Codex
   (1868-1881, 6 vols.), marks an epoch in the science of textual
   criticism of the Greek Testament and of those two Apostolic Fathers,
   and establishes the fact of the ecclesiastical use of all our canonical
   books in the age of Eusebius.

   In view of these discoveries we would not be surprised if the
   Exposition of the Lord's Oracles by Papias, which was still in
   existence at Nismes in 1215, the Memorials of Hegesippus, and the whole
   Greek original of Irenaeus, which were recorded by a librarian as
   extant in the sixteenth century, should turn up in some old convent.

   In connection with these fresh sources there has been a corresponding
   activity on the part of scholars. The Germans have done and are doing
   an astonishing amount of Quellenforschung and Quellenkritik in numerous
   monographs and periodicals, and have given us the newest and best
   critical editions of the Apostolic Fathers and Apologists. The English
   with their strong common sense, judicial calmness, and conservative
   tact are fast wheeling into the line of progress, as is evident from
   the collective works on Christian Antiquities, and the Christian
   Biography, and from Bp. Lightfoot's Clementine Epistles, which are soon
   to be followed by his edition of the Ignatian Epistles. To the
   brilliant French genius and learning of Mr. Renan we owe a graphic
   picture of the secular surroundings of early Christianity down to the
   time of Marcus Aurelius, with sharp glances into the literature and
   life of the church. His Historie des Origines du Christianisme, now
   completed in seven volumes, after twenty year's labor, is well worthy
   to rank with Gibbon's immortal work. The Rise and Triumph of
   Christianity is a grander theme than the contemporary Decline and Fall
   of the Roman Empire, but no historian can do justice to it without
   faith in the divine character and mission of that peaceful Conqueror of
   immortal souls, whose kingdom shall have no end.

   The importance of these literary discoveries and investigations should
   not blind us to the almost equally important monumental discoveries and
   researches of Cavalier de Rossi, Garrucci, and other Italian scholars
   who have illuminated the subterranean mysteries of the church of Rome
   and of Christian art. Neander, Gieseler, and Baur, the greatest church
   historians of the nineteenth century, are as silent about the catacombs
   as Mosheim and Gibbon were in the eighteenth. But who could now write a
   history of the first three centuries without recording the lessons of
   those rude yet expressive pictures, sculptures, and epitaphs from the
   homes of confessors and martyrs? Nor should we overlook the gain which
   has come to us from the study of monumental inscriptions, as for
   instance in rectifying the date of Polycarp's martyrdom who is now
   brought ten years nearer to the age of St. John.

   Before long there will be great need of an historic architect who will
   construct a beautiful and comfortable building out of the vast material
   thus brought to light. The Germans are historic miners, the French and
   English are skilled manufacturers; the former understand and cultivate
   the science of history, the latter excel in the art of historiography.
   A master of both would be the ideal historian. But God has wisely
   distributed his gifts, and made individuals and nations depend upon and
   supplement each other.

   The present volume is an entire reconstruction of the corresponding
   part of the first edition (vol. I p. 144-528), which appeared
   twenty-five years ago. It is more than double in size. Some chapters
   (e.g. VI. VII. IX.) and several sections (e.g. 90-93, 103, 155-157,
   168, 171, 184, 189, 190, 193, 198-204, etc.) are new, and the rest has
   been improved and enlarged, especially the last chapter on the
   literature of the church. My endeavor has been to bring the book up to
   the present advanced state of knowledge, to record every important work
   (German, French, English, and American) which has come under my notice,
   and to make the results of the best scholarship of the age available
   and useful to the rising generation.

   In conclusion, I may be permitted to express my thanks for the kind
   reception which has been accorded to this revised edition of the work
   of my youth. It will stimulate me to new energy in carrying it forward
   as far as God may give time and strength. The third volume needs no
   reconstruction, and a new edition of the same with a few improvements
   will be issued without delay.

   § 1. Literature on the Ante-Nicene Age

   I. Sources

   1. The writings of the Apostolic Fathers, the Apologists, and all the
   ecclesiastical authors of the 2nd and 3rd, and to some extent of the

   classical authors, Tacitus, Suetonius, the younger Pliny, Dion Cassius.

   II. Collections of Sources, (besides those included in the
   comprehensive Patristic Libraries):

   Gebhardt, Harnack, and Zahn: Patrum Apostolicorum Opera. Lips., 1876;
   second ed. 1878 sqq.

   arranged and enlarged by Bishop A. C. Coxe, D. D., with a valuable
   Bibliographical Synopsis by E. C. Richardson. New York (Christian
   Literature Company), 1885-'87, 9 large vols.

   The fragments of the earliest Christian writers, whose works are lost,
   may be found collected in Grabe: Spicilegium Patrum ut et Haereticorum
   Saeculi I. II. et III. (Oxon. 1700; new ed. Oxf. 1714, 3 vols.); in
   Routh: Reliquiae Sacrae, sive auctorum fere jam perditorum secundi,
   tertiique saeculi fragmenta quae supersunt (Oxon. 1814 sqq. 4 vols.;
   2nd ed. enlarged, 5 vols. Oxf. 1846-48); and in Dom. I. B. Pitra (O. S.

   sanctorum patrum scriptorumque eccles. anecdota hactenus opera, selecta
   e Graecis, Orientialibus et Latinis codicibus (Paris, 1852-'60, 5
   vols.). Comp. also Bunsen: Christianity and Mankind, etc. Lond. 1854,
   vols. V., VI. and VII., which contain the Analecta Ante-Nicaena
   (reliquicae literariae, canonicae, liturgicae).

   The haereseological writings of Epiphanius, Philastrius,
   Pseudo-Tertullian, etc. are collected in Franc. Oehler: Corpus
   haereseologicum. Berol. 1856-61, 3 vols. They belong more to the next
   period.

   The Jewish and Heathen Testimonies are collected by N. Lardner, 1764,
   new ed. by Kippis, Lond. 1838.

   III. Histories.

   1. Ancient Historians.

   Hegesippus (a Jewish Christian of the middle of the second century):
   Hupomnemata ton ekklesiastikon praxeon (quoted under the title pente
   hupomnemata and pente sungrammata). These ecclesiastical Memorials are
   only preserved in fragments (on the martyrdom of James of Jerusalem,
   the rise of heresies, etc.) in Eusebius H. Eccl., collected by Grabe
   (Spicileg. II. 203-214), Routh (Reliqu. Sacrae, vol. I. 209-219), and
   Hilgenfeld ("Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theol." 1876, pp. 179
   sqq.). See art. of Weizsäcker in Herzog, 2nd ed., V. 695; and of
   Milligan in Smith & Wace, II. 875. The work was still extant in the
   16th century, and may be discovered yet; see Hilgenfeld's "Zeitschrift"
   for 1880, p. 127. It is strongly Jewish-Christian, yet not Ebionite,
   but Catholic.

   *Eusebius (bishop of Caesarea in Palestine since 315, died 340, "the
   father of Church History," "the Christian Herodotus," confidential
   friend, adviser, and eulogist of Constantine the Great): Ekklesiastike
   historia, from the incarnation to the defeat and death of Licinius 324.
   Chief edd. by Stephens, Paris 1544 (ed. princeps); Valesius (with the
   other Greek church historians), Par. 1659; Reading, Cambr. 1720;
   Zimmermann, Francof. 1822; Burton, Oxon. 1838 and 1845 (2 vols.);
   Schwegler, Tüb. 1852; Lämmer, Scaphus. 1862 (important for the text);
   F. A. Heinichen, Lips. 1827, second ed. improved 1868-'70, 3 vols. (the
   most complete and useful edition of all the Scripta Historica of Eus.);
   G. Dindorf, Lips., 1871. Several versions(German, French, and English);
   one by Hanmer (Cambridge; 1683, etc.); another by C. F. Crusé (an Am.
   Episc., London, 1842, Phil., 1860, included in Bagster's edition of the
   Greek Eccles. Historians, London, 1847, and in Bohn's Eccles. Library);
   the best with commentary by A. C. McGiffert (to be published by "The
   Christian Lit. Comp.," New York, 1890).

   The other historical writings of Eusebius, including his Chronicle, his
   Life of Constantine, and his Martyrs of Palestine, are found in
   Heinichen's ed., and also in the ed. of his Opera omnia, by Migne,
   "Patrol. Graeca," Par. 1857, 5 vols. Best ed. of his Chronicle, by
   Alfred Schöne, Berlin, 1866 and 1875, 2 vols.

   Whatever may be said of the defects of Eusebius as an historical critic
   and writer, his learning and industry are unquestionable, and his
   Church History and Chronicle will always remain an invaluable
   collection of information not attainable in any other ancient author.
   The sarcastic contempt of Gibbon and charge of willful suppression of
   truth are not justified, except against his laudatory over-estimate of
   Constantine, whose splendid services to the church blinded his vision.
   For a just estimate of Eusebius see the exhaustive article of Bishop
   Lightfoot in Smith & Wace, II. 308-348.

   2. Modern Historians.

   William Cave, (died 1713): Primitive Christianity. Lond. 4th ed. 1682,
   in 3 parts. The same: Lives of the most eminent Fathers of the Church
   that flourished in the first four centuries, 1677-'83, 2 vols.; revised
   by ed. H. Carey, Oxford, 1840, in 3 vols. Comp. also Cave's Scriptorum
   ecclesiasticorum historia literaria, a Christo nato usque ad saeculum
   XIV; best ed. Oxford 1740-'43, 2 vols. fol.

   *J. L. Mosheim: Commentarii de rebus Christianis ante Constantinum M.
   Helmst. 1753. The same in English by Vidal, 1813 sqq., 3 vols., and by
   Murdock, New Haven, 1852, 2 vols.

   *Edward Gibbon: The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
   Empire. London, 1776-'88, 6 vols.; best edd. by Milman, with his own,
   Guizot's and Wenck's notes, and by William Smith, including the notes
   of Milman, etc. Reprinted, London, 1872, 8 vols., New York, Harpers,
   1880, in 6 vols. In Chs. 15 and 16, and throughout his great work,
   Gibbon dwells on the outside, and on the defects rather than the
   virtues of ecclesiastical Christianity, without entering into the heart
   of spiritual Christianity which continued beating through all ages; but
   for fullness and general accuracy of information and artistic
   representation his work is still unsurpassed.

   English) should be noticed throughout on this period; but all these
   books are partly superseded by more recent discoveries and discussions
   of special points, which will be noticed in the respective sections.

   § 2. General Character of Ante-Nicene Christianity.

   We now descend from the primitive apostolic church to the Graeco-Roman;
   from the scene of creation to the work of preservation; from the
   fountain of divine revelation to the stream of human development; from
   the inspirations of the apostles and prophets to the productions of
   enlightened but fallible teachers. The hand of God has drawn a bold
   line of demarcation between the century of miracles and the succeeding
   ages, to show, by the abrupt transition and the striking contrast, the
   difference between the work of God and the work of man, and to impress
   us the more deeply with the supernatural origin of Christianity and the
   incomparable value of the New Testament. There is no other transition
   in history so radical and sudden, and yet so silent and secret. The
   stream of divine life in its passage from the mountain of inspiration
   to the valley of tradition is for a short time lost to our view, and
   seems to run under ground. Hence the close of the first and the
   beginning of the second centuries, or the age of the Apostolic Fathers
   is often regarded as a period for critical conjecture and doctrinal and
   ecclesiastical controversy rather than for historical narration.

   Still, notwithstanding the striking difference, the church of the
   second and third centuries is a legitimate continuation of that of the
   primitive age. While far inferior in originality, purity, energy, and
   freshness, it is distinguished for conscientious fidelity in preserving
   and propagating the sacred writings and traditions of the apostles, and
   for untiring zeal in imitating their holy lives amidst the greatest
   difficulties and dangers, when the religion of Christ was prohibited by
   law and the profession of it punished as a political crime.

   The second period, from the death of the apostle John to the end of the
   persecutions, or to the accession of Constantine, the first Christian
   emperor, is the classic age of the ecclesia pressa, of heathen
   persecution, and of Christian martyrdom and heroism, of cheerful
   sacrifice of possessions and life itself for the inheritance of heaven.
   It furnishes a continuous commentary on the Saviour's words: "Behold, I
   send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; I came not to send
   peace on earth, but a sword." [2] No merely human religion could have
   stood such an ordeal of fire for three hundred years. The final victory
   of Christianity over Judaism and heathenism, and the mightiest empire
   of the ancient world, a victory gained without physical force, but by
   the moral power of patience and perseverance, of faith and love, is one
   of the sublimest spectacles in history, and one of the strongest
   evidences of the divinity and indestructible life of our religion.

   But equally sublime and significant are the intellectual and spiritual
   victories of the church in this period over the science and art of
   heathenism, and over the assaults of Gnostic and Ebionitic heresy, with
   the copious vindication and development of the Christian truth, which
   the great mental conflict with those open and secret enemies called
   forth.

   The church of this period appears poor in earthly possessions and
   honors, but rich in heavenly grace, in world-conquering faith, love,
   and hope; unpopular, even outlawed, hated, and persecuted, yet far more
   vigorous and expansive than the philosophies of Greece or the empire of
   Rome; composed chiefly of persons of the lower social ranks, yet
   attracting the noblest and deepest minds of the age, and bearing, in
   her bosom the hope of the world; "as unknown, yet well-known, as dying,
   and behold it lives;" conquering by apparent defeat, and growing on the
   blood of her martyrs; great in deeds, greater in sufferings, greatest
   in death for the honor of Christ and the benefit of generations to
   come. [3]

   The condition and manners of the Christians in this age are most
   beautifully described by the unknown author of the "Epistola ad
   Diognetum" in the early part of the second century. [4] "The
   Christians," he says, "are not distinguished from other men by country,
   by language, nor by civil institutions. For they neither dwell in
   cities by themselves, nor use a peculiar tongue, nor lead a singular
   mode of life. They dwell in the Grecian or barbarian cities, as the
   case may be; they follow the usage of the country in dress, food, and
   the other affairs of life. Yet they present a wonderful and confessedly
   paradoxical conduct. They dwell in their own native lands, but as
   strangers. They take part in all things as citizens; and they suffer
   all things, as foreigners. Every foreign country is a fatherland to
   them, and every native land is a foreign. They marry, like all others;
   they have children; but they do not cast away their offspring. They
   have the table in common, but not wives. They are in the flesh, but do
   not live after the flesh. They live upon the earth, but are citizens of
   heaven. They obey the existing laws, and excel the laws by their lives.
   They love all, and are persecuted by all. They are unknown, and yet
   they are condemned. They are killed and are made alive. They are poor
   and make many rich. They lack all things, and in all things abound.
   They are reproached, and glory in their reproaches. They are
   calumniated, and are justified. They are cursed, and they bless. They
   receive scorn, and they give honor. They do good, and are punished as
   evil-doers. When punished, they rejoice, as being made alive. By the
   Jews they are attacked as aliens, and by the Greeks persecuted; and the
   cause of the enmity their enemies cannot tell. In short, what the soul
   is in the body, the Christians are in the world. The soul is diffused
   through all the members of the body, and the Christians are spread
   through the cities of the world. The soul dwells in the body, but it is
   not of the body; so the Christians dwell in the world, but are not of
   the world. The soul, invisible, keeps watch in the visible body; so
   also the Christians are seen to live in the world, but their piety is
   invisible. The flesh hates and wars against the soul, suffering no
   wrong from it, but because it resists fleshly pleasures; and the world
   hates the Christians with no reason, but that they resist its
   pleasures. The soul loves the flesh and members, by which it is hated;
   so the Christians love their haters. The soul is inclosed in the body,
   but holds the body together; so the Christians are detained in the
   world as in a prison; but they contain the world. Immortal, the soul
   dwells in the mortal body; so the Christians dwell in the corruptible,
   but look for incorruption in heaven. The soul is the better for
   restriction in food and drink; and the Christians increase, though
   daily punished. This lot God has assigned to the Christians in the
   world; and it cannot be taken from them."

   The community of Christians thus from the first felt itself, in
   distinction from Judaism and from heathenism, the salt of the earth,
   the light of the world, the city of God set on a hill, the immortal
   soul in a dying body; and this its impression respecting itself was no
   proud conceit, but truth and reality, acting in life and in death, and
   opening the way through hatred and persecution even to an outward
   victory over the world.

   The ante-Nicene age has been ever since the Reformation a battle-field
   between Catholic and Evangelical historians and polemics, and is
   claimed by both for their respective creeds. But it is a sectarian
   abuse of history to identify the Christianity of this martyr period
   either with Catholicism, or with Protestantism. It is rather the common
   root out of which both have sprung, Catholicism (Greek and Roman)
   first, and Protestantism afterwards. It is the natural transition from
   the apostolic age to the Nicene age, yet leaving behind many important
   truths of the former (especially the Pauline doctrines) which were to
   be derived and explored in future ages. We can trace in it the
   elementary forms of the Catholic creed, organization and worship, and
   also the germs of nearly all the corruptions of Greek and Roman
   Christianity.

   In its relation to the secular power, the ante-Nicene church is simply
   the continuation of the apostolic period, and has nothing in common
   either with the hierarchical, or with the Erastian systems. It was not
   opposed to the secular government in its proper sphere, but the secular
   heathenism of the government was opposed to Christianity. The church
   was altogether based upon the voluntary principle, as a self-supporting
   and self-governing body. In this respect it may be compared to the
   church in the United States, but with this essential difference that in
   America the secular government, instead of persecuting Christianity,
   recognizes and protects it by law, and secures to it full freedom of
   public worship and in all its activities at home and abroad.

   The theology of the second and third centuries was mainly apologetic
   against the paganism of Greece and Rome, and polemic against the
   various forms of the Gnostic heresy. In this conflict it brings out,
   with great force and freshness, the principal arguments for the divine
   origin and character of the Christian religion and the outlines of the
   true doctrine of Christ and the holy trinity, as afterwards more fully
   developed in the Nicene and post-Nicene ages.

   The organization of this period may be termed primitive episcopacy, as
   distinct from the apostolic order which preceded, and the metropolitan
   and patriarchal hierarchy which succeeded it. In worship it forms
   likewise the transition from apostolic simplicity to the liturgical and
   ceremonial splendor of full-grown Catholicism.

   The first half of the second century is comparatively veiled in
   obscurity, although considerable light has been shed over it by recent
   discoveries and investigations. After the death of John only a few
   witnesses remain to testify of the wonders of the apostolic days, and
   their writings are few in number, short in compass and partly of
   doubtful origin: a volume of letters and historical fragments, accounts
   of martyrdom, the pleadings of two or three apologists; to which must
   be added the rude epitaphs, faded pictures, and broken sculptures of
   the subterranean church in the catacombs. The men of that generation
   were more skilled in acting out Christianity in life and death, than in
   its literary defence. After the intense commotion of the apostolic age
   there was a breathing spell, a season of unpretending but fruitful
   preparation for a new productive epoch. But the soil of heathenism had
   been broken up, and the new seed planted by the hands of the apostles
   gradually took root.

   Then came the great literary conflict of the apologists and doctrinal
   polemics in the second half of the same century; and towards the middle
   of the third the theological schools of Alexandria, and northern
   Africa, laying the foundation the one for the theology of the Greek,
   the other for that of the Latin church. At the beginning of the fourth
   century the church east and west was already so well consolidated in
   doctrine and discipline that it easily survived the shock of the last
   and most terrible persecution, and could enter upon the fruits of its
   long-continued sufferings and take the reins of government in the old
   Roman empire.

   [3] Isaac Taylor, in his Ancient Christianity of the early church
   challenge our respect, as well as affection; for theirs was the fervor
   of a steady faith in things unseen and eternal; theirs, often, a meek
   patience under the most grievous wrongs; theirs the courage to maintain
   a good profession before the frowning face of philosophy, of secular
   tyranny, and of splendid superstition; theirs was abstractedness from
   the world and a painful self-denial; theirs the most arduous and costly
   labors of love; theirs a munificence in charity, altogether without
   example; theirs was a reverent and scrupulous care of the sacred
   writings; and this one merit, if they had no other, is of a superlative
   degree, and should entitle them to the veneration and grateful regards
   of the modern church. How little do many readers of the Bible,
   nowadays, think of what it cost the Christians of the second and third
   centuries, merely to rescue and hide the sacred treasures from the rage
   of the heathen!"

   § 4. Hindrances and Helps.

   For the first three centuries Christianity was placed in the most
   unfavorable circumstances, that it might display its moral power, and
   gain its victory over the world by spiritual weapons alone. Until the
   reign of Constantine it had not even a legal existence in the Roman
   empire, but was first ignored as a Jewish sect, then slandered,
   proscribed, and persecuted, as a treasonable innovation, and the
   adoption of it made punishable with confiscation and death. Besides, it
   offered not the slightest favor, as Mohammedanism afterwards did, to
   the corrupt inclinations of the heart, but against the current ideas of
   Jews and heathen it so presented its inexorable demand of repentance
   and conversion, renunciation of self and the world, that more,
   according to Tertullian, were kept out of the new sect by love of
   pleasure than by love of life. The Jewish origin of Christianity also,
   and the poverty and obscurity of a majority of its professors
   particularly offended the pride of the Greeks, and Romans. Celsus,
   exaggerating this fact, and ignoring the many exceptions, scoffingly
   remarked, that "weavers, cobblers, and fullers, the most illiterate
   persons" preached the "irrational faith," and knew how to commend it
   especially "to women and children."

   But in spite of these extraordinary difficulties Christianity made a
   progress which furnished striking evidence of its divine origin and
   adaptation to the deeper wants of man, and was employed as such by
   Irenaeus, Justin, Tertullian, and other fathers of that day. Nay, the
   very hindrances became, in the hands of Providence, means of promotion.
   Persecution led to martyrdom, and martyrdom had not terrors alone, but
   also attractions, and stimulated the noblest and most unselfish form of
   ambition. Every genuine martyr was a living proof of the truth and
   holiness of the Christian religion. Tertullian could exclaim to the
   heathen: "All your ingenious cruelties can accomplish nothing; they are
   only a lure to this sect. Our number increases the more you destroy us.
   The blood of the Christians is their seed." The moral earnestness of
   the Christians contrasted powerfully with the prevailing corruption of
   the age, and while it repelled the frivolous and voluptuous, it could
   not fail to impress most strongly the deepest and noblest minds. The
   predilection of the poor and oppressed for the gospel attested its
   comforting and redeeming power. But others also, though not many, from
   the higher and educated classes, were from the first attracted to the
   new religion; such men as Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathaea, the apostle
   Paul, the proconsul Sergius Paulus, Dionysius of Athens, Erastus of
   Corinth, and some members of the imperial household. Among the
   sufferers in Domitian's persecution were his own near kinswoman Flavia
   Domitilla and her husband Flavius Clemens. In the oldest part of the
   Catacomb of Callistus, which is named after St. Lucina, members of the
   illustrious gens Pomponia, and perhaps also of the Flavian house, are
   interred. The senatorial and equestrian orders furnished several
   converts open or concealed. Pliny laments, that in Asia Minor men of
   every rank (omnis ordinis) go over to the Christians. Tertullian
   asserts that the tenth part of Carthage, and among them senators and
   ladies of the noblest descent and the nearest relatives of the
   proconsul of Africa professed Christianity. The numerous church fathers
   from the middle of the second century, a Justin Martyr, Irenaeus,
   Hippolytus, Clement, Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, excelled, or at least
   equalled in talent and culture, their most eminent heathen
   contemporaries.

   Nor was this progress confined to any particular localities. It
   extended alike over all parts of the empire. "We are a people of
   yesterday," says Tertullian in his Apology, "and yet we have filled
   every place belonging to you--cities, islands, castles, towns,
   assemblies, your very camp, your tribes, companies, palace, senate,
   forum! We leave you your temples only. We can count your armies; our
   numbers in a single province will be greater." All these facts expose
   the injustice of the odious charge of Celsus, repeated by a modern
   sceptic, that the new sect was almost entirely composed of the dregs of
   the populace--of peasants and mechanics, of boys and women, of beggars
   and slaves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. Causes of the Success of Christianity.

   The chief positive cause of the rapid spread and ultimate triumph of
   Christianity is to be found in its own absolute intrinsic worth, as the
   universal religion of salvation, and in the perfect teaching and
   example of its divine-human Founder, who proves himself to every
   believing heart a Saviour from sin and a giver of eternal life.
   Christianity is adapted to all classes, conditions, and relations among
   men, to all nationalities and races, to all grades of culture, to every
   soul that longs for redemption from sin, and for holiness of life. Its
   value could be seen in the truth and self-evidencing power of its
   doctrines; in the purity and sublimity of its precepts; in its
   regenerating and sanctifying effects on heart and life; in the
   elevation of woman and of home life over which she presides; in the
   amelioration of the condition of the poor and suffering; in the faith,
   the brotherly love, the beneficence, and the triumphant death of its
   confessors.

   To this internal moral and spiritual testimony were added the powerful
   outward proof of its divine origin in the prophecies and types of the
   Old Testament, so strikingly fulfilled in the New; and finally, the
   testimony of the miracles, which, according to the express statements
   of Quadratus, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, and others,
   continued in this period to accompany the preaching of missionaries
   from time to time, for the conversion of the heathen.

   Particularly favorable outward circumstances were the extent, order,
   and unity of the Roman empire, and the prevalence of the Greek language
   and culture.

   In addition to these positive causes, Christianity had a powerful
   negative advantage in the hopeless condition of the Jewish and heathen
   world. Since the fearful judgment of the destruction of Jerusalem,
   Judaism wandered restless and accursed, without national existence.
   Heathenism outwardly held sway, but was inwardly rotten and in process
   of inevitable decay. The popular religion and public morality were
   undermined by a sceptical and materialistic philosophy; Grecian science
   and art had lost their creative energy; the Roman empire rested only on
   the power of the sword and of temporal interests; the moral bonds of
   society were sundered; unbounded avarice and vice of every kind, even
   by the confession of a Seneca and a Tacitus, reigned in Rome and in the
   provinces, from the throne to the hovel. Virtuous emperors, like
   Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius, were the exception, not the rule,
   and could not prevent the progress of moral decay. Nothing, that
   classic antiquity in its fairest days had produced, could heal the
   fatal wounds of the age, or even give transient relief. The only star
   of hope in the gathering night was the young, the fresh, the dauntless
   religion of Jesus, fearless of death, strong in faith, glowing with
   love, and destined to commend itself more and more to all reflecting
   minds as the only living religion of the present and the future. While
   the world was continually agitated by wars, and revolutions, and public
   calamities, while systems of philosophy, and dynasties were rising and
   passing away, the new religion, in spite of fearful opposition from
   without and danger from within, was silently and steadily progressing
   with the irresistible force of truth, and worked itself gradually into
   the very bone and blood of the race.

   "Christ appeared," says the great Augustin, "to the men of the
   decrepit, decaying world, that while all around them was withering
   away, they might through Him receive new, youthful life."

   Notes.

   Gibbon, in his famous fifteenth chapter, traces the rapid progress of
   Christianity in the Roman empire to five causes: the zeal of the early
   Christians, the belief in future rewards and punishment, the power of
   miracles, the austere (pure) morals of the Christian, and the compact
   church organization. But these causes are themselves the effects of a
   cause which Gibbon ignores, namely, the divine truth of Christianity,
   the perfection of Christ's teaching and Christ's example. See the
   strictures of Dr. John Henry Newman, Grammar of Assent, 445 sq., and
   Dr. George P. Fisher, The Beginnings of Christianity, p. 543 sqq. "The
   zeal" [of the early Christians], says Fisher, "was zeal for a person,
   and for a cause identified with Him; the belief in the future life
   sprang out of faith in Him who had died and risen again, and ascended
   to Heaven; the miraculous powers of the early disciples were
   consciously connected with the same source; the purification of morals,
   and the fraternal unity, which lay at the basis of ecclesiastical
   association among the early Christians, were likewise the fruit of
   their relation to Christ, and their common love to Him. The victory of
   Christianity in the Roman world was the victory of Christ, who was
   lifted up that He might draw all men unto Him."

   Lecky (Hist. of Europ. Morals, I. 412) goes deeper than Gibbon, and
   accounts for the success of early Christianity by its intrinsic
   excellency and remarkable adaptation to the wants of the times in the
   old Roman empire. "In the midst of this movement," he says,
   "Christianity gained its ascendancy, and we can be at no loss to
   discover the cause of its triumph. No other religion, under such
   circumstances, had ever combined so many distinct elements of power and
   attraction. Unlike the Jewish religion, it was bound by no local ties,
   and was equally adapted for every nation and for every class. Unlike
   Stoicism, it appealed in the strongest manner to the affections, and
   offered all the charm of a sympathetic worship. Unlike the Egyptian
   religion, it united with its distinctive teaching a pure and noble
   system of ethics, and proved itself capable of realizing it in action.
   It proclaimed, amid a vast movement of social and national
   amalgamation, the universal brotherhood of mankind. Amid the softening
   influence of philosophy and civilization, it taught the supreme
   sanctity of love. To the slave, who had never before exercised so large
   an influence over Roman religious life, it was the religion of the
   suffering and the oppressed. To the philosopher it was at once the echo
   of the highest ethics of the later Stoics, and the expansion of the
   best teaching of the school of Plato. To a world thirsting for prodigy,
   it offered a history replete with wonders more strange than those of
   Apollonius; while the Jew and the Chaldean could scarcely rival its
   exorcists, and the legends of continual miracles circulated among its
   followers. To a world deeply conscious of political dissolution, and
   prying eagerly and anxiously into the future, it proclaimed with a
   thrilling power the immediate destruction of the globe--the glory of
   all its friends, and the damnation of all its foes. To a world that had
   grown very weary gazing on the cold passionless grandeur which Cato
   realized, and which Lucan sung, it presented an ideal of compassion and
   of love--an ideal destined for centuries to draw around it all that was
   greatest, as well as all that was noblest upon earth--a Teacher who
   could weep by the sepulchre of His friend, who was touched with the
   feeling of our infirmities. To a world, in fine, distracted by hostile
   creeds and colliding philosophies, it taught its doctrines, not as a
   human speculation, but as a Divine revelation, authenticated much less
   by reason than by faith. 'With the heart man believeth unto
   righteousness;' 'He that doeth the will of my Father will know the
   doctrine, whether it be of God;' 'Unless you believe you cannot
   understand;' 'A heart naturally Christian;' 'The heart makes the
   theologian,' are the phrases which best express the first action of
   Christianity upon the world. Like all great religions, it was more
   concerned with modes of feeling than with modes of thought. The chief
   cause of its success was the congruity of its teaching with the
   spiritual nature of mankind. It was because it was true of the moral
   sentiments of the age, because it represented faithfully the supreme
   type of excellence to which men were then tending, because it
   corresponded with their religious wants, aims, and emotions, because
   the whole spiritual being could then expand and expatiate under its
   influence that it planted its roots so deeply in the hearts of men."

   Merivale (Convers. of the Rom. Emp., Preface) traces the conversion of
   the Roman empire chiefly to four causes: 1) the external evidence of
   the apparent fulfilment of recorded prophecy and miracles to the truth
   of Christianity; 2) the internal evidence of satisfying the
   acknowledged need of a redeemer and sanctifier; 3) the goodness and
   holiness manifested in the lives and deaths of the primitive believers;
   4) the temporal success of Christianity under Constantine, which
   "turned the mass of mankind, as with a sweeping revolution, to the
   rising sun of revealed truth in Christ Jesus."

   Renan discusses the reasons for the victory of Christianity in the 31st
   chapter of his Marc-Aurèle (Paris 1882), pp. 561-588. He attributes it
   chiefly "to the new discipline of life," and "the moral reform," which
   the world required, which neither philosophy nor any of the established
   religions could give. The Jews indeed rose high above the corruptions
   of the times. "Glorie éternelle et unique, qui doit faire oublier bien
   des folies et des violence! Les Juifs sont les révolutionnaires du 1er
   et du 2e siècle de notre ère " They gave to the world Christianity.
   "Les populations se précipitèrent, par une sorte du mouvement
   instinctif, dans une secte qui satisfaisait leur aspirations les plus
   intimes et ouvrait des ésperances infinies." Renan makes much account
   of the belief in immortality and the offer of complete pardon to every
   sinner, as allurements to Christianity; and, like Gibbon, he ignores
   its real power as a religion of salvation. This accounts for its
   success not only in the old Roman empire, but in every country and
   nation where it has found a home.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. Means of Propagation.

   It is a remarkable fact that after the days of the Apostles no names of
   great missionaries are mentioned till the opening of the middle ages,
   when the conversion of nations was effected or introduced by a few
   individuals as St. Patrick in Ireland, St. Columba in Scotland, St.
   Augustine in England, St. Boniface in Germany, St. Ansgar in
   Scandinavia, St. Cyril and Methodius among the Slavonic races. There
   were no missionary societies, no missionary institutions, no organized
   efforts in the ante-Nicene age; and yet in less than 300 years from the
   death of St. John the whole population of the Roman empire which then
   represented the civilized world was nominally Christianized.

   To understand this astonishing fact, we must remember that the
   foundation was laid strong and deep by the apostles themselves. The
   seed scattered by them from Jerusalem to Rome, and fertilized by their
   blood, sprung up as a bountiful harvest. The word of our Lord was again
   fulfilled on a larger scale: "One soweth, and another reapeth. I sent
   you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and
   ye are entered into their labor" (John 4:38).

   Christianity once established was its own best missionary. It grew
   naturally from within. It attracted people by its very presence. It was
   a light shining in darkness and illuminating the darkness. And while
   there were no professional missionaries devoting their whole life to
   this specific work, every congregation was a missionary society, and
   every Christian believer a missionary, inflamed by the love of Christ
   to convert his fellow-men. The example had been set by Jerusalem and
   Antioch, and by those brethren who, after the martyrdom of Stephen,
   "were scattered abroad and went about preaching the Word." [5] Justin
   Martyr was converted by a venerable old man whom he met "walking on the
   shore of the sea." Every Christian laborer, says Tertullian, "both
   finds out God and manifests him, though Plato affirms that it is not
   easy to discover the Creator, and difficult when he is found to make
   him known to all." Celsus scoffingly remarks that fuller, and workers
   in wool and leather, rustic and ignorant persons, were the most zealous
   propagators of Christianity, and brought it first to women and
   children. Women and slaves introduced it into the home-circle, it is
   the glory of the gospel that it is preached to the poor and by the poor
   to make them rich. Origen informs us that the city churches sent their
   missionaries to the villages. The seed grew up while men slept, and
   brought forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, after that the full
   corn in the ear. Every Christian told his neighbor, the laborer to his
   fellow-laborer, the slave to his fellow-slave, the servant to his
   master and mistress, the story of his conversion, as a mariner tells
   the story of the rescue from shipwreck.

   The gospel was propagated chiefly by living preaching and by personal
   intercourse; to a considerable extent also through the sacred
   Scriptures, which were early propagated and translated into various
   tongues, the Latin (North African and Italian), the Syriac (the
   Curetonian and the Peshito), and the Egyptian (in three dialects, the
   Memphitic, the Thebaic, and the Bashmuric). Communication among the
   different parts of the Roman empire from Damascus to Britain was
   comparatively easy and safe. The highways built for commerce and for
   the Roman legions, served also the messengers of peace and the silent
   conquests of the cross. Commerce itself at that time, as well as now,
   was a powerful agency in carrying the gospel and the seeds of Christian
   civilization to the remotest parts of the Roman empire.

   The particular mode, as well as the precise time, of the introduction
   of Christianity into the several countries during this period is for
   the most part uncertain, and we know not much more than the fact
   itself. No doubt much more was done by the apostles and their immediate
   disciples, than the New Testament informs us of. But on the other hand
   the mediaeval tradition assigns an apostolic origin to many national
   and local churches which cannot have arisen before the second or third
   century. Even Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, Dionysius the
   Areopagite, Lazarus, Martha and Mary were turned by the legend into
   missionaries to foreign lands.

   § 7. Extent of Christianity in the Roman Empire.

   Justin Martyr says, about the middle of the second century: "There is
   no people, Greek or barbarian, or of any other race, by whatsoever
   appellation or manners they may be distinguished, however ignorant of
   arts or agriculture, whether they dwell in tents or wander about in
   covered wagons--among whom prayers and thanksgivings are not offered in
   the name of the crucified Jesus to the Father and Creator of all
   things." Half a century later, Tertullian addresses the heathen
   defiantly: "We are but of yesterday, and yet we already fill your
   cities, islands, camps, your palace, senate and forum; we have left to
   you only your temples." [6] These, and similar passages of Irenaeus and
   Arnobius, are evidently rhetorical exaggerations. Origen is more
   cautious and moderate in his statements. But it may be fairly asserted,
   that about the end of the third century the name of Christ was known,
   revered, and persecuted in every province and every city of the empire.
   Maximian, in one of his edicts, says that "almost all" had abandoned
   the worship of their ancestors for the new sect.

   In the absence of statistics, the number of the Christians must be
   purely a matter of conjecture. In all probability it amounted at the
   close of the third and the beginning of the fourth century to nearly
   one-tenth or one-twelfth of the subjects of Rome, that is to about ten
   millions of souls.

   But the fact, that the Christians were a closely united body, fresh,
   vigorous, hopeful, and daily increasing, while the heathen were for the
   most part a loose aggregation, daily diminishing, made the true
   prospective strength of the church much greater.

   The propagation of Christianity among the barbarians in the provinces
   of Asia and the north-west of Europe beyond the Roman empire, was at
   first, of course, too remote from the current of history to be of any
   great immediate importance. But it prepared the way for the
   civilization of those regions, and their subsequent position in the
   world.

   Notes.

   Gibbon and Friedländer (III. 531) estimate the number of Christians at
   the accession of Constantine (306) probably too low at one-twentieth;
   Matter and Robertson too high at one-fifth of his subjects. Some older
   writers, misled by the hyperbolical statements of the early Apologists,
   even represent the Christians as having at least equalled if not
   exceeded the number of the heathen worshippers in the empire. In this
   case common prudence would have dictated a policy of toleration long
   before Constantine. Mosheim, in his Hist. Commentaries, etc. (Murdock's
   translation I. p. 274 sqq.) discusses at length the number of
   Christians in the second century without arriving at definite
   conclusions. Chastel estimates the number at the time of Constantine at
   1/15 in the West, 1/10 in the East, 1/12 on an average (Hist. de la
   destruct. du paganisme, p. 36). According to Chrysostom, the Christian
   population of Antioch in his day (380) was about 100,000, or one-half
   of the whole.

   the heathen Pliny, in his famous letter to Trajan (Epp. x. 97) had
   spoken of "desolata templa" and "sacra solemnia diu intermissa, " in
   consequence of the spread of the Christian superstition throughout the
   cities and villages of Asia Minor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 8. Christianity in Asia.

   Asia was the cradle of Christianity, as it was of humanity and
   civilization. The apostles themselves had spread the new religion over
   Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor. According to the younger Pliny, under
   Trajan, the temples of the gods in Asia Minor were almost forsaken, and
   animals of sacrifice found hardly any purchasers. In the second century
   Christianity penetrated to Edessa in Mesopotamia, and some distance
   into Persia, Media, Bactria, and Parthia; and in the third, into
   Armenia and Arabia. Paul himself had, indeed, spent three years in
   Arabia, but probably in contemplative retirement preparing for his
   apostolic ministry. There is a legend, that the apostles Thomas and
   Bartholomew carried the gospel to India. But a more credible statement
   is, that the Christian teacher Pantaeus of Alexandria journeyed to that
   country about 190, and that in the fourth century churches were found
   there.

   The transfer of the seat of power from Rome to Constantinople, and the
   founding of the East Roman empire under Constantine I. gave to Asia
   Minor, and especially to Constantinople, a commanding importance in the
   history of the Church for several centuries. The seven oecumenical
   Councils from 325 to 787 were all held in that city or its
   neighborhood, and the doctrinal controversies on the Trinity and the
   person of Christ were carried on chiefly in Asia Minor, Syria, and
   Egypt.

   In the mysterious providence of God those lands of the Bible and the
   early church have been conquered by the prophet of Mecca, the Bible
   replaced by the Koran, and the Greek church reduced to a condition of
   bondage and stagnation; but the time is not far distant when the East
   will be regenerated by the undying spirit of Christianity. A peaceful
   crusade of devoted missionaries preaching the pure gospel and leading
   holy lives will reconquer the holy land and settle the Eastern
   question.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 9. Christianity in Egypt.

   In Africa Christianity gained firm foothold first in Egypt, and there
   probably as early as the apostolic age. The land of the Pharaohs, of
   the pyramids and sphinxes, of temples and tombs, of hieroglyphics and
   mummies, of sacred bulls and crocodiles, of despotism and slavery, is
   closely interwoven with sacred history from the patriarchal times, and
   even imbedded in the Decalogue as "the house of bondage." It was the
   home of Joseph and his brethren, and the cradle of Israel. In Egypt the
   Jewish Scriptures were translated more than two hundred years before
   our era, and this Greek version used even by Christ and the apostles,
   spread Hebrew ideas throughout the Roman world, and is the mother of
   the peculiar idiom of the New Testament. Alexandria was full of Jews,
   the literary as well as commercial centre of the East, and the
   connecting link between the East and the West. There the largest
   libraries were collected; there the Jewish mind came into close contact
   with the Greek, and the religion of Moses with the philosophy of Plato
   and Aristotle. There Philo wrote, while Christ taught in Jerusalem and
   Galilee, and his works were destined to exert a great influence on
   Christian exegesis through the Alexandrian fathers.

   Mark, the evangelist, according to ancient tradition, laid the
   foundation of the church of Alexandria. The Copts in old Cairo, the
   Babylon of Egypt, claim this to be the place from which Peter wrote his
   first epistle (1 Pet. 5:13); but he must mean either the Babylon on the
   Euphrates, or the mystic Babylon of Rome. Eusebius names, as the first
   bishops of Alexandria, Annianos (a.d. 62-85), Abilios (to 98), and
   Kerdon (to 110). This see naturally grew up to metropolitan and
   patriarchal importance and dignity. As early as the second century a
   theological school flourished in Alexandria, in which Clement and
   Origen taught as pioneers in biblical learning and Christian
   philosophy. From Lower Egypt the gospel spread to Middle and Upper
   Egypt and the adjacent provinces, perhaps (in the fourth century) as
   far as Nubia, Ethiopia, and Abyssinia. At a council of Alexandria in
   the year 235, twenty bishops were present from the different parts of
   the land of the Nile.

   During the fourth century Egypt gave to the church the Arian heresy,
   the Athanasian orthodoxy, and the monastic piety of St. Antony and St.
   Pachomius, which spread with irresistible force over Christendom.

   The theological literature of Egypt was chiefly Greek. Most of the
   early manuscripts of the Greek Scriptures--including probably the
   invaluable Sinaitic and Vatican MSS.--were written in Alexandria. But
   already in the second century the Scriptures were translated into the
   vernacular language, in three different dialects. What remains of these
   versions is of considerable weight in ascertaining the earliest text of
   the Greek Testament.

   The Christian Egyptians are the descendants of the Pharaonic Egyptians,
   but largely mixed with negro and Arab blood. Christianity never fully
   penetrated the nation, and was almost swept away by the Mohammedan
   conquest under the Caliph Omar (640), who burned the magnificent
   libraries of Alexandria under the plea that if the books agreed with
   the Koran, they were useless, if not, they were pernicious and fit for
   destruction. Since that time Egypt almost disappears from church
   history, and is still groaning, a house of bondage under new masters.
   The great mass of the people are Moslems, but the Copts--about half a
   million of five and a half millions--perpetuate the nominal
   Christianity of their ancestors, and form a mission field for the more
   active churches of the West.

   The inhabitants of the provinces of Northern Africa were of Semitic
   origin, with a language similar to the Hebrew, but became Latinized in
   customs, laws, and language under the Roman rule. The church in that
   region therefore belongs to Latin Christianity, and plays a leading
   part in its early history.

   The Phoenicians, a remnant of the Canaanites, were the English of
   ancient history. They carried on the commerce of the world; while the
   Israelites prepared the religion, and the Greeks the civilization of
   the world. Three small nations, in small countries, accomplished a more
   important work than the colossal empires of Assyria, Babylon, and
   Persia, or even Rome. Occupying a narrow strip of territory on the
   Syrian coast, between Mount Lebanon and the sea, the Phoenicians sent
   their merchant vessels from Tyre and Sidon to all parts of the old
   world from India to the Baltic, rounded the Cape of Good Hope two
   thousand years before Vasco de Gama, and brought back sandal wood from
   Malabar, spices from Arabia, ostrich plumes from Nubia, silver from
   Spain, gold from the Niger, iron from Elba, tin from England, and amber
   from the Baltic. They furnished Solomon with cedars from Lebanon, and
   helped him to build his palace and the temple. They founded on the
   northernmost coast of Africa, more than eight hundred years before
   Christ, the colony of Carthage. [7] From that favorable position they
   acquired the control over the northern coast of Africa from the pillars
   of Hercules to the Great Syrtes, over Southern Spain, the islands of
   Sardinia and Sicily, and the whole Mediterranean sea. Hence the
   inevitable rivalry between Rome and Carthage, divided only by three
   days' sail; hence the three Punic wars which, in spite of the brilliant
   military genius of Hannibal, ended in the utter destruction of the
   capital of North Africa (b.c. 146). [8] "Delenda est Carthago," was the
   narrow and cruel policy of the elder Cato. But under Augustus, who
   carried out the wiser plan of Julius Caesar, there arose a new Carthage
   on the ruins of the old, and became a rich and prosperous city, first
   heathen, then Christian, until it was captured by the barbarous Vandals
   (a.d. 439), and finally destroyed by a race cognate to its original
   founders, the Mohammedan Arabs (647). Since that time "a mournful and
   solitary silence" once more brooded over its ruins. [9]

   Christianity reached proconsular Africa in the second, perhaps already
   at the close of the first century, we do not know when and how. There
   was constant intercourse with Italy. It spread very rapidly over the
   fertile fields and burning sands of Mauritania and Numidia. Cyprian
   could assemble in 258 a synod of eighty-seven bishops, and in 308 the
   schismatical Donatists held a council of two hundred and seventy
   bishops at Carthage. The dioceses, of course, were small in those days.

   The oldest Latin translation of the Bible, miscalled "Itala" (the basis
   of Jerome's "Vulgata"), was made probably in Africa and for Africa, not
   in Rome and for Rome, where at that time the Greek language prevailed
   among Christians. Latin theology, too, was not born in Rome, but in
   Carthage. Tertullian is its father. Minutius Felix, Arnobius, and
   Cyprian bear witness to the activity and prosperity of African
   Christianity and theology in the third century. It reached its highest
   perfection during the first quarter of the fifth century in the sublime
   intellect and burning heart of St. Augustin, the greatest among the
   fathers, but soon after his death (430) it was buried first beneath the
   Vandal barbarism, and in the seventh century by the Mohammedan
   conquest. Yet his writings led Christian thought in the Latin church
   throughout the dark ages, stimulated the Reformers, and are a vital
   force to this day.

   the religion of Islam.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 11. Christianity in Europe.

   "Westward the course of Empire takes its way."

   This law of history is also the law of Christianity. From Jerusalem to
   Rome was the march of the apostolic church. Further and further West
   has been the progress of missions ever since.

   The church of Rome was by far the most important one for all the West.
   According to Eusebius, it had in the middle of the third century one
   bishop, forty-six presbyters, seven deacons with as many sub-deacons,
   forty-two acolyths, fifty readers, exorcists, and door-keepers, and
   fifteen hundred widows and poor persons under its care. From this we
   might estimate the number of members at some fifty or sixty thousand,
   i.e. about one-twentieth of the population of the city, which cannot be
   accurately determined indeed, but must have exceeded one million during
   the reign of the Antonines. [10] The strength of Christianity in Rome
   is also confirmed by the enormous extent of the catacombs where the
   Christians were buried.

   From Rome the church spread to all the cities of Italy. The first Roman
   provincial synod, of which we have information, numbered twelve bishops
   under the presidency of Telesphorus (142-154). In the middle of the
   third century (255) Cornelius of Rome held a council of sixty bishops.

   The persecution of the year 177 shows the church already planted in the
   south of Gaul in the second century. Christianity came hither probably
   from the East; for the churches of Lyons and Vienne were intimately
   connected with those of Asia Minor, to which they sent a report of the
   persecution, and Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons, was a disciple of Polycarp
   of Smyrna. Gregory of Tours states, that in the middle of the third
   century seven missionaries were sent from Rome to Gaul. One of these,
   Dionysius, founded the first church of Paris, died a martyr at
   Montmartre, and became the patron saint of France. Popular superstition
   afterwards confounded him with Dionysius the Areopagite, who was
   converted by Paul at Athens.

   Spain probably became acquainted with Christianity likewise in the
   second century, though no clear traces of churches and bishops there
   meet us till the middle of the third. The council of Elvira in 306
   numbered nineteen bishops. The apostle Paul once formed the plan of a
   missionary journey to Spain, and according to Clement of Rome he
   preached there, if we understand that country to be meant by "the limit
   of the West," to which he says that Paul carried the gospel. [11] 0 But
   there is no trace of his labors in Spain on record. The legend, in
   defiance of all chronology, derives Christianity in that country from
   James the Elder, who was executed in Jerusalem in 44, and is said to be
   buried at Campostella, the famous place of pilgrimage, where his bones
   were first discovered under Alphonse II, towards the close of the
   eighth century [12]

   When Irenaeus speaks of the preaching of the gospel among the Germans
   and other barbarians, who, "without paper and ink, have salvation
   written in their hearts by the Holy Spirit," he can refer only to the
   parts of Germany belonging to the Roman empire (Germania cisrhenana).

   According to Tertullian Britain also was brought under the power of the
   cross towards the end of the second century. The Celtic church existed
   in England, Ireland, and Scotland, independently of Rome, long before
   the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons by the Roman mission of Augustine;
   it continued for some time after that event and sent offshoots to
   Germany, France, and the Low Countries, but was ultimately at different
   dates incorporated with the Roman church. It took its origin probably
   from Gaul, and afterwards from Italy also. The legend traces it to St.
   Paul and other apostolic founders. The venerable Bede (735) says, that
   the British king Lucius (about 167) applied to the Roman bishop
   Eleutherus for missionaries. At the council of Arles, in Gaul
   (Arelate), in 314, three British bishops, of Eboracum (York), Londinum
   (London), and Colonia Londinensium (i.e. either Lincoln or more
   probably Colchester), were present.

   The conversion of the barbarians of Northern and Western Europe did not
   begin in earnest before the fifth and sixth centuries, and will claim
   our attention in the history of the Middle Ages.

   § 13. General Survey.

   The persecutions of Christianity during the first three centuries
   appear like a long tragedy: first, foreboding signs; then a succession
   of bloody assaults of heathenism upon the religion of the cross; amidst
   the dark scenes of fiendish hatred and cruelty the bright exhibitions
   of suffering virtue; now and then a short pause; at last a fearful and
   desperate struggle of the old pagan empire for life and death, ending
   in the abiding victory of the Christian religion. Thus this bloody
   baptism of the church resulted in the birth of a Christian world. It
   was a repetition and prolongation of the crucifixion, but followed by a
   resurrection.

   Our Lord had predicted this conflict, and prepared His disciples for
   it. "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. They
   will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will
   scourge you; yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for
   My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. And brother shall
   deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children
   shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death. And
   ye shall be hated of all men for My name's sake: but he that endureth
   to the end, the same shall be saved." These, and similar words, as well
   as the recollection of the crucifixion and resurrection, fortified and
   cheered many a confessor and martyr in the dungeon and at the stake.

   The persecutions proceeded first from the Jews, afterwards from the
   Gentiles, and continued, with interruptions, for nearly three hundred
   years. History reports no mightier, longer and deadlier conflict than
   this war of extermination waged by heathen Rome against defenseless
   Christianity. It was a most unequal struggle, a struggle of the sword
   and of the cross; carnal power all on one side, moral power all on the
   other. It was a struggle for life and death. One or the other of the
   combatants must succumb. A compromise was impossible. The future of the
   world's history depended on the downfall of heathenism and the triumph
   of Christianity. Behind the scene were the powers of the invisible
   world, God and the prince of darkness. Justin, Tertullian, and other
   confessors traced the persecutions to Satan and the demons, though they
   did not ignore the human and moral aspects; they viewed them also as a
   punishment for past sins, and a school of Christian virtue. Some denied
   that martyrdom was an evil, since it only brought Christians the sooner
   to God and the glory of heaven. As war brings out the heroic qualities
   of men, so did the persecutions develop the patience, the gentleness,
   the endurance of the Christians, and prove the world-conquering power
   of faith.

   Number of Persecutions.

   From the fifth century it has been customary to reckon ten great
   persecutions: under Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Septimius
   Severus, Maximinus, Decius, Valerian, Aurelian, and Diocletian. [13] 2
   This number was suggested by the ten plagues of Egypt taken as types
   (which, however, befell the enemies of Israel, and present a contrast
   rather than a parallel), and by the ten horns of the Roman beast making
   war with the Lamb, taken for so many emperors [14] But the number is
   too great for the general persecutions, and too small for the
   provincial and local. Only two imperial persecutions--those, of Decius
   and Diocletian--extended over the empire; but Christianity was always
   an illegal religion from Trajan to Constantine, and subject to
   annoyance and violence everywhere [15] Some persecuting emperors--Nero,
   Domitian, Galerius, were monstrous tyrants, but others--Trajan, Marcus
   Aurelius, Decius, Diocletian--were among the best and most energetic
   emperors, and were prompted not so much by hatred of Christianity as by
   zeal for the maintenance of the laws and the power of the government.
   On the other hand, some of the most worthless emperors--Commodus,
   Caracalla, and Heliogabalus--were rather favorable to the Christians
   from sheer caprice. All were equally ignorant of the true character of
   the new religion.

   The Result.

   The long and bloody war of heathen Rome against the church, which is
   built upon a rock, utterly failed. It began in Rome under Nero, it
   ended near Rome at the Milvian bridge, under Constantine. Aiming to
   exterminate, it purified. It called forth the virtues of Christian
   heroism, and resulted in the consolidation and triumph of the new
   religion. The philosophy of persecution is best expressed by the terse
   word of Tertullian, who lived in the midst of them, but did not see the
   end: "The blood of the Christians is the seed of the Church."

   Religious Freedom.

   The blood of persecution is also the seed of civil and religious
   liberty. All sects, schools, and parties, whether religious or
   political, when persecuted, complain of injustice and plead for
   toleration; but few practise it when in power. The reason of this
   inconsistency lies in the selfishness of human nature, and in mistaken
   zeal for what it believes to be true and right. Liberty is of very
   slow, but sure growth.

   The ancient world of Greece and Rome generally was based upon the
   absolutism of the state, which mercilessly trampled under foot the
   individual rights of men. It is Christianity which taught and
   acknowledged them.

   The Christian apologists first proclaimed, however imperfectly, the
   principle of freedom of religion, and the sacred rights of conscience.
   Tertullian, in prophetic anticipation as it were of the modern
   Protestant theory, boldly tells the heathen that everybody has a
   natural and inalienable right to worship God according to his
   conviction, that all compulsion in matters of conscience is contrary to
   the very nature of religion, and that no form of worship has any value
   whatever except as far as it is a free voluntary homage of the heart.
   [16] 5

   Similar views in favor of religious liberty were expressed by Justin
   Martyr, [17] 6 and at the close of our period by Lactantius, who says:
   "Religion cannot be imposed by force; the matter must be carried on by
   words rather than by blows, that the will may be affected. Torture and
   piety are widely different; nor is it possible for truth to be united
   with violence, or justice with cruelty. Nothing is so much a matter of
   free will as religion." [18] 7

   The Church, after its triumph over paganism, forgot this lesson, and
   for many centuries treated all Christian heretics, as well as Jews and
   Gentiles, just as the old Romans had treated the Christians, without
   distinction of creed or sect. Every state-church from the times of the
   Christian emperors of Constantinople to the times of the Russian Czars
   and the South American Republics, has more or less persecuted the
   dissenters, in direct violation of the principles and practice of
   Christ and the apostles, and in carnal misunderstanding of the
   spiritual nature of the kingdom of heaven.

   persecutions before Nero, mentioned in the N. T., and to the
   persecutions after Diocletian, as that of Julian, and the Arian
   emperors. "When I think of these and the like things," he says, "it
   does not seem to me that the number of persecutions with which the
   church is to be tried can be definitely stated."

   The Jews had displayed their obstinate unbelief and bitter hatred of
   the gospel in the crucifixion of Christ, the stoning of Stephen, the
   execution of James the Elder, the repeated incarceration as of Peter
   and John, the wild rage against Paul, and the murder of James the Just.
   No wonder that the fearful judgment of God at last visited this
   ingratitude upon them in the destruction of the holy city and the
   temple, from which the Christians found refuge in Pella.

   But this tragical fate could break only the national power of the Jews,
   not their hatred of Christianity. They caused the death of Symeon,
   bishop of Jerusalem (107); they were particularly active in the burning
   of Polycarp of Smyrna; and they inflamed the violence of the Gentiles
   by eliminating the sect of the Nazarenes.

   The Rebellion under Bar-Cochba. Jerusalem again Destroyed.

   By severe oppression under Trajan and Hadrian, the prohibition of
   circumcision, and the desecration of Jerusalem by the idolatry of the
   pagans, the Jews were provoked to a new and powerful insurrection (a.d.
   132-135). A pseudo-Messiah, Bar-Cochba (son of the stars, Num. 24:17),
   afterwards called Bar-Cosiba (son of falsehood), put himself at the
   head of the rebels, and caused all the Christians who would not join
   him to be most cruelly murdered. But the false prophet was defeated by
   Hadrian's general in 135, more than half a million of Jews were
   slaughtered after a desperate resistance, immense numbers sold into
   slavery, 985 villages and 50 fortresses levelled to the ground, nearly
   all Palestine laid waste, Jerusalem again destroyed, and a Roman
   colony, Aelia Capitolina, erected on its ruins, with an image of
   Jupiter and a temple of Venus. The coins of Aelia Capitolina bear the
   images of Jupiter Capitolinus, Bacchus, Serapis, Astarte.

   Thus the native soil of the venerable religion of the Old Testament was
   ploughed up, and idolatry planted on it. The Jews were forbidden to
   visit the holy spot of their former metropolis upon pain of death. [19]
   8 Only on the anniversary of the destruction were they allowed to
   behold and bewail it from a distance. The prohibition was continued
   under Christian emperors to their disgrace. Julian the Apostate, from
   hatred of the Christians, allowed and encouraged them to rebuild the
   temple, but in vain. Jerome, who spent the rest of his life in monastic
   retirement at Bethlehem (d. 419), informs us in pathetic words that in
   his day old Jewish men and women, "in corporibus et in habitu suo iram
   a Domini demonstrantes," had to buy from the Roman watch the privilege
   of weeping and lamenting over the ruins from mount Olivet in sight of
   the cross, "ut qui quondam emerant sanguinem Christi, emant lacrymas
   suas, et ne fletus quidem i eis gratuitus sit." [20] 9 The same sad
   privilege the Jews now enjoy under Turkish rule, not only once a year,
   but every Friday beneath the very walls of the Temple, now replaced by
   the Mosque of Omar. [21] 0

   The Talmud.

   After this the Jews had no opportunity for any further independent
   persecution of the Christians. Yet they continued to circulate horrible
   calumnies on Jesus and his followers. Their learned schools at Tiberias
   and Babylon nourished this bitter hostility. The Talmud, i.e. Doctrine,
   of which the first part (the Mishna, i.e. Repetition) was composed
   towards the end of the second century, and the second part (the Gemara,
   i.e. Completion) in the fourth century, well represents the Judaism of
   its day, stiff, traditional, stagnant, and anti-Christian. Subsequently
   the Jerusalem Talmud was eclipsed by the Babylonian (430-521), which is
   four times larger, and a still more distinct expression of Rabbinism.
   The terrible imprecation on apostates (pratio haereticorum), designed
   to deter Jews from going over to the Christian faith, comes from the
   second century, and is stated by the Talmud to have been composed at
   Jafna, where the Sanhedrin at that time had its seat, by the younger
   Rabbi Gamaliel.

   The Talmud is the slow growth of several centuries. It is a chaos of
   Jewish learning, wisdom, and folly, a continent of rubbish, with hidden
   pearls of true maxims and poetic parables. Delitzsch calls it "a vast
   debating club, in which there hum confusedly the myriad voices of at
   least five centuries, a unique code of laws, in comparison with which
   the law-books of all other nations are but lilliputian." It is the Old
   Testament misinterpreted and turned against the New, in fact, though
   not in form. It is a rabbinical Bible without inspiration, without the
   Messiah, without hope. It shares the tenacity of the Jewish race, and,
   like it, continues involuntarily to bear testimony to the truth of
   Christianity. A distinguished historian, on being asked what is the
   best argument for Christianity, promptly replied: the Jews. [22] 1

   Unfortunately this people, still remarkable even in its tragical end,
   was in many ways cruelly oppressed and persecuted by the Christians
   after Constantine, and thereby only confirmed in its fanatical hatred
   of them. The hostile legislation began with the prohibition of the
   circumcision of Christian slaves, and the intermarriage between Jews
   and Christians, and proceeded already in the fifth century to the
   exclusion of the Jews from all civil and political rights in Christian
   states. Even our enlightened age has witnessed the humiliating
   spectacle of a cruel Judenhetzein Germany and still more in Russia
   (1881). But through all changes of fortune God has preserved this
   ancient race as a living monument of his justice and his mercy; and he
   will undoubtedly assign it an important part in the consummation of his
   kingdom at the second coming of Christ.

   § 15. Causes of Roman Persecution.

   The policy of the Roman government, the fanaticism of the superstitious
   people, and the self-interest of the pagan priests conspired for the
   persecution of a religion which threatened to demolish the tottering
   fabric of idolatry; and they left no expedients of legislation, of
   violence, of craft, and of wickedness untried, to blot it from the
   earth.

   To glance first at the relation of the Roman state to the Christian
   religion.

   Roman Toleration.

   The policy of imperial Rome was in a measure tolerant. It was
   repressive, but not preventive. Freedom of thought was not checked by a
   censorship, education was left untrammelled to be arranged between the
   teacher and the learner. The armies were quartered on the frontiers as
   a protection of the empire, not employed at home as instruments of
   oppression, and the people were diverted from public affairs and
   political discontent by public amusements. The ancient religions of the
   conquered races were tolerated as far as they did not interfere with
   the interests of the state. The Jews enjoyed special protection since
   the time of Julius Caesar.

   Now so long as Christianity was regarded by the Romans as a mere sect
   of Judaism, it shared the hatred and contempt, indeed, but also the
   legal protection bestowed on that ancient national religion. Providence
   had so ordered it that Christianity had already taken root in the
   leading cities of the empire before, its true character was understood.
   Paul had carried it, under the protection of his Roman citizenship, to
   the ends of the empire, and the Roman proconsul at Corinth refused to
   interfere with his activity on the ground that it was an internal
   question of the Jews, which did not belong to his tribunal. The heathen
   statesmen and authors, even down to the age of Trajan, including the
   historian Tacitus and the younger Pliny, considered the Christian
   religion as a vulgar superstition, hardly worthy of their notice.

   But it was far too important a phenomenon, and made far too rapid
   progress to be long thus ignored or despised. So soon as it was
   understood as a new religion, and as, in fact, claiming universal
   validity and acceptance, it was set down as unlawful and treasonable, a
   religio illicita; and it was the constant reproach of the Christians:
   "You have no right to exist." [23] 2

   Roman Intolerance.

   We need not be surprised at this position. For with all its professed
   and actual tolerance the Roman state was thoroughly interwoven with
   heathen idolatry, and made religion a tool of itspolicy. Ancient
   history furnishes no example of a state without some religion and form
   of worship. Rome makes no exception to the general rule. "The
   Romano-Hellenic state religion" (says Mommsen), "and the Stoic
   state-philosophy inseparably combined with it were not merely a
   convenient instrument for every government--oligarchy, democracy, or
   monarchy--but altogether indispensable, because it was just as
   impossible to construct the state wholly without religious elements as
   to discover any new state religion adapted to form a substitute for the
   old." [24] 3

   The piety of Romulus and Numa was believed to have laid the foundation
   of the power of Rome. To the favor of the deities of the republic, the
   brilliant success of the Roman arms was attributed. The priests and
   Vestal virgins were supported out of the public treasury. The emperor
   was ex-officio the pontifex maximus, and even an object of divine
   worship. The gods were national; and the eagle of Jupiter Capitolinus
   moved as a good genius before the world-conquering legions. Cicero lays
   down as a principle of legislation, that no one should be allowed to
   worship foreign gods, unless they were recognized by public statute.
   [25] 4 Maecenas counselled Augustus: "Honor the gods according to the
   custom of our ancestors, and compel [26] 5 others to worship them. Hate
   and punish those who bring in strange gods."

   It is true, indeed, that individuals in Greece and Rome enjoyed an
   almost unlimited liberty for expressing sceptical and even impious
   sentiments in conversation, in books and on the stage. We need only
   refer to the works of Aristophanes, Lucian, Lucretius, Plautus,
   Terence. But a sharp distinction was made then, as often since by
   Christian governments, between liberty of private thought and
   conscience, which is inalienable and beyond the reach of legislation,
   and between the liberty of public worship, although the latter is only
   the legitimate consequence of the former. Besides, wherever religion is
   a matter of state-legislation and compulsion, there is almost
   invariably a great deal of hypocrisy and infidelity among the educated
   classes, however often it may conform outwardly, from policy, interest
   or habit, to the forms and legal acquirements of the established creed.

   The senate and emperor, by special edicts, usually allowed conquered
   nations the free practice of their worship even in Rome; not, however,
   from regard for the sacred rights of conscience, but merely from
   policy, and with the express prohibition of making proselytes from the
   state religion; hence severe laws were published from time to time
   against transition to Judaism.

   Obstacles to the Toleration of Christianity.

   To Christianity, appearing not as a national religion, but claiming to
   be the only true universal one making its converts among every people
   and every sect, attracting Greeks and Romans in much larger numbers
   than Jews, refusing to compromise with any form of idolatry, and
   threatening in fact the very existence of the Roman state religion,
   even this limited toleration could not be granted. The same
   all-absorbing political interest of Rome dictated here the opposite
   course, and Tertullian is hardly just in changing the Romans with
   inconsistency for tolerating the worship of all false gods, from whom
   they had nothing to fear, and yet prohibiting the worship of the only
   true God who is Lord over all. [27] 6 Born under Augustus, and
   crucified under Tiberius at the sentence of the Roman magistrate,
   Christ stood as the founder of a spiritual universal empire at the head
   of the most important epoch of the Roman power, a rival not to be
   endured. The reign of Constantine subsequently showed that the free
   toleration of Christianity was the death-blow to the Roman state
   religion.

   Then, too, the conscientious refusal of the Christians to pay divine
   honors to the emperor and his statue, and to take part in any
   idolatrous ceremonies at public festivities, their aversion to the
   imperial military service, their disregard for politics and
   depreciation of all civil and temporal affairs as compared with the
   spiritual and eternal interests of man, their close brotherly union and
   frequent meetings, drew upon them the suspicion of hostility to the
   Caesars and the Roman people, and the unpardonable crime of conspiracy
   against the state. [28] 7

   The common people also, with their polytheistic ideas, abhorred the
   believers in the one God as atheists and enemies of the gods. They
   readily gave credit to the slanderous rumors of all sorts of
   abominations, even incest and cannibalism, practised by the Christians
   at their religious assemblies and love-feasts, and regarded the
   frequent public calamities of that age as punishments justly inflicted
   by the angry gods for the disregard of their worship. In North Africa
   arose the proverb: "If God does not send rain, lay it to the
   Christians." At every inundation, or drought, or famine, or pestilence,
   the fanatical populace cried: "Away with the atheists! To the lions
   with the Christians!"

   Finally, persecutions were sometimes started by priests, jugglers,
   artificers, merchants, and others, who derived their support from the
   idolatrous worship. These, like Demetrius at Ephesus, and the masters
   of the sorceress at Philippi, kindled the fanaticism and indignation of
   the mob against the new religion for its interference with their gains.

   § 16. Condition of the Church before the Reign of Trajan.

   The imperial persecutions before Trajan belong to the Apostolic age,
   and have been already described in the first volume. We allude to them
   here only for the sake of the connection. Christ was born under the
   first, and crucified under the second Roman emperor. Tiberius (a.d.
   14-37) is reported to have been frightened by Pilate's account of the
   crucifixion and resurrection, and to have proposed to the senate,
   without success, the enrollment of Christ among the Roman deities; but
   this rests only on the questionable authority of Tertullian. The edict
   of Claudius (42-54) in the year 53, which banished the Jews from Rome,
   fell also upon the Christians, but as Jews with whom they were
   confounded. The fiendish persecution of Nero (54-68) was intended as a
   punishment, not for Christianity, but for alleged incendiarism (64). It
   showed, however, the popular temper, and was a declaration of war
   against the new religion. It became a common saying among Christians
   that Nero would reappear as Antichrist.

   During the rapidly succeeding reigns of Galba, Otho, Vitellius,
   Vespacian, and Titus, the church, so far as we know, suffered no very
   serious persecution.

   But Domitian (81-96), a suspicious and blasphemous tyrant, accustomed
   to call himself and to be called "Lord and God," treated the embracing
   of Christianity a crime against the state, and condemned to death many
   Christians, even his own cousin, the consul Flavius Clemens, on the
   charge of atheism; or confiscated their property, and sent them, as in
   the case of Domitilia, the wife of the Clemens just mentioned, into
   exile. His jealousy also led him to destroy the surviving descendants
   of David; and he brought from Palestine to Rome two kinsmen of Jesus,
   grandsons of Judas, the "brother of the Lord," but seeing their poverty
   and rustic simplicity, and hearing their explanation of the kingdom of
   Christ as not earthly, but heavenly, to be established by the Lord at
   the end of the world, when He should come to judge the quick and the
   dead, he let them go. Tradition (in Irenaeus, Eusebius, Jerome) assigns
   to the reign of Domitian the banishment of John to Patmos (which,
   however, must be assigned to the reign of Nero), together with his
   miraculous preservation from death in Rome (attested by Tertullian),
   and the martyrdom of Andrew, Mark, Onesimus, and Dionysius the
   Areopagite. The Martyrium of Ignatius speaks of "many persecutions
   under Domitian."

   His humane and justice-loving successor, Nerva (96-98), recalled the
   banished, and refused to treat the confession of Christianity as a
   political crime, though he did not recognise the new religion as a
   religio licita.

   The Epistles of Ignatius will be discussed in chapter XIII. on
   ecclesiastical literature, §164 and 165.

   Trajan, one of the best and most praiseworthy emperors, honored as the
   "father of his country," but, like his friends, Tacitus and Pliny,
   wholly ignorant of the nature of Christianity, was the first to
   pronounce it in form a proscribed religion, as it had been all along in
   fact. He revived the rigid laws against all secret societies, [30] 9
   and the provincial officers applied them to the Christians, on account
   of their frequent meetings for worship. His decision regulated the
   governmental treatment of the Christians for more than a century . It
   is embodied in his correspondence with the younger Pliny, who was
   governor of Bithynia in Asia Minor from 109 to 111.

   Pliny came in official contact with the Christians. He himself saw in
   that religion only a "depraved and immoderate superstition," and could
   hardly account for its popularity. He reported to the emperor that this
   superstition was constantly spreading, not only in the cities, but also
   in the villages of Asia Minor, and captivated people of every age,
   rank, and sex, so that the temples were almost forsaken, and the
   sacrificial victims found no sale. To stop this progress, he condemned
   many Christians to death, and sent others, who were Roman citizens, to
   the imperial tribunal. But he requested of the emperor further
   instructions, whether, in these efforts, he should have respect to age;
   whether he should treat the mere bearing of the Christian name as a
   crime, if there were no other offence.

   To these inquiries Trajan replied: "You have adopted the right course,
   my friend, with regard to the Christians; for no universal rule, to be
   applied to all cases, can be laid down in this matter. They should not
   be searched for; but when accused and convicted, they should be
   punished; yet if any one denies that be has been a Christian, and
   proves it by action, namely, by worshipping our gods, he is to be
   pardoned upon his repentance, even though suspicion may still cleave to
   him from his antecedents. But anonymous accusations must not be
   admitted in any criminal process; it sets a bad example, and is
   contrary to our age" (i.e. to the spirit of Trajan's government).

   This decision was much milder than might have been expected from a
   heathen emperor of the old Roman stamp. Tertullian charges it with
   self-contradiction, as both cruel and lenient, forbidding the search
   for Christians and yet commanding their punishment, thus declaring them
   innocent and guilty at the same time. But the emperor evidently
   proceeded on political principles, and thought that a transient and
   contagious enthusiasm, as Christianity in his judgment was, could be
   suppressed sooner by leaving it unnoticed, than by openly assailing it.
   He wished to ignore it as much as possible. But every day it forced
   itself more and more upon public attention, as it spread with the
   irresistible power of truth.

   This rescript might give occasion, according to the sentiment of
   governors, for extreme severity towards Christianity as a secret union
   and a religio illicita. Even the humane Pliny tells us that he applied
   the rack to tender women. Syria and Palestine suffered heavy
   persecutions in this reign.

   Symeon, bishop of Jerusalem, and, like his predecessor James, a kinsman
   of Jesus, was accused by fanatical Jews, and crucified a.d. 107, at the
   age of a hundred and twenty years.

   In the same year (or probably between 110 and 116) the distinguished
   bishop Ignatius of Antioch was condemned to death, transported to Rome,
   and thrown before wild beasts in the Colosseum. The story of his
   martyrdom has no doubt been much embellished, but it must have some
   foundation in fact, and is characteristic of the legendary martyrology
   of the ancient church.

   Our knowledge of Ignatius is derived from his disputed epistles, [31] 0
   and a few short notices by Irenaeus and Origen. While his existence,
   his position in the early Church, and his martyrdom are admitted,
   everything else about him is called in question. How many epistles he
   wrote, and when he wrote them, how much truth there is in the account
   of his martyrdom, and when it took place, when it was written up, and
   by whom--all are undecided, and the subject of protracted controversy.
   He was, according to tradition, a pupil of the Apostle John, and by his
   piety so commended himself to the Christians in Antioch that he was
   chosen bishop, the second after Peter, Euodius being, the first. But
   although he was a man of apostolic character and governed the church
   with great care, he was personally not satisfied, until he should be
   counted worthy of sealing his testimony with his blood, and thereby
   attaining to the highest seat of honor. The coveted crown came to him
   at last and his eager and morbid desire for martyrdom was gratified.
   The emperor Trajan, in 107, came to Antioch, and there threatened with
   persecution all who refused to sacrifice to the gods. Ignatius was
   tried for this offence, and proudly confessed himself a "Theophorus"
   ("bearer of God") because, as he said, he had Christ within his breast.
   Trajan condemned him to be thrown to the lions at Rome. The sentence
   was executed with all haste. Ignatius was immediately bound in chains,
   and taken over land and sea, accompanied by ten soldiers, whom he
   denominated his "leopards," from Antioch to Seleucia, to Smyrna, where
   he met Polycarp, and whence be wrote to the churches, particularly to
   that in Rome; to Troas, to Neapolis, through Macedonia to Epirus, and
   so over the Adriatic to Rome. He was received by the Christians there
   with every manifestation of respect, but would not allow them to avert
   or even to delay his martyrdom. It was on the 20th day of December,
   107, that he was thrown into the amphitheater: immediately the wild
   beasts fell upon him, and soon naught remained of his body but a few
   bones, which were carefully conveyed to Antioch as an inestimable
   treasure. The faithful friends who had accompanied him from home
   dreamed that night that they saw him; some that he was standing by
   Christ, dropping with sweat as if he had just come from his great
   labor. Comforted by these dreams they returned with the relics to
   Antioch.

   Note on the Date of the Martyrdom of Ignatius.

   The date a.d.107 has in its favor the common reading of the best of the
   martyrologies of Ignatius (Colbertium)ennato etei, in the ninth year,
   i.e. from Trajan's accession, a.d. 98. From this there is no good
   reason to depart in favor of another reading tetarton etos, the
   nineteenth year, i.e. a.d. 116. Jerome makes the date a.d. 109. The
   fact that the names of the Roman consuls are correctly given in the
   Martyrium Colbertinum, is proof of the correctness of the date, which
   is accepted by such critics as Ussher, Tillemont, Möhler, Hefele, and
   Wieseler. The latter, in his work Die Christenverfolgungen der
   Caesaren, 1878, pp. 125 sqq., finds confirmation of this date in
   Eusebius's statement that the martyrdom took place before Trajan came
   to Antioch, which was in his 10th year; in the short interval between
   the martyrdom of Ignatius and Symeon, son of Klopas (Hist. Ecc. III.
   32); and finally, in the letter of Tiberian to Trajan, relating how
   many pressed forward to martyrdom--an effect, as Wieseler thinks, of
   the example of Ignatius. If 107 be accepted, then another supposition
   of Wieseler is probable. It is well known that in that year Trajan held
   an extraordinary triumph on account of his Dacian victories: may it not
   have been that the blood of Ignatius reddened the sand of the
   amphitheatre at that time?

   But 107 a.d. is by no means universally accepted. Keim (Rom und das
   Christenthum, p. 540) finds the Martyrium Colbertinum wrong in stating
   that the death took place under the first consulate of Sura and the
   second of Senecio, because in 107 Sura was consul for the third and
   Senecio for the fourth time. He also objects that Trajan was not in
   Antioch in 107, but in 115, on his way to attack the Armenians and
   Parthians. But this latter objection falls to the ground if Ignatius
   was not tried by Trajan personally in Antioch. Harnack concludes that
   it is only barely possible that Ignatius was martyred under Trajan.
   Lightfoot assigns the martyrdom to between 110 and 118.

   L'E'glise, chrétienne (1879), 1-44, and Wagenmann in Herzog, vol. v.
   501-506.

   Hadrian, of Spanish descent, a relative of Trajan, and adopted by him
   on his death-bed, was a man of brilliant talents and careful education,
   a scholar an artist, a legislator and administrator, and altogether one
   of the ablest among the Roman emperors, but of very doubtful morality,
   governed by changing moods, attracted in opposite directions, and at
   last lost in self-contradictions and utter disgust of life. His
   mausoleum (Moles Hadriani) still adorns, as the castle of Sant' Angelo,
   the bridge of the Tiber in Rome. He is represented both as a friend and
   foe of the church. He was devoted to the religion of the state,
   bitterly opposed to Judaism, indifferent to Christianity, from
   ignorance of it. He insulted the Jews and the Christians alike by
   erecting temples of Jupiter and Venus over the site of the temple and
   the supposed spot of the crucifixion. He is said to have directed the
   Asiatic proconsul to check the popular fury against the Christians, and
   to punish only those who should be, by an orderly judicial process,
   convicted of transgression of the laws. [32] 1 But no doubt he
   regarded, like Trajan, the mere profession of Christianity itself such
   a transgression.

   The Christian apologies, which took their rise under this emperor,
   indicate a very bitter public sentiment against the Christians, and a
   critical condition of the church. The least encouragement from Hadrian
   would have brought on a bloody persecution. Quadratus and Aristides
   addressed their pleas for their fellow-Christians to him, we do not
   know with what effect.

   Later tradition assigns to his reign the martyrdom of St. Eustachius,
   St. Symphorosa and her seven sons, of the Roman bishops Alexander and
   Telesphorus, and others whose names are scarcely known, and whose
   chronology is more than doubtful.

   [32] The rescript of Hadrian to Minucius Fundanus (124 or 128),
   preserved by Eusebius in a Greek translation, (H. H. E., IV. V. 8, 9),
   is almost an edict of toleration, and hence doubted by Baur, Keim,
   Aubé, but defended as genuine by Neander (I. 101, Engl. ed.), Wieseler,
   Funk, Renan (l.c. p. 32 sqq). Renan represents Hadrian as a rieur
   spirituel, un Lucian couronné prenat le monde comme un jeu frivole (p.
   6), and therefore more favorable to religious liberty than the serious
   Trajan and the pious Antoninius and Marcus Aurelius. But Friedländer
   (III. 492) accepts the report of Pausanias that Hadrian was zealously
   devoted to the worship of the gods. Keim regards him as a visionary and
   hostile to Christianity as well as to Judaism.

   Antoninus Pius protected the Christians from the tumultuous violence
   which broke out against them on account of the frequent public
   calamities. But the edict ascribed to him, addressed to the deputies of
   the Asiatic cities, testifying to the innocence of the Christians, and
   holding them up to the heathen as models of fidelity and zeal in the
   worship of God, could hardly have come from an emperor, who bore the
   honorable title of Pius for his conscientious adherence to the religion
   of his fathers; [33] 2 and in any case he could not have controlled the
   conduct of the provincial governors and the fury of the people against
   an illegal religion.

   The persecution of the church at Smyrna and the martyrdom of its
   venerable bishop, which was formerly assigned to the year 167, under
   the reign of Marcus Aurelius, took place, according to more recent
   research, under Antoninus in 155, when Statius Quadratus was proconsul
   in Asia Minor. [34] 3 Polycarp was a personal friend and pupil of the
   Apostle John, and chief presbyter of the church at Smyrna, where a
   plain stone monument still marks his grave. He was the teacher of
   Irenaeus of Lyons, and thus the connecting link between the apostolic
   and post-apostolic ages. As he died 155 at an age of eighty-six years
   or more, he must have been born a.d. 69, a year before the destruction
   of Jerusalem, and may have enjoyed the friendship of St. John for
   twenty years or more. This gives additional weight to his testimony
   concerning apostolic traditions and writings. We have from him a
   beautiful epistle which echoes the apostolic teaching, and will be
   noticed in another chapter.

   Polycarp steadfastly refused before the proconsul to deny his King and
   Saviour, whom he had served six and eighty years, and from whom he had
   experienced nothing but love and mercy. He joyfully went up to the
   stake, and amidst the flames praised God for having deemed him worthy
   "to be numbered among his martyrs, to drink the cup of Christ's
   sufferings, unto the eternal resurrection of the soul and the body in
   the incorruption of the Holy Spirit." The slightly legendary account in
   the letter of the church of Smyrna states, that the flames avoided the
   body of the saint, leaving it unharmed, like gold tried in the fire;
   also the Christian bystanders insisted, that they perceived a sweet
   odor, as of incense. Then the executioner thrust his sword into the
   body, and the stream of blood at once extinguished the flame. The
   corpse was burned after the Roman custom, but the bones were preserved
   by the church, and held more precious than gold and diamonds. The death
   of this last witness of the apostolic age checked the fury of the
   populace, and the proconsul suspended the persecution.

   the emperor wrote down, towards the close of his life, partly amid the

   for his self-improvement, his own moral reflections) together with
   striking maxims of wise and virtuous men. Ed. princeps by Xylander

   except so far as they show the life-long congenial friendship between
   the amiable teacher and his imperial pupil.

   in the middle of the second century, but proposes in a future work to
   trace it back to Isaiah (or the "Great Unknown") as its proper founder.

   On the legend of the Legio fulminatrix see Tertullian: Apol. 5; Euseb.:
   H. E V. 5.; and Dion Cass.: Hist. LXXI. 8, 9.

   Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher on the throne, was a well-educated,
   just, kind, and amiable emperor, and reached the old Roman ideal of
   self-reliant Stoic virtue, but for this very reason he had no sympathy
   with Christianity, and probably regarded it as an absurd and fanatical
   superstition. He had no room in his cosmopolitan philanthropy for the
   purest and most innocent of his subjects, many of whom served in his
   own army. He was flooded with apologies of Melito, Miltiades,
   Athenagoras in behalf of the persecuted Christians, but turned a deaf
   ear to them. Only once, in his Meditations, does he allude to them, and
   then with scorn, tracing their noble enthusiasm for martyrdom to "sheer
   obstinacy" and love for theatrical display. [35] 4 His excuse is
   ignorance. He probably never read a line of the New Testament, nor of
   the apologies addressed to him. [36] 5

   Belonging to the later Stoical school, which believed in an immediate
   absorption after death into the Divine essence, he considered the
   Christian doctrine of the immortality of the soul, with its moral
   consequences, as vicious and dangerous to the welfare of the state. A
   law was passed under his reign, punishing every one with exile who
   should endeavor to influence people's mind by fear of the Divinity, and
   this law was, no doubt, aimed at the Christians. [37] 6 At all events
   his reign was a stormy time for the church, although the persecutions
   cannot be directly traced to him. The law of Trajan was sufficient to
   justify the severest measures against the followers of the "forbidden"
   religion.

   About the year 170 the apologist Melito wrote: "The race of the
   worshippers of God in Asia is now persecuted by new edicts as it never
   has been heretofore; shameless, greedy sycophants, finding occasion in
   the edicts, now plunder the innocent day and night." The empire was
   visited at that time by a number of conflagrations, a destructive flood
   of the Tiber, an earthquake, insurrections, and particularly a
   pestilence, which spread from Ethiopia to Gaul. This gave rise to
   bloody persecutions, in which government and people united against the
   enemies of the gods and the supposed authors of these misfortunes.
   Celsus expressed his joy that "the demon" [of the Christians] was "not
   only reviled, but banished from every land and sea," and saw in this
   judgment the fulfilment of the oracle: "the mills of the gods grind
   late." But at the same time these persecutions, and the simultaneous
   literary assaults on Christianity by Celsus and Lucian, show that the
   new religion was constantly gaining importance in the empire.

   In 177, the churches of Lyons and Vienne, in the South of France,
   underwent a severe trial. Heathen slaves were forced by the rack to
   declare, that their Christian masters practised all the unnatural vices
   which rumor charged them with; and this was made to justify the
   exquisite tortures to which the Christians were subjected. But the
   sufferers, "strengthened by the fountain of living water from the heart
   of Christ," displayed extraordinary faith and steadfastness, and felt,
   that "nothing can be fearful, where the love of the Father is, nothing
   painful, where shines the glory of Christ."

   The most distinguished victims of this Gallic persecution were the
   bishop Pothinus, who, at the age of ninety years, and just recovered
   from a sickness, was subjected to all sorts of abuse, and then thrown
   into a dismal dungeon, where he died in two days; the virgin Blandina,
   a slave, who showed almost superhuman strength and constancy under the
   most cruel tortures, and was at last thrown to a wild beast in a net;
   Ponticus, a boy of fifteen years, who could be deterred by no sort of
   cruelty from confessing his Saviour. The corpses of the martyrs, which
   covered the streets, were shamefully mutilated, then burned, and the
   ashes cast into the Rhone, lest any remnants of the enemies of the gods
   might desecrate the soil. At last the people grew weary of slaughter,
   and a considerable number of Christians survived. The martyrs of Lyons
   distinguished themselves by true humility, disclaiming in their prison
   that title of honor, as due only, they said, to the faithful and true
   witness, the Firstborn from the dead, the Prince of life (Rev. 1:5),
   and to those of his followers who had already sealed their fidelity to
   Christ with their blood.

   About the same time a persecution of less extent appears to have
   visited Autun (Augustodunum) near Lyons. Symphorinus, a young man of
   good family, having refused to fall down before the image of Cybele,
   was condemned to be beheaded. On his way to the place of execution his
   own mother called to him: "My son, be firm and fear not that death,
   which so surely leads to life. Look to Him who reigns in heaven. To-day
   is thy earthly life not taken from thee, but transferred by a blessed
   exchange into the life of heaven."

   The story of the "thundering legion" [38] 7 rests on the fact of a
   remarkable deliverance of the Roman army in Hungary by a sudden shower,
   which quenched their burning thirst and frightened their barbarian
   enemies, a.d. 174. The heathens, however, attributed this not to the
   prayers of the Christian soldiers, but to their own gods. The emperor
   himself prayed to Jupiter: "This hand, which has never yet shed human
   blood, I raise to thee." That this event did not alter his views
   respecting the Christians, is proved by the persecution in South Gaul,
   which broke out three years later.

   Of isolated cases of martyrdom in this reign, we notice that of Justin
   Martyr, at Rome, in the year 166. His death is traced to the
   machinations of Crescens, a Cynic philosopher.

   Marcus Aurelius was succeeded by his cruel and contemptible son,
   Commodus (180-192), who wallowed in the mire of every sensual
   debauchery, and displayed at the same time like Nero the most
   ridiculous vanity as dancer and singer, and in the character of
   buffoon; but he was accidentally made to favor the Christians by the
   influence of a concubine, [39] 8 Marcia, and accordingly did not
   disturb them. Yet under his reign a Roman senator, Apollonius, was put
   to death for his faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [35] Med. xi. 3: Me kata psilen parataxin, hos hoi Christianoi, halla
   lelogismenos kai semnos kai, hoste kai allon p eisai atragodos

   [36] Bodek (l.c. p. 82 sqq.) maintains, contrary to the common view,
   that Marcus Aurelius was personally indifferent to heathenism and
   Christianity, that his acts of respect for the worship of the gods,
   related by Capitolinus and others, were simply official tributes, and
   that the persecutions of the Christians did probably not originate with
   him. "Er wareben so wenig ein Feind des Christenthums, als er ein Feind
   des Heidenthums war: was wie religiöser Fanatismus aussah,war in
   Wahrheit nur politischer Conservatismus" (p. 87). On the other hand,
   Bodek claims for him a friendly sympathy with Judaism in its
   monotheistic and ethical features, and assumes that he had intimate
   relations with a Jewish rabbi. But there is nothing in his twelve books
   "Do seipso et ad seipsum," which is inconsistent with an enlightened
   heathen piety under the unconscious influence of Christianity, yet
   hostile to it partly from ignorance of its true nature, partly from a
   conscientious regard to his duty as the pontifex maximus of the state
   religion. The same was the case with Trajan and Decius. Renan (p. 262
   sqq.) calls the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius "le livre le plus
   purement humain qu'il y ait. Il ne tranche aucune question
   controversée. En théologie, Marc Aurèle flotte entre le déisme pur, le
   polythéisme enterprété dans un sens physique, à la façon des stoïciens,
   et une sorte de panthéisme cosmique."

   [37] "Si quis aliquid fecerit, quo leves hominum animi superstitio
   numinis terrerentur, Divus Marcus hujusmodi homines in insulam relegari

   With Septimius Severus (193-211), who was of Punic descent and had a
   Syrian wife, a line of emperors (Caracalla, Heliogabalus, Alexander
   Severus) came to the throne, who were rather Oriental than Roman in
   their spirit, and were therefore far less concerned than the Antonines
   to maintain the old state religion. Yet towards the close of the second
   century there was no lack of local persecutions; and Clement of
   Alexandria wrote of those times: "Many martyrs are daily burned,
   confined, or beheaded, before our eyes."

   In the beginning of the third century (202) Septimius Severus, turned
   perhaps by Montanistic excesses, enacted a rigid law against the
   further spread both of Christianity and of Judaism. This occasioned
   violent persecutions in Egypt and in North Africa, and produced some of
   the fairest flowers of martyrdom.

   In Alexandria, in consequence of this law, Leonides, father of the
   renowned Origen, was beheaded. Potamiaena, a virgin of rare beauty of
   body and spirit, was threatened by beastly passion with treatment worse
   than death, and, after cruel tortures, slowly burned with her mother in
   boiling pitch. One of the executioners, Basilides, smitten with
   sympathy, shielded them somewhat from abuse, and soon after their death
   embraced Christianity, and was beheaded. He declared that Potamiaena
   had appeared to him in the night, interceded with Christ for him, and
   set upon his head the martyr's crown.

   In Carthage some catechumens, three young men and two young women,
   probably of the sect of the Montanists, showed remarkable steadfastness
   and fidelity in the dungeon and at the place of execution. Perpetua, a
   young woman of noble birth, resisting, not without a violent struggle,
   both the entreaties of her aged heathen father and the appeal of her
   helpless babe upon her breast, sacrificed the deep and tender feelings
   of a daughter and a mother to the Lord who died for her. Felicitas, a
   slave, when delivered of a child in the same dungeon, answered the
   jailor, who reminded her of the still keener pains of martyrdom: "Now I
   suffer, what I suffer; but then another will suffer for me, because I
   shall suffer for him." All remaining firm, they were cast to wild
   beasts at the next public festival, having first interchanged the
   parting kiss in hope of a speedy reunion in heaven.

   The same state of things continued through the first years of Caracalla
   (211-217), though this gloomy misanthrope passed no laws against the
   Christians.

   The abandoned youth, El-Gabal, or Heliogabalus (218-222), who polluted
   the throne by the blackest vices and follies, tolerated all the
   religions in the hope of at last merging them in his favorite Syrian
   worship of the sun with its abominable excesses. He himself was a
   priest of the god of the sun, and thence took his name. [40] 9

   His far more worthy cousin and successor, Alexander Severus (222-235),
   was addicted to a higher kind of religious eclecticism and syncretism,
   a pantheistic hero-worship. He placed the busts of Abraham and Christ
   in his domestic chapel with those of Orpheus, Apollonius of Tyana, and
   the better Roman emperors, and had the gospel rule, "As ye would that
   men should do to you, do ye even so to them," engraven on the walls of
   his palace, and on public monuments [41] 0. His mother, Julia Mammaea,
   was a patroness of Origen.

   His assassin, Maximinus the Thracian (235-238), first a herdsman,
   afterwards a soldier, resorted again to persecution out of mere
   opposition to his predecessor, and gave free course to the popular fury
   against the enemies of the gods, which was at that time excited anew by
   an earthquake. It is uncertain whether he ordered the entire clergy or
   only the bishops to be killed. He was a rude barbarian who plundered
   also heathen temples.

   The legendary poesy of the tenth century assigns to his reign the
   fabulous martyrdom of St. Ursula, a British princess, and her company
   of eleven thousand (according to others, ten thousand) virgins, who, on
   their return from a pilgrimage to Rome, were murdered by heathens in
   the neighborhood of Cologne. This incredible number has probably arisen
   from the misinterpretation of an inscription, like "Ursula et
   Undecimilla" (which occurs in an old missal of the Sorbonne), or
   "Ursula et XI M. V.," i.e. Martyres Virgines, which, by substituting
   milia for martyres, was increased from eleven martyrs to eleven
   thousand virgins. Some historians place the fact, which seems to form
   the basis of this legend, in connexion with the retreat of the Huns
   after the battle of Chalons, 451. The abridgment of Mil., which may
   mean soldiers (milites) as well as thousands (milia), was another
   fruitful source of mistakes in a credulous and superstitious age.

   Gordianus (208-244) left the church undisturbed. Philip the Arabian
   (244-249) was even supposed by some to be a Christian, and was termed
   by Jerome "primus omnium ex Romanis imperatoribus Christianus." It is
   certain that Origen wrote letters to him and to his wife, Severa.

   This season of repose, however, cooled the moral zeal and brotherly
   love of the Christians; and the mighty storm under the following reign
   served well to restore the purity of the church.

   Cyprian's martyrdom see the Proconsular Acts, and Pontius: Vita

   angebliche Christenverfolgung zur Zeit der Kaiser Numerianus und
   Carinus, in Hilgenfeld's "Zeitschrift für wissenschaftl. Theologie."
   1880 pp. 31-64.

   Decius Trajan (249-251), an earnest and energetic emperor, in whom the
   old Roman spirit once more awoke, resolved to root out the church as an
   atheistic and seditious sect, and in the year 250 published an edict to
   all the governors of the provinces, enjoining return to the pagan state
   religion under the heaviest penalties. This was the signal for a
   persecution which, in extent, consistency, and cruelty, exceeded all
   before it. In truth it was properly the first which covered the whole
   empire, and accordingly produced a far greater number of martyrs than
   any former persecution. In the execution of the imperial decree
   confiscation, exile, torture, promises and threats of all kinds, were
   employed to move the Christians to apostasy. Multitudes of nominal
   Christians, [42] 1 especially at the beginning, sacrificed to the gods
   (sacrificati, thurificati), or procured from the, magistrate a false
   certificate that they had done so (libellatici), and were then
   excommunicated as apostates (lapsi); while hundreds rushed with
   impetuous zeal to the prisons and the tribunals, to obtain the
   confessor's or martyr's crown. The confessors of Rome wrote from prison
   to their brethren of Africa: "What more glorious and blessed lot can
   fall to man by the grace of God, than to confess God the Lord amidst
   tortures and in the face of death itself; to confess Christ the Son of
   God with lacerated body and with a spirit departing, yet free; and to
   become fellow-sufferers with Christ in the name of Christ? Though we
   have not yet shed our blood, we are ready to do so. Pray for us, then,
   dear Cyprian, that the Lord, the best captain, would daily strengthen
   each one of us more and more, and at last lead us to the field as
   faithful soldiers, armed with those divine weapons (Eph. 6:2) which can
   never be conquered."

   The authorities were specially severe with the bishops and officers of
   the churches. Fabianus of Rome, Babylas of Antioch, and Alexander of
   Jerusalem, perished in this persecution. Others withdrew to places of
   concealment; some from cowardice; some from Christian prudence, in hope
   of allaying by their absence the fury of the pagans against their
   flocks, and of saving their own lives for the good of the church in
   better times.

   Among the latter was Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, who incurred much
   censure by his course, but fully vindicated himself by his pastoral
   industry during his absence, and by his subsequent martyrdom. He says
   concerning the matter: "Our Lord commanded us in times of persecution
   to yield and to fly. He taught this, and he practised it himself. For
   since the martyr's crown comes by the grace of God, and cannot be
   gained before the appointed hour, he who retires for a time, and
   remains true to Christ, does not deny his faith, but only abides his
   time."

   The poetical legend of the seven brothers at Ephesus, who fell asleep
   in a cave, whither they had fled, and awoke two hundred years
   afterwards, under Theodosius II. (447), astonished to see the once
   despised and hated cross now ruling over city and country, dates itself
   internally from the time of Decius, but is not mentioned before Gregory
   of Tours in the sixth century.

   Under Gallus (251-253) the persecution received a fresh impulse
   thorough the incursions of the Goths, and the prevalence of a
   pestilence, drought, and famine. Under this reign the Roman bishops
   Cornelius and Lucius were banished, and then condemned to death.

   Valerian (253-260) was at first mild towards the Christians; but in 257
   he changed his course, and made an effort to check the progress of
   their religion without bloodshed, by the banishment of ministers and
   prominent laymen, the confiscation of their property, and the
   prohibition of religious assemblies. These measures, however, proving
   fruitless, he brought the death penalty again into play.

   The most distinguished martyrs of this persecution under Valerian are
   the bishops Sixtus II. of Rome, and Cyprian of Carthage.

   When Cyprian received his sentence of death, representing him as an
   enemy of the Roman gods and laws, he calmly answered: "Deo gratias!"
   Then, attended by a vast multitude to the scaffold, he proved once
   more, undressed himself, covered his eyes, requested a presbyter to
   bind his hands, and to pay the executioner, who tremblingly drew the
   sword, twenty-five pieces of gold, and won the incorruptible crown
   (Sept. 14, 258). His faithful friends caught the blood in
   handkerchiefs, and buried the body of their sainted pastor with great
   solemnity.

   Gibbon describes the martyrdom of Cyprian with circumstantial
   minuteness, and dwells with evident satisfaction on the small decorum
   which attended his execution. But this is no fair average specimen of
   the style in which Christians were executed throughout the empire. For
   Cyprian was a man of the highest social standing and connection from
   his former eminence, as a rhetorician and statesman. His deacon,
   Pontius relates that "numbers of eminent and illustrious persons, men
   of mark family and secular distinction, often urged him, for the sake
   of their old friendship with him, to retire." We shall return to
   Cyprian again in the history of church government, where he figures as
   a typical, ante-Nicene high-churchman, advocating both the visible
   unity of the church and episcopal independence of Rome.

   The much lauded martyrdom of the deacon St. Laurentius of Rome, who
   pointed the avaricious magistrates to the poor and sick of the
   congregation as the richest treasure of the church, and is said to have
   been slowly roasted to death (Aug. 10, 258) is scarcely reliable in its
   details, being first mentioned by Ambrose a century later, and then
   glorified by the poet Prudentius. A Basilica on the Via Tiburtina
   celebrates the memory of this saint, who occupies the same position
   among the martyrs of the church of Rome as Stephen among those of
   Jerusalem.

   § 23. Temporary Repose. a.d. 260-303.

   Gallienus (260-268) gave peace to the church once more, and even
   acknowledged Christianity as a religio licita. And this calm continued
   forty years; for the edict of persecution, issued by the energetic and
   warlike Aurelian (270-275), was rendered void by his assassination; and
   the six emperors who rapidly followed, from 275 to 284, let the
   Christians alone.

   The persecutions under Carus, Numerianus and Carinus from 284 to 285
   are not historical, but legendary. [43] 2

   During this long season of peace the church rose rapidly in numbers and
   outward prosperity. Large and even splendid houses of worship were
   erected in the chief cities, and provided with collections of sacred
   books and vessels of gold and silver for the administration of the
   sacraments. But in the same proportion discipline relaxed, quarrels,
   intrigues, and factions increased, and worldliness poured in like a
   flood.

   Hence a new trial was a necessary and wholesome process of
   purification. [44] 3

   The forty years' repose was followed by, the last and most violent
   persecution, a struggle for life and death.

   "The accession of the Emperor Diocletian is the era from which the
   Coptic Churches of Egypt and Abyssinia still date, under the name of
   the 'Era of Martyrs.' All former persecutions of the faith were
   forgotten in the horror with which men looked back upon the last and
   greatest: the tenth wave (as men delighted to count it) of that great
   storm obliterated all the traces that had been left by others. The
   fiendish cruelty of Nero, the jealous fears of Domitian, the
   unimpassioned dislike of Marcus, the sweeping purpose of Decius, the
   clever devices of Valerian, fell into obscurity when compared with the
   concentrated terrors of that final grapple, which resulted in the
   destruction of the old Roman Empire and the establishment of the Cross
   as the symbol of the world's hope." [45] 4

   Diocletian (284-305) was one of the most judicious and able emperors
   who, in a trying period, preserved the sinking state from dissolution.
   He was the son of a slave or of obscure parentage, and worked himself
   up to supreme power. He converted the Roman republican empire into an
   Oriental despotism, and prepared the way for Constantine and
   Constantinople. He associated with himself three subordinate
   co-regents, Maximian (who committed suicide, 310), Galerius (d. 311),
   and Constantius Chlorus (d. 306, the father of Constantine the Great),
   and divided with them the government of the immense empire; thereby
   quadrupling the personality of the sovereign, and imparting vigor to
   provincial administration, but also sowing the seed of discord and
   civil war [46] 5. Gibbon calls him a second Augustus, the founder of a
   new empire, rather than the restorer of the old. He also compares him
   to Charles V., whom he somewhat resembled in his talents, temporary
   success and ultimate failure, and voluntary retirement from the cares
   of government.

   In the first twenty years of his reign Diocletian respected the
   toleration edict of Gallienus. His own wife Prisca his daughter
   Valeria, and most of his eunuchs and court officers, besides many of
   the most prominent public functionaries, were Christians, or at least
   favorable to the Christian religion. He himself was a superstitious
   heathen and an oriental despot. Like Aurelian and Domitian before him,
   he claimed divine honors, as the vicar of Jupiter Capitolinus. He was
   called, as the Lord and Master of the world, Sacratissimus Dominus
   Noster; he guarded his Sacred Majesty with many circles of soldiers and
   eunuchs, and allowed no one to approach him except on bended knees, and
   with the forehead touching the ground, while he was seated on the
   throne in rich vestments from the far East. "Ostentation," says Gibbon,
   "was the first principle of the new system instituted by Diocletian."
   As a practical statesman, he must have seen that his work of the
   political restoration and consolidation of the empire would lack a firm
   and permanent basis without the restoration of the old religion of the
   state. Although he long postponed the religious question, he had to
   meet it at last. It could not be expected, in the nature of the case,
   that paganism should surrender to its dangerous rival without a last
   desperate effort to save itself.

   But the chief instigator of the renewal of hostility, according to the
   account of Lactantius, was Diocletian's co-regent and son-in-law,
   Galerius, a cruel and fanatical heathen. [47] 6 He prevailed at last on
   Diocletian in his old age to authorize the persecution which gave to
   his glorious reign a disgraceful end.

   In 303 Diocletian issued in rapid succession three edicts, each more
   severe than its predecessor. Maximian issued the fourth, the worst of
   all, April 30, 304. Christian churches were to be destroyed; all copies
   of the Bible were to be burned; all Christians were to be deprived of
   public office and civil rights; and at last all, without exception,
   were to sacrifice to the gods upon pain of death. Pretext for this
   severity was afforded by the occurrence of fire twice in the palace of
   Nicomedia in Bithynia, where Diocletian resided [48] 7. It was
   strengthened by the tearing down of the first edict by an imprudent
   Christian (celebrated in the Greek church under the name of John), who
   vented in that way his abhorrence of such "godless and tyrannical
   rulers," and was gradually roasted to death with every species of
   cruelty. But the conjecture that the edicts were occasioned by a
   conspiracy of the Christians who, feeling their rising power, were for
   putting the government at once into Christian hands, by a stroke of
   state, is without any foundation in history. It is inconsistent with
   the political passivity of the church during the first three centuries,
   which furnish no example of rebellion and revolution. At best such a
   conspiracy could only have been the work of a few fanatics; and they,
   like the one who tore down the first edict, would have gloried in the
   deed and sought the crown of martyrdom. [49] 8

   The persecution began on the twenty-third day of February, 303, the
   feast of the Terminalia (as if to make an end of the Christian sect),
   with the destruction of the magnificent church in Nicomedia, and soon
   spread over the whole Roman empire, except Gaul, Britain, and Spain,
   where the co-regent Constantius Chlorus, and especially his son,
   Constantine the Great (from 306), were disposed, as far as possible, to
   spare the Christians. But even here the churches were destroyed, and
   many martyrs of Spain (St. Vincentius, Eulalia, and others celebrated
   by Prudentins), and of Britain (St. Alban) are assigned by later
   tradition to this age.

   The persecution raged longest and most fiercely in the East under the
   rule of Galerius and his barbarous nephew Maximin Daza, who was
   intrusted by Diocletian before his retirement with the dignity of
   Caesar and the extreme command of Egypt and Syria [50] 9. He issued in
   autumn, 308, a fifth edict of persecution, which commanded that all
   males with their wives and servants, and even their children, should
   sacrifice and actually taste the accursed offerings, and that all
   provisions in the markets should be sprinkled with sacrificial wine.
   This monstrous law introduced a reign of terror for two years, and left
   [51] 0 the Christians no alternative but apostasy or starvation. All
   the pains, which iron and steel, fire and sword, rack and cross, wild
   beasts and beastly men could inflict, were employed to gain the useless
   end.

   Eusebius was a witness of this persecution in Caesura, Tyre, and Egypt,
   and saw, with his own eyes, as he tells us, the houses of prayer razed
   to the ground, the Holy Scriptures committed to the flames on the
   market places, the pastors hunted, tortured, and torn to pieces in the
   amphitheatre. Even the wild beasts, he says, not without rhetorical
   exaggeration, at last refused to attack the Christians, as if they had
   assumed the part of men in place of the heathen Romans; the bloody
   swords became dull and shattered; the executioners grew weary, and had
   to relieve each other; but the Christians sang hymns of praise and
   thanksgiving in honor of Almighty God, even to their latest breath. He
   describes the heroic sufferings and death of several martyrs, including
   his friend, "the holy and blessed Pamphilus," who after two years of
   imprisonment won the crown of life (309), with eleven others--a typical
   company that seemed to him to be "a perfect representation of the
   church."

   Eusebius himself was imprisoned, but released. The charge of having
   escaped martyrdom by offering sacrifice is without foundation. [52] 1

   In this, as in former persecutions, the number of apostates who
   preferred the earthly life to the heavenly, was very great. To these
   was now added also the new class of the traditores, who delivered the
   holy Scriptures to the heathen authorities, to be burned. But as the
   persecution raged, the zeal and fidelity of the Christians increased,
   and martyrdom spread as by contagion. Even boys and girls showed
   amazing firmness. In many the heroism of faith degenerated to a
   fanatical courting of death; confessors were almost worshipped, while
   yet alive; and the hatred towards apostates distracted many
   congregations, and produced the Meletian and Donatist schisms.

   The number of martyrs cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty.
   The seven episcopal and the ninety-two Palestinian martyrs of Eusebius
   are only a select list bearing a similar relation to the whole number
   of victims as the military lists its of distinguished fallen officers
   to the large mass of common soldiers, and form therefore no fair basis
   for the calculation of Gibbon, who would reduce the whole number to
   less than two thousand. During the eight years [53] 2 of this
   persecution the number of victims, without including the many
   confessors who were barbarously mutilated and condemned to a lingering
   death in the prisons and mines, must have been much larger. But there
   is no truth in the tradition (which figures in older church histories)
   that the tyrants erected trophies in Spain and elsewhere with such
   inscriptions as announce the suppression of the Christian sect. [54] 3

   The martyrologies date from this period several legends, the germs of
   which, however, cannot now be clearly sifted from the additions of
   later poesy. The story of the destruction of the legio Thebaica is
   probably an exaggeration of the martyrdom of St. Mauritius, who was
   executed in Syria, as tribunus militum, with seventy soldiers, at the
   order of Maximin. The martyrdom of Barlaam, a plain, rustic Christian
   of remarkable constancy, and of Gordius, a centurion (who, however, was
   tortured and executed a few years later under Licinius, 314) has been
   eulogized by St. Basil. A maiden of thirteen years, St. Agnes, whose
   memory the Latin church has celebrated ever since the fourth century,
   was, according to tradition, brought in chains before the judgment-seat
   in Rome; was publicly exposed, and upon her steadfast confession put to
   the sword; but afterwards appeared to her grieving parents at her grave
   with a white lamb and a host of shining virgins from heaven, and said:
   "Mourn me no longer as dead, for ye see that I live. Rejoice with me,
   that I am forever united in heaven with the Saviour, whom on earth I
   loved with all my heart." Hence the lamb in the paintings of this
   saint; and hence the consecration of lambs in her church at Rome at her
   festival (Jan. 21), from whose wool the pallium of the archbishop is
   made. Agricola and Vitalis at Bologna, Gervasius and Protasius at
   Milan, whose bones were discovered in the time of Ambrose Janurius,
   bishop of Benevent, who became the patron saint of Naples, and
   astonishes the faithful by the annual miracle of the liquefaction of
   his blood, and the British St. Alban, who delivered himself to the
   authorities in the place of the priest he had concealed in his house,
   and converted his executioner, are said to have attained martyrdom
   under Diocletian. [55] 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   [45] So Arthur James Mason begins his book on thePersecution of
   Diocletian.

   [46] Maximian (surnamed Herculius) ruled in Italy and Africa, Galerius
   (Armentarius) on the banks of the Danube, and afterwards in the East,
   Constantius (Chlorus) in Gaul, Spain, and Britain; while Diocletian
   reserved to himself Asia, Egypt, and Thrace, and resided in Nicomedia.
   Galerius married a daughter of Diocletian (the unfortunate Valeria),
   Constantius a (nominal) daughter of Maximian (Theodora), after
   repudiating their former wives. Constantine, the son of the divorced
   Helena, married Fausta, the daughter of Maximian as his second wife
   (father and son being married to two sisters). He was raised to the
   dignity of Caesar, July 25, 306. See Gibbon, chs. XIII and XIV.

   [47] Lactantius (De Morte. Persec. c. 9), calls him "a wild beast, " in
   whom dwelt "a native barbarity and a savageness foreign to Roman
   blood." He died at last of a terrible disease, of which Lacantius gives
   a minute account (ch. 33).

   [48] Lactantius charges the incendiarism on Galerius who, as a second
   Nero, endangered the residence for the purpose of punishing the
   innocent Christians. Constantine, who then resided at the Court, on a
   solemn occasion at a later period, attributes the fire to lightning
   (Orat. ad Sanct. c. 25), but the repetition of the occurrence
   strengthens the suspicion of Lactantius.

   [49] Gibbon, ch. XVI., intimates the probability of a political plot.
   In speaking of the fire in the imperial palace of Nicomedia, he says:
   "The suspicion naturally fell on the Christians; and it was suggested,
   with some degree of probability, that those desperate fanatics,
   provoked by their present sufferings, and apprehensive of impending
   calamities, had entered into a conspiracy with their faithful brethren,
   the eunuchs of the palace, against the lives of two emperors, whom they
   detested as the irreconcilable enemies of the Church of God." The
   conjecture of Gibbon was renewed by Burkhardt in his work on
   Constantine, pp. 332 ff, but without any evidence. Baur rejects it as
   artificial and very improbable. (Kirchengesch. I. 452, note). Mason (p.
   97 sq.) refutes it.

   [50] See Lactant., De Morte Persec. ch. 18 and 19, 32, and Gibbon, ch.
   XIV. V. (vol. II. 16 in Smith's edition). The original name of Maximin
   was Daza. He must not be confounded with Maximian (who was older and
   died three years before him). He was a rude, ignorant and superstitious
   tyrant, equal to Galerius in cruelty and surpassing him in incredible
   debauchery (See Lact. l.c. ch. 37 sqq.). He died of poison after being
   defeated by Licinius in 313.

   [51] See on this edict of Maximin, Euseb. Mart. Pal. IX. 2; the Acts of
   Martyrs in Boll., May 8, p. 291, and Oct. 19, p. 428; Mason, l.c. 284
   sqq.

   [52] Lightfoot vindicates him in his learned art. Euseb. in Smith and
   Wace, Dict. of Christ. Biogr. II. 311.

   § 25. The Edicts of Toleration. a.d. 311-313.

   See Lit. in § 24, especially Keim, and Mason (Persecution of
   Diocletian, pp. 299 and 326 sqq.)

   This persecution was the last desperate struggle of Roman heathenism
   for its life. It was the crisis of utter extinction or absolute
   supremacy for each of the two religions. At the close of the contest
   the old Roman state religion was exhausted. Diocletian retired into
   private life in 305, under the curse of the Christians; he found
   greater pleasure in planting cabbages at Salona in his native Dalmatia,
   than in governing a vast empire, but his peace was disturbed by the
   tragical misfortunes of his wife and daughter, and in 313, when all the
   achievements of his reign were destroyed, he destroyed himself.

   Galerius, the real author of the persecution, brought to reflection by
   a terrible disease, put an end to the slaughter shortly before his
   death, by a remarkable edict of toleration, which he issued from
   Nicomedia in 311, in connexion with Constantine and Licinius. In that
   document he declared, that the purpose of reclaiming the Christians
   from their wilful innovation and the multitude of their sects to the
   laws and discipline of the, Roman state, was not accomplished; and that
   he would now grant them permission to hold their religious assemblies
   provided they disturbed not the order of the state. To this he added in
   conclusion the significant instruction that the Christians, "after this
   manifestation of grace, should pray to their God for the welfare of the
   emperors, of the state, and of themselves, that the state might prosper
   in every respect, and that they might live quietly in their homes."
   [56] 5

   This edict virtually closes the period of persecution in the Roman
   empire.

   For a short time Maximin, whom Eusebius calls "the chief of tyrants,"
   continued in every way to oppress and vex the church in the East, and
   the cruel pagan Maxentius (a son of Maximian and son-in-law of
   Galerius) did the same in Italy.

   But the young Constantine, who hailed from the far West, had already,
   in 306, become emperor of Gaul, Spain, and Britain. He had been brought
   up at the court of Diocletian at Nicomedia (like Moses at the court of
   Pharaoh) and destined for his successor, but fled from the intrigues of
   Galerius to Britain, and was appointed by his father and proclaimed by
   the army as his successor. He crossed the Alps, and under the banner of
   the cross, he conquered Maxentius at the Milvian bridge near Rome, and
   the heathen tyrant perished with his army of veterans in the waters of
   the Tiber, Oct. 27, 312. A few months afterwards Constantine met at
   Milan with his co-regent and brother-in-law, Licinius, and issued a new
   edict of toleration (313), to which Maximin also, shortly before his
   suicide (313), was compelled to give his consent at Nicomedia. [57] 6
   The second edict went beyond the first of 311; it was a decisive step
   from hostile neutrality to friendly neutrality and protection, and
   prepared the way for the legal recognition of Christianity, as the
   religion of the empire. It ordered the full restoration of all
   confiscated church property to the Corpus Christianorum, at the expense
   of the imperial treasury, and directed the provincial magistrates to
   execute this order at once with all energy, so that peace may be fully
   established and the continuance of the Divine favor secured to the
   emperors and their subjects.

   This was the first proclamation of the great principle that every man
   had a right to choose his religion according to the dictates of his own
   conscience and honest conviction, without compulsion and interference
   from the government. [58] 7 Religion is worth nothing except as an act
   of freedom. A forced religion is no religion at all. Unfortunately, the
   successors of Constantine from the time of Theodosius the Great
   (383-395) enforced the Christian religion to the exclusion of every
   other; and not only so, but they enforced orthodoxy to the exclusion of
   every form of dissent, which was punished as a crime against the state.

   Paganism made another spasmodic effort. Licinius fell out with
   Constantine and renewed the persecution for a short time in the East,
   but he was defeated in 323, and Constantine became sole ruler of the
   empire. He openly protected and favored the church, without forbidding
   idolatry, and upon the whole remained true to his policy of protective
   toleration till his death (337). This was enough for the success of the
   church, which had all the vitality and energy of a victorious power;
   while heathenism was fast decaying at its root.

   With Constantine, therefore, the last of the heathen, the first of the
   Christian, emperors, a new period begins. The church ascends the throne
   of the Caesars under the banner of the once despised, now honored and
   triumphant cross, and gives new vigor and lustre to the hoary empire of
   Rome. This sudden political and social revolution seems marvellous; and
   yet it was only the legitimate result of the intellectual and moral
   revolution which Christianity, since the second century, had silently
   and imperceptibly wrought in public opinion. The very violence of the
   Diocletian persecution betrayed the inner weakness of heathenism. The
   Christian minority with its ideas already controlled the deeper current
   of history. Constantine, as a sagacious statesman, saw the signs of the
   times and followed them. The motto of his policy is well symbolized in
   his military standard with the inscription: "Hoc signo vinces." [59] 8

   What a contrast between Nero, the first imperial persecutor, riding in
   a chariot among Christian martyrs as burning torches in his gardens,
   and Constantine, seated in the Council of Nicaea among three hundred
   and eighteen bishops (some of whom--as the blinded Confessor
   Paphnutius, Paul of Neocaesarea, and the ascetics from Upper Egypt
   clothed in wild raiment--wore the insignia of torture on their maimed
   and crippled bodies), and giving the highest sanction of civil
   authority to the decree of the eternal deity of the once crucified
   Jesus of Nazareth! Such a revolution the world has never seen before or
   since, except the silent, spiritual, and moral reformation wrought by
   Christianity itself at its introduction in the first, and at its
   revival in the sixteenth century.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [56] M. de Broglie (L'Église et l'Empire, I. 182) well characterizes
   this manifesto: "Singulier document, moitié insolent, moitié suppliant,
   qui commence par insulter chrétiens et finit par leur demander de prier
   leur maÎ tre pour lui." Mason (1. c. p. 299): "The dying emperor shows
   no penitence, makes no confession, except his impotence. He wishes to
   dupe and outwit the angry Christ, by pretending to be not a persecutor
   but a reformer. With a curse, he dashes his edict of toleration in the
   church's face, and hopes superstitiously that it will win him
   indemnity."

   [57] It is usually stated (also by Keim, l.c., Gieseler, Baur, vol. I..
   454 sqq.), that Constantine and Licinius issued two edicts of
   toleration, one in the year 312, and one from Milan in 313, since the
   last refers to a previous edict, but the reference seems to be to
   directions now lost for officials which accompanied the edict of
   Galerius (311), of which Constantine was a co-signatory. There is no
   edict of 312. See Zahn and especially Mason (p. 328 sq.), also Uhlhorn
   (Conflict, etc., p. 497, Engl. translation).

   [58] "Ut daremus et Christianis et omnibus liberam potestatem sequendi
   religionem, quam quiscunque voluisset." See Euseb. H. X. 5; Lactant. De
   Mort. Pers. c. 48. Mason (p. 327) says of the Edict of Milan: "It is
   the very first announcement of that doctrine which is now regarded as
   the mark and principle of civilization, the foundation of solid
   liberty, the characteristic of modern politics. In vigorous and
   trenchant sentences it sets forth perfect freedom of conscience, the
   unfettered choice of religion."

   To these protracted and cruel persecutions the church opposed no
   revolutionary violence, no carnal resistance, but the moral heroism of
   suffering and dying for the truth. But this very heroism was her
   fairest ornament and staunchest weapon. In this very heroism she proved
   herself worthy of her divine founder, who submitted to the death of the
   cross for the salvation of the world, and even prayed that his
   murderers might be forgiven. The patriotic virtues of Greek and Roman
   antiquity reproduced themselves here in exalted form, in self-denial
   for the sake of a heavenly country, and for a crown that fadeth not
   away. Even boys and girls became heroes, and rushed with a holy
   enthusiasm to death. In those hard times men had to make earnest of the
   words of the Lord: "Whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after
   me, cannot be my disciple." "He, that loveth father and mother more
   than me, is not worthy of me." But then also the promise daily proved
   itself true: "Blessed are they, who are persecuted for righteousness'
   sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." "He, that loseth his life
   for my sake, shall find it." And it applied not only to the martyrs
   themselves, who exchanged the troubled life of earth for the
   blessedness of heaven, but also to the church as a whole, which came
   forth purer and stronger from every persecution, and thus attested her
   indestructible vitality.

   These suffering virtues are among the sweetest and noblest fruits of
   the Christian religion. It is not so much the amount of suffering which
   challenges our admiration, although it was terrible enough, as the
   spirit with which the early Christians bore it. Men and women of all
   classes, noble senators and learned bishops, illiterate artisans and
   poor slaves, loving mothers and delicate virgins, hoary-headed pastors
   and innocent children approached their tortures in no temper of
   unfeeling indifference and obstinate defiance, but, like their divine
   Master, with calm self-possession, humble resignation, gentle meekness,
   cheerful faith, triumphant hope, and forgiving charity. Such spectacles
   must have often overcome even the inhuman murderer. "Go on," says
   Tertullian tauntingly to the heathen governors, "rack, torture, grind
   us to powder: our numbers increase in proportion as ye mow us down. The
   blood of Christians is their harvest seed. Your very obstinacy is a
   teacher. For who is not incited by the contemplation of it to inquire
   what there is in the core of the matter? And who, after having joined
   us, does not long to suffer?" [60] 9

   Unquestionably there were also during this period, especially after
   considerable seasons of quiet, many superficial or hypocritical
   Christians, who, the moment the storm of persecution broke forth, flew
   like chaff from the wheat, and either offered incense to the gods
   (thurificati, sacrificati), or procured false witness of their return
   to paganism (libellatici, from libellum), or gave up the sacred books
   (traditores). Tertullian relates with righteous indignation that whole
   congregations, with the clergy at the head, would at times resort to
   dishonorable bribes in order to avert the persecution of heathen
   magistrates. [61] 0 But these were certainly cases of rare exception.
   Generally speaking the three sorts of apostates (lapsi) were at once
   excommunicated, and in many churches, through excessive rigor, were
   even refused restoration.

   Those who cheerfully confessed Christ before the heathen magistrate at
   the peril of life, but were not executed, were honored as confessors.
   [62] 1 Those who suffered abuse of all kind and death itself, for their
   faith, were called martyrs or bloodwitnesses. [63] 2

   Among these confessors and martyrs were not wanting those in whom the
   pure, quiet flame of enthusiasm rose into the wild fire of fanaticism,
   and whose zeal was corrupted with impatient haste, heaven-tempting
   presumption, and pious ambition; to whom that word could be applied:
   "Though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me
   nothing." They delivered themselves up to the heathen officers, and in
   every way sought the martyr's crown, that they might merit heaven and
   be venerated on earth as saints. Thus Tertullian tells of a company of
   Christians in Ephesus, who begged martyrdom from the heathen governor,
   but after a few had been executed, the rest were sent away by him with
   the words: "Miserable creatures, if you really wish to die, you have
   precipices and halters enough." Though this error was far less
   discreditable than the opposite extreme of the cowardly fear of man,
   yet it was contrary to the instruction and the example of Christ and
   the apostles, [64] 3 and to the spirit of true martyrdom, which
   consists in the union of sincere humility and power, and possesses
   divine strength in the very consciousness of human weakness. And
   accordingly intelligent church teachers censured this stormy, morbid
   zeal. The church of Smyrna speaks thus: "We do not commend those who
   expose themselves; for the gospel teaches not so." Clement of
   Alexandria says: "The Lord himself has commanded us to flee to another
   city when we are persecuted; not as if the persecution were an evil;
   not as if we feared death; but that we may not lead or help any to evil
   doing." In Tertullian's view martyrdom perfects itself in divine
   patience; and with Cyprian it is a gift of divine grace, which one
   cannot hastily grasp, but must patiently wait for.

   But after all due allowance for such adulteration and degeneracy, the
   martyrdom of the first three centuries still remains one of the
   grandest phenomena of history, and an evidence of the indestructible
   divine nature of Christianity.

   No other religion could have stood for so long a period the combined
   opposition of Jewish bigotry, Greek philosophy, and Roman policy and
   power; no other could have triumphed at last over so many foes by
   purely moral and spiritual force, without calling any carnal weapons to
   its aid. This comprehensive and long-continued martyrdom is the
   peculiar crown and glory of the early church; it pervaded its entire
   literature and gave it a predominantly apologetic character; it entered
   deeply into its organization and discipline and the development of
   Christian doctrine; it affected the public worship and private
   devotions; it produced a legendary poetry; but it gave rise also,
   innocently, to a great deal of superstition, and undue exaltation of
   human merit; and it lies at the foundation of the Catholic worship of
   saints and relics.

   Sceptical writers have endeavored to diminish its moral effect by
   pointing to the fiendish and hellish scenes of the papal crusades
   against the Albigenses and Waldenses, the Parisian massacre of the
   Huguenots, the Spanish Inquisition, and other persecutions of more
   recent date. Dodwell expressed the opinion, which has been recently
   confirmed by the high authority of the learned and impartial Niebuhr,
   that the Diocletian persecution was a mere shadow as compared with the
   persecution of the Protestants in the Netherlands by the Duke of Alva
   in the service of Spanish bigotry and despotism. Gibbon goes even
   further, and boldly asserts that "the number of Protestants who were
   executed by the Spaniards in a single province and a single reign, far
   exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the space of three centuries
   and of the Roman empire." The victims of the Spanish Inquisition also
   are said to outnumber those of the Roman emperors. [65] 4

   Admitting these sad facts, they do not justify any sceptical
   conclusion. For Christianity is no more responsible for the crimes and
   cruelties perpetrated in its name by unworthy professors and under the
   sanction of an unholy alliance of politics and religion, than the Bible
   for all the nonsense men have put into it, or God for the abuse daily
   and hourly practised with his best gifts. But the number of martyrs
   must be judged by the total number of Christians who were a minority of
   the population. The want of particular statements by contemporary
   writers leaves it impossible to ascertain, even approximately, the
   number of martyrs. Dodwell and Gibbon have certainly underrated it, as
   far as Eusebius, the popular tradition since Constantine, and the
   legendary poesy of the middle age, have erred the other way. This is
   the result of recent discovery and investigation, and fully admitted by
   such writers as Renan. Origen, it is true, wrote in the middle of the
   third century, that the number of Christian martyrs was small and easy
   to be counted; God not permitting that all this class of men should be
   exterminated. [66] 5 But this language must be understood as referring
   chiefly to the reigns of Caracalla, Heliogabalus, Alexander Severus and
   Philippus Arabs, who did not persecute the Christians. Soon afterwards
   the fearful persecution of Decius broke out, in which Origen himself
   was thrown into prison and cruelly treated. Concerning the preceding
   ages, his statement must be qualified by the equally valid testimonies
   of Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria (Origen's teacher), and the still
   older Irenaeus, who says expressly, that the church, for her love to
   God, "sends in all places and at all times a multitude of martyrs to
   the Father." [67] 6 Even the heathen Tacitus speaks of an "immense
   multitude" (ingens multitudo) of Christians, who were murdered in the
   city of Rome alone during the Neronian persecution in 64. To this must
   be added the silent, yet most eloquent testimony of the Roman
   catacombs, which, according to the calculation of Marchi and Northcote,
   extended over nine hundred English miles, and are said to contain
   nearly seven millions of graves, a large proportion of these including
   the relics of martyrs, as the innumerable inscriptions and instruments
   of death testify. The sufferings, moreover, of the church during this
   period are of course not to be measured merely by the number of actual
   executions, but by the far more numerous insults, slanders, vexatious,
   and tortures, which the cruelty of heartless heathens and barbarians
   could devise, or any sort of instrument could inflict on the human
   body, and which were in a thousand cases worse than death.

   Finally, while the Christian religion has at all times suffered more or
   less persecution, bloody or unbloody, from the ungodly world, and
   always had its witnesses ready for any sacrifice; yet at no period
   since the first three centuries was the whole church denied the right
   of a peaceful legal existence, and the profession of Christianity
   itself universally declared and punished as a political crime. Before
   Constantine the Christians were a helpless and proscribed minority in
   an essentially heathen world, and under a heathen government. Then they
   died not simply for particular doctrines, but for the facts of
   Christianity. Then it was a conflict, not for a denomination or sect,
   but for Christianity itself. The importance of ancient martyrdom does
   not rest so much on the number of victims and the cruelty of their
   sufferings as on the great antithesis and the ultimate result in saving
   the Christian religion for all time to come. Hence the first three
   centuries are the classical period of heathen persecution and of
   Christian martyrdom. The martyrs and confessors of the ante-Nicene age
   suffered for the common cause of all Christian denominations and sects,
   and hence are justly held in reverence and gratitude by all.

   Notes.

   Dr. Thomas Arnold, who had no leaning to superstitious and idolatrous
   saint-worship, in speaking of a visit to the church of San Stefano at
   Rome, remarks: "No doubt many of the particular stories thus painted
   will bear no critical examination; it is likely enough, too, that
   Gibbon has truly accused the general statements of exaggeration. But
   this is a thankless labor. Divide the sum total of the reported martyrs
   by twenty--by fifty, if you will; after all you have a number of
   persons of all ages and sexes suffering cruel torment and death for
   conscience' sake, and for Christ's; and by their sufferings manifestly
   with God's blessing ensuring the triumph of Christ's gospel. Neither do
   I think that we consider the excellence of this martyr spirit half
   enough. I do not think that pleasure is a sin; but though pleasure is
   not a sin, yet surely the contemplation of suffering for Christ's sake
   is a thing most needful for us in our days, from whom in our daily life
   suffering seems so far removed. And as God's grace enabled rich and
   delicate persons, women and even children, to endure all extremities of
   pain and reproach, in times past; so there is the same grace no less
   mighty now; and if we do not close ourselves against it, it might be in
   us no less glorious in a time of trial."

   Lecky, a very able and impartial historian, justly censures the
   unfeeling chapter of Gibbon on persecution. "The complete absence," he
   says (History of European Morals, I. 494 sqq.), "of all sympathy with
   the heroic courage manifested by the martyrs, and the frigid, and in
   truth most unphilosophical severity with which the historian has
   weighed the words and actions of men engaged in the agonies of a
   deadly, struggle, must repel every generous nature, while the
   persistence with which he estimates persecutions by the number of
   deaths rather than the amount of suffering, diverts the mind from the
   really distinctive atrocities of the Pagan persecutions .... It is true
   that in one Catholic country they introduced the atrocious custom of
   making the spectacle of men burnt alive for their religious opinions an
   element in the public festivities. It is true, too, that the immense
   majority of the acts of the martyrs are the transparent forgeries of
   lying monks; but it is also true that among the authentic records of
   Pagan persecutions there are histories, which display, perhaps more
   vividly than any other, both the depth of cruelty to which human nature
   may sink, and the heroism of resistance it may attain. There was a time
   when it was the just boast of the Romans, that no refinement of
   cruelty, no prolongations of torture, were admitted in their stern but
   simple penal code. But all this was changed. Those hateful games, which
   made the spectacle of human suffering and death the delight of all
   classes, had spread their brutalising influence wherever the Roman name
   was known, had rendered millions absolutely indifferent to the sight of
   human suffering, had produced in many, in the very centre of an
   advanced civilisation, a relish and a passion for torture, a rapture
   and an exultation in watching the spasms of extreme agony, such as an
   African or an American savage alone can equal. The most horrible
   recorded instances of torture were usually inflicted, either by the
   populace, or in their presence, in the arena. We read of Christians
   bound in chains of red-hot iron, while the stench of their
   half-consumed flesh rose in a suffocating cloud to heaven; of others
   who were torn to the very bone by, shells or hooks of iron; of holy
   virgins given over to the lust of the gladiator or to the mercies of
   the pander; of two hundred and twenty-seven converts sent on one
   occasion to the mines, each with the sinews of one leg severed by a
   red-hot iron, and with an eye scooped from its socket; of fires so slow
   that the victims writhed for hours in their agonies; of bodies torn
   limb from limb, or sprinkled with burning lead; of mingled salt and
   vinegar poured over the flesh that was bleeding from the rack; of
   tortures prolonged and varied through entire days. For the love of
   their Divine Master, for the cause they believed to be true, men, and
   even weak girls, endured these things without flinching, when one word
   would have freed them from their sufferings, No opinion we may form of
   the proceedings of priests in a later age should impair the reverence
   with which we bend before the martyr's tomb.

   In thankful remembrance of the fidelity of this "noble army of
   martyrs," in recognition of the unbroken communion of saints, and in
   prospect of the resurrection of the body, the church paid to the
   martyrs, and even to their mortal remains, a veneration, which was in
   itself well-deserved and altogether natural, but which early exceeded
   the scriptural limit, and afterwards degenerated into the worship of
   saints and relics. The heathen hero-worship silently continued in the
   church and was baptized with Christian names.

   In the church of Smyrna, according to its letter of the year 155, we
   find this veneration still in its innocent, childlike form: "They [the
   Jews] know not, that we can neither ever forsake Christ, who has
   suffered for the salvation of the whole world of the redeemed, nor
   worship another. Him indeed we adore (proskunoumen) as the Son of God;
   but the martyrs we love as they deserve (agapomen axios) for their
   surpassing love to their King and Master, as we wish also to be their
   companions and fellow-disciples." [68] 7 The day of the death of a
   martyr was called his heavenly birth-day, [69] 8 and was celebrated
   annually at his grave (mostly in a cave or catacomb), by prayer,
   reading of a history of his suffering and victory, oblations, and
   celebration of the holy supper.

   But the early church did not stop with this. Martyrdom was taken, after
   the end of the second century, not only as a higher grade of Christian
   virtue, but at the same time as a baptism of fire and blood, [70] 9 an
   ample substitution for the baptism of water, as purifying from sin, and
   as securing an entrance into heaven. Origen even went so far as to
   ascribe to the sufferings of the martyrs an atoning virtue for others,
   an efficacy like that of the sufferings of Christ, on the authority of
   such passages as 2 Cor. 12:15; Col. 1:24; 2 Tim. 4:6. According to
   Tertullian, the martyrs entered immediately into the blessedness of
   heaven, and were not required, like ordinary Christians, to pass
   through the intermediate state. Thus was applied the benediction on
   those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, Matt. 5:10-12. Hence,
   according to Origen and Cyprian, their prayers before the throne of God
   came to be thought peculiarly efficacious for the church militant on
   earth, and, according to an example related by Eusebius, their future
   intercessions were bespoken shortly before their death.

   In the Roman Catacombs we find inscriptions where the departed are
   requested to pray for their living relatives and friends.

   The veneration thus shown for the persons of the martyrs was
   transferred in smaller measure to their remains. The church of Smyrna
   counted the bones of Polycarp more precious than gold or diamonds. [71]
   0 The remains of Ignatius were held in equal veneration by the
   Christians at Antioch. The friends of Cyprian gathered his blood in
   handkerchiefs, and built a chapel over his tomb.

   A veneration frequently excessive was paid, not only to the deceased
   martyrs, but also the surviving confessors. It was made the special
   duty of the deacons to visit and minister to them in prison. The
   heathen Lucian in his satire, "De morte Peregrini," describes the
   unwearied care of the Christians for their imprisoned brethren; the
   heaps of presents brought to them; and the testimonies of sympathy even
   by messengers from great distances; but all, of course, in Lucian's
   view, out of mere good-natured enthusiasm. Tertullian the Montanist
   censures the excessive attention of the Catholics to their confessors.
   The libelli pacis, as they were called--intercessions of the confessors
   for the fallen--commonly procured restoration to the fellowship of the
   church. Their voice had peculiar weight in the choice of bishops, and
   their sanction not rarely overbalanced the authority of the clergy.
   Cyprian is nowhere more eloquent than in the praise of their heroism.
   His letters to the imprisoned confessors in Carthage are full of
   glorification, in a style somewhat offensive to our evangelical ideas.
   Yet after all, he protests against the abuse of their privileges, from
   which he had himself to suffer, and earnestly exhorts them to a holy
   walk; that the honor they have gained may not prove a snare to them,
   and through pride and carelessness be lost. He always represents the
   crown of the confessor and the martyr as a free gift of the grace of
   God, and sees the real essence of it rather in the inward disposition
   than in the outward act. Commodian conceived the whole idea of
   martyrdom in its true breadth, when he extended it to all those who,
   without shedding their blood, endured to the end in love, humility, and
   patience, and in all Christian virtue.

   § 29. Literary Opposition to Christianity.

   Besides the external conflict, which we have considered in the second
   chapter, Christianity was called to pass through an equally important
   intellectual and literary struggle with the ancient world; and from
   this also it came forth victorious, and conscious of being the perfect
   religion for man. We shall see in this chapter, that most of the
   objections of modern infidelity against Christianity were anticipated
   by its earliest literary opponents, and ably and successfully refuted
   by the ancient apologists for the wants of the church in that age. Both
   unbelief and faith, like human nature and divine grace, are essentially
   the same in all ages and among all nations, but vary in form, and hence
   every age, as it produces its own phase of opposition, must frame its
   own mode of defense.

   The Christian religion found at first as little favor with the
   representatives of literature and art as with princes and statesmen. In
   the secular literature of the latter part of the first century and the
   beginning of the second, we find little more than ignorant, careless
   and hostile allusions to Christianity as a new form of superstition
   which then began to attract the attention of the Roman government. In
   this point of view also Christ's kingdom was not of the world, and was
   compelled to force its way through the greatest difficulties; yet it
   proved at last the mother of an intellectual and moral culture far in
   advance of the Graeco-Roman, capable of endless progress, and full of
   the vigor of perpetual youth.

   The pious barbarism of the Byzantine emperors Theodosius II. and
   Valentinian III. ordered the destruction of the works of Porphyrius and
   all other opponents of Christianity, to avert the wrath of God, but
   considerable fragments have been preserved in the refutations of the
   Christian Fathers, especially Origen, Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria
   (against Julian), and scattered notices of Jerome and Augustin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 30. Jewish Opposition. Josephus and the Talmud.

   The hostility of the Jewish Scribes and Pharisees to the gospel is
   familiar from the New Testament. Josephus mentions Jesus once in his
   archaeology, but in terms so favorable as to agree ill with his Jewish
   position, and to subject the passage to the suspicion of interpolation
   or corruption. [72] 1 His writings, however, contain much valuable
   testimony to the truth of the gospel history. His "Archaeology"
   throughout is a sort of fifth Gospel in illustration of the social and
   political environments of the life of Christ. [73] 2 His "History of
   the Jewish War," in particular, is undesignedly a striking commentary
   on the Saviour's predictions concerning the destruction of the city and
   temple of Jerusalem, the great distress and affliction of the Jewish
   people at that time, the famine, pestilence, and earthquake, the rise
   of false prophets and impostors, and the flight of his disciples at the
   approach of these calamities. [74] 3

   The attacks of the later Jews upon Christianity are essentially mere
   repetitions of those recorded in the Gospels--denial of the Messiahship
   of Jesus, and horrible vituperation of his confessors. We learn their
   character best from the dialogue of Justin with the Jew Trypho. The
   fictitious disputation on Christ by Jason and Papiscus, first mentioned
   by Celsus, was lost since the seventh century. [75] 4 It seems to have
   been a rather poor apology of Christianity against Jewish objections by
   a Jewish Christian, perhaps by Aristo of Pella.

   The Talmud is the Bible of Judaism separated from, and hostile to,
   Christianity, but it barely notices it except indirectly. It completed
   the isolation of the Jews from all other people.

   § 31. Pagan Opposition. Tacitus and Pliny.

   The Greek and Roman writers of the first century, and some of the
   second, as Seneca, the elder Pliny, and even the mild and noble
   Plutarch, either from ignorance or contempt, never allude to
   Christianity at all.

   Tacitus and the younger Pliny, contemporaries and friends of the
   emperor Trajan, are the first to notice it; and they speak of it only
   incidentally and with stoical disdain and antipathy, as an "exitiabilis
   superstition" "prava et immodica superstitio," "inflexibilis
   obstinatio." These celebrated and in their way altogether estimable
   Roman authors thus, from manifest ignorance, saw in the Christians
   nothing but superstitious fanatics, and put them on a level with the
   hated Jews; Tacitus, in fact, reproaching them also with the "odium
   generis humani." This will afford some idea of the immense obstacles
   which the new religion encountered in public opinion, especially in the
   cultivated circles of the Roman empire. The Christian apologies of the
   second century also show, that the most malicious and gratuitous
   slanders against the Christians were circulated among the common
   people, even charges of incest and cannibalism, [76] 5 which may have
   arisen in part from a misapprehension of the intimate brotherly love of
   the Christians, and their nightly celebration of the holy supper and
   love-feasts.

   Their Indirect Testimony to Christianity.

   On the other hand, however, the scanty and contemptuous allusions of
   Tacitus and Pliny to Christianity bear testimony to a number of facts
   in the Gospel History. Tacitus, in giving an account of the Neronian
   persecution, incidentally attests, that Christ was put to death as a
   malefactor by Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius; that he was the
   founder of the Christian sect, that the latter took its rise in Judaea
   and spread in spite of the ignominious death of Christ and the hatred
   and contempt it encountered throughout the empire, so that a "vast
   multitude" (multitudo ingens) of them were most cruelly put to death in
   the city of Rome alone as early as the year 64. He also bears valuable
   testimony, in the fifth book of his History, together with Josephus,
   from whom he mainly, though not exclusively takes his account, to the
   fulfilment of Christ's prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem
   and the overthrow of the Jewish theocracy.

   As to Pliny's famous letter to Trajan, written about 107, it proves the
   rapid spread of Christianity in Asia Minor at that time among all ranks
   of society, the general moral purity and steadfastness of its
   professors amid cruel persecution, their mode and time of worship,
   their adoration of Christ as God, their observance of a "stated day,"
   which is undoubtedly Sunday, and other facts of importance in the early
   history of the Church. Trajan's rescript in reply to Pliny's inquiry,
   furnishes evidence of the innocence of the Christians; he notices no
   charge against them except their disregard of the worship of the gods,
   and forbids them to be sought for. Marcus Aurelius testifies, in one
   brief and unfriendly allusion, to their eagerness for the crown of
   martyrdom.

   § 32. Direct Assaults. Celsus.

   The direct assault upon Christianity, by works devoted to the purpose,
   began about the middle of the second century, and was very ably
   conducted by a Grecian philosopher, Celsus, otherwise unknown;
   according to Origen, an Epicurean with many Platonic ideas, and a
   friend of Lucian. He wrote during the persecuting reign of Marcus
   Aurelius. [77] 6

   Celsus, with all his affected or real contempt for the new religion,
   considered it important enough to be opposed by an extended work
   entitled "A True Discourse," of which Origen, in his Refutation, has
   faithfully preserved considerable fragments. [78] 7 These represent
   their author as an eclectic philosopher of varied culture, skilled in
   dialectics, and familiar with the Gospels, Epistles, and even the
   writings of the Old Testament. He speaks now in the frivolous style of
   an Epicurean, now in the earnest and dignified tone of a Platonist. At
   one time he advocates the popular heathen religion, as, for instance,
   its doctrine of demons; at another time he rises above the polytheistic
   notions to a pantheistic or sceptical view. He employs all the aids
   which the culture of his age afforded, all the weapons of learning,
   common sense, wit, sarcasm, and dramatic animation of style, to
   disprove Christianity; and he anticipates most of the arguments and
   sophisms of the deists and infidels of later times. Still his book is,
   on the whole, a very superficial, loose, and light-minded work, and
   gives striking proof of the inability of the natural reason to
   understand the Christian truth. It has no savor of humility, no sense
   of the corruption of human nature, and man's need of redemption; it is
   full of heathen passion and prejudice, utterly blind to any spiritual
   realities, and could therefore not in the slightest degree appreciate
   the glory of the Redeemer and of his work. It needs no refutation, it
   refutes itself.

   Celsus first introduces a Jew, who accuses the mother of Jesus of
   adultery with a soldier named Panthera; [79] 8 adduces the denial of
   Peter, the treachery of Judas, and the death of Jesus as contradictions
   of his pretended divinity; and makes the resurrection an imposture.
   Then Celsus himself begins the attack, and begins it by combating the
   whole idea of the supernatural, which forms the common foundation of
   Judaism and Christianity. The controversy between Jews and Christians
   appears to him as foolish as the strife about the shadow of an ass. The
   Jews believed, as well as the Christians, in the prophecies of a
   Redeemer of the world, and thus differed from them only in that they
   still expected the Messiah's coming. But then, to what purpose should
   God come down to earth at all, or send another down? He knows
   beforehand what is going on among men. And such a descent involves a
   change, a transition from the good to the evil, from the lovely to the
   hateful, from the happy to the miserable; which is undesirable, and
   indeed impossible, for the divine nature. In another place he says, God
   troubles himself no more about men than about monkeys and flies. Celsus
   thus denies the whole idea of revelation, now in pantheistic style, now
   in the levity of Epicurean deism; and thereby at the same time abandons
   the ground of the popular heathen religion. In his view Christianity
   has no rational foundation at all, but is supported by the imaginary
   terrors of future punishment. Particularly offensive to him are the
   promises of the gospel to the poor and miserable, and the doctrines of
   forgiveness of sins and regeneration, and of the resurrection of the
   body. This last he scoffingly calls a hope of worms, but not of
   rational souls. The appeal to the omnipotence of God, he thinks, does
   not help the matter, because God can do nothing improper and unnatural.
   He reproaches the Christians with ignorance, credulity, obstinacy,
   innovation, division, and sectarianism, which they inherited mostly
   from their fathers, the Jews. They are all uncultivated, mean,
   superstitious people, mechanics, slaves, women, and children. The great
   mass of them he regarded as unquestionably deceived. But where there
   are deceived, there must be also deceivers; and this leads us to the
   last result of this polemical sophistry. Celsus declared the first
   disciples of Jesus to be deceivers of the worst kind; a band of
   sorcerers, who fabricated and circulated the miraculous stories of the
   Gospels, particularly that of the resurrection of Jesus; but betrayed
   themselves by contradictions. The originator of the imposture, however,
   is Jesus himself, who learned that magical art in Egypt, and afterwards
   made a great noise with it in his native country.

   But here, this philosophical and critical sophistry virtually,
   acknowledges its bankruptcy. The hypothesis of deception is the very
   last one to offer in explanation of a phenomenon so important as
   Christianity was even in that day. The greater and more permanent the
   deception, the more mysterious and unaccountable it must appear to
   reason.

   Chrysostom made the truthful remark, that Celsus bears witness to the
   antiquity of the apostolic writings. This heathen assailant, who lived
   almost within hailing distance of St. John, incidentally gives us an
   abridgement of the history of Christ as related by the Gospels, and
   this furnishes strong weapons against modern infidels, who would
   represent this history as a later invention. "I know everything" he
   says; "we have had it all from your own books, and need no other
   testimony; ye slay yourselves with your own sword." He refers to the
   Gospels of Matthew, Luke, and John, and makes upon the whole about
   eighty allusions to, or quotations from, the New Testament. He takes
   notice of Christ's birth from a virgin in a small village of Judaea,
   the adoration of the wise men from the East, the slaughter of the
   infants by order of Herod, the flight to Egypt, where he supposed
   Christ learned the charms of magicians, his residence in Nazareth, his
   baptism and the descent of the Holy Spirit in the shape of a dove and
   the voice from heaven, the election of disciples, his friendship with
   publicans and other low people, his supposed cures of the lame and the
   blind, and raising of the dead, the betrayal of Judas, the denial of
   Peter, the principal circumstances in the history of the passion and
   crucifixion, also the resurrection of Christ. [80] 9

   It is true he perverts or abuses most of these facts; but according to
   his own showing they were then generally and had always been believed
   by the Christians. He alludes to some of the principal doctrines of the
   Christians, to their private assemblies for worship, to the office of
   presbyters. He omits the grosser charges of immorality, which he
   probably disowned as absurd and incredible.

   In view of all these admissions we may here, with Lardner, apply
   Samson's riddle: "Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the
   strong came forth sweetness." [81] 0
     __________________________________________________________________

   [77] Origen (I. 8) indefinitely assigns him to the reign of Hadrian and
   the Antonines; most historians (Mosheim, Gieseler, Baur, Friedländer)
   to a.d. 150 or later; others (Tillemont, Neander, Zeller) to about 160
   or 170; Keim (1. c. p. 267) to a.d. 178. As the place of composition
   Keim (p. 274) suggests Rome, others Alexandria. He ably defends his
   identity with the friend of Lucian (p. 291), but makes him out a
   Platonist rather than an Epicurean (p. 203 sqq.).

   [78] See the restoration of Celsus from these fragments by Dr. Keim,
   quoted above.

   [79] Panther, panthera, here, and in the Talmud, where Jesus is
   likewise called yshy vn pndyr' is used, like the Latin lupa, as a type
   of ravenous lust hence as a symbolical name for moicheir. So Nitzsch
   and Baur. But Keim (p. 12) takes it as a designation of the wild
   rapacious (pan theron) Roman soldier. The mother of Jesus was,
   according to the Jewish informant of Celsus, a poor seamstress, and
   engaged to a carpenter, who plunged her into disgrace and misery when
   he found out her infidelity.

   [80] Keim (Geschichte Jesu von Nazara, I. 22) says of Celsus: "Von der
   Jungfraugeburt bis zum Jammer des Todes bei Essig und Galle, bis zu den
   Wundern des Todes und der Auferstehung hat er unsere Evangelien
   verfolgt, und anderen Quellen, welche zum Theil heute noch fliessen,
   hat er den Glauben an die Hasslichkeit Jesu und an die Sündhaftigkeit
   seiner Jünger abgewonnen." Comp. Keim's monograph on Celsus, pp.
   219-231. On the bearing of his testimony on the genuineness of the
   Gospel of John, see vol. 1. p. 708.

   the more radical theories of Strauss and Renan. For Keim's estimate,
   see his Celsus, 253-261.

   § 33. Lucian.

   Edd. of Lucian's works by Hemsterhuis and Reiz (1743 sqq.), Jacobitz
   (1836-39), Dindorf (1840 and 1858), Bekker (1853), Franc. Fritzsche
   (1860-'69). The pseudo-Lucianic dialogue Philopatris (philopatris,
   loving one's country, patriot) in which the Christians are ridiculed
   and condemned as enemies of the Roman empire, is of a much later date,
   probably from the reign of Julian the Apostate (363). See Gesner: De
   aetate et auctore Philopatridis, Jen. 1714.

   Jacob:Charakteristik Lucians. Hamburg 1822.

   G. G. Bernays: Lucian und die Cyniker. Berlin. 1879.

   Comp. Keim: Celsus, 143-151; Ed. D. Zeller:Alexander und Peregrinus ,
   in the "Deutsche Rundschau," for Jan. 1877; Henry Cotterill: Peregrinus
   Proteus (Edinb. 1879); Ad. Harnack in Herzog (ed. II.), VIII. 772-779;
   and the Lit. quoted in § 28.

   In the same period the rhetorician Lucian (born at Samosata in Syria
   about 120, died in Egypt or Greece before 200), the Voltaire of Grecian
   literature, attacked the Christian religion with the same light weapons
   of wit and ridicule, with which, in his numerous elegantly written
   works, he assailed the old popular faith and worship, the mystic
   fanaticism imported from the East, the vulgar life of the Stoics and
   Cynics of that day, and most of the existing manners and customs of the
   distracted period of the empire. An Epicurean, worldling, and infidel,
   as he was, could see in Christianity only one of the many vagaries and
   follies of mankind; in the miracles, only jugglery; in the belief of
   immortality, an empty dream; and in the contempt of death and the
   brotherly love of the Christians, to which he was constrained to
   testify, a silly enthusiasm.

   Thus he represents the matter in an historical romance on the life and
   death of Peregrinus Proteus, a contemporary Cynic philosopher, whom he
   make the basis of a satire upon Christianity, and especially upon
   Cynicism. Peregrinus is here presented as a perfectly contemptible man,
   who, after the meanest and grossest crimes, adultery, sodomy, and
   parricide, joins the credulous Christians in Palestine, cunningly
   imposes on them, soon rises to the highest repute among them, and,
   becoming one of the confessors in prison, is loaded with presents by
   them, in fact almost worshipped as a god, but is afterwards
   excommunicated for eating some forbidden food (probably meat of the
   idolatrous sacrifices); then casts himself into the arms of the Cynics,
   travels about everywhere, in the filthiest style of that sect; and at
   last about the year 165, in frantic thirst for fame, plunges into the
   flames of a funeral pile before the assembled populace of the town of
   Olympia, for the triumph of philosophy. This fiction of the
   self-burning was no doubt meant for a parody on the Christian
   martyrdom, perhaps with special reference to Polycarp, who a few years
   before had suffered death by fire at Smyrna (155). [82] 1

   Lucian treated the Christians rather with a compassionate smile, than
   with hatred. He nowhere urges persecution. He never calls Christ an
   impostor, as Celsus does, but a "crucified sophist;" a term which he
   uses as often in a good sense as in the bad. But then, in the end, both
   the Christian and the heathen religions amount, in his view, to
   imposture; only, in his Epicurean indifferentism, he considers it not
   worth the trouble to trace such phenomena to their ultimate ground, and
   attempt a philosophical explanation. [83] 2

   The merely negative position of this clever mocker of all religions
   injured heathenism more than Christianity, but could not be long
   maintained against either; the religious element is far too deeply
   seated in the essence of human nature. Epicureanism and scepticism made
   way, in their turns, for Platonism, and for faith or superstition.
   Heathenism made a vigorous effort to regenerate itself, in order to
   hold its ground against the steady advance of Christianity. But the old
   religion itself could not help feeling more and more the silent
   influence of the new.

   ins Literatenthum übergegangen; unwissend und leichtfertig trägt er
   lediglich eine nihilistische Oede in Bezuq auf alle religiösen und
   metaphysischen Fraqen zur Schau und reisst alle als verkehrt und

   directed against the Christians, but against the Cynic philosophers and
   more particularly against the then still living Theagenes.

   More earnest and dignified, but for this very reason more lasting and
   dangerous, was the opposition which proceeded directly and indirectly
   from Neo-Platonism. This system presents the last phase, the evening
   red, so to speak, of the Grecian philosophy; a fruitless effort of
   dying heathenism to revive itself against the irresistible progress of
   Christianity in its freshness and vigor. It was a pantheistic
   eclecticism and a philosophico-religious syncretism, which sought to
   reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy with Oriental religion
   and theosophy, polytheism with monotheism, superstition with culture,
   and to hold, as with convulsive grasp, the old popular religion in a
   refined and idealized form. Some scattered Christian ideas also were
   unconsciously let in; Christianity already filled the atmosphere of the
   age too much, to be wholly shut out. As might be expected, this
   compound of philosophy and religion was an extravagant, fantastic,
   heterogeneous affair, like its contemporary, Gnosticism, which differed
   from it by formally recognising Christianity in its syncretism. Most of
   the NeoPlatonists, Jamblichus in particular, were as much hierophants
   and theurgists as philosophers, devoted themselves to divination and
   magic, and boasted of divine inspirations and visions. Their literature
   is not an original, healthy natural product, but an abnormal
   after-growth.

   In a time of inward distraction and dissolution the human mind hunts up
   old and obsolete systems and notions, or resorts to magical and
   theurgic arts. Superstition follows on the heels of unbelief, and
   atheism often stands closely connected with the fear of ghosts and the
   worship of demons. The enlightened emperor Augustus was troubled, if he
   put on his left shoe first in the morning, instead of the right; and
   the accomplished elder Pliny wore amulets as protection from thunder
   and lightning. In their day the long-forgotten Pythagoreanism was
   conjured from the grave and idealized. Sorcerers like Simon Magus,
   Elymas, Alexander of Abonoteichos, and Apollonius of Tyana (d. a.d.
   96), found great favor even with the higher classes, who laughed at the
   fables of the gods. Men turned wishfully to the past, especially to the
   mysterious East, the land of primitive wisdom and religion. The Syrian
   cultus was sought out; and all sorts of religions, all the sense and
   all the nonsense of antiquity found a rendezvous in Rome. Even a
   succession of Roman emperors, from Septimius Severus, at the close of
   the second century, to Alexander Severus, embraced this religious
   syncretism, which, instead of supporting the old Roman state religion,
   helped to undermine it. [84] 3

   After the beginning of the third century this tendency found
   philosophical expression and took a reformatory turn in Neo-Platonism.
   The magic power, which was thought able to reanimate all these various
   elements and reduce them to harmony, and to put deep meaning into the
   old mythology, was the philosophy of the divine Plato; which in truth
   possessed essentially a mystical character, and was used also by
   learned Jews, like Philo, and by Christians, like Origen, in their
   idealizing efforts and their arbitrary allegorical expositions of
   offensive passages of the Bible. In this view we may find among heathen
   writers a sort of forerunner of the NeoPlatonists in the pious and
   noble-minded Platonist, Plutarch, of Boeotia (d. 120), who likewise saw
   a deeper sense in the myths of the popular polytheistic faith, and in
   general, in his comparative biographies and his admirable moral
   treatises, looks at the fairest and noblest side of the Graeco-Roman
   antiquity, but often wanders off into the trackless regions of fancy.

   The proper founder of Neo-Platonism was Ammonius Saccas, of Alexandria,
   who was born of Christian parents, but apostatized, and died in the
   year 243. His more distinguished pupil, Plotinus, also an Egyptian
   (204-269), developed the NeoPlatonic ideas in systematic form, and gave
   them firm foothold and wide currency, particularly in Rome, where he
   taught philosophy. The system was propagated by his pupil Porphyry of
   Tyre (d. 304), who likewise taught in Rome, by Jamblichus of Chalcis in
   Coelo-Syria (d. 333), and by Proclus of Constantinople (d. 485). It
   supplanted the popular religion among in the educated classes of later
   heathendom, and held its ground until the end of the fifth century,
   when it perished of its own internal falsehood and contradictions.

   From its love for the ideal, the supernatural, and the mystical, this
   system, like the original Platonism, might become for many
   philosophical minds a bridge to faith; and so it was even to St.
   Augustin, whom it delivered from the bondage of scepticism, and filled
   with a burning thirst for truth and wisdom. But it could also work
   against Christianity. Neo-Platonism was, in fact, a direct attempt of
   the more intelligent and earnest heathenism to rally all its nobler
   energies, especially the forces of Hellenic philosophy and Oriental
   mysticism, and to found a universal religion, a pagan counterpart to
   the Christian. Plotinus, in his opposition to Gnosticism, assailed
   also, though not expressly, the Christian element it contained. On
   their syncretistic principles the Neo-Platonists could indeed reverence
   Christ as a great sage and a hero of virtue, but not as the Son of God.
   They ranked the wise men of heathendom with him. The emperor Alexander
   Severus (d. 235) gave Orpheus and Apollonius of Tyana a place in his
   lararium by the side of the bust of Jesus.

   The rhetorician Philostratus, the elder, about the year 220, at the
   request of Julia Domna, the wife of Septimius Severus, and a zealous
   patron of the reform of paganism, idealized the life of the pagan
   magician and soothsayer Apollonius, of the Pythagorean school, and made
   him out an ascetic saint, a divinely inspired philosopher, a religious
   reformer and worker of miracles, with the purpose, as is generally
   assumed, though without direct evidence, of holding him up as a rival
   of Christ with equal claims to the worship of men. [85] 4

   The points of resemblance are chiefly these: Jesus was the Son of God,
   Apollonius the son of Jupiter; the birth of Christ was celebrated by
   the appearance of angels, that of Apollonius by a flash of lightning;
   Christ raised the daughter of Jairus, Apollonius a young Roman maiden,
   from the dead; Christ cast out demons, Apollonius did the same; Christ
   rose from the dead, Apollonius appeared after his death. Apollonius is
   made to combine also several characteristics of the apostles, as the
   miraculous gift of tongues, for he understood all the languages of the
   world. Like St. Paul, he received his earlier education at Tarsus,
   labored at Antioch, Ephesus, and other cities, and was persecuted by
   Nero. Like the early Christians, he was falsely accused of sacrificing
   children with certain mysterious ceremonies. [86] 5 With the same
   secret polemical aim Porphyry and Jamblichus embellished the life of
   Pythagoras, and set him forth as the highest model of wisdom, even a
   divine being incarnate, a Christ of heathenism.

   These various attempts to Christianize paganism were of course as
   abortive as so many attempts to galvanize a corpse. They made no
   impression upon their age, much less upon ages following. They were
   indirect arguments in favor of Christianity: they proved the internal
   decay of the false, and the irresistible progress of the true religion,
   which began to mould the spirit of the age and to affect public opinion
   outside of the church. By inventing false characters in imitation of
   Christ they indirectly conceded to the historical Christ his claim to
   the admiration and praise of mankind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [84] The oldest apostle of this strange medley of Hellenic, Persian,
   Chaldean and Egyptian mysteries in Rome was Nigidius Figulus, who
   belonged to the strictest section of the aristocracy, and filled the
   praetorship in 696 a.u.c. (58 b.c.) He foretold the father of the
   subsequent emperor Augustus on the very day of his birth his future
   greatness. The system was consecrated by the name of Pythagoras, the
   primeval sage of Italian birth, the miracleworker and necromancer. The
   new and old wisdom made a profound impression on men of the highest
   rank and greatest learning, who took part in the citation of spirits,
   as in the nineteenth century, spirit-rapping and tablemoving exercised
   for a while a similar charm. "These last attempts to save the Roman
   theology, like the similar efforts of Cato in the field of politics,
   produce at once a comical and a melancholy impression. We may smile at
   the creed and its propagators, but still it is a grave matter when all
   men begin to addict themselves to absurdity." Th. Mommsen, History of
   Rome, vol. IV. p. 563 (Dickson's translation. Lond. 1867.)

   [85] Philostratus himself gives no intimation of such design on his
   part, and simply states that he was requested by the empress Julia
   Domna (a.d. 217), to draw up a biography of Apollonius from certain
   memoranda of Damis, one of his friends and followers. The name of
   Christ is never mentioned by him; nor does he allude to the Gospels,
   except in one instance, where he uses the same phrase as the daemon in
   St. Luke (viii. 28): "I beseech thee, torment me not (me me basanises
   .). Vita Apoll. IV. 25. Bishop Samuel Parker, in a work on the Divine
   Authority of the Christian Religion (1681), Lardner, Neander (K G. I.
   298), and J. S. Watson (in a review of Re'ville's Apoll. of T., in the
   "Contemporary Review" for 1867, p. 199 ff.), deny the commonly received
   opinion, first maintained by Bishop Daniel Hust, and defended by Baur,
   Newman, and Re'ville, that Philostratus intended to draw a parallel
   between his hero and Christ. The resemblance is studied and fictitious,
   and it is certain that at a later date Hierocles vainly endeavored to
   lower the dignity of Christ by raising this Pythagorean adventurer as
   portrayed by Philostratus, to a level with the eternal Son of God.

   § 35. Porphyry and Hierocles

   See the Lit. in § 34.

   One of the leading Neo-Platonists made a direct attack upon
   Christianity, and was, in the eyes of the church fathers, its bitterest
   and most dangerous enemy. Towards the end of the third century Porphyry
   wrote an extended work against the Christians, in fifteen books, which
   called forth numerous refutations from the most eminent church teachers
   of the time, particularly from Methodius of Tyre, Eusebius of Caesarea,
   and Apollinaris of Laodicea. In 448 all the copies were burned by order
   of the emperors Theodosius II. and Valentinian III., and we know the
   work now only from fragments in the fathers.

   Porphyry attacked especially the sacred books of the Christians, with
   more knowledge than Celsus. He endeavored, with keen criticism, to
   point out the contradictions between the Old Testament and the New, and
   among the apostles themselves; and thus to refute the divinity of their
   writings. He represented the prophecies of Daniel as vaticinia post
   eventum, and censured the allegorical interpretation of Origen, by
   which transcendental mysteries were foisted into the writings of Moses,
   contrary to their clear sense. He took advantage, above all, of the
   collision between Paul and Peter at Antioch (Gal. 2:11), to reproach
   the former with a contentious spirit, the latter with error, and to
   infer from the whole, that the doctrine of such apostles must rest on
   lies and frauds. Even Jesus himself he charged with equivocation and
   inconsistency, on account of his conduct in John 7:8 compared with
   verse 14.

   Still Porphyry would not wholly reject Christianity. Like many
   rationalists of more recent times, he distinguished the original pure
   doctrine of Jesus from the second-handed, adulterated doctrine of the
   apostles. In another work [87] 6 on the "Philosophy of Oracles," often
   quoted by Eusebius, and also by Augustin, [88] 7 he says, we must not
   calumniate Christ, who was most eminent for piety, but only pity those
   who worship him as God. "That pious soul, exalted to heaven, is become,
   by a sort of fate, an occasion of delusion to those souls from whom
   fortune withholds the gifts of the gods and the knowledge of the
   immortal Zeus." Still more remarkable in this view is a letter to his
   wife Marcella, which A. Mai published at Milan in 1816, in the
   unfounded opinion that Marcella was a Christian. In the course of this
   letter Porphyry remarks, that what is born of the flesh is flesh; that
   by faith, love, and hope we raise ourselves to the Deity; that evil is
   the fault of man; that God is holy; that the most acceptable sacrifice
   to him is a pure heart; that the wise man is at once a temple of God
   and a priest in that temple. For these and other such evidently
   Christian ideas and phrases he no doubt had a sense of his own, which
   materially differed from their proper scriptural meaning. But such
   things show how Christianity in that day exerted, even upon its
   opponents, a power, to which heathenism was forced to yield an
   unwilling assent.

   The last literary antagonist of Christianity in our period is
   Hierocles, who, while governor of Bythynia, and afterwards of
   Alexandria under Diocletian, persecuted that religion also with the
   sword, and exposed Christian maidens to a worse fate than death. His
   "Truth-loving Words to the Christians" has been destroyed, like
   Porphyry's work, by the mistaken zeal of Christian emperors, and is
   known to us only through the answer of Eusebius of Caesarea. [89] 8 He
   appears to have merely repeated the objections of Celsus and Porphyry,
   and to have drawn a comparison between Christ and Apollonius of Tyana,
   which resulted in favor of the latter. The Christians says he, consider
   Jesus a God, on account of some insignificant miracles falsely colored
   up by his apostles; but the heathens far more justly declare the
   greater wonder-worker Apollonius, as well as an Aristeas and a
   Pythagoras, simply a favorite of the gods and a benefactor of men.

   § 36. Summary of the Objections to Christianity.

   In general the leading arguments of the Judaism and heathenism of this
   period against the new religion are the following:

   1. Against Christ: his illegitimate birth; his association with poor,
   unlettered fishermen, and rude publicans: his form of a servant, and
   his ignominious death. But the opposition to him gradually ceased.
   While Celsus called him a downright impostor, the Syncretists and
   Neo-Platonists were disposed to regard him as at least a distinguished
   sage.

   2. Against Christianity: its novelty; its barbarian origin; its want of
   a national basis; the alleged absurdity of some of its facts and
   doctrines, particularly of regeneration and the resurrection;
   contradictions between the Old and New Testaments, among the Gospels,
   and between Paul and Peter; the demand for a blind, irrational faith.

   3. Against the Christians: atheism, or hatred of the gods; the worship
   of a crucified malefactor; poverty, and want of culture and standing;
   desire of innovation; division and sectarianism; want of patriotism;
   gloomy seriousness; credulity; superstition, and fanaticism. Sometimes
   they were charged even with unnatural crimes, like those related in the
   pagan mythology of Oedipus and his mother Jocaste (concubitus
   Oedipodei), and of Thyestes and Atreus (epulae Thyesteae). Perhaps some
   Gnostic sects ran into scandalous excesses; but as against the
   Christians in general this charge was so clearly unfounded, that it is
   not noticed even by Celsus and Lucian. The senseless accusation, that
   they worshipped an ass's head, may have arisen, as Tertullian already
   intimates, [90] 9 from a story of Tacitus, respecting some Jews, who
   were once directed by a wild ass to fresh water, and thus relieved from
   the torture of thirst; and it is worth mentioning, only to show how
   passionate and blind was the opposition with which Christianity in this
   period of persecution had to contend.

   These assaults of argument and calumny called forth in the second
   century the Christian apologetic literature, the vindication of
   Christianity by the pen, against the Jewish zealot, the Grecian
   philosopher, and the Roman statesman. The Christians were indeed from
   the first "ready always to give an answer to every man that asked them
   a reason of the hope that was in them." But when heathenism took the
   field against them not only with fire and sword, but with argument and
   slander besides, they had to add to their simple practical testimony a
   theoretical self-defence. The Christian apology against non-Christian
   opponents, and the controversial efforts against Christian errorists,
   are the two oldest branches of theological science.

   The apologetic literature began to appear under the reign of Hadrian,
   and continued to grow till the end of our period. Most of the church
   teachers took part in this labor of their day. The first apologies, by
   Quadratus, bishop of Athens, Aristides, philosopher of Athens, and
   Aristo of Pella, which were addressed to the emperor Hadrian, and the
   later works of Melito of Sardis, Claudius Apollinaris of Hierapolis,
   and Miltiades, who lived under Marcus Aurelius, were either entirely
   lost, or preserved only in scattered notices of Eusebius. But some
   interesting fragments of Melito and Aristides have been recently
   discovered. [91] 0 More valuable are the apologetical works of the
   Greek philosopher and martyr, Justin (d. 166), which we possess in
   full. After him come, in the Greek church, Tatian, Athenagoras,
   Theophilus of Antioch, and Hermias in the last half of the second
   century, and Origen, the ablest of all, in the first half of the third.

   The most important Latin apologists are Tertullian (d. about 220),
   Minucius Felix (d. between 220 and 230; according to some, between 161
   and 200), the later Arnobius and Lactantius, all of North Africa.

   Here at once appears the characteristic difference between the Greek
   and the Latin minds. The Greek apologies are more learned and
   philosophical, the Latin more practical and juridical in their matter
   and style. The former labor to prove the truth of Christianity and its
   adaptedness to the intellectual wants of man; the latter plead for its
   legal right to exist, and exhibit mainly its moral excellency and
   salutary effect upon society. The Latin also are in general more
   rigidly opposed to heathenism, while the Greek recognize in the Grecian
   philosophy a certain affinity to the Christian religion.

   The apologies were addressed in some cases to the emperors (Hadrian,
   Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius) or the provincial governors; in
   others, to the intelligent public. Their first object was to soften the
   temper of the authorities and people towards Christianity and its
   professors by refuting the false charges against them. It may be
   doubtful whether they ever reached the hands of the emperors; at all
   events the persecution continued. [92] 1 Conversion commonly proceeds
   from the heart and will, not from the understanding and from knowledge.
   No doubt, however, these writings contributed to dissipate prejudice
   among honest and susceptible heathens, to spread more favorable views
   of the new religion, and to infuse a spirit of humanity into the spirit
   of the age, the systems of moral philosophy and the legislation of the
   Antonines.

   Yet the chief service of this literature was to strengthen believers
   and to advance theological knowledge. It brought the church to a deeper
   and clearer sense of the peculiar nature of the Christian religion, and
   prepared her thenceforth to vindicate it before the tribunal of reason
   and philosophy; whilst Judaism and heathenism proved themselves
   powerless in the combat, and were driven to the weapons of falsehood
   and vituperation. The sophisms and mockeries of a Celsus and a Lucian
   have none but a historical interest; the Apologies of Justin and the
   Apologeticus of Tertullian, rich with indestructible truth and glowing
   piety, are read with pleasure and edification to this day.

   The apologists do not confine themselves to the defensive, but carry
   the war aggressively into the territory of Judaism and heathenism. They
   complete their work by positively demonstrating that Christianity is
   the divine religion, and the only true religion for all mankind.

   § 38. The Argument against Judaism.

   In regard to the controversy with Judaism, we have two principal
   sources: the Dialogue of Justin Martyr with the Jew Trypho, [93] 2
   based, it appears, on real interviews of Justin with Trypho; and
   Tertullian's work against the Jews. [94] 3 Another work from the first
   half of the second century by Aristo of Pella, entitled "A Disputation
   of Jason and Papiscus concerning Christ," is lost. [95] 4 It was known
   to Celsus who speaks contemptuously of it on account of its allegorical
   interpretation. Origen deems it useful for ordinary readers, though not
   calculated to make much impression on scholars. It was intended to show
   the fulfillment of the old prophecies in Christ, and ends with the
   conviction of the Jew Papiscus and his baptism by Jason. The author was
   a Jewish Christian of Pella, the city of refuge for the Christians of
   Jerusalem before the destruction.

   I. The defensive apology answered the Jewish objections thus:

   (1) Against the charge, that Christianity is an apostasy from the
   Jewish religion, it was held, that the Mosaic law, as far as it relates
   to outward rites and ceremonies was only a temporary institution for
   the Jewish nation foreshadowing the substance of Christianity, while
   its moral precepts as contained in the Decalogue were kept in their
   deepest spiritual sense only by Christians; that the Old Testament
   itself points to its own dissolution and the establishment of a new
   covenant; [96] 5 that Abraham was justified before he was circumcised,
   and women, who could not be circumcised, were yet saved.

   (2) Against the assertion, that the servant-form of Jesus of Nazareth,
   and his death by the cross, contradicted the Old Testament idea of the
   Messiah, it was urged, that the appearance of the Messiah is to be
   regarded as twofold, first, in the form of a servant, afterwards in
   glory; and that the brazen serpent in the wilderness, and the
   prophecies of David in Psalm 22, of Isaiah 53, and Zech. 13, themselves
   point to the sufferings of Christ as his way to glory.

   (3) To the objection, that the divinity of Jesus contradicts the unity
   of God and is blasphemy, it was replied, that the Christians believe
   likewise in only one God; that the Old Testament itself makes a
   distinction in the divine nature; that the plural expression: "Let us
   make man," [97] 6 the appearance of the three men at Mamre [98] 7 of
   whom one was confessedly God, [99] 8 yet distinct from the Creator,
   [100] 9 indicate this; and that all theophanies (which in Justin's view
   are as many christophanies), and the Messianic Psalms, [101] 00 which
   ascribe divine dignity to the Messiah, show the same.

   II. The aggressive apology or polemic theology urges as evidence
   against Judaism:

   (1) First and mainly that the prophecies and types of the Old Testament
   are fulfilled in Jesus Christ and his church. Justin finds all the
   outlines of the gospel history predicted in the Old Testament: the
   Davidic descent of Jesus, for example, in Isa. 11:1; the birth from a
   virgin in 7:14]; the birth at Bethlehem in Micah 5:1; the flight into
   Egypt in Hosea 11:1 (rather than Ps. 22:10?); the appearance of the
   Baptist in Is. 40:1-17; Mal. 4:5; the heavenly voice at the baptism of
   Jesus in Ps. 2:7; the temptation in the wilderness under the type of
   Jacob's wrestling in Gen. 32:24 sqq.; the miracles of our Lord in Is.
   35:5; his sufferings and the several circumstances of his crucifixion
   in Is. 53 and Ps. 22. In this effort, however, Justin wanders also,
   according to the taste of his uncritical age, into arbitrary fancies
   and allegorical conceits; as when he makes the two goats, of which one
   carried away the sins into the wilderness, and the other was
   sacrificed, types of the first and second advents of Christ; and sees
   in the twelve bells on the robe of the high priest a type of the twelve
   apostles, whose sound goes forth into all the world. [102] 01

   (2) The destruction of Jerusalem, in which Judaism, according to the
   express prediction of Jesus, was condemned by God himself, and
   Christianity was gloriously vindicated. Here the Jewish priest and
   historian Josephus, who wrote from personal observation a graphic
   description of this tragedy, had to furnish a powerful historical
   argument against his own religion and for the truth of Christianity.
   Tertullian sums up the prophetic predictions of the calamities which
   have befallen the Jews for rejecting Christ, "the sense of the
   Scriptures harmonizing with the events." [103] 02

   § 39. The Defense against Heathenism.

   I. The various Objections and Accusations of the heathens, which we
   have collected in §

   (1) The attack upon the miraculous in the evangelical history the
   apologists could meet by pointing to the similar element in the heathen
   mythology; of course proposing this merely in the way of argumentum ad
   hominem, to deprive the opposition of the right to object. For the
   credibility of the miraculous accounts in the Gospels, particularly
   that of the resurrection of Jesus, Origen appealed to the integrity and
   piety of the narrators, to the publicity of the death of Jesus, and to
   the effects of that event.

   (2) The novelty and late appearance of Christianity were justified by
   the need of historical preparation in which the human race should be
   divinely trained for Christ; but more frequently it was urged also,
   that Christianity existed in the counsel of God from eternity, and had
   its unconscious votaries, especially among the pious Jews, long before
   the advent of Christ. By claiming the Mosaic records, the apologists
   had greatly the advantage as regards antiquity over any form of
   paganism, and could carry their religion, in its preparatory state,
   even beyond the flood and up to the very gates of paradise. Justin and
   Tatian make great account of the fact that Moses is much older than the
   Greek philosophers, poets, and legislators. Athenagoras turns the
   tables, and shows that the very names of the heathen gods are modern,
   and their statues creations of yesterday. Clement of Alexandria calls
   the Greek philosophers thieves and robbers, because they stole certain
   portions of truth from the Hebrew prophets and adulterated them.
   Tertullian, Minucius Felix and others raise the same charge of
   plagiarism.

   (3) The doctrine of the resurrection of the body, so peculiarly
   offensive to the heathen and Gnostic understanding, was supported, as
   to its possibility, by reference to the omnipotence of God, and to the
   creation of the world and of man; and its propriety and reasonableness
   were argued from the divine image in man, from the high destiny of the
   body to be the temple of the Holy Spirit, and from its intimate
   connection with the soul, as well as from the righteousness and
   goodness of God. The argument from analogy was also very generally
   used, but often without proper discrimination. Thus, Theophilus alludes
   to the decline and return of the seasons, the alternations of day and
   night, the renewal of the waning and waxing moon, the growth of seeds
   and fruits. Tertullian expresses his surprise that anybody should deny
   the possibility and probability of the resurrection in view of the
   mystery of our birth and the daily occurrences of surrounding nature.
   "All things," he says, "are preserved by dissolution, renewed by
   perishing; and shall man ... the lord of all this universe of
   creatures, which die and rise again, himself die only to perish
   forever?" [104] 03

   (4) The charge of immoral conduct and secret vice the apologists might
   repel with just indignation, since the New Testament contains the
   purest and noblest morality, and the general conduct of the Christians
   compared most favorably with that of the heathens. "Shame! shame!" they
   justly cried; "to roll upon the innocent what you are openly guilty of,
   and what belongs to you and your gods!" Origen says in the preface to
   the first book against Celsus: "When false witness was brought against
   our blessed Saviour, the spotless Jesus, he held his peace, and when he
   was accused, returned no answer, being fully persuaded that the tenor
   of his life and conduct among the Jews was the best apology that could
   possibly be made in his behalf .... And even now he preserves the same
   silence, and makes no other answer than the unblemished lives of his
   sincere followers; they are his most cheerful and successful advocates,
   and have so loud a voice that they drown the clamors of the most
   zealous and bigoted adversaries."

   II. To their defence the Christians, with the rising consciousness of
   victory, added direct arguments against heathenism, which were
   practically sustained by, its dissolution in the following period.

   (1) The popular religion of the heathens, particularly the doctrine of
   the gods, is unworthy, contradictory, absurd, immoral, and pernicious.
   The apologists and most of the early church teachers looked upon the
   heathen gods not as mere imaginations or personified powers of nature
   or deifications of distinguished men, but as demons or fallen angels.
   They took this view from the Septuagint version of Ps. 96:5, [105] 04
   and from the immorality of those deities, which was charged to demons
   (even sexual intercourse with fair daughters of men, according to Gen.
   6:2).

   "What sad fates," says Minucius Felix, "what lies, ridiculous things,
   and weaknesses we read of the pretended gods! Even their form, how
   pitiable it is! Vulcan limps; Mercury has wings to his feet; Pan is
   hoofed; Saturn in fetters; and Janus has two faces, as if he walked
   backwards .... Sometimes Hercules is a hostler, Apollo a cow-herd, and
   Neptune, Laomedon's mason, cheated of his wages. There we have the
   thunder of Jove and the arms of Aeneas forged on the same anvil (as if
   the heavens and the thunder and lightning did not exist before Jove was
   born in Crete); the adultery of Mars and Venus; the lewdness of Jupiter
   with Ganymede, all of which were invented for the gods to authorize men
   in their wickedness." "Which of the poets," asks Tertullian, "does not
   calumniate your gods? One sets Apollo to keep sheep; another hires out
   Neptune to build a wall; Pindar declares Esculapius was deservedly
   scathed for his avarice in exercising the art of medicine to a bad
   purpose; whilst the writers of tragedy and comedy alike, take for their
   subjects the crimes or the miseries of the deities. Nor are the
   philosophers behindhand in this respect. Out of pure contempt, they
   would swear by an oak, a goat, a dog. Diogenes turned Hercules into
   ridicule; and the Roman Cynic Varro introduces three hundred Joves
   without heads." From the stage abuser the sarcastic African father
   selects, partly from his own former observation, those of Diana being
   flogged, the reading of Jupiter's will after his decease, and the three
   half-starved Herculesses! Justin brings up the infanticide of Saturn,
   the parricide, the anger, and the adultery of Jupiter, the drunkenness
   of Bacchus, the voluptuousness of Venus, and he appeals to the judgment
   of the better heathens, who were ashamed of these scandalous histories
   of the gods; to Plato, for example, who for this reason banishes Homer
   from his ideal State. Those myths, which had some resemblance to the
   Old Testament prophecies or the gospel history, Justin regards as
   caricatures of the truth, framed by demons by abuse of Scripture. The
   story of Bacchus, for instance rests in his fanciful view, on Gen.
   49:11 sq.; the myth of the birth of Perseus from a virgin, on Is. 7:14;
   that of the wandering of Hercules, on Ps. 19:6; the fiction of the
   miracles of Esculapius on Is. 35:1 sqq.

   Origen asks Celsus, why it is that he can discover profound mysteries
   in those strange and senseless accidents, which have befallen his gods
   and goddesses, showing them to be polluted with crimes and doing many
   shameful things; whilst Moses, who says nothing derogatory to the
   character of God, angel, or man, is treated as an impostor. He
   challenges any one to compare Moses and his laws with the best Greek
   writers; and yet Moses was as far inferior to Christ, as he was
   superior to the greatest of heathen sages and legislators.

   (2) The Greek philosophy, which rises above the popular belief, is not
   suited to the masses, cannot meet the religious wants, and confutes
   itself by its manifold contradictions. Socrates, the wisest of all the
   philosophers, himself acknowledged that he knew nothing. On divine and
   human things Justin finds the philosophers at variance among
   themselves; with Thales water is the ultimate principle of all things;
   with Anaximander, air; with Heraclitus, fire; with Pythagoras, number.
   Even Plato not seldom contradicts himself; now supposing three
   fundamental causes (God, matter, and ideas), now four (adding the
   world-soul); now he considers matter is unbegotten, now as begotten; at
   one time he ascribes substantiality to ideas, at another makes them
   mere forms of thought, etc. Who, then, he concludes, would intrust to
   the philosophers the salvation of his soul?

   (3) But, on the other hand, the Greek apologists recognized also
   elements of truth in the Hellenic literature, especially in the
   Platonic and Stoic philosophy, and saw in them, as in the law and the
   prophecies of Judaism, a preparation of the way for Christianity.
   Justin attributes all the good in heathenism to the divine Logos, who,
   even before his incarnation, scattered the seeds of truth (hence the
   name "Logos spermaticos"), and incited susceptible spirits to a holy
   walk. Thus there were Christians before Christianity; and among these
   he expressly reckons Socrates and Heraclitus. [106] 05 Besides, he
   supposed that Pythagoras, Plato, and other educated Greeks, in their
   journeys to the East, became acquainted with the Old Testament
   writings, and drew from them the doctrine of the unity of God, and
   other like truths, though they in various ways misunderstood them, and
   adulterated them with pagan errors. This view of a certain affinity
   between the Grecian philosophy and Christianity, as an argument in
   favor of the new religion, was afterwards further developed by the
   Alexandrian fathers, Clement and Origen. [107] 06

   The Latin fathers speak less favorably of the Greek philosophy; yet
   even Augustin acknowledges that the Platonists approach so nearly to
   Christian truth that with a change of some expressions and sentences
   they would be true Christians (in theory). [108] 07

   § 40. The Positive Apology.

   The Christian apology completed itself in the positive demonstration of
   the divinity of the new religion; which was at the same time the best
   refutation of both the old ones. As early as this period the strongest
   historical and philosophical arguments for Christianity were brought
   forward, or at least indicated, though in connection with many
   untenable adjunct.

   1. The great argument, not only with Jews, but with heathens also, was
   the prophecies; since the knowledge of future events can come only from
   God. The first appeal of the apologists was, of course, to the
   prophetic writings of the Old Testament, in which they found, by a very
   liberal interpretation, every event of the gospel history and every
   lineament of our Saviour's character and work. In addition to the
   Scriptures, even such fathers as Clement of Alexandria, and, with more
   caution, Origen, Eusebius, St. Jerome, and St. Augustin, employed also,
   without hesitation, apocryphal prophecies, especially the Sibylline
   oracles, a medley of ancient heathen, Jewish, and in part Christian
   fictions, about a golden age, the coining of Christ, the fortunes of
   Rome, and the end of the world. [109] 08 And indeed, this was not all
   error and pious fraud. Through all heathenism there runs, in truth, a
   dim, unconscious presenti-ment and longing hope of Christianity. Think
   of the fourth Eclogue of Virgil, with its predictions of the "virgo"
   and "nova progenies" from heaven, and the "puer," with whom, after the
   blotting out of sin and the killing of the serpent, a golden age of
   peace was to begin. For this reason Virgil was the favorite poet of the
   Latin church during the middle ages, and figures prominently in Dante's
   Divina Comedia as his guide through the dreary regions of the Inferno
   and Purgatorio to the very gates of Paradise. Another pseudo-prophetic
   book used by the fathers (Tertullian, Origen, and apparently Jerome) is
   "The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, "written by a Jewish
   Christian between a.d. 100 and 120. It puts into the mouth of the
   twelve sons of Jacob farewell addresses and predictions of the coming
   of Christ, his death and resurrection, of baptism and the Lord's
   Supper, the rejection of the gospel by the Jews, and the preaching of
   Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, the destruction of Jerusalem
   and the end of the world. [110] 09

   2. The types. These, too, were found not only in the Old Testament, but
   in the whole range of nature. Justin saw everywhere, in the tree of
   life in Eden, in Jacob's ladder, in the rods of Moses and Aaron, nay,
   in every sailing ship, in the wave-cutting oar, in the plough, in the
   human countenance, in the human form with outstretched arms, in banners
   and trophies--the sacred form of the cross, and thus a prefiguration of
   the mystery of redemption through the crucifixion of the Lord. [111] 10

   3. The miracles of Jesus and the apostles, with those which continued
   to be wrought in the name of Jesus, according to the express testimony
   of the fathers, by their contemporaries. But as the heathens also
   appealed to miraculous deeds and appearances in favor of their
   religion, Justin, Arnobius, and particularly Origen, fixed certain
   criteria, such as the moral purity of the worker, and his intention to
   glorify God and benefit man, for distinguishing the true miracles from
   Satanic juggleries. "There might have been some ground," says Origen,
   "for the comparison which Celsus makes between Jesus and certain
   wandering magicians, if there had appeared in the latter the slightest
   tendency to beget in persons a true fear of God, and so to regulate
   their actions in prospect of the day of judgment. But they attempt
   nothing of the sort. Yea, they themselves are guilty of the most
   grievous crimes; whereas the Saviour would have his hearers to be
   convinced by the native beauty of religion and the holy lives of its
   teachers, rather than by even the miracles they wrought."

   The subject of post-apostolic miracles is surrounded by much greater
   difficulties in the absence of inspired testimony, and in most cases
   even of ordinary immediate witnesses. There is an antecedent
   probability that the power of working miracles was not suddenly and
   abruptly, but gradually withdrawn, as the necessity of such outward and
   extraordinary attestation of the divine origin of Christianity
   diminished and gave way to the natural operation of truth and moral
   suasion. Hence St. Augustin, in the fourth century, says: "Since the
   establishment of the church God does not wish to perpetuate miracles
   even to our day, lest the mind should put its trust in visible signs,
   or grow cold at the sight of common marvels." [112] 11 But it is
   impossible to fix the precise termination, either at the death of the
   apostles, or their immediate disciples, or the conversion of the Roman
   empire, or the extinction of the Arian heresy, or any subsequent era,
   and to sift carefully in each particular case the truth from legendary
   fiction.

   It is remarkable that the genuine writings of the ante-Nicene church
   are more free from miraculous and superstitious elements than the
   annals of the Nicene age and the middle ages. The history of
   monasticism teems with miracles even greater than those of the New
   Testament. Most of the statements of the apologists are couched in
   general terms, and refer to extraordinary cures from demoniacal
   possession (which probably includes, in the language of that age, cases
   of madness, deep melancholy, and epilepsy) and other diseases, by the
   invocation of the name of Jesus. [113] 12 Justin Martyr speaks of such
   cures as a frequent occurrence in Rome and all over the world, and
   Origen appeals to his own personal observation, but speaks in another
   place of the growing scarcity of miracles, so as to suggest the gradual
   cessation theory as held by Dr. Neander, Bishop Kaye, and others.
   Tertullian attributes many if not most of the conversions of his day to
   supernatural dreams and visions, as does also Origen, although with
   more caution. But in such psychological phenomena it is exceedingly
   difficult to draw the line of demarcation between natural and
   supernatural causes, and between providential interpositions and
   miracles proper. The strongest passage on this subject is found in
   Irenaeus, who, in contending against the heretics, mentions, besides
   prophecies and miraculous cures of demoniacs, even the raising of the
   dead among contemporary events taking place in the Catholic church;
   [114] 13 but he specifies no particular case or name; and it should be
   remembered also, that his youth still bordered almost on the Johannean
   age.

   4. The moral effect of Christianity upon the heart and life of its
   professors. The Christian religion has not only taught the purest and
   sublimest code of morals ever known among men, but actually exhibited
   it in the life sufferings, and death of its founder and true followers.
   All the apologists, from the author of the Epistle to Diognetus down to
   Origen, Cyprian, and Augustin, bring out in strong colors the infinite
   superiority of Christian ethics over the heathen, and their testimony
   is fully corroborated by the practical fruits of the church, as we
   shall have occasion more fully to show in another chapter. "They think
   us senseless," says Justin, "because we worship this Christ, who was
   crucified under Pontius Pilate, as God next to the Father. But they
   would not say so, if they knew the mystery of the cross. By its fruits
   they may know it. We, who once lived in debauchery, now study chastity;
   we, who dealt in sorceries, have consecrated ourselves to the good, the
   increate God; we, who loved money and possessions above all things
   else, now devote our property freely to the general good, and give to
   every needy one; we, who fought and killed each other, now pray for our
   enemies; those who persecute us in hatred, we kindly try to appease, in
   the hope that they may share the same blessings which we enjoy." [115]
   14

   5. The rapid spread of Christianity by purely moral means, and in spite
   of the greatest external obstacles, yea, the bitter persecution of Jews
   and Gentiles. The anonymous apologetic Epistle to Diognetus which
   belongs to the literature of the Apostolic Fathers, already thus urges
   this point: "Do you not see the Christians exposed to wild beasts, that
   they may be persuaded to deny the Lord, and yet not overcome? Do you
   not see that the more of them are punished, the greater becomes the
   number of the rest? This does not seem to be the work of man: this is
   the power of God; these are the evidences of his manifestation." [116]
   15 Justin Martyr and Tertullian frequently go on in a similar strain.
   Origen makes good use of this argument against Celsus, and thinks that
   so great a success as Christianity met among Greeks and barbarians,
   learned and unlearned persons in so short a time, without any force or
   other worldly means, and in view of the united opposition of emperors,
   senate, governors, generals, priests, and people, can only be
   rationally accounted for on the ground of an extraordinary providence
   of God and the divine nature of Christ.

   6. The reasonableness of Christianity, and its agreement with all the
   true and the beautiful in the Greek philosophy and poesy. All who had
   lived rationally before Christ were really, though unconsciously,
   already Christians. Thus all that is Christian is rational, and all
   that is truly rational is Christian. Yet, on the other hand, of course,
   Christianity is supra-rational (not irrational).

   7. The adaptation of Christianity to the deepest needs of human nature,
   which it alone can meet. Here belongs Tertullian's appeal to the
   "testimonia animae naturaliter Christianae;" his profound thought, that
   the human soul is, in its inmost essence and instinct, predestined for
   Christianity, and can find rest and peace in that alone. "The soul,"
   says he, "though confined in the prison of the body, though perverted
   by bad training, though weakened by lusts and passions, though given to
   the service of false gods, still no sooner awakes from its intoxication
   and its dreams, and recovers its health, than it calls upon God by the
   one name due to him: 'Great God! good God!'--and then looks, not to the
   capitol, but to heaven; for it knows the abode of the living God, from
   whom it proceeds." [117] 16

   This deep longing of the human soul for the living God in Christ,
   Augustin, in whom Tertullian's spirit returned purified and enriched,
   afterwards expressed in the grand sentence: "Thou, O God, hast made us
   for thee, and our heart is restless, till it rests in thee." [118] 17

   ORGANIZATION AND DISCIPLINE OF THE CHURCH.

   § 41. Progress in Consolidation.

   In the external organization of the church, several important changes
   appear in the period before us. The distinction of clergy and laity,
   and the sacerdotal view of the ministry becomes prominent and fixed;
   subordinate church offices are multiplied; the episcopate arises; the
   beginnings of the Roman primacy appear; and the exclusive unity of the
   Catholic church develops itself in opposition to heretics and
   schismatics. The apostolical organization of the first century now
   gives place to the old Catholic episcopal system; and this, in its
   turn, passes into the metropolitan, and after the fourth century into
   the patriarchal. Here the Greek church stopped, and is governed to this
   day by a hierarchical oligarchy of patriarchs equal in rank and
   jurisdiction; while the Latin church went a step further, and produced
   in the middle ages the papal monarchy. The germs of this papacy
   likewise betray themselves even in our present period, particularly in
   Cyprian, together with a protest against it. Cyprian himself is as much
   a witness for consolidated primacy, as for independent episcopacy, and
   hence often used and abused alike by Romanists and Anglicans for
   sectarian purposes.

   The characteristics, however, of the pre-Constantinian hierarchy, in
   distinction from the post-Constantinian, both Greek and Roman, are,
   first, its grand simplicity, and secondly, its spirituality, or freedom
   from all connection with political power and worldly splendor. Whatever
   influence the church acquired and exercised, she owed nothing to the
   secular government, which continued indifferent or positively hostile
   till the protective toleration edict of Constantine (313). Tertullian
   thought it impossible for an emperor to be a Christian, or a Christian
   to be an emperor; and even after Constantine, the Donatists persisted
   in this view, and cast up to the Catholics the memory of the former
   age: "What have Christians to do with kings? or what have bishops to do
   in the palace?" [119] 18 The ante-Nicene fathers expected the ultimate
   triumph of Christianity over the world from a supernatural
   interposition at the second Advent. Origen seems to have been the only
   one in that age of violent persecution who expected that Christianity,
   by continual growth, would gain the dominion over the world. [120] 19

   The consolidation of the church and its compact organization implied a
   restriction of individual liberty, in the interest of order, and a
   temptation to the abuse of authority. But it was demanded by the
   diminution of spiritual gifts, which were poured out in such
   extraordinary abundance in the apostolic age. It made the church a
   powerful republic within the Roman empire, and contributed much to its
   ultimate success. "In union is strength," especially in times of danger
   and persecution such as the church had to pass through in the
   ante-Nicene age. While we must deny a divine right and perpetual
   obligation to any peculiar form of government as far as it departs from
   the simple principles of the New Testament, we may concede a historical
   necessity and great relative importance to the ante-Nicene and
   subsequent organizations of the church. Even the papacy was by no means
   an unmixed evil, but a training school for the barbarian nations during
   the middle ages. Those who condemn, in principle, all hierarchy,
   sacerdotalism, and ceremonialism, should remember that God himself
   appointed the priesthood and ceremonies in the Mosaic dispensation, and
   that Christ submitted to the requirements of the law in the days of his
   humiliation.

   § 42. Clergy and Laity.

   The idea and institution of a special priesthood, distinct from the
   body of the people, with the accompanying notion of sacrifice and
   altar, passed imperceptibly from Jewish and heathen reminiscences and
   analogies into the Christian church. The majority of Jewish converts
   adhered tenaciously to the Mosaic institutions and rites, and a
   considerable part never fully attained to the height of spiritual
   freedom proclaimed by Paul, or soon fell away from it. He opposed
   legalistic and ceremonial tendencies in Galatia and Corinth; and
   although sacerdotalism does not appear among the errors of his
   Judaizing opponents, the Levitical priesthood, with its three ranks of
   high-priest, priest, and Levite, naturally furnished an analogy for the
   threefold ministry of bishop, priest, and deacon, and came to be
   regarded as typical of it. Still less could the Gentile Christians, as
   a body, at once emancipate themselves from their traditional notions of
   priesthood, altar, and sacrifice, on which their former religion was
   based. Whether we regard the change as an apostasy from a higher
   position attained, or as a reaction of old ideas never fully abandoned,
   the change is undeniable, and can be traced to the second century. The
   church could not long occupy the ideal height of the apostolic age, and
   as the Pentecostal illumination passed away with the death of the
   apostles, the old reminiscences began to reassert themselves. [121] 20

   In the apostolic church preaching and teaching were not confined to a
   particular class, but every convert could proclaim the gospel to
   unbelievers, and every Christian who had the gift could pray and teach
   and exhort in the congregation. [122] 21 The New Testament knows no
   spiritual aristocracy or nobility, but calls all believers "saints"
   though many fell far short of their vocation. Nor does it recognize a
   special priesthood in distinction from the people, as mediating between
   God and the laity. It knows only one high-priest, Jesus Christ, and
   clearly teaches the universal priesthood, as well as universal
   kingship, of believers. [123] 22 It does this in a far deeper and
   larger sense than the Old; [124] 23 in a sense, too, which even to this
   day is not yet fully realized. The entire body of Christians are called
   "clergy" (kleroi a peculiar people, the heritage of God. [125] 24

   On the other hand it is equally clear that there was in the apostolic
   church a ministerial office, instituted by Christ, for the very purpose
   of raising the mass of believers from infancy and pupilage to
   independent and immediate intercourse with God, to that prophetic,
   priestly, and kingly position, which in principle and destination
   belongs to them all. [126] 25 This work is the gradual process of
   church history itself, and will not be fully accomplished till the
   kingdom of glory shall come. But these ministers are nowhere
   represented as priests in any other sense than Christians generally are
   priests, with the privilege of a direct access to the throne of grace
   in the name of their one and eternal high-priest in heaven. Even in the
   Pastoral Epistles which present the most advanced stage of
   ecclesiastical organization in the apostolic period, while the
   teaching, ruling, and pastoral functions of the presbyter-bishops are
   fully discussed, nothing is said about a sacerdotal function. The
   Apocalypse, which was written still later, emphatically teaches the
   universal priesthood and kingship of believers. The apostles themselves
   never claim or exercise a special priesthood. The sacrifice which all
   Christians are exhorted to offer is the sacrifice of their person and
   property to the Lord, and the spiritual sacrifice of thanksgiving and
   praise. [127] 26 In one passage a Christian "altar" is spoken of, in
   distinction from the Jewish altar of literal and daily sacrifices, but
   this altar is the cross on which Christ offered himself once and
   forever for the sins of the world. [128] 27

   After the gradual abatement of the extraordinary spiritual elevation of
   the apostolic age, which anticipated in its way the ideal condition of
   the church, the distinction of a regular class of teachers from the
   laity became more fixed and prominent. This appears first in Ignatius,
   who, in his high episcopalian spirit, considers the clergy the
   necessary medium of access for the people to God. "Whoever is within
   the sanctuary (or altar), is pure; but he who is outside of the
   sanctuary is not pure; that is, he who does anything without bishop and
   presbytery and deacon, is not pure in conscience." [129] 28 Yet he
   nowhere represents the ministry as a sacerdotal office. The Didache
   calls "the prophets" high-priests, but probably in a spiritual sense.
   [130] 29 Clement of Rome, in writing to the congregation at Corinth,
   draws a significant and fruitful parallel between the Christian
   presiding office and the Levitical priesthood, and uses the expression
   "layman" (laikos anthropos) as antithetic to high-priest, priests, and
   Levites. [131] 30 This parallel contains the germ of the whole system
   of sacerdotalism. But it is at best only an argument by analogy.
   Tertullian was the first who expressly and directly asserts sacerdotal
   claims on behalf of the Christian ministry, and calls it "sacerdotium,"
   although he also strongly affirms the universal priesthood of all
   believers. Cyprian (d. 258) goes still further, and applies all the
   privileges, duties, and responsibilities of the Aaronic priesthood to
   the officers of the Christian church, and constantly calls them
   sacerdotes and sacerdotium. He may therefore be called the proper
   father of the sacerdotal conception of the Christian ministry as a
   mediating agency between God and the people. During the third century
   it became customary to apply the term "priest" directly and exclusively
   to the Christian ministers especially the bishops. [132] 31 In the same
   manner the whole ministry, and it alone, was called "clergy," with a
   double reference to its presidency and its peculiar relation to God.
   [133] 32 It was distinguished by this name from the Christian people or
   "laity." [134] 33 Thus the term "clergy," which first signified the lot
   by which office was assigned (Acts 1:17, 25), then the office itself,
   then the persons holding that office, was transferred from the
   Christians generally to the ministers exclusively.

   Solemn "ordination" or consecration by the laying on of hands was the
   form of admission into the "ordo ecclesiasticus" or "sacerdotalis." In
   this order itself there were again three degrees, "ordines majores," as
   they were called: the diaconate, the presbyterate, and the
   episcopate--held to be of divine institution. Under these were the
   "ordines minores," of later date, from sub-deacon to ostiary, which
   formed the stepping-stone between the clergy proper and the people.
   [135] 34

   Thus we find, so early as the third century, the foundations of a
   complete hierarchy; though a hierarchy of only moral power, and holding
   no sort of outward control over the conscience. The body of the laity
   consisted of two classes: the faithful, or the baptized and
   communicating members, and the catechumens, who were preparing for
   baptism. Those church members who lived together in one place, [136] 35
   formed a church in the narrower sense. [137] 36

   With the exaltation of the clergy appeared the tendency to separate
   them from secular business, and even from social relations--from
   marriage, for example--and to represent them, even outwardly, as a
   caste independent of the people, and devoted exclusively to the service
   of the sanctuary. They drew their support from the church treasury,
   which was supplied by voluntary contributions and weekly collections on
   the Lord's Day. After the third century they were forbidden to engage
   in any secular business, or even to accept any trusteeship. Celibacy
   was not yet in this period enforced, but left optional. Tertullian,
   Gregory of Nyssa, and other distinguished church teachers, lived in
   wedlock, though theoretically preferring the unmarried state. Of an
   official clerical costume no certain trace appears before the fourth
   century; and if it came earlier into use, as may have been the ease,
   after the example of the Jewish church, it must have been confined,
   during the times of persecution, to the actual exercises of worship.

   With the growth of this distinction of clergy and laity, however, the
   idea of the universal priesthood continued from time to time to assert
   itself: in Irenaeus, [138] 37 for example, and in an eccentric form in
   the Montanists, who even allowed women to teach publicly in the church.
   So Tertullian, with whom clerus and laici were at one time familiar
   expressions, inquires, as the champion of the Montanistic reaction
   against the Catholic hierarchy: "Are not we laymen priests also?" [139]
   38 It is written, he continues: "He hath made us kings and priests
   (Rev. 1:6). It is the authority of the church alone which has made a
   distinction between clergy and laity. Where there is no college of
   ministers, you administer the sacrament, you baptize, you are a priest
   for yourself alone. And where there are three of you, there is a
   church, though you be only laymen. For each one lives by his own faith,
   and there is no respect of persons with God." [140] 39 All, therefore,
   which the clergy considered peculiar to them, he claimed for the laity
   as the common sacerdotal privilege of all Christians.

   Even in the Catholic church an acknowledgment of the general priesthood
   showed itself in the custom of requiring the baptized to say the Lord's
   Prayer before the assembled congregation. With reference to this,
   Jerome says: "Sacerdotium laici, id est, baptisma." The congregation
   also, at least in the West, retained for a long time the right of
   approval and rejection in the choice of its ministers, even of the
   bishop. Clement of Rome expressly requires the assent of the whole
   congregation for a valid election; [141] 40 and Cyprian terms this an
   apostolic and almost universal regulation. [142] 41 According to his
   testimony it obtained also in Rome, and was observed in the case of his
   contemporary, Cornelius. [143] 42 Sometimes in the filling of a vacant
   bishopric the "suffragium" of the people preceded the "judicium" of the
   clergy of the diocese. Cyprian, and afterwards Athanasius, Ambrose,
   Augustin, and other eminent prelates, were in a manner pressed into the
   bishopric in this democratic way. Cyprian, with all his high-church
   proclivities, declares it his principle to do nothing as bishop without
   the advice of the presbyters and deacons, and the consent of the
   people. [144] 43 A peculiar influence, which even the clergy could not
   withstand, attached to the "confessors," and it was sometimes abused by
   them, as in their advocacy of the lapsed, who denied Christ in the
   Decian persecution.

   Finally, we notice cases where the function of teaching was actually
   exercised by laymen. The bishops of Jerusalem and Caesarea allowed the
   learned Origen to expound the Bible to their congregations before his
   ordination, and appealed to the example of several bishops in the East.
   [145] 44 Even in the Apostolical Constitutions there occurs, under the
   name of the Apostle Paul, the direction: "Though a man be a layman, if
   experienced in the delivery of instruction, and reverent in habit, he
   may teach; for the Scripture says: 'They shall be all taught of God.' "
   [146] 45 The fourth general council at Carthage (398) prohibited laymen
   from teaching in the presence of clergymen and without their consent;
   implying at the same time, that with such permission the thing might be
   done. [147] 46

   It is worthy of notice that a number of the most eminent church
   teachers of this period, Hermas, Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, Clement of
   Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, Arnobius, and Lactantius, were either
   laymen, or at most only presbyters. Hermas, who wrote one of the most
   popular and authoritative books in the early church, was probably a
   layman; perhaps also the author of the homily which goes under the name
   of the Second Epistle of Clement of Rome, and has recently been
   discovered in full both in the original Greek and in a Syriac
   translation; for he seems to distinguish himself and his hearers from
   the presbyters. [148] 47
     __________________________________________________________________

   [121] Renan, looking at the gradual development of the hierarchy out of
   the primitive democracy, from his secular point of view, calls it, the
   most profound transformation "in history, and a triple abdication:
   first the club (the congregation) committing its power to the bureau or
   the committee (the college of presbyters), then the bureau to its
   president (the bishop) who could say: "Je suis le club,"and finally the
   presidents to the pope as the universal and infallible bishop; the last
   process being completed in the Vatican Council of 1870. See his E'glise
   chrétienne, p. 88, and his English Conferences (Hibbert Lectures,
   1880), p 90.

   was enjoyed, and the elder could ask any member of repute, even a
   stranger, to deliver a discourse on the Scripture lesson (Luke 4:17;
   Acts 17:2).

   Bampton Lectures on The Organization of the Early Christian Churches
   (1881), p. 139: "In earlier times there was a grander faith. For the
   kingdom of God was a kingdom of priests. Not only the 'four and twenty
   elders' before the throne, but the innumerable souls of the sanctified
   upon whom 'the second death had no power,' were 'kings and priests unto
   God.' Only in that high sense was priesthood predicable of Christian
   men. For the shadow had passed: the reality had come: the one High
   Priest of Christianity was Christ."

   Bengel, Bleek, Lünemann, Riehm, etc. Others explain it of the Lord's

   estin te suneidesei.Funk's ed. I. 208. Some MSS. omit the second
   clause, perhaps from homoeoteleuton. Von Gebhardt and Harnack also omit
   it in the Greek text, but retain it in the Latin (qui extra attare est,
   non mundus est). The toutestin evidently requires the clause.

   [130] Cf. ch. 13. See note in Schaff's edition, p. 206

   [131] Ad Cor. 40: "Unto the high-priest his proper services have been
   intrusted, and to the priests their proper office is appointed, and
   upon the levites their proper ministrations are laid. The layman is
   bound by the layman's ordinances (ho laikos anthropos tois laikois
   prostagmasin dedetai)." The passage occurs in the text of Bryennios as
   well as in the older editions, and there is no good reason to suspect
   it of being an interpolation in the hierarchical interest, as Neander
   and Milman have done. Bishop Lightfoot, in his St. Clement of Rome, p.
   128 sq., puts a mild construction upon it, and says that the analogy
   does not extend to the three orders, because Clement only knows two
   (bishops and deacons), and that the high priesthood of Christ is wholly
   different in kind from the Mosaic high priesthood, and exempt from
   those very limitations on which Clement dwells in that chapter.

   [132] Sacerdos, also summus sacerdos (Tertullian, De Bapt. 7), and
   oncepontifex maximus (De Pudic. 1, with ironical reference, it seems,
   to the Roman bishop); ordo sacerdotalis (De Exhort. Cast. 7); hiereus
   and sometimes archiereus (Apost. Const. II. 34, 35, 36, 57; III. 9; vi.
   15, 18, etc.). Hippolytus calls his office an archierateia and
   didaskalia (Ref. Haer. I. prooem.). Cyprian generally applies the term
   sacerdos to the bishop, and calls his colleagues consacerdotales.

   [133] Kleros,clerus, taxisordo, ordosacerdotalis (Tertulli, De Ehort.
   Cast. 7), ordo eccelesiasticus orecclesiae (De Monog. 11; De Idolol.
   7); klerikoi, clerici. The first instance perhaps of the use of clerus
   in the sense of clergy is in Tertullian,De Monog. c. 12: "Unde enim
   episcopi et clerus ?" and: "Extollimur et inflamur adversus clerum."
   Jerome (Ad Nepotian.) explains this exclusive application of clerus to
   ministers, "vel quia de sorte sunt Domini, vel quia ipse Dominus sors,
   id est, pars clericorum est." The distinction between the regular
   clergy, who were also monks, and the secular clergy or parish priests,
   is of much later date (seventh or eighth century).

   [134] Laos, laikoi, plebs. In Tertullian, Cyprian, and in the Apostolic
   Constitutions the term " layman" occurs very often. Cyprian speaks
   (250) of a " conference held with bishops, presbyters, deacons,
   confessors, and also with laymen who stood firm"(in persecution), Ep.
   30, ad Rom

   [135] .Occasionally, however we find a somewhat wider terminology.
   Tertullian mentions, De Monog c. 12, the ordo viduarum among the
   ordines ecclesiastici, and even the much later Jerome (see In Jesaiam,
   l. v.c. 19, 18), enumerates quinque ecclesiae ordines, episcopos,
   presbyteros, diaconos, fideles, catechumenos.

   the church, although he had not yet obtained the priesthood by the
   imposition of hands." It is true this was made the ground of a charge
   against him by Demetrius, bishop of Alexandria; but the charge was that
   Origen had preached "in the presence of bishops," not that he had
   preached as a layman. And the bishops of Jerusalem and Caesarea adduced
   several examples of holy bishops inviting capable laymen to preach to
   the people. Prudentius and Aedesius, while laymen, founded the church
   in Abyssinia, Socrates, Hist. Eccl. I. 19.

   "learned or holy," to "presume to teach men in a meeting." Pope Leo I.
   (Ep 92 and 93) forbids lay preaching in the interest of ecclesiastical
   order. Charlemagne enacted a law that "a layman ought not to recite a
   lesson in church, nor to say the Hallelujah but only the Psalm or
   responses without the Hallelujah."

   [148] The Greek text (of which only a fragment was known before) was

   Clement of Rome, Appendix (1877). Harnack, Hilgenfeld, and Hatch (l.c.
   114; note) suppose that the homily was delivered by a layman, but
   Lightfoot (p. 304) explains the language above alluded to as a common
   rhetorical figure by which the speaker places himself on a level with
   his audience.

   § 43. New Church Officers.

   The expansion of the church, the development of her cultus, and the
   tendency towards hierarchical pomp, led to the multiplication of
   offices below the diaconate, which formed the ordines minores. About
   the middle of the third century the following new officers are
   mentioned:

   1. Sub-deacons, or under-helpers; [149] 48 assistants and deputies of
   the deacons; the only one of these subordinate offices for which a
   formal ordination was required. Opinions differ as to its value.

   2. Readers, [150] 49 who read the Scriptures in the assembly and had
   charge of the church books.

   3. Acolyths, [151] 50 attendants of the bishops in their official
   duties and processions.

   4. Exorcists, [152] 51 who, by prayer and the laying on of hands, cast
   out the evil spirit from the possessed, [153] 52 and from catechumens,
   and frequently assisted in baptism. This power had been formerly
   considered a free gift of the Holy Spirit.

   5. Precentors, [154] 53 for the musical parts of the liturgy, psalms,
   benedictions, responses, etc.

   6. Janitors or sextons, [155] 54 who took care of the religious
   meeting-rooms, and at a later period also of the church-yards.

   7. Besides these there were in the larger churches catechists, and,
   where the church language in the worship was not understood,
   interpreters; but the interpreting was commonly done by presbyters,
   deacons, or readers.

   The bishop Cornelius of Rome (d. 252), in a letter on the Novatian
   schism, [156] 55 gives the number of officers in his church as follows:
   Forty-six presbyters, probably corresponding to the number of the
   meeting-houses of the Christians in the city; seven deacons, after the
   model of the church at Jerusalem (Acts vi); seven sub-deacons;
   forty-two acolyths, and fifty-two exorcists, readers, and janitors.

   As to the ordines majores, the deacons during this period rose in
   importance. In addition to their original duties of caring for the poor
   and sick, they baptized, distributed the sacramental cup, said the
   church prayers, not seldom preached, and were confidential advisers,
   sometimes even delegates and vicars of the bishops. This last is true
   especially of the "archdeacon," who does not appear, however, till the
   fourth century. The presbyters, on the contrary, though above the
   deacons, were now overtopped by the new office of bishop, in which the
   entire government of the church became centred.

   § 44. Origin of the Episcopate.

   Besides the works already cited, compare the special works and essays
   on the Ignatian controversy, published since 1837, by Rothe (close of
   his Anfänge, etc.), Hefele (R.C.), Baur, Hilgenfeld, Bunsen, Petermann,
   Cureton, Lipsius, Uhlhorn, Zahn, Lightfoot (I. 376 sqq). Also R. D.
   Hitchcock on the Origin of Episcopacy, N. Y. 1867 (in the "Am. Presbyt.
   & Theol. Review" for Jan. 1867, pp. 133-169); Lightfoot on the
   Christian Ministry (1873); Hatch on the Organization of the Early
   Christian Church (1881); Renan, L'Eglise chrétienne (1879), ch.
   VI.Progrés de l'épiscopat; and Gore, The Ministry of the Church (1889).

   The most important and also the most difficult phenomenon of our period
   in the department of church organization is the rise and development of
   the episcopate as distinct from the presbyterate. This institution
   comes to view in the second century as the supreme spiritual office,
   and is retained to this day by all Roman and Greek Christendom, and by
   a large part of the Evangelical church, especially the Anglican
   communion. A form of government so ancient and so widely adopted, can
   be satisfactorily accounted for only on the supposition of a religious
   need, namely, the need of a tangible outward representation and
   centralization, to illustrate and embody to the people their relation
   to Christ and to God, and the visible unity of the church. It is
   therefore inseparable from the catholic principle of authority and
   mediation; while the protestant principle of freedom and direct
   intercourse of the believer with Christ, consistently carried out,
   infringes the strict episcopal constitution, and tends to ministerial
   equality. Episcopacy in the full sense of the term requires for its
   base the idea of a real priesthood and real sacrifice, and an essential
   distinction between clergy and laity. Divested of these associations,
   it resolves itself into a mere superintendency. [157] 56

   During the lifetime of the apostles, those eye- and ear-witnesses of
   the divine-human life of Jesus, and the inspired organs of the Holy
   Spirit, there was no room for proper bishops; and those who were so
   called, must have held only a subordinate place. The church, too, in
   the first century was as yet a strictly supernatural organization, a
   stranger in this world, standing with one foot in eternity, and longing
   for the second coming of her heavenly bridegroom. But in the episcopal
   constitution the church provided an extremely simple but compact and
   freely expansible organization, planted foot firmly upon earth, became
   an institution for the education of her infant people, and, as
   chiliastic hopes receded, fell into the path of quiet historical
   development; yet unquestionably she thus incurred also the danger of a
   secularization which reached its height just when the hierarchy became
   complete in the Roman church, and which finally necessitated a
   reformation on the basis of apostolical Christianity. That this
   secularization began with the growing power of the bishops even before
   Constantine and the Byzantine court orthodoxy, we perceive, for
   instance, in the lax penitential discipline, the avarice, and the
   corruption with which Hippolytus, in the ninth book of his
   Philosophumena, reproaches Zephyrinus and Callistus, the Roman bishops
   of his time (202-223); also in the example of the bishop Paul of
   Samosata, who was deposed in 269 on almost incredible charges, not only
   against his doctrine, but still more against his moral character. [158]
   57 Origen complains that there are, especially in the larger cities,
   overseers of the people of God, who seek to outdo the pomp of heathen
   potentates, would surround themselves, like the emperors, with a
   body-guard, and make themselves terrible and inaccessible to the poor.
   [159] 58

   We consider, first, the origin of the episcopate. The unreliable
   character of our documents and traditions from the transition period
   between the close of the apostolic church and the beginning of the
   post-apostolic, leaves large room here for critical research and
   combination. First of all comes the question: Was the episcopate
   directly or indirectly of apostolic (Johannean) origin? [160] 59 Or did
   it arise after the death of the apostles, and develope itself from the
   presidency of the congregational presbytery? [161] 60 In other words,
   was the episcopate a continuation and contraction of, and substitute
   for, the apostolate, or was it an expansion and elevation of the
   presbyterate? [162] 61 The later view is more natural and better
   sustained by facts. Most of its advocates date the change from the time
   of Ignatius in the first quarter of the second century, while a few
   carry it further back to the close of the first, when St. John still
   lived in Ephesus.

   I. For the apostolic origin of episcopacy the following points may be
   made:

   (1) The position of James, who evidently stood at the head of the
   church at Jerusalem, [163] 62 and is called bishop, at least in the
   pseudo-Clementine literature, and in fact supreme bishop of the whole
   church. [164] 63 This instance, however, stands quite alone, and does
   not warrant an inference in regard to the entire church.

   (2) The office of the assistants and delegates of the apostles, like
   Timothy, Titus, Silas, Epaphroditus, Luke, Mark, who had a sort of
   supervision of several churches and congregational officers, and in a
   measure represented the apostles in special missions. But, in any case,
   these were not limited, at least during the life of the apostles, each
   to a particular diocese; they were itinerant evangelists and legates of
   the apostles; only the doubtful tradition of a later day assigns them
   distinct bishoprics. If bishops at all, they were missionary bishops.

   (3) The angels of the seven churches of Asia, [165] 64 who, if regarded
   as individuals, look very like the later bishops, and indicate a
   monarchical shaping of the church government in the days of John. But,
   apart from the various interpretations of the Apocalyptic angeloi, that
   office appears not co-ordinate with the apostolate of John, but
   subordinate to it, and was no more than a congregational
   superintendency.

   (4) The testimony of Ignatius of Antioch, a disciple of John, in his
   seven (or three) epistles from the beginning of the second century
   (even according to the shorter Syriac version), presupposes the
   episcopate, in distinction from the presbyterate, as already existing,
   though as a new institution, yet in its growth.

   (5) The statement of Clement of Alexandria, [166] 65 that John
   instituted bishops after his return from Patmos; and the accounts of
   Irenaeus, [167] 66 Tertullian, [168] 67 Eusebius, [169] 68 and Jerome,
   [170] 69 that the same apostle nominated and ordained Polycarp (with
   whom Irenaeus was personally acquainted) bishop of Smyrna.

   (6) The uncertain tradition in Eusebius, who derived it probably from
   Hegesippus, that the surviving apostles and disciples of the apostles,
   soon after the destruction of Jerusalem, elected Symeon, the son of
   Klopas and a cousin of Jesus, bishop of that city and successor of
   James. But this arrangement at best was merely local, and not general.
   [171] 70

   (7) The tradition of the churches of Antioch and Rome, which trace
   their line of bishops back to apostolic institution, and kept the
   record of an unbroken succession.

   (8) A passage in the second of the Pfaff Fragments of Irenaeus, which
   speaks of "second ordinances of the apostles" (deuterai ton apostolon
   diataxeis). Rothe understands by these the institution of the
   episcopate. But aside from the doubtful genuineness of the Fragments,
   these words are at all events of unsettled interpretation, and,
   according to the connection, relate not to the government of the church
   at all, but to the celebration of the eucharist.

   (9) Equally uncertain is the conclusion drawn from an obscure passage
   in the Epistle of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians, which admits of
   different interpretations. [172] 71 The apostles, it is said,
   foreseeing the future controversy about the name of the episcopal
   office, appointed bishops and deacons, and afterwards made the
   disposition, [173] 72 that when they should fall asleep, other approved
   men should follow them in office. Rothe refers "they" and "them" to the
   apostles as the main subject. But these words naturally refer to the
   congregational officers just before mentioned, and in this case the
   "other approved men" are not successors of the apostles, but of the
   presbyter-bishops and deacons. [174] 73 This view is sustained by the
   connection. The difficulty in the Corinthian congregation was a
   rebellion, not against a single bishop, but against a number of
   presbyter-bishops, and Clement reminds them that the apostles
   instituted this office not only for the first generation, but provided
   for a permanent succession, and that the officers were appointed for
   life, and could therefore not be deposed so long as they discharged
   their duties. Hence he goes on to say, immediately after the disputed
   passage in chapter 44: "Wherefore we think that those cannot justly be
   thrown out of their ministry who were appointed either by them (the
   apostles), or afterwards by other eminent men, with the consent of the
   whole congregation; and who have with all lowliness and innocency
   ministered to the flock of Christ, in peace, and without self-interest,
   and were for a long time commended by all."

   (10) Finally, the philosophical consideration, that the universal and
   uncontested spread of the episcopate in the second century cannot be
   satisfactorily explained without the presumption of at least the
   indirect sanction of the apostles. By the same argument the observance
   of Sunday and infant baptism are usually traced to apostolic origin.
   But it is not quite conclusive, since most of the apostles died before
   the destruction of Jerusalem. It could only apply to John, who was the
   living centre of the church in Asia Minor to the close of the first
   century. [175] 74

   II. The theory of the post-apostolic origin of the episcopate as a
   separate office or order, and its rise out of the presidency of the
   original congregational presbyterate, by way of human, though natural
   and necessary, development, is supported by the following facts:

   (1) The undeniable identity of presbyters and bishops in the New
   Testament, [176] 75 conceded even by the best interpreters among the
   church fathers, by Jerome, Chrysostom, and Theodoret, and by the best
   scholars of recent times.

   (2) Later, at the close of the first and even in the second century,
   the two terms are still used in like manner for the same office. The
   Roman bishop Clement, in his First Epistle to the Corinthians says,
   that the apostles, in the newly-founded churches, appointed the first
   fruits of the faith, i.e., the first converts, "bishops and deacons."
   [177] 76 He here omits the presbuteroi, as Paul does in Phil. 1:1, for
   the simple reason that they are in his view identical with episkopoi;
   while conversely, in c. 57, he enjoins subjection to presbyters,
   without mentioning bishops. [178] 77 The Didache mentions bishops and
   deacons, but no presbyters. [179] 78 Clement of Alexandria
   distinguishes, it is true, the deaconate, the presbyterate, and the
   episcopate; but he supposes only a two-fold official character, that of
   presbyters, and that of deacons--a view which found advocates so late
   as the middle ages, even in pope Urban II., a.d. 1091. Lastly,
   Irenaeus, towards the close of the second century, though himself a
   bishop, makes only a relative difference between episcopi and
   presbyteri; speaks of successions of the one in the same sense as of
   the other; terms the office of the latter episcopatus; and calls the
   bishops of Rome "presbyters". [180] 79 Sometimes, it is true, he
   appears to use the term "presbyters" in a more general sense, for the
   old men, the fathers. [181] 80 But in any case his language shows that
   the distinction between the two offices was at that time still relative
   and indefinite.

   (3) The express testimony of the learned Jerome, that the churches
   originally, before divisions arose through the instigation of Satan,
   were governed by the common council of the presbyters, and not till a
   later period was one of the pres-byters placed at the head, to watch
   over the church and suppress schisms. [182] 81 He traces the difference
   of the office simply to "ecclesiastical" custom as distinct from divine
   institution. [183] 82

   (4) The custom of the church of Alexandria, where, from the evangelist
   Mark down to the middle of the third century, the twelve presbyters
   elected one of their number president, and called him bishop. This fact
   rests on the authority of Jerome, [184] 83 and is confirmed
   independently by the Annals of the Alexandrian patriarch, Eutychius, of
   the tenth century. [185] 84 The latter states that Mark instituted in
   that city a patriarch (this is an anachronism) and twelve presbyters,
   who should fill the vacant patriarchate by electing and ordaining to
   that office one of their number and then electing a new presbyter, so
   as always to retain the number twelve. He relates, moreover, that down
   to the time of Demetrius, at the end of the second century, there was
   no bishop in Egypt besides the one at Alexandria; consequently there
   could have been no episcopal ordination except by going out of the
   province.

   III. Conclusion. The only satisfactory conclusion from these various
   facts and traditions seems to be, that the episcopate proceeded, both
   in the descending and ascending scale, from the apostolate and the
   original presbyterate conjointly, as a contraction of the former and an
   expansion of the latter, without either express concert or general
   regulation of the apostles, neither of which, at least, can be
   historically proved. It arose, instinctively, as it were, in that
   obscure and critical transition period between the end of the first and
   the middle of the second century. It was not a sudden creation, much
   less the invention of a single mind. It grew, in part, out of the
   general demand for a continuation of, or substitute for, the apostolic
   church government, and this, so far as it was transmissible at all,
   very naturally passed first to the most eminent disciples and
   fellow-laborers of the apostles, to Mark, Luke, Timothy, Clement,
   Ignatius, Polycarp, Papias, which accounts for the fact that tradition
   makes them all bishops in the prominent sense of the term. It was
   further occasioned by the need of a unity in the presbyterial
   government of congregations, which, in the nature of the case and
   according to the analogy of the Jewish archisunagogos, [186] 85
   required a head or president. This president was called bishop, at
   first only by eminence, as primus inter pares; afterwards in the
   exclusive sense. In the smaller churches there was, perhaps, from the
   beginning, only one presbyter, who of himself formed this centre, like
   the chorepiscopi or country-bishops in the fourth century. The dioceses
   of the bishops in Asia Minor and North Africa, owing to their large
   number, in the second and third centuries, can hardly have exceeded the
   extent of respectable pastoral charges. James of Jerusalem, on the
   other hand, and his immediate successors, whose positions in many
   respects were altogether peculiar, seem to have been the only bishops
   in Palestine. Somewhat similar was the state of things in Egypt, where,
   down to Demetrius (a.d. 190-232), we find only the one bishop of
   Alexandria.

   We cannot therefore assume any strict uniformity. But the whole church
   spirit of the age tended towards centralization; it everywhere felt a
   demand for compact, solid unity; and this inward bent, amidst the
   surrounding dangers of persecution and heresy, carried the church
   irresistibly towards the episcopate. In so critical and stormy a time,
   the principle, union is strength, division is weakness, prevailed over
   all. In fact, the existence of the church at that period may be said to
   have depended in a great measure on the preservation and promotion of
   unity, and that in an outward, tangible form, suited to the existing
   grade of culture. Such a unity was offered in the bishop, who held a
   monarchical, or more properly a patriarchal relation to the
   congregation. In the bishop was found the visible representative of
   Christ, the great Head of the whole church. In the bishop, therefore,
   all sentiments of piety found a centre. In the bishop the whole
   religious posture of the people towards God and towards Christ had its
   outward support and guide. And in proportion as every church pressed
   towards a single centre, this central personage must acquire a peculiar
   importance and subordinate the other presbyters to itself; though, at
   the same time, as the language of Clement and Irenaeus, the state of
   things in Egypt, and even in North Africa, and the testimony of Jerome
   and other fathers, clearly prove, the remembrance of the original
   equality could not be entirely blotted out, but continued to show
   itself in various ways.

   Besides this there was also a powerful practical reason for elevating
   the powers of the bishop. Every Christian congregation was a charitable
   society, regarding the care of the widow and orphan, the poor and the
   stranger as a sacred trust; and hence the great importance of the
   bishop as the administrative officer by whom the charitable funds were
   received and the alms disbursed. In Greek communities the title bishop
   (episkopos, epimelites), was in wide use for financial officers. Their
   administrative functions brought them in close relation to the deacons,
   as their executive aids in the care of the poor and sick. The
   archdeacon became the right arm, the "eye" and "heart" of the bishop.
   In primitive times every case of poverty or suffering was separately
   brought to the notice of the bishop and personally relieved by a
   deacon. Afterwards institutions were founded for widows and orphans,
   poor and infirm, and generally placed under the superintendence of the
   bishop; but personal responsibility was diminished by this organized
   charity, and the deacons lost their original significance and became
   subordinate officers of public worship. [187] 86

   Whatever may be thought, therefore, of the origin and the divine right
   of the episcopate, no impartial historian can deny its adaptation to
   the wants of the church at the time, and its historical necessity.

   But then, this primitive catholic episcopal system must by no means be
   confounded with the later hierarchy. The dioceses, excepting those of
   Jerusalem, Ephesus, Alexandria, Antioch, and Rome, must have long
   remained very small, if we look at the number of professing Christians.
   In the Apocalypse seven such centres of unity are mentioned within a
   comparatively small compass in Asia Minor, and at a time when the
   number of Christians was insignificant. In the year 258, Cyprian
   assembled a council of eighty-seven bishops of North Africa. The
   functions of the bishops were not yet strictly separated from those of
   the presbyters, and it was only by degrees that ordination, and, in the
   Western church, confirmation also, came to be intrusted exclusively to
   the bishops.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [157] Such is the Swedish and Danish Lutheran, the American Methodist,
   and the Moravian episcopate, which recognizes the validity of
   non-episcopal orders. The Anglican church harbors a high-church and a
   low-church theory of episcopacy, the one derived from the mediaeval
   hierarchy, the other from the Reformation, but repudiates the primacy
   as an antichristian usurpation, although it must be confessed to be
   almost as old as episcopacy, its roots going back to Clement of Rome,
   or at all events to the age of Irenaeus.

   [160] This is the Greek, the Roman Catholic, and the high Anglican
   theory. It is advocated by a very few Continental Protestants as
   Chevalier Bunsen, Rothe and Thiersch (an Irvingite), who trace
   episcopacy to John in Ephesus.

   [161] So the Lutheran, Presbyterian, and some eminent Episcopal
   writers. We mention Mosheim, Neander, Lightfoot, Stanley, Hatch. Also
   Baur and Renan, who judge as mere critics.

   [162] Bishop Lightfoot (l.c. p. 194) thus states the question with his
   own answer: "The episcopate was formed, not out of the apostolic order
   by localization, but out of the presbyterial by elevation; and the
   title, which originally was common to all, came at length to be
   appropriated to the chief among them."

   Lightfoot (Philippians p. 202) remarks against Rothe's inference: "The
   account of Hegesippus confines the object of this gathering to the
   appointment of a successor of St. James. If its deliberations had
   exerted that vast and permanent influence on the future of the church
   which Rothe's theory supposes, it is scarcely possible that this early
   historian should have been ignorant of the fact, or knowing it should
   have passed it over in silence."

   that there would be strife over the name of the bishop's office [i.e.,
   the office of the ministry, in general; Comp. Acts 1:20; Sept. Num.
   4:16; Ps. 109:8; 2 Chr. 23:18]. For this cause, therefore, having
   complete foreknowledge, they appointed the aforesaid persons [i.e.,
   presbyter-bishops and deacons; Comp. c. 42 and 57], and afterwards they
   made the disposition [or provided a continuance, if we read with
   Lightfoot epimonen.], that if these should fall asleep, other approved
   men should succeed to their ministration."

   [173] The reading is obscure and disputed. The Alexandrian MS. reads:
   epinomen, the Constantinopolitan: epidomen (both have EPI-OMHN). The
   former word is rare (from or from nemo or fromnomos) is not found in
   the dictionaries; and hence various emendations have been proposed, as
   aponomen (Junius), epidochen (Bryennios), epibolen (von Gebhardt and
   Harnack), epimonen (Bunsen, Lightfoot), epitropen (Hilgenfeld),
   epilogen, epinomian, epistolen, epitagen, eti nomon. Rothe (Anfänge, p.
   374) ingeniously translates epinomen " testamentary disposition"
   (testamentarische Verfügung =epinomis ,an after-enactment, a codicil),
   and identifies it with the deuterai diataxeis of the fragment of
   Irenaeus. But this is rejected by the latest editors as untenable.
   Lightfoot (with Bunsen) reads epimonen, permanence (not "life-tenure,"
   as Bunsen rendered it). The drift of the passage, however, does not so
   much depend upon the meaning of this word as upon the question whether
   the apostles, or the congregational officers are the grammatical
   subjects of the following verb, koimethosin.

   [174] See also Gebhardt and Harnack (presbyteri et diaconi illi, quos
   apostoli ipsi constituerunt), the Roman Catholic editor Funk
   ("koimethosin, sc. episcopi et diaconi de quorum successione Clemens
   agit"), and Bishop Lightfoot ("the first generation of presbyters
   appointed by the apostles themselves"). (Comp. also on this whole
   passage Lightfoot, Philippians, p. 203, where he refutes Rothe's
   interpretation; Baur Ursprung des Episcopats, p. 53; Ewald, Gesch. des
   Volkes Israel, VII. 300; Ritschl, Altkath. K. 358 and 413, and
   Ilgenfeld, Apost. Väter, 70.

   [175] Hence Rothe traces the institution to John. And Bishop Lightfoot
   (Philippians, p. 204) is inclined to this view: "Asia Minor was the
   nurse, if not the mother of episcopacy in the Gentile churches. So
   important an institution, developed in a Christian community, of which
   St. John was the living centre and guide, could hardly, have grown up
   without his sanction: and early tradition very distinctly connects his
   name with the appointment of bishops in these parts." He repeats the
   same view more confidently in his Ignat. and Polyc., I. 377.

   are in the apostolic writers. In Ignatius and Polycarp they first
   appear as distinct titles."

   [178] The hegoumenoi, c. 1, also, and the proegoumenoi, c. 21, are not

   § 45. Development of the Episcopate. Ignatius.

   It is matter of fact that the episcopal form of government was
   universally established in the Eastern and Western church as early as
   the middle of the second century. Even the heretical sects, at least
   the Ebionites, as we must infer from the commendation of the episcopacy
   in the pseudo-Clementine literature, were organized on this plan, as
   well as the later schismatic parties of Novatians, Donatists, etc. But
   it is equally undeniable, that the episcopate reached its complete form
   only step by step. In the period before us we must note three stages in
   this development connected with the name of Ignatius in Syria (d. 107
   or 115), Irenaeus in Gaul (d. 202), and Cyprian in North Africa (d.
   258).

   The episcopate first appears, as distinct from the presbyterate, but as
   a congregational office only (in distinction from the diocesan idea),
   and as yet a young institution, greatly needing commendation, in the
   famous seven (or three) Epistles of Ignatius of Antioch a disciple of
   the apostles, and the second bishop of that see (Evodius being the
   first, and Hero the third). He is also the first who uses the term
   "catholic church," as if episcopacy and catholicity sprung up
   simultaneously. The whole story of Ignatius is more legendary than
   real, and his writings are subject to grave suspicion of fraudulent
   interpolation. We have three different versions of the Ignatian
   Epistles, but only one of them can be genuine; either the smaller Greek
   version, or the lately discovered Syriac. [188] 87 In the latter, which
   contains only three epistles, most of the passages on the episcopate
   are wanting, indeed; yet the leading features of the institution appear
   even here, and we can recognise ex ungue leonem. [189] 88 In any case
   they reflect the public sentiment before the middle of the second
   century.

   The substance of these epistles (with the exception of that to the
   Romans, in which, singularly enough, not a word is said about bishops
   [190] 89), consists of earnest exhortations to obey the bishop and
   maintain the unity of the church against the Judaistic and docetic
   heresies. With the near prospect and the most ardent desire for
   martyrdom, the author has no more fervent wish than the perfect inward
   and outward unity of the faithful; and to this the episcopate seems to
   him indispensable. In his view Christ is the invisible supreme head,
   the one great universal bishop of all the churches scattered over the
   earth. The human bishop is the centre of unity for the single
   congregation, and stands in it as the vicar of Christ and even of God.
   [191] 90 The people, therefore, should unconditionally obey him, and do
   nothing without his will. Blessed are they who are one with the bishop,
   as the church is with Christ, and Christ with the Father, so that all
   harmonizes in unity. Apostasy from the bishop is apostasy from Christ,
   who acts in and through the bishops as his organs.

   We shall give passages from the shorter Greek text (as edited by Zahn):

   If any one is able to continue in purity (en hagneia i.e., in the state
   of celibacy), to the honor of the flesh of our Lord, let him continue
   so without boasting; if he boasts, he is lost (apoleto) if he become
   known more than the bishop, [192] 91 he is corrupt (ephthartai). It is
   becoming, therefore, to men and women who marry, that they marry by the
   counsel of the bishop, that the marriage may be in the Lord, and not in
   lust. Let ever thing be done for the honor of God. Look to the bishop,
   that God also [may look] upon you. I will be in harmony with those who
   are subject to the bishop, and the presbyters, and the deacons; with
   them may I have a portion near God!" This passage is one of the
   strongest, and occurs in the Syriac Epistle to Polycarp as well as in
   the shorter Greek recension. [193] 92 It characteristically connected
   episcopacy with celibacy: the ascetic system of Catholicism starts in
   celibacy, as the hierarchical organization of Catholicism takes its
   rise in episcopacy. "It becomes you to be in harmony with the mind (or
   sentence, gnome) of the bishop, as also ye do. For your most estimable
   presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted to the bishop as the strings are
   to the harp." [194] 93 "It is evident that we should look upon the
   bishop as we do upon the Lord himself." [195] 94 "I exhort you that ye
   study to do all things with a divine concord: the bishop presiding in
   the place of God (eis topon theou), and presbyters in the place of the
   college of the apostles, (eis topon sunedriou ton apostolon), and the
   deacons, most dear to me, being intrusted with the ministry (diakonian)
   of Jesus Christ, who was with the Father before all ages, and in the
   end appeared to us." [196] 95 "Be subject to the bishop, and to one
   another, as Christ [was subject] to the Father according to the flesh,
   and the apostles to Christ and to the Father and to the Spirit, in
   order that the union be carnal (sarkike), as well as spiritual." [197]
   96 "It is necessary, as is your habit, to do nothing without the
   bishop, and that ye should be subject also to the presbytery (to
   presbuterio), as to the apostles of Jesus Christ." [198] 97 "As many as
   are of God and of Jesus Christ, are also with their bishop." [199] 98
   "Let all of you follow the bishop, as Jesus Christ [follows] the
   Father; and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the
   deacons as the ordinance of God. Without the bishop let no one do
   anything connected with the church. Let that eucharist be accounted
   valid which is [offered] under the bishop or by one he has appointed.
   Wherever the bishop is found, there let the people be; as wherever
   Christ is, there is the catholic church. Without the bishop it is not
   lawful either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast." [200] 99

   This is the first time that the term "catholic" is applied to the
   church, and that episcopacy is made a condition of catholicity.

   "He that honors the bishop, shall be honored by God; he that does
   anything without the knowledge of the bishop serves the devil." [201]
   00

   This is making salvation pretty much depend upon obedience to the
   bishop; just as Leo I., three centuries later, in the controversy with
   Hilary of Arles, made salvation depend upon obedience to the pope by
   declaring every rebel against the pope to be a servant of the devil!
   Such daring superabundance of episcopalianism clearly betrays some
   special design and raises the suspicion of forgery or large
   interpolations. But it may also be explained as a special pleading for
   a novelty which to the mind of the writer was essential to the very
   existence of the church.

   The peculiarity in this Ignatian view is that the bishop appears in it
   as the head and centre of a single congregation, and not as equally the
   representative of the whole church; also, that (as in the
   pseudo-Clementine Homilies) he is the vicar of Christ, and not, as in
   the later view, merely the successor of the apostles,--the presbyters
   and deacons around him being represented as those successors; and
   finally, that there are no distinctions of order among the bishops, no
   trace of a primacy; all are fully coordinate vicars of Christ, who
   provides for himself in them, as it were, a sensible, perceptible
   omnipresence in the church. The Ignatian episcopacy, in short, is
   congregational, not diocesan; a new and growing institution, not a
   settled policy of apostolic origin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [188] The question of the genuineness will be discussed in §165.
   Cureton (1845) Bunsen, Lipsius, and others accept the Syriac version as
   the original form of the Ignatian epistles, and regard even the short
   Greek text as corrupt, but yet as dating from the middle of the second
   century. Rothe, Hefele, Schaff (first ed.), Düsterdieck, Uhlhorn, Zahn,
   Harnack, defend the genuineness of the shorter Greek recension. The
   larger Greek recension is universally given up as spurious. The origin
   of the hierarchical system is obscured by pious frauds. See below, §164
   and 165.

   [189] In the Syriac Ep. to Polycarp, the word bishop occurs four times;
   in the Syriac Ep. to the Ephesians, God is blessed for having given
   them such a bishop as Onesimus. In the shorter Greek Ep. to Polycarp
   episcopacy is mentioned in the salutation, and in three of the eight
   chapters (ch. 5 twice, ch. 6 twice, ch. 8 once). In the 21 chapters of
   the Greek Ep. to the Ephesians, the word bishop occurs thirteen times,
   presbyter three times, and deacon once (in the first six chapters, and
   ch. 21). In the Greek Trallians, the bishop appears nine times; in the
   Magnesians, eleven times; in the Philadelphians, eight times; in the
   Smynaeans, nine times. Thus in the three Syriac Epistles the bishop is
   mentioned but six times; in the seven shorter Greek Epistles about
   fifty times; but one of the strongest passages is found in the Syriac
   Epistle to Polycarp (ch. 5. and 6.).

   [190] Except that Ignatius speaks of himself as "the bishop of Syria,"
   who "has found favor with God, being sent from the East to the West"
   (ch. 2). The verb episkopeo is also used, but of Christ (ch. 9).

   [191] Episkopos eis topon theou prokathemenos, each bisbop being thus a
   sort of pope.

   [192] Zahn reads, Ad Polyc. cap. 5: ean gnosthe pleon tou episkopou,i.e
   . if he be better known or more esteemed than the bishop. The other
   reading is, plen, beyond, or apart from.

   § 46. Episcopacy at the time of Irenaeus and Tertullian.

   In all these points the idea of the episcopate in Irenaeus, the great
   opponent of Gnosticism (about 180), is either lower or higher. This
   father represents the institution as a diocesan office, and as the
   continuation of the apostolate, the vehicle of the catholic tradition,
   and the support of doctrinal unity in opposition to heretical vagaries.
   He exalts the bishops of the original apostolic churches, above all the
   church of Rome, and speaks with great emphasis of an unbroken episcopal
   succession as a test of apostolic teaching and a bulwark against
   heresy. [202] 01

   At the same time the wavering terminology of Irenaeus in the
   interchangeable use of the words "bishop" and "presbyter" reminds us of
   Clement of Rome, and shows that the distinction of the two orders was
   not yet fully fixed. [203] 02

   The same view of the episcopal succession as the preserver of apostolic
   tradition and guardian of orthodox doctrine, we find also, though less
   frequently, in the earlier writings of Tertullian, with this difference
   that he uniformly and clearly distinguishes bishops and presbyters, and
   thus proves a more advanced state of the episcopal polity at his time
   (about 200). [204] 03 But afterwards, in the chiliastic and democratic
   cause of Montanism, he broke with the episcopal hierarchy, and
   presented against it the antithesis that the church does not consist of
   bishops, and that the laity are also priests. [205] 04
     __________________________________________________________________

   [202] Comp. Adv. Haer. III. 3, §1, 2; 4, 1; IV. 33, §8. I remember what
   great stress the late Dr. Posey, when I saw him at Oxford in 1844, laid
   on the testimony of Irenaeus for the doctrine of an unbroken episcopal
   succession, as the indispensable mark of a genuine Catholic church;
   while he ignored the simultaneous growth of the primacy, which a year
   afterwards carried his friend, J. H. Newman, over to the church of
   Rome. The New Testament is the only safe guide and ultimate standard in
   all matters of faith and discipline. The teaching of Irenaeus on
   episcopacy is well set forth by Lightfoot (l.c. p. 237): Irenaeus
   followed Ignatius after an interval of about two generations. With the
   altered circumstances of the Church, the aspect of the episcopal office
   has also undergone a change. The religious atmosphere is now charged
   with heretical speculations of all kinds. Amidst the competition of
   rival teachers. all eagerly bidding for support, the perplexed believer
   asks for some decisive test by which he may try the claims of
   disputants. To this question Irenaeeus supplies an answer. 'If you
   wish,' he argues, 'to ascertain the doctrine of the Apostles, apply to
   the Church of the Apostles.' In the succession of bishops tracing their
   descent from the primitive age and appointed by the Apostles
   themselves, you have a guarantee for the transmission of the pure
   faith, which no isolated, upstart, self-constituted teacher can
   furnish. There is the Church of Rome for instance, whose episcopal
   pedigree is perfect in all its links, and whose earliest bishops, Linus
   and Clement, associated with the Apostles themselves: there is the
   Church of Smyrna again, whose bishop Polycarp, the disciple of St.
   John, died only the other day. Thus the episcopate is regarded now not
   so much as the centre of ecclesiastical unity, but rather as the
   depositary of apostolic tradition."

   § 47. Cyprianic Episcopacy.

   The old catholic episcopalianism reached its maturity in the middle of
   the third century in the teaching and example of Cyprian, bishop and
   martyr of the church in North Africa. He represents the claims of
   episcopacy in close connection with the idea of a special priesthood
   and sacrifice. [206] 05 He is the typical high-churchman of the
   ante-Nicene age. He vigorously put into practice what he honestly
   believed. He had a good opportunity to assert his authority in the
   controversy about the lapsed during the Decian persecution, in the
   schism of Felicissimus, and in the controversy on heretical baptism.

   Cyprian considers the bishops as the bearers of the Holy Spirit, who
   passed from Christ to the apostles, from them by ordination to the
   bishops, propagates himself in an unbroken line of succession, and
   gives efficacy to all religious exercises. Hence they are also the
   pillars of the unity of the church; nay, in a certain sense they are
   the church itself. "The bishop," says he, "is in the church, and the
   church in the bishop, and if any one is not with the bishop he is not
   in the church." [207] 06 And this is the same with him as to say, he is
   no Christian. Cyprian is thoroughly imbued with the idea of the
   solidary unity of the episcopate,--the many bishops exercising only one
   office in solidum, each within his diocese, and each at the same time
   representing in himself the whole office. [208] 07

   But with all this, the bishop still appears in Cyprian in the closest
   connexion with the presbyters. He undertook no important matter without
   their advice. The fourth general council, at Carthage, a.d. 398, even
   declared the sentence of a bishop, without the concurrence of the lower
   clergy, void, and decreed that in the ordination of a presbyter, all
   the presbyters, with the bishop, should lay their hands on the
   candidate. [209] 08

   The ordination of a bishop was performed by the neighboring bishops,
   requiring at least three in number. In Egypt, however, so long as there
   was but one bishop there, presbyters must have performed the
   consecration, which Eutychius [210] 09 and Hilary the Deacon [211] 10
   expressly assert was the case.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [206] "As Cyprian crowned the edifice of episcopal power, so also was
   he the first to put forward without relief or disguise the sacerdotal
   assumptions; and so uncompromising was the tone in which he asserted
   them, that nothing was left to his successors but to enforce his
   principles and reiterate his language." Lightfoot l. c. p. 257. "If
   with Ignatius the bishop is the centre of Christian unity, if with
   Irenaeus he is the depository of apostolic tradition, with Cyprian he
   is the absolute viceregerent of Christ in thing spiritual."Ibid. p.
   238.

   § 48. The Pseudo-Clementine Episcopacy.

   Besides this orthodox or catholic formation of the episcopate, the
   kindred monarchical hierarchy of the Ebionitic sect deserves attention,
   as it meets us in the pseudo-Clementine Homilies. Chronologically this
   falls in the middle of the second century, between Ignatius and
   Irenaeus, and forms a sort of transition from the former to the latter;
   though it cannot exactly be said to have influenced the Catholic
   church. It is rather a heretical counterpart of the orthodox
   episcopate. The organization which consolidated the Catholic church
   answered the same purpose for a sect. The author of the
   pseudo-Clementine, like Ignatius, represents the bishop as the vicar of
   Christ, [212] 11 and at the same time, according to the view of
   Irenaeus, as the vicar and successor of the apostles; [213] 12 but
   outstrips both in his high hierarchical expressions, such as kathedra
   thronos tou episkopou, and in his idea of the primacy, or of a
   universal church monarchy, which he finds, however, not as Irenaeus
   suggests and Cyprian more distinctly states, in Peter and the Roman
   see, but, agreeably to his Judaistic turn, in James of, Jerusalem, the
   "bishop of bishops." [214] 13

   The Manichaeans had likewise a hierarchical organization (as the
   Mormons in modern times).

   Montanism, on the other hand, was a democratic reaction against the
   episcopal hierarchy in favor of the general priesthood, and the liberty
   of teaching and prophesying, but it was excommunicated and died out,
   till it reappeared under a different form in Quakerism.

   § 49. Beginnings of the Metropolitan and Patriarchal Systems

   Though the bishops were equal in their dignity and powers as successors
   of the apostles, they gradually fell into different ranks, according to
   the ecclesiastical and political importance of their several districts.

   1. On the lowest level stood the bishops of the country churches, the
   chorepiscopi who, though not mentioned before the beginning of the
   fourth century, probably originated at an earlier period. [215] 14 They
   stood between the presbyters and the city bishops, and met the wants of
   episcopal supervision in the villages of large dioceses in Asia Minor
   and Syria, also in Gaul.

   2. Among the city bishops the metropolitans rose above the rest, that
   is, the bishops of the capital cities of the provinces. [216] 15 They
   presided in the provincial synods, and, as primi inter pares, ordained
   the bishops of the province. The metropolitan system appears, from the
   Council of Nicaea in 325, to have been already in operation at the time
   of Constantine and Eusebius, and was afterwards more fully carried out
   in the East. In North Africa the oldest bishop, hence called senex,
   stood as primas, at the head of his province; but the bishop of
   Carthage enjoyed the highest consideration, and could summon general
   councils.

   3. Still older and more important is the distinction of apostolic
   mother-churches, [217] 16 such as those at Jerusalem, Antioch)
   Alexandria, Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome. In the time of Irenaeus and
   Tertullian they were held in the highest regard, as the chief bearers
   of the pure church tradition. Among these Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome
   were most prominent, because they were the capitals respectively of the
   three divisions (eparchiae) of the Roman empire, and centres of trade
   and intercourse, combining with their apostolic origin the greatest
   political weight. To the bishop of Antioch fell all Syria as his
   metropolitan district; to the bishop of Alexandria, all Egypt; to the
   bishop of Rome, central and lower Italy, without definite boundaries.

   4. Here we have the germs of the eparchal or patriarchal system, to
   which the Greek church to this day adheres. The name patriarch was at
   first, particularly in the East, an honorary title for all bishops, and
   was not till the fourth century exclusively appropriated to the bishops
   of the three ecclesiastical and political capitals of the Roman empire,
   Antioch, Alexandria and Rome, and also to the bishop of Jerusalem
   honoris causa, and the bishop of Constantinople or New Rome. So in the
   West the term papa afterwards appropriated by the Roman bishop, as
   summus pontifex, vicarius Christi, was current for a long time in a
   more general application.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [215] The country bishops (chorepiskopoi) appear first in the councils
   of Ancyra and Neo-Caesarea, 314, and again in the Council of Nicaea.
   They continued to exist in the East till the 9th century, when they
   were superseded by the exarchs (exarchoi) In the West, the chorepiscopi
   performed regular episcopal functions, without proper subordination to
   the diocesans, and hence excited jealousy and hostility till the office
   was abolished under Charlemagne, and continued only as a title of
   various cathedral dignitaries. See Haddan in Smith & Cheetham Dict.

   Among the great bishops of Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome, the Roman
   bishop combined all the conditions for a primacy, which, from a purely
   honorary distinction, gradually became the basis of a supremacy of
   jurisdiction. The same propension to monarchical unity, which created
   out of the episcopate a centre, first for each congregation, then for
   each diocese, pressed on towards a visible centre for the whole church.
   Primacy and episcopacy grew together. In the present period we already
   find the faint beginnings of the papacy, in both its good and its evil
   features; and with them, too, the first examples of earnest protest
   against the abuse of its power. In the Nicene age the bishop of
   Jerusalem was made an honorary patriarch in view of the antiquity of
   that church, though his diocese was limited; and from the middle of the
   fourth century the new patriarch of Constantinople or New Rome, arose
   to the primacy among the eastern patriarchs, and became a formidable
   rival of the bishop of old Rome.

   The Roman church claims not only human but divine right for the papacy,
   and traces its institution directly to Christ, when he assigned to
   Peter an eminent position in the work of founding his church, against
   which even the gates of hades shall never prevail. This claim implies
   several assumptions, viz. (1) that Peter by our Lord's appointment had
   not simply a primacy of personal excellency, or of honor and dignity
   (which must be conceded to him), but also a supremacy of jurisdiction
   over the other apostles (which is contradicted by the fact that Peter
   himself never claimed it, and that Paul maintained a position of
   perfect independence, and even openly rebuked him at Antioch, Gal.
   2:11); (2) that the privileges of this primacy and supremacy are not
   personal only (as the peculiar gifts of Paul or John undoubtedly were),
   but official, hereditary and transferable; (3) that they were actually
   transferred by Peter, not upon the bishop of Jerusalem, or Antioch
   (where Peter certainly was), but upon the bishop of Rome; (4) that
   Peter was not only at Rome (which is very probable after 63, though not
   as certain as Paul's presence and martyrdom in Rome), but acted there
   as bishop till his martyrdom, and appointed a successor (of which there
   is not the slightest historical evidence); and (5) that the bishops of
   Rome, as successors of Peter, have always enjoyed and exercised an
   universal jurisdiction over the Christian church (which is not the case
   as a matter of fact, and still less as a matter of conceded right).

   Leaving a full discussion of most of these points to polemical
   theology, we are here concerned with the papacy as a growth of history,
   and have to examine the causes which have gradually raised it to its
   towering eminence among the governing institutions of the world.

   The historical influences which favored the ascendency of the Roman see
   were:

   (1) The high antiquity of the Roman church, which had been honored even
   by Paul with the most important doctrinal epistle of the New Testament.
   It was properly the only apostolic mother-church in the West, and was
   thus looked upon from the first by the churches of Italy, Gaul, and
   Spain, with peculiar reverence.

   (2) The labors, martyrdom, and burial at Rome of Peter and Paul, the
   two leading apostles. The whole Roman congregation passed through the
   fearful ordeal of martyrdom during the Neronian persecution, but must
   soon afterwards have been reorganized, with a halo of glory arising
   from the graves of the victims.

   (3) The political pre-eminence of that metropolis of the world, which
   was destined to rule the European races with the sceptre of the cross,
   as she had formerly ruled them with the sword.

   (4) The executive wisdom and the catholic orthodox instinct of the
   Roman church, which made themselves felt in this period in the three
   controversies on the time of Easter, the penitential discipline, and
   the validity of heretical baptism.

   To these may be added, as secondary causes, her firmness under
   persecutions, and her benevolent care for suffering brethren even in
   distant places, as celebrated by Dionysius of Corinth (180), and by
   Eusebius.

   From the time of St. Paul's Epistle (58), when he bestowed high praise
   on the earlier Roman converts, to the episcopate of Victor at the close
   of the second century, and the unfavorable account by Hippolytus of
   Pope Zephyrinus and Pope Callistus, we have no express and direct
   information about the internal state of the Roman church. But
   incidentally it is more frequently mentioned than any other. Owing to
   its metropolitan position, it naturally grew in importance and
   influence with the spread of the Christian religion in the empire. Rome
   was the battle-field of orthodoxy and heresy, and a resort of all sects
   and parties. It attracted from every direction what was true and false
   in philosophy and religion. Ignatius rejoiced in the prospect of
   suffering for Christ in the centre of the world; Polycarp repaired
   hither to settle with Anicetus the paschal controversy; Justin Martyr
   presented there his defense of Christianity to the emperors, and laid
   down for it his life; Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Cyprian conceded to
   that church a position of singular pre-eminence. Rome was equally
   sought as a commanding position by heretics and theosophic jugglers, as
   Simon Magus, Valentine, Marcion, Cerdo, and a host of others. No
   wonder, then, that the bishops of Rome at an early date were looked
   upon as metropolitan pastors, and spoke and acted accordingly with an
   air of authority which reached far beyond their immediate diocese.

   Clement of Rome.

   The first example of the exercise of a sort of papal authority is found
   towards the close of the first century in the letter of the Roman
   bishop Clement (d. 102) to the bereaved and distracted church of
   Corinth. This epistle, full of beautiful exhortations to harmony, love,
   and humility, was sent, as the very address shows, [218] 17 not in the
   bishop's own name, which is not mentioned at all, but in that of the
   Roman congregation, which speaks always in the first person plural. It
   was a service of love, proffered by one church to another in time of
   need. Similar letters of instruction, warning and comfort were written
   to other congregations by Ignatius, Polycarp, Dionysius of Corinth,
   Irenaeus. Nevertheless it can hardly be denied that the document
   reveals the sense of a certain superiority over all ordinary
   congregations. The Roman church here, without being asked (as far as
   appears), gives advice, with superior administrative wisdom, to an
   important church in the East, dispatches messengers to her, and exhorts
   her to order and unity in a tone of calm dignity and authority, as the
   organ of God and the Holy Spirit. [219] 18 This is all the more
   surprising if St. John, as is probable, was then still living in
   Ephesus, which was nearer to Corinth than Rome. The hierarchical spirit
   arose from the domineering spirit of the Roman church, rather than the
   Roman bishop or the presbyters who were simply the organs of the
   people. [220] 19 But a century later the bishop of Rome was substituted
   for the church of Rome, when Victor in his own name excommunicated the
   churches of Asia Minor for a trifling difference of ritual. From this
   hierarchical assumption there was only one step towards the papal
   absolutism of a Leo and Hildebrand, and this found its ultimate
   doctrinal climax in the Vatican dogma of papal infallibility.

   Ignatius.

   Ignatius, in his Epistle to the Romans (even in the Syriac recension),
   applies to that congregation a number of high-sounding titles, and
   describes her as "presiding in the place of the region of the Romans,"
   and as "taking the lead in charity." [221] 20 This is meant as a
   commendation of her practical benevolence for which she was famous.
   Dionysius of Corinth in his letter to Soter of Rome testifies to it as
   saying: "This practice has prevailed with you from the very beginning,
   to do good to all the brethren in every way, and to send contributions
   to many churches in every city." [222] 21 The Roman church was no doubt
   more wealthy than any other, and the liberal use of her means must have
   greatly increased her influence. Beyond this, Ignatius cannot be quoted
   as a witness for papal claims. He says not a word of the primacy, nor
   does he even mention Clement or any other bishop of Rome. The church
   alone is addressed throughout. He still had a lively sense of the
   difference between a bishop and an apostle. "I do not command you," he
   writes to the Romans, "as if I were Peter or Paul; they were apostles."

   Irenaeus.

   Irenaeus calls Rome the greatest, the oldest(?) church, acknowledged by
   all, founded by the two most illustrious apostles, Peter and Paul, the
   church, with which, on account of her more important precedence, all
   Christendom must agree, or (according to another interpretation) to
   which (as the metropolis of the world) all other churches must resort.
   [223] 22 The "more important precedence" places her above the other
   apostolic churches, to which likewise a precedence is allowed.

   This is surely to be understood, however, as a precedence only of
   honor, not of jurisdiction. For when Pope Victor, about the year 190,
   in hierarchical arrogance and intolerance, broke fellowship with the
   churches of Asia Minor, for no other reason but because they adhered to
   their tradition concerning the celebration of Easter, the same
   Irenaeus, though agreeing with him on the disputed point itself,
   rebuked him very emphatically as a troubler of the peace of the church,
   and declared himself against a forced uniformity in such unessential
   matters. Nor did the Asiatic churches allow themselves to be
   intimidated by the dictation of Victor. They answered the Roman
   tradition with that of their own sedes apostolicae. The difference
   continued until the council at Nicaea at last settled the controversy
   in favor of the Roman practice, but even long afterwards the old
   British churches differed from the Roman practice in the Easter
   observance to the time of Gregory I.

   Hippolytus.

   The celebrated Hippolytus, in the beginning of the third century, was a
   decided antagonist of the Roman bishops, Zephyrinus and Callistus, both
   for doctrinal and disciplinary reasons. Nevertheless we learn from his
   work called Philosophumena, that at that time the Roman bishop already
   claimed an absolute power within his own jurisdiction; and that
   Callistus, to the great grief of part of the presbytery, laid down the
   principle, that a bishop can never be deposed or compelled to resign by
   the presbytery, even though he have committed a mortal sin.

   Tertullian.

   Tertullian points the heretics to the apostolic mother churches, as the
   chief repositories of pure doctrine; and among these gives especial
   prominence to that of Rome, where Peter was crucified, Paul beheaded,
   and John immersed unhurt in boiling oil(?) and then banished to the
   island. Yet the same father became afterwards an opponent of Rome. He
   attacked its loose penitential discipline, and called the Roman bishop
   (probably Zephyrinus), in irony and mockery, "pontifex maximus" and
   "episcopus episcoporum."

   Cyprian.

   Cyprian is clearest, both in his advocacy of the fundamental idea of
   the papacy, and in his protest against the mode of its application in a
   given case. Starting from the superiority of Peter, upon whom the Lord
   built his church, and to whom he intrusted the feeding of his sheep, in
   order to represent thereby the unity in the college of the apostles,
   Cyprian transferred the same superiority to the Bishop of Rome, as the
   successor of Peter, and accordingly called the Roman church the chair
   of Peter, and the fountain of priestly unity, [224] 23 the root, also,
   and mother of the catholic church. [225] 24 But on the other side, he
   asserts with equal energy the equality and relative independence of the
   bishops, as successors of the apostles, who had all an equally direct
   appointment from Christ. In his correspondence he uniformly addresses
   the Roman bishop as "brother" and "colleague," conscious of his own
   equal dignity and authority. And in the controversy about heretical
   baptism, he opposes Pope Stephen with almost Protestant independence,
   accusing him of error and abuse of his power, and calling a tradition
   without truth an old error. Of this protest he never retracted a word.

   Firmilian.

   Still more sharp and unsparing was the Cappadocian bishop, Firmilian, a
   disciple of Origen, on the bishop of Rome, while likewise implying a
   certain acknowledgment of his primacy. Firmilian charges him with
   folly, and with acting unworthily of his position; because, as the
   successor of Peter, he ought rather to further the unity of the church
   than to destroy it, and ought to abide on the rock foundation instead
   of laying a new one by recognizing heretical baptism. Perhaps the
   bitterness of Firmilian was due partly to his friendship and veneration
   for Origen, who had been condemned by a council at Rome.

   Nevertheless, on this question of baptism, also, as on those of Easter,
   and of penance, the Roman church came out victorious in the end.

   Comparative Insignificance of the first Popes.

   From these testimonies it is clear, that the growing influence of the
   Roman see was rooted in public opinion and in the need of unity in the
   ancient church. It is not to be explained at all by the talents and the
   ambition of the incumbents. On the contrary, the personality of the
   thirty popes of the first three centuries falls quite remarkably into
   the background; though they are all canonized saints and, according to
   a later but extremely doubtful tradition, were also, with two
   exceptions, martyrs. [226] 25 Among them, and it may be said down to
   Leo the Great, about the middle of the fifth century, there was hardly
   one, perhaps Clement, who could compare, as a church leader, with an
   Ignatius, a Cyprian, and an Ambrose; or, as a theologian, with an
   Irenaeus, a Tertullian, an Athanasius, and an Augustin. [227] 26
   Jerome, among his hundred and thirty-six church celebrities, of the
   first four centuries, brings in only four Roman bishops, Clement,
   Victor, Cornelius, and Damasus, and even these wrote only a few
   epistles. Hippolytus, in his Philosophumena, written about 225, even
   presents two contemporaneous popes, St. Zephyrinus (202-218) and
   Callistus (St. Calixtus I., 218-223), from his own observation, though
   not without partisan feeling, in a most unfavorable light; charging the
   first with ignorance and avarice, [228] 27 the second with scandalous
   conduct (he is said to have been once a swindler and a fugitive slave
   rescued from suicide), and both of them with the Patripassian heresy.
   Such charges could not have been mere fabrications with so honorable an
   author as Hippolytus, even though he was a schismatic rival bishop to
   Callistus; they must have had at least some basis of fact.

   hierarchically: "head of the love-union of Christendom (Vorsteherin des

   [223] The famous Passage, Adv. Haer. iii. §2, is only extant in Latin,

   probably read: Pros tauten gar ten ekklesian dia ten hikanoteran
   proteian sumbainein (or, in the local sense, sunerchesthai) dei
   (according to others: ananke, natural necessity) pasan ten ekklesian,

   proteia (so Thiersch and Gieseler). Comp. Iren. IV. 38, 3, where
   proteuei is rendered principatitatem habet. Stieren and Ziegler

   Herveus of Bordeaux and Hugo Eterianus (p. 172 sq.). But the moral
   sense (to agree)seems more natural.

   of the value of the Roman Catholic tradition on this point. It is so
   remote from the time in question as to be utterly unworthy of credit.

   [227] Cardinal Newman says (Apologia, p. 407): "The see of Rome
   possessed no great mind in the whole period of persecution. Afterwards
   for a long time it had not a single doctor to show. The great luminary
   of the western world is St. Augustin; he, no infallible teacher, has
   formed the intellect of Europe." Dean Stanley remarks (Christian
   Institutions, p. 241): "There have been occupants of the sees of
   Constantinople, Alexandria, and Canterbury who have produced more
   effect on the mind of Christendom by their utterances than any of the
   popes."

   § 51. Chronology of the Popes.

   I. Sources.

   The principal sources for the obscure chronology of the early bishops
   of Rome are the catalogues of popes. These are divided into two
   classes, the oriental or Greek, and the occidental or Latin. To the
   first belong the lists of Hegesippus and Irenaeus, from the second
   century, that of Eusebius (in his Chronicle, and his Church History),
   and his successors from the fourth century and later. This class is
   followed by Lipsius and Harnack. The second class embraces the
   catalogues of Augustin (Ep. 55, al. 165), Optatus of Mileve (De schism.
   Donat. II. 3), the "Catalogus Liberianus" (coming down to Liberius,
   354), the "Catalogus Felicianus" (to 530), the "Catalogus Cononianus,"
   based perhaps on the "Catalogus Leoninus" (to 440), the "Liber
   Pontificalis" (formerly supposed to be based on the preceding
   catalogues, but according to the Abbé Duchesne and Waitz, older than
   the "Liber Felicianus"). The "Liber Pontif." itself exists in different
   MSS., and has undergone many changes. It is variously dated from the
   fifth or seventh century.

   To these may be added the "Martyrologia" and "Calendaria" of the Roman
   Church, especially the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum," and the
   "Martyrologium Romanum parvum" (both of the seventh or eighth century).

   The inscriptions on the papal tombs discovered in Rome since 1850,
   contain names and titles, but no dates.

   On the "Catalogus Liberianus," see especially the critical essay of
   Mommsen "Ueber de Chronographen des Jahres 354," in the "Transactions
   of the Royal Saxon Society of Sciences," Philos. histor. Section, vol.
   I. (1850), p. 631 sqq. The text of the Catalogue is given, p. 634-'37,
   and by Lipsius, Chronologie der röm. Bischöfe, Append. p. 265-268. The
   oldest MSS. of the "Liber Pontificalis" date from the seventh and
   eighth centuries, and present a text of a.d. 641, but with many
   variations. "Mit wahrer Sicherheit," says Waitz, "gelangen wir in der
   Geschichte des Papsthums nicht über das 7te Jahrhundert hinauf."

   Zeitschrift" for 1880, p. 135 sqq.

   The oldest links in the chain of Roman bishops are veiled in
   impenetrable darkness. Tertullian and most of the Latins (and the
   pseudo-Clementina), make Clement (Phil. 4:3), the first successor of
   Peter; [229] 28 but Irenaeus, Eusebius, and other Greeks, also Jerome
   and the Roman Catalogue, give him the third place, and put Linus (2
   Tim. 4:21), and Anacletus (or Anincletus), between him and Peter. [230]
   29 In some lists Cletus is substituted for Anacletus, in others the two
   are distinguished. Perhaps Linus and Anacletus acted during the life
   time of Paul and Peter as assistants or presided only over one part of
   the church, while Clement may have had charge of another branch; for at
   that early day, the government of the congregation composed of Jewish
   and Gentile Christian elements was not so centralized as it afterwards
   became. Furthermore, the earliest fathers, with a true sense of the
   distinction between the apostolic and episcopal offices, do not reckon
   Peter among the bishops of Rome at all; and the Roman Catalogue in
   placing Peter in the line of bishops, is strangely regardless of Paul,
   whose independent labors in Rome are attested not only by tradition,
   but by the clear witness of his own epistles and the book of Acts.

   Lipsius, after a laborious critical comparison of the different
   catalogues of popes, arrives at the conclusion that Linus, Anacletus,
   and Clement were Roman presbyters (or presbyter-bishops in the N. T.
   sense of the term), at the close of the first century, Evaristus and
   Alexander presbyters at the beginning of the second, Xystus I.
   (Latinized: Sixtus), presbyter for ten years till about 128,
   Telesphorus for eleven years, till about 139, and next successors
   diocesan bishops. [231] 30

   It must in justice be admitted, however, that the list of Roman bishops
   has by far the preeminence in age, completeness, integrity of
   succession, consistency of doctrine and policy, above every similar
   catalogue, not excepting those of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and
   Constantinople; and this must carry great weight with those who ground
   their views chiefly on external testimonies, without being able to rise
   to the free Protestant conception of Christianity and its history of
   development on earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [229] Or at least the first appointed by Peter. Tertullian De Praescr.
   HaeR.C. 32 "Romanorum Clementem a Petro ordinatum." The Apost. Const.
   VII. 6 make Linus (Comp. 2 Tim. 4:21) the first bishop, appointed by
   Paul, Clement the next, appointed by Peter. According to Epiphanius
   (Haer. XXVII. 6) Clement was ordained by Peter, but did not enter upon
   his office till after the death of Linus and Anacletus.

   [230] The Catalogue of Irenaeus (Adv. Haer. III. 3, 3) down to his own
   time (a.d. 177) is this: The apostles Peter and Paul, Linos, Anacletos,
   Clement, Evaristus, Alexander, Xystos, Telesphoros, who died gloriously
   as a martyr, Hyginos, Pios, Aniketos, Soter, Eleutheros, who then held
   "the inheritance of the episcopate in the twelfth place from the
   apostles." Irenaeus adds: "In this order and by this succession, the
   ecclesiastical tradition from the apostles and the preaching of the
   truth have come down to us."

   [231] Langen (l. c .p. 100 sqq.) carries the line of Roman
   presbyter-bishops down to Alexander, and dates the monarchical
   constitution of the Roman church (i.e. the diocesan episcopacy) from

   an average to each papal reign. The traditional twenty-five years of
   Peter were considered the maximum which none of his successors was
   permitted to reach, except Pius IX., the first infallible pope, who
   reigned twenty-seven years (1846-1878). The average term of office of
   the archbishops of Canterbury is fourteen years.

   On the basis of Paul's idea of the unity, holiness, and universality of
   the church, as the mystical body of Christ; hand in hand with the
   episcopal system of government; in the form of fact rather than of
   dogma; and in perpetual conflict with heathen persecution from without,
   and heretical and schismatic tendencies within--arose the idea and the
   institution of: "the Holy Catholic Church," as the Apostles' Creed has
   it; [232] 32 or, in the fuller language of the
   Nicene-Constantinopolitan, "the One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church." In
   both the oecumenical symbols, as even in the more indefinite creeds of
   the second and third centuries, on which those symbols are based, the
   church appears as an article of faith, [233] 33 presupposing and
   necessarily, following faith in the Father, the Son, and the Holy
   Spirit; and as a holy fellowship, [234] 34 within which the various
   benefits of grace, from the forgiveness of sins to the life
   everlasting, are enjoyed.

   Nor is any distinction made here between a visible and an invisible
   church. All catholic antiquity thought of none but the actual,
   historical church, and without hesitation applied to this, while yet in
   the eyes of the world a small persecuted sect, those four predicates of
   unity, holiness, universality, and apostolicity, to which were
   afterwards added exclusiveness infallibility and indestructibility.
   There sometimes occur, indeed, particularly in the Novatian schism,
   hints of the incongruity between the empirical reality and the ideal
   conception of the church; and this incongruity became still more
   palpable, in regard to the predicate of holiness, after the abatement
   of the spiritual elevation of the apostolic age, the cessation of
   persecution, and the decay of discipline. But the unworthiness of
   individual members and the external servant-form of the church were not
   allowed to mislead as to the general objective character, which
   belonged to her in virtue of her union with her glorious heavenly Head.

   The fathers of our period all saw in the church, though with different
   degrees of clearness, a divine, supernatural order of things, in a
   certain sense the continuation of the life of Christ on earth, the
   temple of the Holy Spirit, the sole repository of the powers of divine
   life, the possessor and interpreter of the Holy Scriptures, the mother
   of all the faithful. She is holy because she is separated from the
   service of the profane world, is animated by the Holy Spirit, forms her
   members to holiness, and exercises strict discipline. She is catholic,
   that is (according to the precise sense of holos, which denotes not so
   much numerical totality as wholeness), complete, and alone true, in
   distinction from all parties and sects. Catholicity, strictly taken,
   includes the three marks of universality, unity, and exclusiveness, and
   is an essential property of the church as the body and organ of Christ,
   who is, in fact, the only Redeemer for all men. Equally inseparable
   from her is the predicate of apostolicity, that is, the historical
   continuity or unbroken succession, which reaches back through the
   bishops to the apostles, from the apostles to Christ, and from Christ
   to God. In the view of the fathers, every theoretical departure from
   this empirical, tangible, catholic church is heresy, that is,
   arbitrary, subjective, ever changing human opinion; every practical
   departure, all disobedience to her rulers is schism, or dismemberment
   of the body of Christ; either is rebellion against divine authority,
   and a heinous, if not the most heinous, sin. No heresy can reach the
   conception of the church, or rightly claim any one of her predicates;
   it forms at best a sect or party, and consequently falls within the
   province and the fate of human and perishing things, while the church
   is divine and indestructible.

   This is without doubt the view of the ante-Nicene fathers, even of the
   speculative and spiritualistic Alexandrians. The most important
   personages in the development of the doctrine concerning the church
   are, again, Ignatius, Irenaeus, and Cyprian. Their whole doctrine of
   the episcopate is intimately connected with their doctrine of the
   catholic unity, and determined by it. For the episcopate is of value in
   their eyes only, is the indispensable means of maintaining and
   promoting this unity: while they are compelled to regard the bishops of
   heretics and schismatics as rebels and antichrists.

   1. In the Epistles of Ignatius the unity of the church, in the form and
   through the medium of the episcopate, is the fundamental thought and
   the leading topic of exhortation. The author calls himself a man
   prepared for union. [235] 35 He also is the first to use the term
   "catholic" in the ecclesiastical sense, when he says: [236] 36 "Where
   Christ Jesus is, there is the catholic church;" that is, the closely
   united and full totality of his people. Only in her, according to his
   view, can we eat the bread of God; he, who follows a schismatic,
   inherits not the kingdom of God. [237] 37

   We meet similar views, although not so clearly and strongly stated, in
   the Roman Clement's First Epistle to the Corinthians, in the letter of
   the church of Smyrna on the martyrdom of Polycarp, and in the Shepherd
   of Hermas.

   2 Irenaeus speaks much more at large respecting the church. He calls
   her the haven of rescue, the way of salvation, the entrance to life,
   the paradise in this world, of whose trees, to wit, the holy
   Scriptures, we may eat, excepting the tree of knowledge of good and
   evil, which he takes as a type of heresy. The church is inseparable
   from the Holy Spirit; it is his home, and indeed his only
   dwelling-place on earth. "Where the church is," says he, putting the
   church first, in the genuine catholic spirit, "there is the Spirit of
   God, and where the Spirit of God is there is all grace." [238] 38 Only
   on the bosom of the church, continues he, can we be nursed to life. To
   her must we flee, to be made partakers of the Holy Spirit; separation
   from her is separation from the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
   Heretics, in his view, are enemies of the truth and sons of Satan, and
   will be swallowed up by hell, like the company of Korah, Dathan, and
   Abiram. Characteristic in this respect is the well-known legend, which
   he relates, about the meeting of the apostle John with the Gnostic
   Cerinthus, and of Polycarp with Marcion, the "first-born of Satan."

   3. Tertullian is the first to make that comparison of the church with
   Noah's ark, which has since become classical in Roman catholic
   theology; and he likewise attributes heresies to the devil, without any
   qualification. But as to schism, he was himself guilty of it since he
   joined the Montanists and bitterly opposed the Catholics in questions
   of discipline. He has therefore no place in the Roman Catholic list of
   the patres, but simply of the scriptores ecclesiae.

   4. Even Clement of Alexandria, and Origen, with all their
   spiritualistic and idealizing turn of mind, are no exception here. The
   latter, in the words: "Out of the church no man can be saved," [239] 39
   brings out the principle of the catholic exclusiveness as unequivocally
   as Cyprian. Yet we find in him, together with very severe judgments of
   heretics, mild and tolerant expressions also; and he even supposes, on
   the ground of Rom. 2:6 sqq., that in the future life honest Jews and
   heathens will attain a suitable reward, a low grade of blessedness,
   though not the "life everlasting" in the proper sense. In a later age
   he was himself condemned as a heretic.

   Of other Greek divines of the third century, Methodius in particular,
   an opponent of Origen, takes high views of the church, and in his
   Symposion poetically describes it as "the garden of God in the beauty
   of eternal spring, shining in the richest splendor of immortalizing
   fruits and flowers;" as the virginal, unspotted, ever young and
   beautiful royal bride of the divine Logos.

   5. Finally, Cyprian, in his Epistles, and most of all in his classical
   tract: De Unitate Eccelesiae, written in the year 251, amidst the
   distractions of the Novatian schism, and not without an intermixture of
   hierarchical pride and party spirit, has most distinctly and most
   forcibly developed the old catholic doctrine of the church, her unity,
   universality, and exclusiveness. He is the typical champion of visible,
   tangible church unity, and would have made a better pope than any pope
   before Leo I.; yet after all he was anti-papal and anti-Roman when he
   differed from the pope. Augustin felt this inconsistency, and thought
   that he had wiped it out by the blood of his martyrdom. But he never
   gave any sign of repentance. His views are briefly as follows:

   The Catholic church was founded from the first by Christ on St. Peter
   alone, that, with all the equality of power among the apostles, unity
   might still be kept prominent as essential to her being. She has ever
   since remained one, in unbroken episcopal succession; as there is only
   one sun, though his rays are everywhere diffused. Try once to separate
   the ray from the sun; the unity of the light allows no division. Break
   the branch from the tree; it can produce no fruit. Cut off the brook
   from the fountain; it dries up. Out of this empirical orthodox church,
   episcopally organized and centralized in Rome, Cyprian can imagine no
   Christianity at all; [240] 40 not only among the Gnostics and other
   radical heretics, but even among the Novatians, who varied from the
   Catholics in no essential point of doctrine, and only elected an
   opposition bishop in the interest of their rigorous penitential
   discipline. Whoever separates himself from the catholic church is a
   foreigner, a profane person, an enemy, condemns himself, and must be
   shunned. No one can have God for his father, who has not the church for
   his mother. [241] 41 As well might one out of the ark of Noah have
   escaped the flood, as one out of the church be saved; [242] 42 because
   she alone is the bearer of the Holy Spirit and of all grace.

   In the controversy on heretical baptism, Cyprian carried out the
   principle of exclusiveness even more consistently than the Roman
   church. For he entirely rejected such baptism, while Stephen held it
   valid, and thus had to concede, in strict consistency, the possibility
   of regeneration, and hence of salvation, outside the Catholic church.
   Here is a point where even the Roman system, generally so consistent,
   has a loophole of liberality, and practically gives up her theoretical
   principle of exclusiveness. But in carrying out this principle, even in
   persistent opposition to the pope, in whom he saw the successor of
   Peter and the visible centre of unity, Cyprian plainly denied the
   supremacy of Roman jurisdiction and the existence of an infallible
   tribunal for the settlement of doctrinal controversies and protested
   against identifying the church in general with the church of Rome. And
   if he had the right of such protest in favor of strict exclusiveness,
   should not the Greek church, and above all the Evangelical, much rather
   have the right of protest against the Roman exclusiveness, and in favor
   of a more free and comprehensive conception of the church?

   We may freely acknowledge the profound and beautiful truth at the
   bottom of this old catholic doctrine of the church, and the historical
   importance of it for that period of persecution, as well as for the
   great missionary work among the barbarians of the middle ages; but we
   cannot ignore the fact that the doctrine rested in part on a fallacy,
   which, in course of time, after the union of the church with the state,
   or, in other words, with the world, became more and more glaring, and
   provoked an internal protest of ever-growing force. It blindly
   identified the spiritual unity of the church with unity of
   organization, insisted on outward uniformity at the expense of free
   development, and confounded the faulty empirical church, or a temporary
   phase of the development of Christianity, with the ideal and eternal
   kingdom of Christ, which will not be perfect in its manifestation until
   the glorious second coming of its Head. The Scriptural principle "Out
   of Christ there is no salvation," was contracted and restricted to the
   Cyprianic principle: "Out of the (visible) church there is no
   salvation;" and from this there was only one step to the fundamental
   error of Romanism: "Out of the Roman Church there is no salvation."

   No effort after outward unity could prevent the distinction of all
   Oriental and Occidental church from showing itself at this early
   period, in language, customs, and theology;--a distinction which
   afterwards led to a schism to this day unhealed.

   It may well be questioned whether our Lord intended an outward visible
   unity of the church in the present order of things. He promised that
   there should be "one flock one shepherd," but not "one fold." [243] 43
   There may be one flock, and yet many folds or church organizations. In
   the sacerdotal prayer, our Lord says not one word about church, bishops
   or popes, but dwells upon that spiritual unity which reflects the
   harmony between the eternal Father and the eternal Son. "The true
   communion of Christian men--'the communion of saints' upon which all
   churches are built--is not the common performance of external acts, but
   a communion of soul with soul and of the soul with Christ. It is a
   consequence of the nature which God has given us that an external
   organization should help our communion with one another: it is a
   consequence both of our twofold nature, and of Christ's appointment
   that external acts should help our communion with Him. But subtler,
   deeper, diviner than anything of which external things can be either
   the symbol or the bond is that inner reality and essence of union--that
   interpenetrating community of thought and character--which St. Paul
   speaks of as the 'unity of the Spirit,' and which in the sublimest of
   sublime books, in the most sacred words, is likened to the oneness of
   the Son with the Father and of the Father with the Son." [244] 44

   [232] The Church of England retained the term "catholic" in the Creed,
   and the, ante-papal and anti-papal use of this; term (=general,
   universal); while Luther in his Catechism, and the Moravian church (in
   her liturgy) substituted the word "Christian," and surrendered the use
   of "catholic" to the Roman Catholics. "Roman" is a sectarian term (in
   opposition to Greek Catholic and Evangelical Catholic).

   Councils or Synods were an important means of maintaining and promoting
   ecclesiastical unity, and deciding questions of faith and discipline.
   [245] 45 They had a precedent and sanction in the apostolic Conference
   of Jerusalem for the settlement of the circumcision controversy. [246]
   46 They were suggested moreover by the deliberative political
   assemblies of the provinces of the Roman empire, which met every year
   in the chief towns. [247] 47 But we have no distinct trace of Councils
   before the middle of the second century (between 50 and 170), when they
   first appear, in the disputes concerning Montanism and Easter.

   There are several kinds of Synods according to their size, diocesan,
   provincial (or metropolitan), national, patriarchal, and oecumenical
   (or universal). [248] 48 Our period knows only the first three.
   Diocesan synods consist of the bishop and his presbyters and deacons
   with the people assisting, and were probably held from the beginning,
   but are not mentioned before the third century. Provincial synods
   appear first in Greece, where the spirit of association had continued
   strong since the days of the Achaean league, and then in Asia Minor,
   North Africa, Gaul, and Spain. They were held, so far as the stormy
   times of persecution allowed, once or twice a year, in the metropolis,
   under the presidency of the metropolitan, who thus gradually acquired a
   supervision over the other bishops of the province. Special emergencies
   called out extraordinary sessions, and they, it seems, preceded the
   regular meetings. They were found to be useful, and hence became
   institutions.

   The synodical meetings were public, and the people of the community
   around sometimes made their influence felt. In the time of Cyprian
   presbyters, confessors, and laymen took an active part, a custom which
   seems to have the sanction of apostolic practice. [249] 49 At the Synod
   which met about 256, in the controversy on heretical baptism, there
   were present eighty-seven bishops, very many priests and deacons, and
   "maxima pars plebis;" [250] 50 and in the synods concerning the
   restoration of the Lapsi, Cyprian convened besides the bishops, his
   clergy, the "confessores," and "laicos stantes" (i.e. in good
   standing). [251] 51 Nor was this practice confined to North Africa. We
   meet it in Syria, at the synods convened on account of Paul of Samosata
   (264-269), and in Spain at the council of Elvira. Origen, who was
   merely a presbyter, was the leading spirit of two Arabian synods, and
   convinced their bishop Beryllus of his Christological error. Even the
   Roman clergy, in their letter to Cyprian, [252] 52 speak of a common
   synodical consultation of the bishops with the priests, deacons,
   confessors, and laymen in good standing.

   But with the advance of the hierarchical spirit, this republican
   feature gradually vanished. After the council of Nicaea (325) bishops
   alone had seat and voice, and the priests appear hereafter merely as
   secretaries, or advisers, or representatives of their bishops. The
   bishops, moreover, did not act as representatives of their churches,
   nor in the name of the body of the believers, as formerly, but in their
   own right as successors of the apostles. They did not as yet, however,
   in this period, claim infallibility for their decisions, unless we
   choose to find a slight approach to such a claim in the formula:
   "Placuit nobis, Sancto Spiritu suggerente," as used, for example, by
   the council of Carthage, in 252. [253] 53 At all events, their decrees
   at that time had only moral power, and could lay no claim to universal
   validity. Even Cyprian emphatically asserts absolute independence for
   each bishop in his own diocese. "To each shepherd," he says, "a portion
   of the Lord's flock has been assigned, and his account must be rendered
   to his Master."

   The more important acts, such as electing bishops, excommunication,
   decision of controversies, were communicated to other provinces by
   epistolae synodicae. In the intercourse and the translation of
   individual members of churches, letters of recommendation [254] 54 from
   the bishop were commonly employed or required as terms of admission.
   Expulsion from one church was virtually an expulsion from all
   associated churches.

   The effect of the synodical system tended to consolidation. The
   Christian churches from independent communities held together by a
   spiritual fellowship of faith, became a powerful confederation, a
   compact moral commonwealth within the political organization of the
   Roman empire.

   As the episcopate culminated in the primacy, so the synodical system
   rose into the oecumenical councils, which represented the whole church
   of the Roman empire. But these could not be held till persecution
   ceased, and the emperor became the patron of Christianity. The first
   was the celebrated council of Nicaea, in the year 325. The state gave
   legal validity to the decrees of councils, and enforced them if
   necessary by all its means of coercion. But the Roman government
   protected only the Catholic or orthodox church, except during the
   progress of the Arian and other controversies, before the final result
   was reached by the decision of an oecumenical Synod convened by the
   emperor. [255] 55

   [248] That is, within the limits of the old Roman empire, as the orbis

   seven oecumenical Councils from 325 to 787 were confined to the empire,
   and poorly attended by Western bishops. The Roman Councils held after
   that time (down to the Vatican Council in 1870) claim to be
   oecumenical, but exclude the Greek and all evangelical churches.

   [249] Comp. Acts 15:6, 7, 12, 13, 23, where the "brethren" are

   votum decisium. But in several old councils the presbyters and deacons
   subscribed their names after those of the bishops; see Harduin, Coll.

   angelis ejus (Harduin, Coll. Concil. I. 262).

   [254] Epistolae formatae, grammata tetupomena.

   [255] This policy was inaugurated by Constantine I. a.d. 326 (Cod.
   Theod. 16, 5, 1). He confined the privileges and immunities which, in
   313, he had granted to Christians in his later enactments to
   "Catholicae legis observatoribus." He ratified the Nicene creed and
   exiled Arius (325), although he afterwards wavered and was baptized by
   a semi-Arian bishop (337). His immediate successors wavered likewise.
   But as a rule the Byzantine emperors recognized the decisions of
   councils in dogma and discipline, and discouraged and ultimately
   prohibited the formation of dissenting sects. The state can, of course,
   not prevent dissent as an individual opinion; it can only prohibit and
   punish the open profession. Full religious liberty requires separation
   of church and state.

   § 55. The Councils of Elvira, Arles, and Ancyra.

   Among the ante-Nicene Synods some were occasioned by the Montanist
   controversy in Asia Minor, some by the Paschal controversies, some by
   the affairs of Origen, some by the Novatian schism and the treatment of
   the Lapsi in Carthage and Rome, some by the controversies on heretical
   baptism (255, 256), three were held against Paul of Samosata in Antioch
   (264-269).

   In the beginning of the fourth century three Synods, held at Elvira,
   Arles, and Ancyra, deserve special mention, as they approach the
   character of general councils and prepared the way for the first
   oecumenical council. They decided no doctrinal question, but passed
   important canons on church polity and Christian morals. They were
   convened for the purpose of restoring order and discipline after the
   ravages of the Diocletian persecution. They deal chiefly with the large
   class of the Lapsed, and reflect the transition state from the
   ante-Nicene to the Nicene age. They are alike pervaded by the spirit of
   clericalism and a moderate asceticism.

   1. The Synod of Elvira (Illiberis, or Eliberis, probably on the site of
   the modern Granada) was held in 306, [256] 56 and attended by nineteen
   bishops, and twenty-six presbyters, mostly from the Southern districts
   of Spain. Deacons and laymen were also present. The Diocletian
   persecution ceased in Spain after the abdication of Diocletian and
   Maximian Herculeus in 305; while it continued to rage for several years
   longer in the East under Galerius and Maximin. The Synod passed
   eighty-one Latin canons against various forms of heathen immorality
   then still abounding, and in favor of church discipline and austere
   morals. The Lapsed were forbidden the holy communion even in articulo
   mortis (can. 1). This is more severe than the action of the Nicene
   Synod. The thirty-sixth canon prohibits the admission of sacred
   pictures on the walls of the church buildings, [257] 57 and has often
   been quoted by Protestants as an argument against image worship as
   idolatrous; while Roman Catholic writers explain it either as a
   prohibition of representations of the deity only, or as a prudential
   measure against heathen desecration of holy things. [258] 58 Otherwise
   the Synod is thoroughly catholic in spirit and tone. Another
   characteristic feature is the severity against the Jews who were
   numerous in Spain. Christians are forbidden to marry Jews. [259] 59

   The leading genius of the Elvira Synod and the second in the list was
   Hosius, bishop of Corduba (Cordova), who also attended the Council of
   Nicaea as the chief representative of the West. He was native of
   Cordova, the birth-place of Lucan and Seneca, and more than sixty years
   in the episcopate. Athanasius calls him a man holy in fact as well as
   in name, and speaks of his wisdom in guiding synods. As a far-seeing
   statesman, he seems to have conceived the idea of reconciling the
   empire with the church and influenced the mind of Constantine in that
   direction. He is one of the most prominent links between the age of
   persecution and the age of imperial Christianity. He was a strong
   defender of the Nicene faith, but in his extreme old age he wavered and
   signed an Arian formula. Soon afterwards he died, a hundred years old
   (358).

   2. The first Council of Arles in the South of France [260] 60 was held
   a.d. 314, in consequence of an appeal of the Donatists to Constantine
   the Great, against the decision of a Roman Council of 313, consisting
   of three Gallican and fifteen Italian bishops under the lead of Pope
   Melchiades. This is the first instance of an appeal of a Christian
   party to the secular power, and it turned out unfavorably to the
   Donatists who afterwards became enemies of the government. The Council
   of Arles was the first called by Constantine and the forerunner of the
   Council of Nicaea. Augustin calls it even universal, but it was only
   Western at best. It consisted of thirty-three bishops [261] 61 from
   Gaul, Sicily, Italy (exclusive of the Pope Sylvester, who, however, was
   represented by two presbyters and two deacons), North Africa, and
   Britain (three, from York, London, and probably from Caerleon on Usk),
   besides thirteen presbyters and twenty-three deacons. It excommunicated
   Donatus and passed twenty-two canons concerning Easter (which should be
   held on one and the same day), against the non-residence of clergy,
   against participation in races and gladiatorial fights (to be punished
   by excommunication), against the rebaptism of heretics, and on other
   matters of discipline. Clergymen who could be proven to have delivered
   sacred books or utensils in persecution (the traditores) should be
   deposed, but their official acts were to be held valid. The assistance
   of at least three bishops was required at ordination. [262] 62

   3. The Council of Ancyra, the capital of Galatia in Asia Minor, was
   held soon after the death of the persecutor Maximin (3l3), probably in
   the year 314, and represented Asia Minor and Syria. It numbered from
   twelve to eighteen bishops (the lists vary), several of whom eleven
   years afterwards attended the Council of Nicaea. Marcellus of Ancyra
   who acquired celebrity in the Arian controversies, presided, according
   to others Vitalis of Antioch. Its object was to heal the wounds of the
   Diocletian persecution, and it passed twenty-five canons relating
   chiefly to the treatment of those who had betrayed their faith or
   delivered the sacred books in those years of terror. Priests who had
   offered sacrifice to the gods, but afterwards repented, were prohibited
   from preaching and all sacerdotal functions, but allowed to retain
   their clerical dignity. Those who had sacrificed before baptism may be
   admitted to orders. Adultery is to be punished by seven years' penance,
   murder by life-long penance. [263] 63

   A similar Council was held soon afterwards at, Neo-Caesarea in
   Cappadocia (between 314-325), mostly by the same bishops who attended
   that of Ancyra, and passed fifteen disciplinary canons. [264] 64
     __________________________________________________________________

   [256] Hefele, Gams, and Dale decide in favor of this date against the
   superscription which puts it down to the period of the Council of
   Nicaea (324). The chief reason is that Hosius, bishop of Cordova, could
   not be, present in 324 when he was in the Orient, nor at any time after
   307, when he joined the company of Constantine as one of his private
   councillors.

   [257] "Placuit picturas in ecclesia esse non debere, ne quod colitur et
   adoratur in parietibus depingatur.""There shall be no pictures in the
   church, lest what is worshipped [saints] and adored [God and Christ]
   should be depicted on the walls."

   [258] The last is the interpretation of the canon by DeRossi, in Roma
   sotteranea, Tom. I., p. 97, and Hefele, I. 170. But Dale (p. 292 sqq.)
   thinks that it was aimed against the idolatry of Christians.

   [259] The best accounts of the Synod of Elvira are given by Ferdinand
   de Mendoza, De confirmando Concilio IIIiberitano ad Clementem VIII.,
   1593 (reprinted in Mansi II. 57-397); Fr. Ant. Gonzalez, Collect. Can.

   monograph on the Synod of Elvira, London, 1882.

   [260] Concilium Arelatense, from Arelate or Arelatum Sextanorum, one of
   the chief Roman cities in South-Eastern Gaul, where Constantine at one
   time resided, and afterwards the West Gothic King Eurich. It was
   perhaps the seat of the first bishopric of Gaul, or second only to that
   of Lyons and Vienne. Several councils were held in that city, the
   second in 353 during the Arian controversy.

   [261] Not 633, as McClintock & Strong's "Cyclop" has it sub Arles.

   [263] Hefele, vol. I. 222 sqq., gives the canons in Greek and German
   with explanation. He calls it a Synodus plenaria, i.e., a general
   council for the churches of Asia Minor and Syria. See also Mansi II.
   514 sqq. Two Arian Synods were held at Ancyra in 358 and 375.

   Ph. Schaff: The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, or the Oldest Church
   Manual. N. York, 1885. 3d ed. revised and enlarged, 1889.

   Several church manuals or directories of public worship, and discipline
   have come down to us from the first centuries in different languages.
   They claim directly or indirectly apostolic origin and authority, but
   are post-apostolic and justly excluded from the canon. They give us
   important information on the ecclesiastical laws, morals, and customs
   of the ante-Nicene age.

   1. The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles is the oldest and simplest
   church manual, of Jewish Christian (Palestinian or Syrian) origin, from
   the end of the first century, known to the Greek fathers, but only
   recently discovered and published by Bryennios (1883). It contains in
   16 chapters (1) a summary of moral instruction based on the Decalogue
   and the royal commandment of love to God and man, in the parabolic form
   of two ways, the way of life and the way of death; (2) directions on
   the celebration of baptism and the eucharist with the agape; (3)
   directions on discipline and the offices of apostles (i.e. travelling
   evangelists), prophets, teachers, bishops (i.e. presbysters), and
   deacons; (4) an exhortation to watchfulness in view of the coming of
   the Lord and the resurrection of the saints. A very remarkable book.
   Its substance survived in the seventh book of the Apostolical
   Constitutions.

   2. The Ecclesiastical Canons of the holy apostles or Apostolical Church
   Order, of Egyptian origin, probably of the third century. An expansion
   of the former in the shape of a fictitious dialogue of the apostles,
   first published in Greek by Bickell (1843), and then also in Coptic and
   Syriac. It contains ordinances of the apostles on morals, worship, and
   discipline.

   3. The Apostolical Constitutions, the most complete and important
   Church Manual. It is, in form, a literary fiction, professing to be a
   bequest of all the apostles, handed down through the Roman bishop
   Clement, or dictated to him. It begins with the words: "The apostles
   and elders, to all who among the nations have believed in the Lord
   Jesus Christ. Grace be with you, and peace." It contains, in eight
   books, a collection of moral exhortations, church laws and usages, and
   liturgical formularies which had gradually arisen in the various
   churches from the close of the first century, the time of the Roman
   Clement, downward, particularly in Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and
   Rome, partly on the authority of apostolic practice. These were at
   first orally transmitted; then committed to writing in different
   versions, like the creeds; and finally brought, by some unknown hand,
   into their present form. The first six books, which have a strongly
   Jewish-Christian tone, were composed, with the exception of some later
   interpolations, at the end of the third century, in Syria. The seventh
   book is an expansion of the Didache of the Twelve Apostles. The eighth
   book contains a liturgy, and, in an appendix, the apostolical canons.
   The collection of the three parts into one whole may be the work of the
   compiler of the eighth book. It is no doubt of Eastern authorship, for
   the church of Rome nowhere occupies a position of priority or
   supremacy. [265] 65 The design was, to set forth the ecclesiastical
   life for laity and clergy, and to establish the episcopal theocracy.
   These constitutions were more used and consulted in the East than any
   work of the fathers, and were taken as the rule in matters of
   discipline, like the Holy Scriptures in matters of doctrine. Still the
   collection, as such, did not rise to formal legal authority, and the
   second Trullan council of 692 (known as quinisextum), rejected it for
   its heretical interpolations, while the same council acknowledged the
   Apostolical Canons. [266] 66

   The "Apostolical Canons" consist of brief church rules or
   prescriptions, in some copies eighty-five in number, in others fifty,
   and pretend to be of apostolic origin, being drawn up by Clement of
   Rome from the directions of the apostles, who in several places speak
   in the first person. They are incorporated in the "Constitutions" as an
   appendix to the eighth book, but are found also by themselves, in
   Greek, Syriac, Aethiopic, and Arabic manuscripts. Their contents are
   borrowed partly from the Scriptures, especially the Pastoral Epistles,
   partly from tradition, and partly from the decrees of early councils at
   Antioch, Neo-Caesarea, Nicaea, Laodicea, &c. (but probably not
   Chalcedon, 451). They are, therefore, evidently of gradual growth, and
   were collected either after the middle of the fourth century, [267] 67
   or not till the latter part of the fifth, [268] 68 by some unknown
   hand, probably also in Syria. They are designed to furnish a complete
   system of discipline for the clergy. Of the laity they say scarcely a
   word. The eighty-fifth and last canon settles the canon of the
   Scripture, but reckons among the New Testament books two epistles of
   Clement and the genuine books of the pseudo-Apostolic Constitutions.

   The Greek church, at the Trullan council of 692, adopted the whole
   collection of eighty-five canons as authentic and binding, and John of
   Damascus placed it even on a parallel with the epistles of the apostle
   Paul, thus showing that he had no sense of the infinite superiority of
   the inspired writings. The Latin church rejected it at first, but
   subsequently decided for the smaller collection of fifty canons, which
   Dionysus Exiguus about the year 500 translated from a Greek manuscript.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [265] Harnack (l.c. 266-268) identifies Pseudo-Clement with
   Pseudo-Ignatius and assigns him to the middle of the fourth century.

   [266] Turrianus Bovius; and the eccentric Whiston regarded these
   pseudoapostolic Constitutions as a genuine work of the apostles;
   containing Christ's teaching during the forty days between the
   Resurrection and Ascension. But Baronius, Bellarmin, and Petavius
   attached little weight to them, and the Protestant scholars, Daillé and
   Blondel, attacked and overthrew their genuineness and authority. The
   work is a gradual growth, with many repetitions, interpolations, and
   contradictions and anachronisms. James, who was beheaded (a.d. 44), is
   made to sit in council with Paul (VI. 14), but elsewhere is represented
   as dead (V. 7). The apostles condemn post-apostolic heresies and
   heretics (VI. 8), and appoint days of commemoration of their death
   (VIII. 33). Episcopacy is extravagantly extolled. P. de Lagarde says:
   (Rel juris Eccles. ant., Preface, p. IV.): "Communis vivorum doctorum
   fere omnium nunc invaluit opinio eas [constitutiones] saeculo tertio
   clam succrevisse et quum sex aliquando libris septimo et octavo auctas
   esse postea."

   [267] As Bickell supposes. Beveridge put the collection in the third
   century.

   [268] According to Daillé, Dr. von Drey, and Mejer.

   On the discipline of the Montanists, see Bonwetsch: Die Geschichte des
   Montanismus (1881), pp. 108-118.

   The ancient church was distinguished for strict discipline. Previous to
   Constantine the Great, this discipline rested on purely moral
   sanctions, and had nothing to do with civil constraints and
   punishments. A person might be expelled from one congregation without
   the least social injury. But the more powerful the church became, the
   more serious were the consequences of her censures, and when she was
   united with the state, ecclesiastical offenses were punished as
   offenses against the state, in extreme cases even with death. The
   church always abhorred blood ("ecclesia non sitit sanguiem"), but she
   handed the offender over to the civil government to be dealt with
   according to law. The worst offenders for many centuries were heretics
   or teachers of false doctrine.

   The object of discipline was, on the one hand, the dignity and purity
   of the church, on the other, the spiritual welfare of the offender;
   punishment being designed to be also correction. The extreme penalty
   was excommunication, or exclusion from all the rights and privileges of
   the faithful. This was inflicted for heresy and schism, and all gross
   crimes, such as, theft, murder, adultery, blasphemy, and the denial of
   Christ in persecution. After Tertullian, these and like offences
   incompatible with the regenerate state, were classed as mortal sins,
   [269] 69 in distinction from venial sins or sins of weakness. [270] 70

   Persons thus excluded passed into the class of penitents, [271] 71 and
   could attend only the catechumen worship. Before they could be
   re-admitted to the fellowship of the church, they were required to pass
   through a process like that of the catechumens, only still more severe,
   and to prove the sincerity of their penitence by the absence from all
   pleasures, from ornament in dress, and from nuptial intercourse, by
   confession, frequent prayer, fasting, almsgiving, and other good works.
   Under pain of a troubled conscience and of separation from the only
   saving church, they readily submitted to the severest penances. The
   church teachers did not neglect, indeed, to inculcate the penitent
   spirit and the contrition of the heart is the main thing. Yet many of
   them laid too great stress on certain outward exercises. Tertullian
   conceived the entire church penance as a "satisfaction" paid to God.
   This view could easily obscure to a dangerous degree the all-sufficient
   merit of Christ, and lead to that self-righteousness against which the
   Reformation raised so loud a voice.

   The time and the particular form of the penances, in the second
   century, was left as yet to the discretion of the several ministers and
   churches. Not till the end of the third century was a rigorous and
   fixed system of penitential discipline established, and then this could
   hardly maintain itself a century. Though originating in deep moral
   earnestness, and designed only for good, it was not fitted to promote
   the genuine spirit of repentance. Too much formality and legal
   constraint always deadens the spirit, instead of supporting and
   regulating it. This disciplinary formalism first appears, as already
   familiar, in the council of Ancyra, about the year 314. [272] 72

   Classes of Penitents.

   The penitents were distributed into four classes:--

   (1) The weepers, [273] 73 who prostrated themselves at the church doors
   in mourning garments and implored restoration from the clergy and the
   people.

   (2) The hearers, [274] 74 who, like the catechumens called by the same
   name, were allowed to hear the Scripture lessons and the sermon.

   (3) The kneelers, [275] 75 who attended the public prayers, but only in
   the kneeling posture.

   (4) The standers, [276] 76 who could take part in the whole worship
   standing, but were still excluded from the communion.

   Those classes answer to the four stages of penance. [277] 77 The course
   of penance was usually three or four years long, but, like the
   catechetical preparation, could be shortened according to
   circumstances, or extended to the day of death. In the East there were
   special penitential presbyters, [278] 78 intrusted with the oversight
   of the penitential discipline.

   Restoration.

   After the fulfilment of this probation came the act of reconciliation.
   [279] 79 The penitent made a public confession of sin, received
   absolution by the laying on of hands of the minister, and precatory or
   optative benediction, [280] 80 was again greeted by the congregation
   with the brotherly kiss, and admitted to the celebration of the
   communion. For the ministry alone was he for ever disqualified. Cyprian
   and Firmilian, however, guard against the view, that the priestly
   absolution of hypocritical penitents is unconditional and infallible,
   and can forestall the judgment of God. [281] 81

   Two Parties.

   In reference to the propriety of any restoration in certain cases,
   there was an important difference of sentiment, which gave rise to
   several schisms. All agreed that the church punishment could not
   forestall the judgment of God at the last day, but was merely temporal,
   and looked to the repentance and conversion of the subject. But it was
   a question whether the church should restore even the grossest offender
   on his confession of sorrow, or should, under certain circumstances
   leave him to the judgment of God. The strict, puritanic party, to which
   the Montanists, the Novatians, and the Donatists belonged, and, for a
   time, the whole African and Spanish Church, took ground against the
   restoration of those who had forfeited the grace of baptism by a mortal
   sin, especially by denial of Christ; since, otherwise, the church would
   lose her characteristic holiness, and encourage loose morality. The
   moderate party, which prevailed in the East, in Egypt, and especially
   in Rome, and was so far the catholic party, held the principle that the
   church should refuse absolution and communion, at least on the
   death-bed, to no penitent sinner. Paul himself restored the Corinthian
   offender. [282] 82

   The point here in question was of great practical moment in the times
   of persecution, when hundreds and thousands renounced their faith
   through weakness, but as soon as the danger was passed, pleaded for
   readmission into the church, and were very often supported in their
   plea by the potent intercessions of the martyrs and confessors, and
   their libelli pacis. The principle was: necessity knows no law. A
   mitigation of the penitential discipline seemed in such cases justified
   by every consideration of charity and policy. So great was the number
   of the lapsed in the Decian persecution, that even Cyprian found
   himself compelled to relinquish his former rigoristic views, all the
   more because he held that out of the visible church there was no
   salvation.

   The strict party were zealous for the holiness of God; the moderate,
   for his grace. The former would not go beyond the revealed forgiveness
   of sins by baptism, and were content with urging the lapsed to
   repentance, without offering them hope of absolution in this life. The
   latter refused to limit the mercy of God and expose the sinner to
   despair. The former were carried away with an ideal of the church which
   cannot be realized till the second coming of Christ; and while impelled
   to a fanatical separatism, they proved, in their own sects, the
   impossibility of an absolutely pure communion on earth. The others not
   rarely ran to the opposite extreme of a dangerous looseness, were quite
   too lenient, even towards mortal sins, and sapped the earnestness of
   the Christian morality.

   It is remarkable that the lax penitential discipline had its chief
   support from the end of the second century, in the Roman church.
   Tertullian assails that church for this with bitter mockery.
   Hippolytus, soon after him, does the same; for, though no Montanist, he
   was zealous for strict discipline. According to his statement (in the
   ninth book of his Philosophumena), evidently made from fact, the pope
   Callistus, whom a later age stamped a saint because it knew little of
   him, admitted bigami and trigami to ordination, maintained that a
   bishop could not be deposed, even though he had committed a mortal sin,
   and appealed for his view to Rom. 14:4, to the parable of the tares and
   the wheat, Matt. 13:30, and, above all, to the ark of Noah, which was a
   symbol of the church, and which contained both clean and unclean
   animals, even dogs and wolves. In short, he considered no sin too great
   to be loosed by the power of the keys in the church. And this continued
   to be the view of his successors.

   But here we perceive, also, how the looser practice in regard to
   penance was connected with the interest of the hierarchy. It favored
   the power of the priesthood, which claimed for itself the right of
   absolution; it was at the same time matter of worldly policy; it
   promoted the external spread of the church, though at the expense of
   the moral integrity of her membership, and facilitated both her
   subsequent union with the state and her hopeless confusion with the
   world. No wonder the church of Rome, in this point, as in others,
   triumphed at last over all opposition.

   [269] Peccata mortalia, or, ad mortem; after a rather arbitrary
   interpretation of 1 John 5:16. Tertullian gives seven mortal sins:
   Homocidium idololatria, fraus, negatio blasphemia. utique et moechia
   et. fornicatio et si qua alia violatio templi Dei. De pudic. c. 19,
   These he declares irremissibilia, horum ultra exoratur non erit

   (favorable to Meletius); Athanas.: Apol. contra Arianos, § 59; and
   after him, Socr, Sozom., and Theod. (very unfavorable to Meletius).

   Out of this controversy on the restoration of the lapsed, proceeded
   four schisms during the third century; two in Rome, one in North
   Africa, and one in Egypt. Montanism, too, was in a measure connected
   with the question of penitential discipline, but extended also to
   several other points of Christian life, and will be discussed in a
   separate chapter.

   I. The Roman schism of Hippolytus. This has recently been brought to
   the light by the discovery of his Philosophumena (1851). Hippolytus was
   a worthy disciple of Irenaeus, and the most learned and zealous divine
   in Rome, during the pontificates of Zephyrinus (202-217), and Callistus
   (217-222). He died a martyr in 235 or 236. He was an advocate of strict
   views on discipline in opposition to the latitudinarian practice which
   we have described in the previous section. He gives a most unfavorable
   account of the antecedents of Callistus, and charges him and his
   predecessor with the patripassian heresy. The difference, therefore,
   was doctrinal as well as disciplinarian. It seems to have led to mutual
   excommunication and a temporary schism, which lasted till a.d. 235.
   Hippolytus ranks himself with the successors of the apostles, and seems
   to have been bishop of Portus, the port of Rome (according to later
   Latin tradition), or bishop of Rome (according to Greek writers). If
   bishop of Rome, he was the first schismatic pope, and forerunner of
   Novatianus, who was ordained anti pope in 251. [283] 83 But the Roman
   Church must have forgotten or forgiven his schism, for she numbers him
   among her saints and martyrs, and celebrates his memory on the
   twenty-second of August. Prudentius, the spanish poet, represents him
   as a Roman presbyter, who first took part in the Novatian schism, then
   returned to the Catholic church, and was torn to pieces by wild horses
   at Ostia on account of his faith. The remembrance of the schism was
   lost in the glory of his supposed or real martyrdom. According to the
   chronological catalogue of Popes from a.d. 354, a "presbyter"
   Hippolytus, together with the Roman bishop Pontianus, the successor of
   Callistus, was banished from Rome in the reign of Alexander Severus
   (235), to the mines of Sardinia. [284] 84

   II. The schism of Felicississimus, at Carthage, about the year 250,
   originated in the personal dissatisfaction of five presbyters with the
   hasty and irregular election of Cyprian to the bishopric, by the voice
   of the congregation, very soon after his baptism, a.d. 248. At the head
   of this opposition party stood the presbyter Novatus, an unprincipled
   ecclesiastical demagogue, of restless, insubordinate spirit and
   notorious character, [285] 85 and the deacon Felicissimus, whom Novatus
   ordained, without the permission or knowledge of Cyprian, therefore
   illegally, whether with his own hands or through those of foreign
   bishops. The controversy cannot, however, from this circumstance, be
   construed, as it is by Neander and others, into a presbyterial reaction
   against episcopal autocracy. For the opponents themselves afterwards
   chose a bishop in the person of Fortunatus. The Novatians and the
   Meletians likewise had the episcopal form of organization, though
   doubtless with many irregularities in the ordination.

   After the outbreak of the Decian persecution this personal rivalry
   received fresh nourishment and new importance from the question of
   discipline. Cyprian originally held Tertullian's principles, and
   utterly opposed the restoration of the lapsed, till further examination
   changed his views. Yet, so great was the multitude of the fallen, that
   he allowed an exception in periculo mortis. His opponents still saw
   even in this position an unchristian severity, least of all becoming
   him, who, as they misrepresented him, fled from his post for fear of
   death. They gained the powerful voice of the confessors, who in the
   face of their own martyrdom freely gave their peace-bills to the
   lapsed. A regular trade was carried on in these indulgences. An
   arrogant confessor, Lucian, wrote to Cyprian in the name of the rest,
   that he granted restoration to all apostates, and begged him to make
   this known to the other bishops. We can easily understand how this
   lenity from those who stood in the fire, might take more with the
   people than the strictness of the bishop, who had secured himself. The
   church of Novatus and Felicissimus was a resort of all the careless
   lapsi. Felicissimus set himself also against a visitation of churches
   and a collection for the poor, which Cyprian ordered during his exile.

   When the bishop returned, after Easter, 251, he held a council at
   Carthage, which, though it condemned the party of Felicissimus, took a
   middle course on the point in dispute. It sought to preserve the
   integrity of discipline, yet at the same time to secure the fallen
   against despair. It therefore decided for the restoration of those who
   proved themselves truly penitent, but against restoring the careless,
   who asked the communion merely from fear of death. Cyprian afterwards,
   when the persecution was renewed, under Gallus, abolished even this
   limitation. He was thus, of course, not entirely consistent, but
   gradually accommodated his principles to circumstances and to the
   practice of the Roman church. [286] 86 His antagonists elected their
   bishop, indeed, but were shortly compelled to yield to the united force
   of the African and Roman churches, especially as they had no moral
   earnestness at the bottom of their cause.

   His conflict with this schismatical movement strengthened Cyprian's
   episcopal authority, and led him in his doctrine of the unity of the
   church to the principle of absolute exclusiveness.

   III. The Novatian schism in Rome was prepared by the controversy
   already alluded to between Hippolytus and Callistus. It broke out soon
   after the African schism, and, like it, in consequence of an election
   of bishop. But in this case the opposition advocated the strict
   discipline against the lenient practice of the dominant church. The
   Novatianists [287] 87 considered themselves the only pure communion,
   [288] 88 and unchurched all churches which defiled themselves by
   re-admitting the lapsed, or any other gross offenders. They went much
   farther than Cyprian, even as far as the later Donatists. They admitted
   the possibility of mercy for a mortal sinner, but denied the power and
   the right of the church to decide upon it, and to prevent, by
   absolution, the judgment of God upon such offenders. They also, like
   Cyprian, rejected heretical baptism, and baptized all who came over to
   them from other communions not just so rigid as themselves.

   At the head of this party stood the Roman presbyter Novatian, [289] 89
   an earnest, learned, but gloomy man, who had come to faith through
   severe demoniacal disease and inward struggles. He fell out with
   Cornelius, who, after the Decian persecution in 251, was nominated
   bishop of Rome, and at once, to the grief of many, showed great
   indulgence towards the lapsed. Among his adherents the above-named
   Novatus of Carthage was particularly busy, either from a mere spirit of
   opposition to existing authority, or from having changed his former lax
   principles on his removal to Rome. Novatian, against his will, was
   chosen bishop by the opposition. Cornelius excommunicated him. Both
   parties courted the recognition of the churches abroad. Fabian, bishop
   of Antioch, sympathized with the rigorists. Dionysius of Alexandria, on
   the contrary, accused them of blaspheming the most gracious Lord Jesus
   Christ, by calling him unmerciful. And especially Cyprian, from his
   zeal for ecclesiastical unity and his aversion to Novatus, took sides
   with Cornelius, whom he regarded the legitimate bishop of Rome.

   In spite of this strong opposition the Novatian sect, by virtue of its
   moral earnestness, propagated itself in various provinces of the West
   and the East down to the sixth century. In Phrygia it combined with the
   remnants of the Montanists. The council of Nicaea recognized its
   ordination, and endeavored, without success, to reconcile it with the
   Catholic church. Constantine, at first dealt mildly with the Novatians,
   but afterwards prohibited them to worship in public and ordered their
   books to be burnt.

   IV. The Meletian schism in Egypt arose in the Diocletian persecution,
   about 305, and lasted more than a century, but, owing to the
   contradictory character of our accounts, it is not so well understood.
   It was occasioned by Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis in Thebais, who,
   according to one statement, from zeal for strict discipline, according
   to another, from sheer arrogance, rebelled against his metropolitan,
   Peter of Alexandria (martyred in 311), and during his absence
   encroached upon his diocese with ordinations, excommunications, and the
   like. Peter warned his people against him, and, on returning from his
   flight, deposed him as a disturber of the peace of the church. But the
   controversy continued, and spread over all Egypt. The council of Nicaea
   endeavored, by recognizing the ordination of the twenty-nine Meletian
   bishops, and by other compromise measures, to heal the division; but to
   no purpose. The Meletians afterwards made common cause with the Arians.

   The Donatist schism, which was more formidable than any of those
   mentioned, likewise grew out of the Diocletian persecution, but belongs
   more to the next period.

   The numerous works on church architecture (by Fergusson, Brown, Bunsen,
   Kugler, Kinkel, Kreuser, Schnaase, Lübke, Voillet-le-Duc, De Vogüé
   etc.) usually begin with the basilicas of the Constantinian age, which
   are described in vol. III. 541 sqq.

   The Christian worship, as might be expected from the humble condition
   of the church in this period of persecution, was very simple, strongly
   contrasting with the pomp of the Greek and Roman communion; yet by no
   means puritanic. We perceive here, as well as in organization and
   doctrine, the gradual and sure approach of the Nicene age, especially
   in the ritualistic solemnity of the baptismal service, and the mystical
   character of the eucharistic sacrifice.

   Let us glance first at the places of public worship. Until about the
   close of the second century the Christians held their worship mostly in
   private houses, or in desert places, at the graves of martyrs, and in
   the crypts of the catacombs. This arose from their poverty, their
   oppressed and outlawed condition, their love of silence and solitude,
   and their aversion to all heathen art. The apologists frequently
   assert, that their brethren had neither temples nor altars (in the
   pagan sense of these words), and that their worship was spiritual and
   independent of place and ritual. Heathens, like Celsus, cast this up to
   them as a reproach; but Origen admirably replied: The humanity of
   Christ is the highest temple and the most beautiful image of God, and
   true Christians are living statues of the Holy Spirit, with which no
   Jupiter of Phidias can compare. Justin Martyr said to the Roman
   prefect: The Christians assemble wherever it is convenient, because
   their God is not, like the gods of the heathen, inclosed in space, but
   is invisibly present everywhere. Clement of Alexandria refutes the
   superstition, that religion is bound to any building.

   In private houses the room best suited for worship and for the
   love-feast was the oblong dining-hall, the triclinium, which was never
   wanting in a convenient Greek or Roman dwelling, and which often had a
   semicircular niche, like the choir [290] 90 in the later churches. An
   elevated seat [291] 91 was used for reading the Scriptures and
   preaching, and a simple tables [292] 92 for the holy communion. Similar
   arrangements were made also in the catacombs, which sometimes have the
   form of a subterranean church.

   The first traces of special houses of worship [293] 93 occur in
   Tertullian, who speaks of going to church, [294] 94 and in his
   contemporary, Clement of Alexandria, who mentions the double meaning of
   the word ekklesia. [295] 95 About the year 230, Alexander Severus
   granted the Christians the right to a place in Rome against the protest
   of the tavern-keepers, because the worship of God in any form was
   better than tavern-keeping. After the middle of the third century the
   building of churches began in great earnest, as the Christians enjoyed
   over forty years of repose (260-303), and multiplied so fast that,
   according to Eusebius, more spacious places of devotion became
   everywhere necessary. The Diocletian persecution began (in 303,) with
   the destruction of the magnificent church at Nicomedia, which,
   according to Lactantius, even towered above the neighboring imperial
   palace. [296] 96 Rome is supposed to have had, as early as the
   beginning of the fourth century, more than forty churches. But of the
   form and arrangement of them we have no account. With Constantine the
   Great begins the era of church architecture, and its first style is the
   Basilica. The emperor himself set the example, and built magnificent
   churches in Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Constantinople, which, however,
   have undergone many changes. His contemporary, the historian Eusebius,
   gives us the first account of a church edifice which Paulinus built in
   Tyre between a.d. 313 and 322. [297] 97 It included a large portico
   (propulon) a quadrangular atrium (aithrion) surrounded by ranges of
   columns; a fountain in the centre of the atrium for the customary
   washing of hands and feet before entering the church; interior
   porticoes; the nave or central space (basileios oikos) with galleries
   above the aisles, and covered by a roof of cedar of Lebanon; and the
   most holy altar (hagion hagion thusiasterion). Eusebius mentions also
   the thrones (thronoi) for the bishops and presbyters, and benches or
   seats. The church was surrounded by halls and inclosed by a wall, which
   can still be traced. Fragments of five granite columns of this building
   are among the ruins of Tyre.

   The description of a church in the Apostolic Constitutions, [298] 98
   implies that the clergy occupy the space at the cast end of the church
   (in the choir), and the people the nave, but mentions no barrier
   between them. Such a barrier, however, existed as early as the fourth
   century, when the laity were forbidden to enter the enclosure of the
   altar.

   § 60. The Lord's Day.

   See Lit. in vol. I. 476.

   The celebration of the Lord's Day in memory of the resurrection of
   Christ dates undoubtedly from the apostolic age. [299] 99 Nothing short
   of apostolic precedent can account for the universal religious
   observance in the churches of the second century. There is no
   dissenting voice. This custom is confirmed by the testimonies of the
   earliest post-apostolic writers, as Barnabas, [300] 00 Ignatius, [301]
   01 and Justin Martyr. [302] 02 It is also confirmed by the younger
   Pliny. [303] 03 The Didache calls the first day "the Lord's Day of the
   Lord." [304] 04

   Considering that the church was struggling into existence, and that a
   large number of Christians were slaves of heathen masters, we cannot
   expect an unbroken regularity of worship and a universal cessation of
   labor on Sunday until the civil government in the time of Constantine
   came to the help of the church and legalized (and in part even
   enforced) the observance of the Lord's Day. This may be the reason why
   the religious observance of it was not expressly enjoined by Christ and
   the apostles; as for similar reasons there is no prohibition of
   polygamy and slavery by the letter of the New Testament, although its
   spirit condemns these abuses, and led to their abolition. We may go
   further and say that coercive Sunday laws are against the genius and
   spirit of the Christian religion which appeals to the free will of man,
   and uses only moral means for its ends. A Christian government may and
   ought to protect the Christian Sabbath against open desecration, but
   its positive observance by attending public worship, must be left to
   the conscientious conviction of individuals. Religion cannot be forced
   by law. It looses its value when it ceases to be voluntary.

   The fathers did not regard the Christian Sunday as a continuation of,
   but as a substitute for, the Jewish Sabbath, and based it not so much
   on the fourth commandment, and the primitive rest of God in creation,
   to which the commandment expressly refers, as upon the resurrection of
   Christ and the apostolic tradition. There was a disposition to
   disparage the Jewish law in the zeal to prove the independent
   originality of Christian institutions. The same polemic interest
   against Judaism ruled in the paschal controversies, and made Christian
   Easter a moveable feast. Nevertheless, Sunday was always regarded in
   the ancient church as a divine institution, at least in the secondary
   sense, as distinct from divine ordinances in the primary sense, which
   were directly and positively commanded by Christ, as baptism and the
   Lord's Supper. Regular public worship absolutely requires a stated day
   of worship.

   Ignatius was the first who contrasted Sunday with the Jewish Sabbath as
   something done away with. [305] 05 So did the author of the so-called
   Epistle of Barnabas. [306] 06 Justin Martyr, in controversy with a Jew,
   says that the pious before Moses pleased God without circumcision and
   the Sabbath, [307] 07 and that Christianity requires not one particular
   Sabbath, but a perpetual Sabbath. [308] 08 He assigns as a reason for
   the selection of the first day for the purposes of Christian worship,
   because on that day God dispelled the darkness and the chaos, and
   because Jesus rose from the dead and appeared to his assembled
   disciples, but makes no allusion to the fourth commandment. [309] 09 He
   uses the term "to sabbathize" (sabbatizein), only of the Jews, except
   in the passage just quoted, where he spiritualizes the Jewish law.
   Dionysius of Corinth mentions Sunday incidentally in a letter to the
   church of Rome, a.d., 170: "To-day we kept the Lord's Day holy, in
   which we read your letter." [310] 10 Melito of Sardis wrote a treatise
   on the Lord's Day, which is lost. [311] 11 Irenaeus of Lyons, about
   170, bears testimony to the celebration of the Lord's Day, [312] 12 but
   likewise regards the Jewish Sabbath merely as a symbolical and typical
   ordinance, and says that "Abraham without circumcision and without
   observance of Sabbaths believed in God," which proves "the symbolical
   and temporary character of those ordinances, and their inability to
   make perfect." [313] 13 Tertullian, at the close of the second and
   beginning of the third century, views the Lord's Day as figurative of
   rest from sin and typical of man's final rest, and says: "We have
   nothing to do with Sabbaths, new moons or the Jewish festivals, much
   less with those of the heathen. We have our own solemnities, the Lord's
   Day, for instance, and Pentecost. As the heathen confine themselves to
   their festivals and do not observe ours, let us confine ourselves to
   ours, and not meddle with those belonging to them." He thought it wrong
   to fast on the Lord's Day, or to pray kneeling during its continuance.
   "Sunday we give to joy." But he also considered it Christian duty to
   abstain from secular care and labor, lest we give place to the devil.
   [314] 14 This is the first express evidence of cessation from labor on
   Sunday among Christians. The habit of standing in prayer on Sunday,
   which Tertullian regarded as essential to the festive character of the
   day, and which was sanctioned by an ecumenical council, was afterwards
   abandoned by the western church.

   The Alexandrian fathers have essentially the same view, with some
   fancies of their own concerning the allegorical meaning of the Jewish
   Sabbath.

   We see then that the ante-Nicene church clearly distinguished the
   Christian Sunday from the Jewish Sabbath, and put it on independent
   Christian ground. She did not fully appreciate the perpetual obligation
   of the fourth commandment in its substance as a weekly day of rest,
   rooted in the physical and moral necessities of man. This is
   independent of those ceremonial enactments which were intended only for
   the Jews and abolished by the gospel. But, on the other hand, the
   church took no secular liberties with the day. On the question of
   theatrical and other amusements she was decidedly puritanic and
   ascetic, and denounced them as being inconsistent on any day with the
   profession of a soldier of the cross. She regarded Sunday as a sacred
   day, as the Day of the Lord, as the weekly commemoration of his
   resurrection and the pentecostal effusion of the Spirit, and therefore
   as a day of holy joy and thanksgiving to be celebrated even before the
   rising sun by prayer, praise, and communion with the risen Lord and
   Saviour.

   Sunday legislation began with Constantine, and belongs to the next
   period.

   The observance of the Sabbath among the Jewish Christians gradually
   ceased. Yet the Eastern church to this day marks the seventh day of the
   week (excepting only the Easter Sabbath) by omitting fasting, and by
   standing in prayer; while the Latin church, in direct opposition to
   Judaism, made Saturday a fast day. The controversy on this point began
   as early as the, end of the second century

   Wednesday, [315] 15 and especially Friday, [316] 16 were devoted to the
   weekly commemoration of the sufferings and death of the Lord, and
   observed as days of penance, or watch-days, [317] 17 and half-fasting
   (which lasted till three o'clock in the afternoon). [318] 18
     __________________________________________________________________

   [299] The original designations of the Christian Sabbath or weekly
   rest-day are: he mia ormia sabbaton, the first day of the week (Matt.
   28:1; Mark 16:2; Luke 24:1; John 21:1; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:2), and he
   hemera kuriake, the Lord's Day, which first occurs in Rev. 1:10, then
   in Ignatius and the fathers. The Latins render it Dominicus or Dominica
   dies. Barnabas calls it the eighth day, in contrast to the Jewish
   Sabbath. After Constantine the Jewish term Sabbath and the heathen term
   Sunday (hemera tou heliou, dies Solis)were used also. In the edict of
   Gratian, a.d. 386, two are combined: "Solis die, quem Dominicum rite`
   dixere majores." On the Continent of Europe Sunday has ruled out
   Sabbath completely; while in England, Scotland, and the United States
   Sabbath is used as often as the other or oftener in religious
   literature. The difference is characteristic of the difference in the
   Continental and the Anglo-American observance of the Lord's Day.

   [300] Ep., c. 15: "We celebrate the eighth day with joy, on which Jesus
   rose from the dead, and, after having appeared [to his disciple, ;],
   ascended to heaven." It does not follow from this that Barnabas put the
   ascension of Christ likewise on Sunday.

   Alterthümer," vol. I. (1881), pp. 486-502, and the Lit. quoted there.
   The article is written by several authors, the section on Easter and
   Pentecost by Dr. Funk of Tübingen.

   The yearly festivals of this period were Easter, Pentecost, and
   Epiphany. They form the rudiments of the church year, and keep within
   the limits of the facts of the New Testament.

   Strictly speaking the ante-Nicene church had two annual festive
   seasons, the Passover in commemoration of the suffering of Christ, and
   the Pentecoste in commemoration of the resurrection and exaltation of
   Christ, beginning with Easter and ending with Pentecost proper. But
   Passover and Easter were connected in a continuous celebration,
   combining the deepest sadness with the highest joy, and hence the term
   pascha (in Greek and Latin) is often used in a wider sense for the
   Easter season, as is the case with the French paqueor paques, and the
   Italian pasqua. The Jewish passover also lasted a whole week, and after
   it began their Pentecost or feast of weeks. The death of Christ became
   fruitful in the resurrection, and has no redemptive power without it.
   The commemoration of the death of Christ was called the pascha
   staurosimon or the Passover proper. [319] 19 The commemoration of the
   resurrection was called the pascha anastasimon, and afterwards Easter.
   [320] 20 The former corresponds to the gloomy Friday, the other to the
   cheerful Sunday, the sacred days of the week in commemoration of those
   great events.

   The Christian Passover naturally grew out of the Jewish Passover as the
   Lord's Day grew out of the Sabbath; the paschal lamb being regarded as
   a prophetic type of Christ, the Lamb of God slain for our sins (1 Cor.
   5:7, 8), and the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt as a type of the
   redemption from sin. It is certainly the oldest and most important
   annual festival of the church, and can be traced back to the first
   century, or at all events to the middle of the second, when it was
   universally observed, though with a difference as to the day, and the
   extent of the fast connected with it. It is based on the view that
   Christ crucified and risen is the centre of faith. The Jewish
   Christians would very naturally from the beginning continue to
   celebrate the legal passover, but in the light of its fulfillment by
   the sacrifice of Christ, and would dwell chiefly on the aspect of the
   crucifixion. The Gentile Christians, for whom the Jewish passover had
   no meaning except through reflection from the cross, would chiefly
   celebrate the Lord's resurrection as they did on every Sunday of the
   week. Easter formed at first the beginning of the Christian year, as
   the month of Nisan, which contained the vernal equinox (corresponding
   to our March or April.), began the sacred year of the Jews. Between the
   celebration of the death and the resurrection of Christ lay "the great
   Sabbath," [321] 21 on which also the Greek church fasted by way of
   exception; and "the Easter vigils," [322] 22 which were kept, with
   special devotion, by the whole congregation till the break of day, and
   kept the more scrupulously, as it was generally believed that the
   Lord's glorious return would occur on this night. The feast of the
   resurrection, which completed the whole work of redemption, became
   gradually the most prominent part of the Christian Passover, and
   identical with Easter. But the crucifixion continued to be celebrated
   on what is called "Good Friday." [323] 23

   The paschal feast was preceded by a season of penitence and fasting,
   which culminated in "the holy week." [324] 24 This fasting varied in
   length, in different countries, from one day or forty hours to six
   weeks; [325] 25 but after the fifth century, through the influence of
   Rome, it was universally fixed at forty days, [326] 26 with reference
   to the forty days' fasting of Christ in the wilderness and the Old
   Testament types of that event (the fasting of Moses and Elijah). [327]
   27
     __________________________________________________________________

   [319] Pascha, pascha, is not from the verb paschein, to, suffer (though
   often confounded with it and with the Latin passio by the Father, who
   were ignorant of Hebrew), but from the Hebrew chsk the Chaldee 'hsk ,
   (Comp. the verb chsk to pass over, to spare). See Ex. chg. 12 and 13;
   Lev. 23:4-9; Num. ch. 9. It has three meanings in the Sept. and the N.
   T. 1) the paschal festival, called "the feast of unleavened bread," and
   lasting from the fourteenth to the twentieth of Nisan, in commemoration
   of the sparing of the first-born and the deliverance of Israel from
   Egypt; 2) the paschal lamb which was slain between the two evenings.
   (3-5 p. m.) on the 14^th of Nisan; 3) the paschal supper on the
   evening- of the same day, which marked the beginning of the 15th of
   Nisan, or the first day of the festival. In the first sense it
   corresponds to the Christian Easter-festival, as the type corresponds
   to the substance. Nevertheless the translation Easter for Passover in
   the English version, Acts 12:4, is a strange anachronism (corrected in
   the Revision).

   [320] Easter is the resurrection festival which follow., ; the Passover
   proper, but is included in the same festive week. The English Easter
   (Anglo-Saxon easter, eastran, German Ostern) is connected with East and
   sunrise, and is akin to eos, oriens, aurora (comp. Jac. Grimm's
   Deutsche Mythol. 1835, p. 181 and 349, and Skeat's Etym. Dict. E. Lang.
   sub Easter). The comparison of sunrise and the natural spring with the
   new moral creation in the resurrection of Christ, and the transfer of
   the celebration of Ostara, the old German divinity of the rising,
   health-bringing light, to the Christian Easter festival, was easy and
   natural, because all nature is a symbol of spirit, and the heathen
   myths are dim presentiments and carnal anticipations of Christian
   truths.

   hours night and day; and this diversity existing among those that
   observe it, is not a matter that has just sprung up in our times, but

   Respecting the time of the Christian Passover and of the fast connected
   with it, there was a difference of observance which created violent
   controversies in the ancient church, and almost as violent
   controversies in the modern schools of theology in connection with the
   questions of the primacy of Rome, and the genuineness of John's Gospel.
   [328] 28

   The paschal controversies of the ante-Nicene age are a very complicated
   chapter in ancient church-history, and are not yet sufficiently cleared
   up. They were purely ritualistic and disciplinary, and involved no
   dogma; and yet they threatened to split the churches; both parties
   laying too much stress on external uniformity. Indirectly, however,
   they involved the question of the independence of Christianity on
   Judaism. [329] 29

   Let us first consider the difference of observance or the subject of
   controversy.

   The Christians of Asia Minor, following the Jewish chronology, and
   appealing to the authority of the apostles John and Philip, celebrated
   the Christian Passover uniformly on the fourteenth of Nisan (which
   might fall on any of the seven days of the week) by a solemn fast; they
   fixed the close of the fast accordingly, and seem to have partaken on
   the evening of this day, as the close of the fast, but indeed of the
   Jewish paschal lamb, as has sometimes been supposed, [330] 30 but of
   the communion and love-feast, as the Christian passover and the
   festival of the redemption completed by the death of Christ. [331] 31
   The communion on the evening of the 14th (or, according to the Jewish
   mode of reckoning, the day from sunset to sunset, on the beginning of
   the 15th) of Nisan was in memory of the last pascha supper of Christ.
   This observance did not exclude the idea that Christ died as the true
   paschal Lamb. For we find among the fathers both this idea and the
   other that Christ ate the regular Jewish passover with his disciples,
   which took place on the14th. [332] 32 From the day of observance the
   Asiatic Christians were afterwards called Quartadecimanians. [333] 33
   Hippolytus of Rome speaks of them contemptuously as a sect of
   contentious and ignorant persons, who maintain that "the pascha should
   be observed on the fourteenth day of the first month according to the
   law, no matter on what day of the week it might fall." [334] 34
   Nevertheless the Quartadecimanian observance was probably the oldest
   and in accordance with the Synoptic tradition of the last Passover of
   our Lord, which it commemorated. [335] 35

   The Roman church, on the contrary, likewise appealing to early custom,
   celebrated the death of Jesus always on a Friday, the day of the week
   on which it actually occurred, and his resurrection always on a Sunday
   after the March full moon, and extended the paschal fast to the latter
   day; considering it improper to terminate the fast at an earlier date,
   and to celebrate the communion before the festival of the resurrection.
   Nearly all the other churches agreed with the Roman in this observance,
   and laid the main stress on the resurrection-festival on Sunday. This
   Roman practice created an entire holy week of solemn fasting and
   commemoration of the Lord's passion, while the Asiatic practice ended
   the fast on the 14^th of Nisan, which may fall sometimes several days
   before Sunday.

   Hence a spectacle shocking to the catholic sense of ritualistic
   propriety and uniformity was frequently presented to the world, that
   one part of Christendom was fasting and mourning over the death of our
   Saviour, while the other part rejoiced in the glory of the
   resurrection. We cannot be surprised that controversy arose, and
   earnest efforts were made to harmonize the opposing sections of
   Christendom in the public celebration of the fundamental facts of the
   Christian salvation and of the most sacred season of the church-year.

   The gist of the paschal controversy was, whether the Jewish paschal-day
   (be it a Friday or not), or the Christian Sunday, should control the
   idea and time of the entire festival. The Johannean practice of Asia
   represented here the spirit of adhesion to historical precedent, and
   had the advantage of an immovable Easter, without being Judaizing in
   anything but the observance of a fixed day of the month. The Roman
   custom represented the principle of freedom and discretionary change,
   and the independence of the Christian festival system. Dogmatically
   stated, the difference would be, that in the former case the chief
   stress was laid on the Lord's death; in the latter, on his
   resurrection. But the leading interest of the question for the early
   Church was not the astronomical, nor the dogmatical, but the
   ritualistic. The main object was to secure uniformity of observance,
   and to assert the originality of the Christian festive cycle, and its
   independence of Judaism; for both reasons the Roman usage at last
   triumphed even in the East. Hence Easter became a movable festival
   whose date varies from the end of March to the latter part of April.

   The history of the controversy divides itself into three acts.

   1. The difference came into discussion first on a visit of Polycarp,
   bishop of Smyrna, to Anicetus, bishop of Rome, between a.d. 150 and
   155. [336] 36 It was not settled; yet the two bishops parted in peace,
   after the latter had charged his venerable guest to celebrate the holy
   communion in his church. We have a brief, but interesting account of
   this dispute by Irenaeus, a pupil of Polycarp, which is as follows:
   [337] 37

   "When the blessed Polycarp sojourned at Rome in the days of Anicetus,
   and they had some little difference of opinion likewise with regard to
   other points, [338] 38 they forthwith came to a peaceable understanding
   on this head [the observance of Easter], having no love for mutual
   disputes. For neither could Anicetus persuade Polycarp not to observe
   [339] 39 inasmuch as he [Pol.] had always observed with John, the
   disciple of our Lord, and the other apostles, with whom he had
   associated; nor did Polycarp persuade Anicetus to observe Gr. (threi'n)
   who said that he was bound to maintain the custom of the presbyters
   (=bishops) before him. These things being so, they communed together;
   and in the church Anicetus yielded to Polycarp, out of respect no
   doubt, the celebration of the eucharist Gr. (thVn eujcaristivan), and
   they separated from each other in peace, all the church being at peace,
   both those that observed and those that did not observe [the fourteenth
   of Nisan], maintaining peace."

   This letter proves that the Christians of the days of Polycarp knew how
   to keep the unity of the Spirit without uniformity of rites and
   ceremonies. "The very difference in our fasting," says Irenaeus in the
   same letter, "establishes the unanimity in our faith."

   2. A few years afterwards, about a.d. 170, the controversy broke out in
   Laodicea, but was confined to Asia, where a difference had arisen
   either among the Quartadecimanians themselves, or rather among these
   and the adherents of the Western observance. The accounts on this
   interimistic sectional dispute are incomplete and obscure. Eusebius
   merely mentions that at that time Melito of Sardis wrote two works on
   the Passover. [340] 40 But these are lost, as also that of Clement of
   Alexandria on the same topic. [341] 41 Our chief source of information
   is Claudius Apolinarius (Apollinaris), [342] 42 bishop of Hierapolis,
   in Phrygia, in two fragments of his writings upon the subject, which
   have been preserved in the Chronicon Paschale. [343] 43 These are as
   follows:

   "There are some now who, from ignorance, love to raise strife about
   these things, being guilty in this of a pardonable offence; for
   ignorance does not so much deserve blame as need instruction. And they
   say that on the fourteenth [of Nisan] the Lord ate the paschal lamb (to
   probaton ephage) with his disciples, but that He himself suffered on
   the great day of unleavened bread [344] 44 [i.e. the fifteenth of
   Nisan]; and they interpret Matthew as favoring their view from which it
   appears that their view does not agree with the law, [345] 45 and that
   the Gospels seem, according to them, to be at variance. [346] 46

   The Fourteenth is the true Passover of the Lord, the great sacrifice,
   the. Son of God [347] 47 in the place of the lamb ... who was lifted up
   upon the horns of the unicorn ... and who was buried on the day of the
   Passover, the stone having been placed upon his tomb."

   Here Apolinarius evidently protests against the Quartadecimanian
   practice, yet simply as one arising from ignorance, and not as a
   blameworthy heresy. He opposes it as a chronological and exegetical
   mistake, and seems to hold that the fourteenth, and not the fifteenth,
   is the great day of the death of Christ as the true Lamb of God, on the
   false assumption that this truth depends upon the chronological
   coincidence of the crucifixion and the Jewish passover. But the
   question arises: Did he protest from the Western and Roman standpoint
   which had many advocates in the East, [348] 48 or as a
   Quartadecimanian? [349] 49 In the latter case we would be obliged to
   distinguish two parties of Quartadecimanians, the orthodox or catholic
   Quartadecimanians, who simply observed the 14th Nisan by fasting and
   the evening communion, and a smaller faction of heretical and
   schismatic Quartadecimanians, who adopted the Jewish practice of eating
   a paschal lamb on that day in commemoration of the Saviour's last
   passover. But there is no evidence for this distinction in the above or
   other passages. Such a grossly Judaizing party would have been treated
   with more severity by a catholic bishop. Even the Jews could no more
   eat of the paschal lamb after the destruction of the temple in which it
   had to be slain. There is no trace of such a party in Irenaeus,
   Hippolytus [350] 50 and Eusebius who speak only of one class of
   Quartadecimanians. [351] 51

   Hence we conclude that Apolinarius protests against the whole
   Quartadecimanian practice, although very mildly and charitably. The
   Laodicean controversy was a stage in the same controversy which was
   previously discussed by Polycarp and Anicetus in Christian charity, and
   was soon agitated again by Polycrates and Victor with hierarchical and
   intolerant violence.

   3. Much more important and vehement was the third stage of the
   controversy between 190 and 194, which extended over the whole church,
   and occasioned many synods and synodical letters. [352] 52 The Roman
   bishop Victor, a very different man from his predecessor Anicetus,
   required the Asiatics, in an imperious tone, to abandon their
   Quartadecimanian practice. Against this Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus,
   solemnly protested in the name of a synod held by him, and appealed to
   an imposing array of authorities for their primitive custom. Eusebius
   has preserved his letter, which is quite characteristic.

   "We," wrote the Ephesian bishop to the Roman pope and his church, "We
   observe the genuine day; neither adding thereto nor taking therefrom.
   For in Asia great lights [353] 53 have fallen asleep, which shall rise
   again in the day of the Lord's appearing, in which he will come with
   glory from heaven, and will raise up all the saints: Philip, one of the
   twelve apostles, who sleeps in Hierapolis, and his two aged virgin
   daughters; his other daughter, also, who having lived under the
   influence of the Holy Spirit, now likewise rests in Ephesus; moreover,
   John, who rested upon the bosom of our Lord, [354] 54 who was also a
   priest, and bore the sacerdotal plate, [355] 55 both a martyr and
   teacher; he is buried in Ephesus. Also Polycarp of Smyrna, both bishop
   and martyr, and Thraseas, both bishop and martyr of Eumenia, who sleeps
   in Smyrna. Why should I mention Sagaris, bishop and martyr, who sleeps
   in Laodicea; moreover, the blessed Papirius, and Melito, the eunuch
   [celibate], who lived altogether under the influence of the Holy
   Spirit, who now rests in Sardis, awaiting the episcopate from heaven,
   in which he shall rise from the dead. All these observed the fourteenth
   day of the passover according to the gospel, deviating in no respect,
   but following the rule of faith.

   "Moreover, I, Polycrates, who am the least of you, according to the
   tradition of my relatives, some of whom I have followed. For seven of
   my relatives were bishops, and I am the eighth; and my relatives always
   observed the day when the people of the Jews threw away the leaven. I,
   therefore, brethren, am now sixty-five years in the Lord, who having
   conferred with the brethren throughout the world, and having studied
   the whole of the Sacred Scriptures, am not at all alarmed at those
   things with which I am threatened, to intimidate me. For they who are
   greater than I have said, 'we ought to obey God rather than men.' ... I
   could also mention the bishops that were present, whom you requested me
   to summon, and whom I did call; whose names would present a great
   number, but who seeing my slender body consented to my epistle, well
   knowing that I did not wear my gray hairs for nought, but that I did at
   all times regulate my life in the Lord Jesus." [356] 56

   Victor turned a deaf ear to this remonstrance, branded the Asiatics as
   heretics, and threatened to excommunicate them. [357] 57

   But many of the Eastern bishops, and even Irenaeus, in the name of the
   Gallic Christians, though he agreed with Victor on the disputed point,
   earnestly reproved him for such arrogance, and reminded him of the more
   Christian and brotherly conduct of his predecessors Anicetus, Pius,
   Hyginus, Telesphorus, and Xystus, who sent the eucharist to their
   dissenting brethren. He dwelt especially on the fraternal conduct of
   Anicetus to Polycarp. Irenaeus proved himself on this occasion, as
   Eusebius remarks, a true peacemaker, and his vigorous protest seems to
   have prevented the schism.

   We have from the same Irenaeus another utterance on this controversy,
   [358] 58 saying: "The apostles have ordered that we should 'judge no
   one in meat or in drink, or in respect to a feast-day or a new moon or
   a sabbath day' (Col. 2:16). Whence then these wars? Whence these
   schisms? We keep the feasts, but in the leaven of malice by tearing the
   church of God and observing what is outward, in order to reject what is
   better, faith and charity. That such feasts and fasts are displeasing
   to the Lord, we have heard from the Prophets." A truly evangelical
   sentiment from one who echoes the reaching of St. John and his last
   words: "Children, love one another."

   4. In the course of the third century the Roman practice gained ground
   everywhere in the East, and, to anticipate the result, was established
   by the council of Nicaea in 325 as the law of the whole church. This
   council considered it unbecoming, in Christians to follow the usage of
   the unbelieving, hostile Jews, and ordained that Easter should always
   be celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon succeeding
   the vernal equinox (March 21), and always after the Jewish passover.
   [359] 59 If the full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter-day is the Sunday
   after. By this arrangement Easter may take place as early as March 22,
   or as late as April 25.

   Henceforth the Quartadecimanians were universally regarded as heretics,
   and were punished as such. The Synod of Antioch, 341, excommunicated
   them. The Montanists and Novatians were also cleared with the
   Quartadecimanian observance. The last traces of it disappeared in the
   sixth century.

   But the desired uniformity in the observance of Easter was still
   hindered by differences in reckoning the Easter Sunday according to the
   course of the moon and the vernal equinox, which the Alexandrians fixed
   on the 21^st of March, and the Romans on the 18^th; so that in the year
   387, for example, the Romans kept Easter on the 21^st of March, and the
   Alexandrians not till the 25^th of April. In the West also the
   computation changed and caused a renewal of the Easter controversy in
   the sixth and seventh centuries. The old British, Irish and Scotch
   Christians, and the Irish missionaries on the Continent adhered to the
   older cycle of eighty-four years in opposition to the later Dionysian
   or Roman cycle of ninety-five years, and hence were styled
   "Quartadecimanians "by their Anglo-Saxon and Roman opponents, though
   unjustly; for they celebrated Easter always on a Sunday between the
   14^th and the 20^th of the mouth (the Romans between the 15^th and
   21^st). The Roman practice triumphed. But Rome again changed the
   calendar under Gregory XIII. (a.d. 1583). Hence even to this day the
   Oriental churches who hold to the Julian and reject the Gregorian
   calendar, differ from the Occidental Christians in the time of the
   observance of Easter.

   All these useless ritualistic disputes might have been avoided if, with
   some modification of the old Asiatic practice as to the close of the
   fast, Easter, like Christmas, had been made an immovable feast at least
   as regards the week, if not the day, of its observance.

   Note.

   The bearing of this controversy on the Johannean origin of the fourth
   Gospel has been greatly overrated by the negative critics of the
   Tübingen School. Dr. Baur, Schwegler, Hilgenfeld, Straus (Leben Jesu,
   new ed. 1864, p. 76 sq.), Schenkel, Scholten, Samuel Davidson, Renan
   (Marc-Aurèle, p. 196), use it as a fatal objection to the Johannean
   authorship. Their argument is this: "The Asiatic practice rested on the
   belief that Jesus ate the Jewish Passover with his disciples on the
   evening of the 14^th of Nisan, and died on the 15^th; this belief is
   incompatible with the fourth Gospel, which puts the death of Jesus, as
   the true Paschal Lamb, on the 14^th of Nisan, just before the regular
   Jewish Passover; therefore the fourth Gospel cannot have existed when
   the Easter controversy first broke out about a.d. 160; or, at all
   events, it cannot be the work of John to whom the Asiatic Christians so
   confidently appealed for their paschal observance."

   But leaving out of view the early testimonies for the authenticity of
   John, which reach back to the first quarter of the second century, the
   minor premise is wrong, and hence the conclusion falls. A closer
   examination of the relevant passages of John leads to the result that
   he agrees with the Synoptic account, which puts the last Supper on the
   14^th, and the crucifixion on the 15^th of Nisan. (Comp. on this
   chronological difficulty vol. I. 133 sqq.; and the authorities quoted
   there, especially John Lightfoot, Wieseler, Robinson, Lange, Kirchner,
   and McClellan.)

   Weitzel, Steitz, and Wagenmann deny the inference of the Tübingen
   School by disputing the major premise, and argue that the Asiatic
   observance (in agreement with the Tübingen school and their own
   interpretation of John's chronology) implies that Christ died as the
   true paschal lamb on the 14^th, and not on the 15^th of Nisan. To this
   view we object: 1) it conflicts with the extract from Apolinarius in
   the Chronicon Paschale as given p. 214. 2) There is no contradiction
   between the idea that Christ died as the true paschal lamb, and the
   Synoptic chronology; for the former was taught by Paul (1 Cor. 5:7),
   who was quoted for the Roman practice, and both were held by the
   fathers; the coincidence in the time being subordinate to the fact. 3)
   A contradiction in the primitive tradition of Christ's death is
   extremely improbable, and it is much easier to conform the Johannean
   chronology to the Synoptic than vice versa.

   It seems to me that the Asiatic observance of the 14^th of Nisan was in
   commemoration of the last passover of the Lord, and this of necessity
   implied also a commemoration of his death, like every celebration of
   the Lord's Supper. In any case, however, these ancient paschal
   controversies did not hinge on the chronological question or the true
   date of Christ's death at all but on the week-day and the manner of its
   annual observance. The question was whether the paschal communion
   should be celebrated on the 14^th of Nisan, or on the Sunday of the
   resurrection festival, without regard to the Jewish chronology.

   [328] See note at the end of the section.

   [329] So Renan regards the controversy, Marc-Aurèle, p. 194, as a
   conflict between two kinds of Christianity. "le christianisme qui
   s'envisageait comme une suite du judaisme," and "le christianisme qui
   s'envisageait comme la destruction du judaisme."

   [330] By Mosheim (De rebus christ. ante Const. M Com., p. 435 sqq.) and
   Neander (in the first edition of his Church Hist., 1. 518, but not in
   the second I. 512, Germ. ed., I. 298 in Torrey's translation). There is
   no trace of such a Jewish custom on the part of the Quartadecimani.
   This is admitted by Hefele (I. 87), who formerly held to three parties
   in this controversy; but there were only two.

   [331] The celebration of the eucharist is not expressly mentioned by
   Eusebius, but may be inferred. He says (H. E. V. 23): "The churches of
   all Asia, guided by older tradition (hosek paradoseosarchaioteras,
   older than that of Rome), thought that they were bound to keep the
   fourteenth day of the moon, on (or at the time of) the feast of the
   Saviour's Passover (epi testou soteriou pascha eortes), that day on
   which the Jews were commanded to kill the paschal lamb; it being
   incumbent on them by all means to regulate the close of the fast by
   that day on whatever day of the week it might happen to fall."

   [332] Justin M. Dial.c.111; Iren. Adv. Haer. II. 22, 3; Tert. De Bapt.
   19; Origen, In Matth.; Epiph. Haer. XLII. St. Paul first declared
   Christ to be our passover (1 Cor. 5:7), and yet his companion Luke,
   with whom his own account of the institution of the Lord's Supper
   agrees, represents Christ's passover meal as takin, place on the 14th.

   sectarian name occurs in the canons of the councils of Laodicea, 364,
   Constantinople, 381, etc.

   [335] So also Renan regards it, L'égl. Chrét., p. 445sq., but he brings
   it, like Baur, in conflict with the chronology of the fourth Gospel. He
   traces the Roman custom from the pontificate of Xystus and Telesphorus,
   a.d. 120.

   [336] Renan (l.c., p. 447) conjectures that Trenaeus and Florinus
   accompanied Polycarp on that journey to Rome. Neander and others give a
   wrong date, 162. Polycarp died in 155, see § 19, p. 51, The pontificate
   of Anicetus began in 154 or before.

   probably also the celebration of the eucharist in the evening. It was a
   technical term for legal observances, Comp. John 9:16.

   [340] H. E. IV. 26.

   [341] With the exception of a few fragments in the Chrenicon Paschale.

   [342] Eusebius spells his name Apolinarios (IV. 21 and 26, 27, ree
   Heinichen's ed.), and so do Photius, and the Chron. Pachale in most
   MSS. But the Latins spell his name Apollinaris. He lived under Marcus
   Aurelius (161-180), was an apologist and opponent of Montanism which
   flourished especially in Phrygia, and must not be confounded with one
   of the two Apollinarius or Apollinaris, father and son, of Laodicea in
   Syria, who flourished in the fourth century.

   [343] Ed. Dindorf I. 13; in Routh's Reliquiae Sacrae I.p. 160. Quoted
   and discussed by Milligan, l.c. p. 109 sq.

   [344] If this is the genuine Quartadecimanian view, it proves
   conclusively that it agreed with the Synoptic chronology as to the day
   of Christ's death, and that Weitzel and Steitz are wrong on this point.

   [345] Since according to the view of Apolinarius, Christ as the true
   fulfillment of the law, must have died on the 14th, the day of the
   legal passover.

   [346] This seems to be the meaning of stasiazein dokei, kat' autous, ta
   euangelia, inter se pugnare, etc. On the assumption namely that John
   fixes the detail of Christ on the fourteenth of Nisan, which, however,
   is a point in dispute. The opponents who started from the chronology of
   the Synoptists, could retort this objections.

   [347] The same argument is urged in the fragments of Hippolytus in the
   Chronicon Paschale. But that Jesus was the true Paschal Lamb is a
   doctrine in which all the churches were agreed.

   [348] So Baur (p. 163 sq.) and the Tübingen School rightly maintain.

   [349] As Weitzel, Steitz, and Lechler assume in opposition to Baur.

   fragments of the Paschal Chronicle.

   [351] Epiphanius, it is true, distinguishes different opinions among
   the Quartadecimanians (Haer. L. cap. 1-3 Contra Quartadecimanas), but
   be makes no mention of the practice of eating a Paschal lamb, or of any
   difference in this chronology of the death of Christ.

   relating to the unity of judgment on the subject of the most holy feast
   of Easter; ...that all the brethren in the East who have heretofore
   kept this festival at the same time as the Jews, will henceforth
   conform to the Romans and to us, and to all who from the earliest time
   have observed our period of celebrating Easter." Eusebius; reports
   (Vita Const. III. 19) that especially the province of Asia acknowledged
   the decree. He thinks that only God and the emperor Constantine could
   remove this, ; evil of two conflicting celebrations of Easter.

   § 63. Pentecost.

   Easter was followed by the festival of Pentecost. [360] 60 It rested on
   the Jewish feast of harvest. It was universally observed, as early as
   the second century, in commemoration of the appearances and heavenly
   exaltation of the risen Lord, and had throughout a joyous character. It
   lasted through fifty days--Quinquagesima --which were celebrated as a
   continuous Sunday, by daily communion, the standing posture in prayer,
   and the absence of all fasting. Tertullian says that all the festivals
   of the heathen put together will not make up the one Pentecost of the
   Christians. [361] 61 During that period the Acts of the Apostles were
   read in the public service (and are read to this day in the Greek
   church).

   Subsequently the celebration was limited to the fortieth day as the
   feast of the Ascension, and the fiftieth day, or Pentecost proper
   (Whitsunday) as the feast of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the
   birthday of the Christian Church. In this restricted sense Pentecost
   closed the cycle of our Lord's festivals (the semestre Domini), among
   which it held the third place (after Easter and Christmas). [362] 62 It
   was also a favorite time for baptism, especially the vigil of the
   festival.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [360] Pentekoste (hemera), Quinquagesima, is the fiftieth day after the
   Passover Sabbath, see vol. I. 225 sqq. It is used by the fathers; in it
   wider sense for the whole period of fifty days, from Easter to

   § 64. The Epiphany

   The feast of the Epiphany is of later origin. [363] 63 It spread from
   the East towards the West, but here, even in the fourth century, it was
   resisted by such parties as the Donatists, and condemned as an oriental
   innovation. It was, in general, the feast of the appearance of Christ
   in the flesh, and particularly of the manifestation of his Messiahship
   by his baptism in the Jordan, the festival at once of his birth and his
   baptism. It was usually kept on the 6th of January. [364] 64 When the
   East adopted from the West the Christmas festival, Epiphany was
   restricted to the celebration of the baptism of Christ, and made one of
   the three great reasons for the administration of baptism.

   In the West it was afterwards made a collective festival of several
   events in the life of Jesus, as the adoration of the Magi, the first
   miracle of Cana, and sometimes the feeding of the five thousand. It
   became more particularly the "feast of the three kings," that is, the
   wise men from the East, and was placed in special connexion with the
   mission to the heathen. The legend of the three kings (Caspar,
   Melchior, Baltazar) grew up gradually from the recorded gifts, gold,
   frankincense, and myrrh, which the Magi offered to the new-born King,
   of the Jews. [365] 65

   Of the Christmas festival there is no clear trace before the fourth
   century; partly because the feast of the Epiphany in a measure held the
   place of it; partly because of birth of Christ, the date of which, at
   any rate, was uncertain, was less prominent in the Christian mind than
   his death and resurrection. It was of Western (Roman) origin, and found
   its way to the East after the middle of the fourth century for
   Chrysostom, in a Homily, which was probably preached Dec. 25, 386,
   speaks of the celebration of the separate day of the Nativity as having
   been recently introduced in Antioch.

   Basilidians (Strom. I. 21). Neander supposes that they derived it from
   the Jewish Christians in Palestine. Chrysostom often alludes to it.

   § 65. The Order of Public Worship.

   The earliest description of the Christian worship is given us by a
   heathen, the younger Pliny, a.d. 109, in his well-known letter to
   Trajan, which embodies the result of his judicial investigations in
   Bithynia. [366] 66 According to this, the Christians assembled on an
   appointed day (Sunday) at sunrise, sang responsively a song to Christ
   as to God, [367] 67 and then pledged themselves by an oath
   (sacramentum) not to do any evil work, to commit no theft, robbery, nor
   adultery, not to break their word, nor sacrifice property intrusted to
   them. Afterwards (at evening) they assembled again, to eat ordinary and
   innocent food (the agape).

   This account of a Roman official then bears witness to the primitive
   observance of Sunday, the separation of the love-feast from the morning
   worship (with the communion), and the worship of Christ as God in song.

   Justin Martyr, at the close of his larger Apology, [368] 68 describes
   the public worship more particularly, as it was conducted about the
   year 140. After giving a full account of baptism and the holy Supper,
   to which we shall refer again, he continues:

   "On Sunday [369] 69 a meeting of all, who live in the cities and
   villages, is held, and a section from the Memoirs of the Apostles (the
   Gospels) and the writings of the Prophets (the Old Testament) is read,
   as long as the time permits. [370] 70 When the reader has finished, the
   president, [371] 71 in a discourse, gives all exhortation [372] 72 to
   the imitation of these noble things. After this we all rise in common
   prayer. [373] 73 At the close of the prayer, as we have before
   described, [374] 74 bread and wine with water are brought. The
   president offers prayer and thanks for them, according to the power
   given him, [375] 75 and the congregation responds the Amen. Then the
   consecrated elements are distributed to each one, and partaken, and are
   carried by the deacons to the houses of the absent. The wealthy and the
   willing then give contributions according to their free will, and this
   collection is deposited with the president, who therewith supplies
   orphans and widows, poor and needy, prisoners and strangers, and takes
   care of all who are in want. We assemble in common on Sunday because
   this is the first day, on which God created the world and the light,
   and because Jesus Christ our Saviour on the same day rose from the dead
   and appeared to his disciples."

   Here, reading of the Scriptures, preaching (and that as an episcopal
   function), prayer, and communion, plainly appear as the regular parts
   of the Sunday worship; all descending, no doubt, from the apostolic
   age. Song is not expressly mentioned here, but elsewhere. [376] 76 The
   communion is not yet clearly separated from the other parts of worship.
   But this was done towards the end of the second century.

   The same parts of worship are mentioned in different places by
   Tertullian. [377] 77

   The eighth book of the Apostolical Constitutions contains already an
   elaborate service with sundry liturgical prayers. [378] 78

   § 66. Parts of Worship.

   1. The reading of Scripture lessons from the Old Testament with
   practical application and exhortation passed from the Jewish synagogue
   to the Christian church. The lessons from the New Testament came
   prominently into use as the Gospels and Epistles took the place of the
   oral instruction of the apostolic age. The reading of the Gospels is
   expressly mentioned by Justin Martyr, and the Apostolical Constitutions
   add the Epistles and the Acts. [379] 79 During the Pentecostal season
   the Acts of the Apostles furnished the lessons. But there was no
   uniform system of selection before the Nicene age. Besides the
   canonical Scripture, post-apostolic writings, as the Epistle of Clement
   of Rome, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the Pastor of Hermas, were read
   in some congregations, and are found in important MSS. of the New
   Testament. [380] 80 The Acts of Martyrs were also read on the
   anniversary of their martyrdom.

   2. The sermon [381] 81 was a familiar exposition of Scripture and
   exhortation to repentance and a holy life, and gradually assumed in the
   Greek church an artistic, rhetorical character. Preaching was at first
   free to every member who had the gift of public speaking, but was
   gradually confined as an exclusive privilege of the clergy, and
   especially the bishop. Origen was called upon to preach before his
   ordination, but this was even then rather an exception. The oldest
   known homily, now recovered in full (1875), is from an unknown Greek or
   Roman author of the middle of the second century, probably before a.d.
   140 (formerly ascribed to Clement of Rome). He addresses the hearers as
   "brothers" and "sisters," and read from manuscript. [382] 82 The homily
   has no literary value, and betrays confusion and intellectual poverty,
   but is inspired by moral earnestness and triumphant faith. It closes
   with this doxology: "To the only God invisible, the Father of truth,
   who sent forth unto us the Saviour and Prince of immortality, through
   whom also He made manifest unto us the truth and the heavenly life, to
   Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen." [383] 83

   3. Prayer. This essential part of all worship passed likewise from the
   Jewish into the Christian service. The oldest prayers of post-apostolic
   times are the eucharistic thanksgivings in the Didache, and the
   intercession at the close of Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians,
   which seems to have been used in the Roman church. [384] 84 It is long
   and carefully composed, and largely interwoven with passages from the
   Old Testament. It begins with an elaborate invocation of God in
   antithetical sentences, contains intercession for the afflicted, the
   needy, the wanderers, and prisoners, petitions for the conversion of
   the heathen, a confession of sin and prayer for pardon (but without a
   formula of absolution), and closes with a prayer for unity and a
   doxology. Very touching is the prayer for rulers then so hostile to the
   Christians, that God may grant them health, peace, concord and
   stability. The document has a striking resemblance to portions of the
   ancient liturgies which begin to appear in the fourth century, but bear
   the names of Clement, James and Mark, and probably include some
   primitive elements. [385] 85

   The last book of the Apostolical Constitutions contains the pseudo- or
   post-Clementine liturgy, with special prayers for believers,
   catechumens, the possessed, the penitent, and even for the dead, and a
   complete eucharistic service. [386] 86

   The usual posture in prayer was standing with outstretched arms in
   Oriental fashion.

   4. Song. The Church inherited the psalter from the synagogue, and has
   used it in all ages as an inexhaustible treasury of devotion. The
   psalter is truly catholic in its spirit and aim; it springs from the
   deep fountains of the human heart in its secret communion with God, and
   gives classic expression to the religious experience of all men in
   every age and tongue. This is the best proof of its inspiration.
   Nothing like it can be found in all the poetry of heathendom. The
   psalter was first enriched by the inspired hymns which saluted the
   birth of the Saviour of the world, the Magnificat of Mary, the
   Benedictus of Zacharias, the Gloria in Excelsis of the heavenly host,
   and the Nunc Dimittis of the aged Simeon. These hymns passed at once
   into the service of the Church, to resound through all successive
   centuries, as things of beauty which are "a joy forever." Traces of
   primitive Christian poems can be found throughout the Epistles and the
   Apocalypse. The angelic anthem (Luke 2:14) was expanded into the Gloria
   in Excelsis, first in the Greek church, in the third, if not the
   second, century, and afterwards in the Latin, and was used as the
   morning hymn. [387] 87 It is one of the classical forms of devotion,
   like the Latin Te Deum of later date. The evening hymn of the Greek
   church is less familiar and of inferior merit.

   The following is a free translation:


   "Hail! cheerful Light, of His pure glory poured,

   Who is th' Immortal Father, Heavenly, Blest,

   Holiest of Holies--Jesus Christ our Lord!

   Now are we come to the Sun's hour of rest,

   The lights of Evening round us shine,

   We sing the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost Divine!

   Worthiest art Thou at all times, to be sung

   With undefiled tongue,

   Son of our God, Giver of Life alone!

   Therefore, in all the world, Thy glories, Lord, we own." [388] 88

   An author towards the close of the second century [389] 89 could appeal
   against the Artemonites, to a multitude of hymns in proof of the faith
   of the church in the divinity of Christ: "How many psalms and odes of
   the Christians are there not, which have been written from the
   beginning by believers, and which, in their theology, praise Christ as
   the Logos of God?" Tradition says, that the antiphonies, or responsive
   songs; were introduced by Ignatius of Antioch. The Gnostics, Valentine
   and Bardesanes also composed religious songs; and the church surely
   learned the practice not from them, but from the Old Testament psalms.

   The oldest Christian poem preserved to us which can be traced to an
   individual author is from the pen of the profound Christian
   philosopher, Clement of Alexandria, who taught theology ill that city
   before a.d. 202. It is a sublime but somewhat turgid song of praise to
   the Logos, as the divine educator and leader of the human race, and
   though not intended and adapted for public worship, is remarkable for
   its spirit and antiquity. [390] 90

   Notes.

   I. The Prayer of the Roman Church from the newly recovered portion of
   the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, ch. 59-61 (in Bishop
   Lightfoot's translation, St. Clement of Rome, Append. pp. 376-378):

   "Grant unto us, Lord, that we may set our hope on Thy Name which is the
   primal source of all creation, and open the eyes of our hearts, that we
   may know Thee, who alone abidest Highest in the highest, Holy in the
   holy; who layest low the insolence of the proud: who scatterest the
   imaginings of nations; who settest the lowly on high, and bringest the
   lofty low; who makest rich and makest poor; who killest and makest
   alive; who alone art the Benefactor of spirits and the God of all
   flesh; who lookest into the abysses, who scannest the works of man; the
   Succor of them that are in peril, the Saviour of them that are in
   despair; the Creator and Overseer of every spirit; who multipliest the
   nations upon earth, and hast chosen out from all men those that love
   Thee through Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, through whom Thou didst
   instruct us, didst sanctify us, didst honor us. We beseech Thee, Lord
   and Master, to be our help and succor. Save those among us who are in
   tribulation; have mercy on the lowly; lift up the fallen; show Thyself
   unto the needy; heal the ungodly; convert the wanderers of Thy people;
   feed the hungry; release our prisoners; raise up the weak; comfort the
   faint-hearted. Let all the Gentiles know that Thou art God alone, and
   Jesus Christ is Thy Son, and we are Thy people and the sheep of Thy
   pastures

   "Thou through Thine operation didst make manifest the everlasting
   faithful of the world. Thou, Lord, didst create the earth. Thou art
   faithful throughout all generations, righteous in Thy judgments,
   marvellous in strength and excellence. Thou that art wise in creating
   and prudent in establishing that which Thou hast made, that art good in
   the things which are seen and faithful with them that trust on Thee,
   pitiful and compassionate, forgive us our iniquities and our
   unrighteousnesses and our transgressions and shortcomings. Lay not to
   our account every sin of Thy servants and Thine handmaids, but cleanse
   us with the cleansing of Thy truth, and guide our steps to walk in
   holiness and righteousness and singleness of heart, and to do such
   things as are good and well-pleasing in Thy sight and in the sight of
   our rulers. Yea Lord, make Thy face to shine upon us in peace for our
   good, that we may be sheltered by Thy mighty hand and delivered from
   every sin by Thine uplifted arm. And deliver up from them that hate us
   wrongfully. Give concord and peace to us and to all that dwell on the
   earth, as thou gavest to our fathers, when they called on Thee in faith
   and truth with holiness, that we may be saved, while we render
   obedience to Thine almighty and most excellent Name, and to our rulers
   and governors upon the earth.

   "Thou, Lord and Master, hast given them the power of sovereignty
   through Thine excellent and unspeakable might, that we knowing the
   glory and honor which Thou hast given them may submit ourselves unto
   them, in nothing resisting Thy will. Grant unto them therefore, O Lord,
   health, peace, concord, stability, that they may administer the
   government which Thou hast given them without failure. For Thou, O
   heavenly Master, King of the ages, givest to the sons of men glory and
   honor and power over all things that are upon earth. Do Thou, Lord,
   direct their counsel according to that which is good and well pleasing
   in Thy sight, that, administering in peace and gentleness with
   godliness the power which Thou hast given them, they may obtain Thy
   favor. O Thou, who alone art able to do these things and things far
   more exceeding good than these for us, we praise Thee through the
   High-priest and Guardian of our souls, Jesus Christ, through whom be,
   the glory and the majesty unto Thee both now and for all generations
   and for ever and ever. Amen."

   praise of Christ.

   The God of peace."

   This poem was for sixteen centuries merely a hymnological curiosity,
   until an American Congregational minister, Dr. Henry Martyn Dexter, by
   a happy reproduction, in 1846, secured it a place in modern hymn-books.
   While preparing a sermon (as He. informs me) on "some prominent
   characteristics of the early Christians" (text, Deut. 32:7, "Remember
   the days of old"), he first wrote down an exact translation of the
   Greek hymn of Clement, and then reproduced and modernized it for the
   use of his congregation in connection with the sermon. It is well known
   that many Psalms of Israel have inspired some of the noblest Christian
   hymns. The 46^th Psalm gave the key-note of Luther's triumphant
   war-hymn of the Reformation: "Ein' feste Burg." John Mason Neale dug
   from the dust of ages many a Greek and Latin hymn, to the edification
   of English churches, notably some portions of Bernard of Cluny's De
   Contemptu Mundi, which runs through nearly three thousand dactylic
   hexameters, and furnished the material for "Brief life is here our
   portion." "For thee, O dear, dear Country," and "Jerusalem the golden."
   We add Dexter's hymn as a fair specimen of a useful transfusion and
   rejuvenation of an old poem.


   1. Shepherd of tender youth,

   None calls on Thee in vain;


   Guiding in love and truth

   Help Thou dost not disdain--


       Through devious ways;

       Help from above.

   We come Thy name to sing;

   4. Ever be Thou our Guide,


   Hither our children bring

   Our Shepherd and our Pride,


       To shout Thy praise!

       Our Staff and Song!


   Jesus, Thou Christ of God


   2. Thou art our Holy Lord,

   By Thy perennial Word


   The all-subduing Word,

   Lead us where Thou hast trod,


       Healer of strife!

       Make our faith strong.


   Thou didst Thyself abase,


   That from sin's deep disgrace

   5. So now, and till we die,


   Thou mightest save our race,

   Sound we Thy praises high,


       And give us life.

       And joyful sing:


   Infants, and the glad throng

   The public service was divided from. the middle of the second century
   down to the close of the fifth, into the worship of the catechumens,
   [391] 91 and the worship of the faithful. [392] 92 The former consisted
   of scripture reading, preaching, prayer, and song, and was open to the
   unbaptized and persons under penance. The latter consisted of the holy
   communion, with its liturgical appendages; none but the proper members
   of the church could attend it; and before it began, all catechumens and
   unbelievers left the assembly at the order of the deacon, [393] 93 and
   the doors were closed or guarded.

   The earliest witness for this strict separation is Tertullian, who
   reproaches the heretics with allowing the baptized and the unbaptized
   to attend the same prayers, and casting the holy even before the
   heathens. [394] 94 He demands, that believers, catechumens, and
   heathens should occupy separate places in public worship. The
   Alexandrian divines furnished a theoretical ground for this practice by
   their doctrine of a secret tradition for the esoteric. Besides the
   communion, the sacrament of baptism, with its accompanying confession,
   was likewise treated as a mystery for the initiated, [395] 95 and
   withdrawn from the view of Jews and heathens.

   We have here the beginnings of the Christian mystery-worship, or what
   has been called since 1679 "the Secret Discipline," (Disciplina
   Arcani), which is presented in its full development in the liturgies of
   the fourth century, but disappeared from the Latin church after the
   sixth century, with the dissolution of heathenism and the universal
   introduction of infant baptism.

   The Secret Discipline had reference chiefly to the celebration of the
   sacraments of baptism and the eucharist, but included also the
   baptismal symbol, the Lord's Prayer, and the doctrine of the Trinity.
   Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Cyril of Jerusalem, and other fathers
   make a distinction between lower or elementary (exoteric) and higher or
   deeper (esoteric) doctrines, and state that the latter are withheld
   from the uninitiated out of reverence and to avoid giving offence to
   the weak and the heathen. This mysterious reticence, however, does not
   justify the inference that the Secret Discipline included
   transubstantiation, purgatory, and other Roman dogmas which are not
   expressly taught in the writings of the fathers. The argument from
   silence is set aside by positive proof to the contrary. [396] 96 Modern
   Roman archaeologists have pressed the whole symbolism of the Catacombs
   into the service of the Secret Discipline, but without due regard to
   the age of those symbolical representations.

   The origin of the Secret Discipline has been traced by some to the
   apostolic age, on the ground of the distinction made between "milk for
   babes" and "strong meat" for those "of full age," and between speaking
   to "carnal" and to "spiritual" hearers. [397] 97 But this distinction
   has no reference to public worship, and Justin Martyr, in his first
   Apology, addressed to a heathen emperor, describes the celebration of
   baptism and the eucharist without the least reserve. Others derive the
   institution from the sacerdotal and hierarchical spirit which appeared
   in the latter part of the second century, and which no doubt favored
   and strengthened it; [398] 98 still others, from the Greek and Roman
   mystery worship, which would best explain many expressions and
   formulas, together with all sorts of unscriptural pedantries connected
   with these mysteries. [399] 99 Yet the first motive must be sought
   rather in an opposition to heathenism; to wit, in the feeling of the
   necessity of guarding the sacred transactions of Christianity, the
   embodiment of its deepest truths, against profanation in the midst of a
   hostile world, according to Matt. 7:6; especially when after Hadrian,
   perhaps even from the time of Nero, those transactions came to be so
   shamefully misunderstood and slandered. To this must be added a proper
   regard for modesty and decency in the administration of adult baptism
   by immersion. Finally--and this is the chief cause--the institution of
   the order of catechumens led to a distinction of half-Christians and
   full-Christians, exoteric and esoteric, and this distinction gradually
   became established in the liturgy. The secret discipline was therefore
   a temporary, educational and liturgical expedient of the ante-Nicene
   age. The catechumenate and the division of the acts of worship grew
   together and declined to, together. With the disappearance of adult
   catechumens, or with the general use of infant baptism and the union of
   church and state, disappeared also the secret discipline in the sixth
   century: "cessante causa cessat effectus."

   The Eastern church, however, has retained in her liturgies to this day
   the ancient form for the dismission of catechumens, the special prayers
   for them, the designation of the sacraments as "mysteries," and the
   partial celebration of the mass behind the veil; though she also has
   for centuries had no catechumens in the old sense of the word, that is,
   adult heathen or Jewish disciples preparing for baptism, except in rare
   cases of exception, or on missionary ground.

   [391] Leitourgia ton katechoumenon, Missa Catechumenorum. The name
   missa (from which our mass is derived) occurs first in Augustin and in
   the acts of the council of Carthage, a.d. 398. it arose from the
   formula of dismission at the close of each part of the service, and is
   equivalent to missio, dismissio. Augustin (Serm. 49, c. 8): "Take
   notice, after the sermon the dismissal (missa) of the catechumens takes
   place; the faithful will remain." Afterwards missa came to designate
   exclusively the communion service. In the Greek church leitourgia or
   litourgia, service, is the precise equivalent for missa.

   the Manichaeans, who carried the notion of mystery in the sacrament
   much further than the Catholics.

   primitive revelation, were propagated in the Greek mysteries.

   § 68. Celebration of the Eucharist.

   The celebration of the Eucharist or holy communion with appropriate
   prayers of the faithful was the culmination of Christian worship. [400]
   00 Justin Martyr gives us the following description, which still
   bespeaks the primitive simplicity: [401] 01 "After the prayers [of the
   catechumen worship] we greet one another with the brotherly kiss. Then
   bread and a cup with water and wine are handed to the president
   (bishop) of the brethren. He receives them, and offers praise, glory,
   and thanks to the Father of all, through the name of the Son and the
   Holy Spirit, for these his gifts. When he has ended the prayers and
   thanksgiving, the whole congregation responds: 'Amen.' For 'Amen' in
   the Hebrew tongue means: 'Be it so.' Upon this the deacons, as we call
   them, give to each of those present some of the blessed bread, [402] 02
   and of the wine mingled with water, and carry it to the absent in their
   dwellings. This food is called with us the eucharist, of which none can
   partake, but the believing and baptized, who live according to the
   commands of Christ. For we use these not as common bread and common
   drink; but like as Jesus Christ our Redeemer was made flesh through the
   word of God, and took upon him flesh and blood for our redemption; so
   we are taught, that the nourishment blessed by the word of prayer, by
   which our flesh and blood are nourished by transformation
   (assimilation), is the flesh and blood of the incarnate Jesus."

   Then he relates the institution from the Gospels, and mentions the
   customary collections for the poor.

   We are not warranted in carrying back to this period the full
   liturgical service, which we find prevailing with striking uniformity
   in essentials, though with many variations in minor points, in all
   quarters of the church in the Nicene age. A certain simplicity and
   freedom characterized the period before us. Even the so-called
   Clementine liturgy, in the eighth book of the pseudo-Apostolical
   Constitutions, was probably not composed and written out in this form
   before the fourth century. There is no trace of written liturgies
   during the Diocletian persecution. But the germs (late from the second
   century. The oldest eucharistic prayers have recently come to light in
   the Didache ,which contains three thanksgivings, for the, cup, the
   broken and for all mercies. (chs. 9 and 10.)

   From scattered statements of the ante-Nicene fathers we may gather the
   following view of the eucharistic service as it may have stood in the
   middle of the third century, if not earlier.

   The communion was a regular and the most solemn part of the Sunday
   worship; or it was the worship of God in the stricter sense, in which
   none but full members of the church could engage. In many places and by
   many Christians it was celebrated even daily, after apostolic
   precedent, and according to the very common mystical interpretation of
   the fourth petition of the Lord's prayer. [403] 03 The service began,
   after the dismission of the catechumens, with the kiss of peace, given
   by the men to men, and by the women to women, in token of mutual
   recognition as members of one redeemed family in the midst of a
   heartless and loveless world. It was based upon apostolic precedent,
   and is characteristic of the childlike simplicity, and love and joy of
   the early Christians. [404] 04 The service proper consisted of two
   principal acts: the oblation, [405] 05 or presenting of the offerings
   of the congregation by the deacons for the ordinance itself, and for
   the benefit of the clergy and the poor; and the communion, or partaking
   of the consecrated elements. In the oblation the congregation at the
   same time presented itself as a living thank-offering; as in the
   communion it appropriated anew in faith the sacrifice of Christ, and
   united itself anew with its Head. Both acts were accompanied and
   consecrated by prayer and songs of praise.

   In the prayers we must distinguish, first, the general thanksgiving
   (the eucharist in the strictest sense of the word) for all the natural
   and spiritual gifts of God, commonly ending with the seraphic hymn,
   Isa. 6:3; secondly, the prayer of consecration, or the invocation of
   the Holy Spirit [406] 06 upon the people and the elements, usually
   accompanied by the recital of the words of institution and the Lord's
   Prayer; and finally, the general intercessions for all classes,
   especially for the believers, on the ground of the sacrifice of Christ
   on the cross for the salvation of the world. The length and order of
   the prayers, however, were not uniform; nor the position of the Lord's
   Prayer, which sometimes took the place of the prayer of consecration,
   being reserved for the prominent part of the service. Pope Gregory I.
   says that it "was the custom of the Apostles to consecrate the oblation
   only by the Lord's Prayer." The congregation responded from time to
   time, according to the ancient Jewish and the apostolic usage, with an
   audible "Amen, "or "Kyrie eleison." The "Sursum corda," also, as an
   incitement to devotion, with the response, "Habemus ad Dominum,"
   appears at least as early as Cyprian's time, who expressly alludes to
   it, and in all the ancient liturgies. The prayers were spoken, not read
   from a book. But extemporaneous prayer naturally assumes a fixed form
   by constant repetition.

   The elements were common or leavened bread [407] 07 (except among the
   Ebionites, who, like the later Roman church from the seventh century,
   used unleavened bread), and wine mingled with water. This mixing was a
   general custom in antiquity, but came now to have various mystical
   meanings attached to it. The elements were placed in the hands (not in
   the mouth) of each communicant by the clergy who were present, or,
   according to Justin, by the deacons alone, amid singing of psalms by
   the congregation (Psalm 34), with the words: "The body of Christ;" "The
   blood of Christ, the cup of life;" to each of which the recipient
   responded "Amen." [408] 08 The whole congregation thus received the
   elements, standing in the act. [409] 09 Thanksgiving and benediction
   concluded the celebration.

   After the public service the deacons carried the consecrated elements
   to the sick and to the confessors in prison. Many took portions of the
   bread home with them, to use in the family at morning prayer. This
   domestic communion was practised particularly in North Africa, and
   furnishes the first example of a communio sub una specie. In the same
   country, in Cyprian's time, we find the custom of infant communion
   (administered with wine alone), which was justified from John 6:53, and
   has continued in the Greek (and Russian) church to this day, though
   irreconcilable with the apostle's requisition of a preparatory
   examination (1 Cor. 11:28).

   At first the communion was joined with a love feast, and was then
   celebrated in the evening, in memory of the last supper of Jesus with
   his disciples. But so early as the beginning of the second century
   these two exercises were separated, and the communion was placed in the
   morning, the love feast in the evening, except on certain days of
   special observance. [410] 10 Tertullian gives a detailed description of
   the Agape in refutation of the shameless calumnies of the heathens.
   [411] 11 But the growth of the churches and the rise of manifold abuses
   led to the gradual disuse, and in the fourth century even to the formal
   prohibition of the Agape, which belonged in fact only to the childhood
   and first love of the church. It was a family feast, where rich and
   poor, master and slave met on the same footing, partaking of a simple
   meal, hearing reports from distant congregations, contributing to the
   necessities of suffering brethren, and encouraging each other in their
   daily duties and trials. Augustin describes his mother Monica as going
   to these feasts with a basket full of provisions and distributing them.

   The communion service has undergone many changes in the course of time,
   but still substantially survives with all its primitive vitality and
   solemnity in all churches of Christendom,--a perpetual memorial of
   Christ's atoning sacrifice and saving love to the human race. Baptism
   and the Lord's Supper are institutions which proclaim from day to day
   the historic Christ, and can never be superseded by contrivances of
   human ingenuity and wisdom.

   the thirteenth century, and was then transferred to the close of the
   service or exchanged for a mere form of words: Pax tibi et ecclesiae.
   In the Russian church the clergy kiss each other during the recital of
   the Nicene Creed to show the nominal union of orthodoxy and charity (so
   often divided). In the Coptic church the primitive custom is still in
   force, and in some small Protestant sects it has been revived.

   [405] Prosphora.

   [406] Epiklesis tou Pn. Hag. Irenaeus derives this invocatio Spiritus
   S., as well as the oblation and the thanksgiving, from apostolic
   instruction. See the 2nd fragment, in Stieren, I. 854. It appears in
   all the Greek liturgies. In the Liturgia Jacobi it reads thus:Kai
   exaposteilon eph' hemas kai epi ta proskeimena dora tauta to Pneuma sou
   to panagion, to kurion kai zoopoion ... hina ... agiase kai poiese ton
   men arton touton soma hagion tou Christou sou, kai to poterion touto
   aima timion tou Chr. sou, hina genetai pasi tois ex hauton
   metalambanousin eis haphesin hamartion kai eis zoen aionion, eis
   hagiasmon psuchon kai somaton, eis kartophorian ergon agathon.

   [407] Koinos artos, says; Justin, while in view of its sacred import be
   calls it also uncommon bread and drink. The use of leavened or
   unleavened bread became afterwards, as is well known, a point of
   controversy between the Roman and Greek churches.

   [408] This simplest form of distribution, "Soma Christou," and "Aima
   Chr., poterion zoes" occurs in the Clementine liturgy of the Apostolic
   Constitutions, VIII. 13, and seems to be the oldest. The Didache gives
   no form of distribution.

   [409] The standing posture of the congregation during the principal
   prayers, and in the communion itself, seems to have been at first
   universal. For this was, indeed, the custom always on the day of the
   resurrection in distinction from Friday ("stantes oramus, quod est
   signunt resurrectionis," says Augustin) besides, the communion was, in
   the highest sense, a ceremony of festivity and joy; and finally, Justin
   expressly observes: "Then we all stand up to prayer." After the twelfth
   century, kneeling in receiving the elements became general, and passed
   from the Catholic church into the Lutheran and Anglican, while most of
   the Reformed churches; returned to the original custom of standing.
   Sitting in the communion was first introduced after the Reformation by
   the Presbyterian church of Scotland, and is very common in the United
   States the deacons or elders banding the bread and cup to the
   communicants in their pews. A curious circumstance is the sitting
   posture of the Pope in the communion, which Dean Stanley regards as a
   relic of the reclining or recumbent posture of the primitive disciples.
   See his Christ. Instit. p. 250 sqq.

   [410] On Maundy-Thursday, according, to Augustin's testimony, the
   communion continued to be celebrated in the evening, "tanquam ad
   insigniorem commemorationem." So on high feasts, as Christmas night,
   Epiphany, and Easter Eve, and in fasting seasons. See Ambrose, Serm.
   viii. in Ps. 118.

   [411] Apol. c.39: "About the modest supper-room of the Christians alone
   a great ado is made. Our feast explains itself by its name. The Greeks
   call it love. Whatever it costs, our outlay in the name of piety is
   gain, since with the good things of the feast we benefit the needy, not
   as it is with you, do parasites aspire to the glory of satisfying their
   licentious propensities, selling themselves for a belly-feast to all
   disgraceful treatment-but as it is with God himself, a peculiar respect
   is shown to the lowly. If the object of our feast be good, in the light
   of that consider its further regulations. As it is an act of religious
   service, it permits no vileness or immodesty. The participants, before
   reclining, taste first of prayer to God. As much is eaten as satisfies
   the cravings of hunger; as much is drunk as befits the chaste. They say
   it is enough, as those who remember that even during the night they
   have to worship God; they talk as those who know that the Lord is one
   of their auditors. After the washing of hands and the bringing in of
   lights, each is asked to stand forth and sing, as he can, a hymn to
   God, either one from the holy Scriptures or one of his own composing-a
   proof of the measure of our drinking. As the feast commenced with
   prayer, so with prayer it closed. We go from it, not like troops of
   mischief-doers, nor bands of roamers, nor to break out into licentious
   acts, but to have aq ruucli care of our modesty and chastity as if we
   had been at a school of virtue rather than a banquet." (Translation
   from the "Ante-Nicene Library ").

   § 69. The Doctrine of the Eucharist.

   Literature. See the works quoted, vol. I. 472, by Waterland (Episc. d.
   1740), Döllinger (R. Cath., 1826; since 1870 Old Cath.), Ebrard
   (Calvinistic, 1845), Nevin (Calvinistic, 1846), Kahnis (Luth. 1851, but
   changed his view in his Dogmatik), E. B. Pusey (high Anglic., 1855),
   Rückert (Rationalistic, 1856), Vogan (high Anglic., 1871), Harrison
   (Evang. Angl., 1871), Stanley (Broad Church Episc., 1881), Gude
   (Lutheran, 1887).

   On the Eucharistic doctrine of Ignatius, Justin, Irenaeus, and
   Tertullian, there are also special treatises by Thiersch (1841),
   Semisch (1842), Engelhardt (1842), Baur (1839 and 1857), Steitz (1864),
   and others.

   (N. Y. 1881) p. 73 sqq.

   The doctrine concerning the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, not coming
   into special discussion, remained indefinite and obscure. The ancient
   church made more account of the worthy participation of the ordinance
   than of the logical apprehension of it. She looked upon it as the
   holiest mystery of the Christian worship, and accordingly celebrated it
   with the deepest devotion, without inquiring into the mode of Christ's
   presence, nor into the relation of the sensible signs to his flesh and
   blood. It is unhistorical to carry any of the later theories back into
   this age; although it has been done frequently in the apologetic and
   polemic discussion of this subject.

   1. The Eucharist as a Sacrament.

   The Didache of the Apostles contains eucharistic prayers, but no theory
   of the eucharist. Ignatius speaks of this sacrament in two passages,
   only by way of allusion, but in very strong, mystical terms, calling it
   the flesh of our crucified and risen Lord Jesus Christ, and the
   consecrated bread a medicine of immortality and an antidote of
   spiritual death. [412] 12 This view, closely connected with his
   high-churchly tendency in general, no doubt involves belief in the real
   presence, and ascribes to the holy Supper an effect on spirit and body
   at once, with reference to the future resurrection, but is still
   somewhat obscure, and rather an expression of elevated feeling than a
   logical definition.

   The same may be said of Justin Martyr, when he compares the descent of
   Christ into the consecrated elements to his incarnation for our
   redemption. [413] 13

   Irenaeus says repeatedly, in combating the Gnostic Docetism, [414] 14
   that bread and wine in the sacrament become, by the presence of the
   Word of God, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, the body and blood of
   Christ and that the receiving of there strengthens soul and body (the
   germ of the resurrection body) unto eternal life. Yet this would hardly
   warrant our ascribing either transubstantiation or consubstantiation to
   Irenaeus. For in another place he calls the bread and wine, after
   consecration, "antitypes," implying the continued distinction of their
   substance from the body and blood of Christ. [415] 15 This expression
   in itself, indeed, might be understood as merely contrasting here the
   upper, as the substance, with the Old Testament passover, its type; as
   Peter calls baptism the antitype of the saving water of the flood.
   [416] 16 But the connection, and the usus loquendi of the earlier Greek
   fathers, require us to take the term antitype, a the sense of type, or,
   more precisely, as the antithesis of archetype. The bread and wine
   represent and exhibit the body and blood of Christ as the archetype,
   and correspond to them, as a copy to the original. In exactly the same
   sense it is said in Heb. 9:24--comp. 8:5--that the earthly sanctuary is
   the antitype, that is the copy, of the heavenly archetype. Other Greek
   fathers also, down to the fifth century, and especially the author of
   the Apostolical Constitutions, call the consecrated elements
   "antitypes" (sometimes, like Theodoretus, "types") of the body and
   blood of Christ. [417] 17

   A different view, approaching nearer the Calvinistic or Reformed, we
   meet with among the African fathers. Tertullian makes the words of
   institution: Hoc est corpus meum, equivalent to: figura corporis mei,
   to prove, in opposition to Marcion's docetism, the reality of the body
   of Jesus--a mere phantom being capable of no emblematic representation
   [418] 18 This involves, at all events, an essential distinction between
   the consecrated elements and the body and blood of Christ in the
   Supper. Yet Tertullian must not be understood as teaching a merely
   symbolical presence of Christ; for in other places he speaks, according
   to his general realistic turn, in almost materialistic language of an
   eating of the body of Christ, and extends the participation even to the
   body of the receiver. [419] 19 Cyprian likewise appears to favor a
   symbolical interpretation of the words of institution, yet not so
   clearly. The idea of the real presence would have much better suited
   his sacerdotal conception of the ministry. In the customary mixing of
   the wine with water he sees a type of the union of Christ with his
   church, [420] 20 and, on the authority of John 6:53, holds the
   communion of the Supper indispensable to salvation. The idea of a
   sacrifice comes out very boldly in Cyprian.

   The Alexandrians are here, as usual, decidedly spiritualistic. Clement
   twice expressly calls the wine a symbol or an allegory of the blood of
   Christ, and says, that the communicant receives not the physical, but
   the spiritual blood, the life, of Christ; as, indeed, the blood is the
   life of the body. Origen distinguishes still more definitely the
   earthly elements from the heavenly bread of life, and makes it the
   whole design of the supper to feed the soul with the divine word. [421]
   21 Applying his unsound allegorical method here, he makes the bread
   represent the Old Testament, the wine the New, and the breaking of the
   bread the multiplication of the divine word! But these were rather
   private views for the initiated, and can hardly be taken as presenting
   the doctrine of the Alexandrian church.

   We have, therefore, among the ante-Nicene fathers, three different
   views, an Oriental, a North-African, and an Alexandrian. The first
   view, that of Ignatius and Irenaeus, agrees most nearly with the
   mystical character of the celebration of the eucharist, and with the
   catholicizing features of the age.

   2. The Eucharist as a Sacrifice.

   This point is very important in relation to the doctrine, and still
   more important in relation to the cultus and life, of the ancient
   church. The Lord's Supper was universally regarded not only as a
   sacrament, but also as a sacrifice, [422] 22 the true and eternal
   sacrifice of the new covenant, superseding all the provisional and
   typical sacrifices of the old; taking the place particularly of the
   passover, or the feast of the typical redemption from Egypt. This
   eucharistic sacrifice, however, the ante-Nicene fathers conceived not
   as an unbloody repetition of the atoning sacrifice of Christ on the
   cross, but simply as a commemoration and renewed appropriation of that
   atonement, and, above all, a thank-offering of the whole church for all
   the favors of God in creation and redemption. Hence the current name
   itself--eucharist; which denoted in the first place the prayer of
   thanksgiving, but afterwards the whole rite. [423] 23

   The consecrated elements were regarded in a twofold light, as
   representing at once the natural and the spiritual gifts of God, which
   culminated in the self-sacrifice of Christ on the cross. Hence the
   eucharistic prayer, like that connected with the typical passover,
   related at the same time to creation and redemption, which were the
   more closely joined in the mind of the church for their dualistic
   separation by the Gnostics. The earthly gifts of bread and wine were
   taken as types and pledges of the heavenly gifts of the same God, who
   has both created and redeemed the world.

   Upon this followed the idea of the self-sacrifice of the worshipper
   himself, the sacrifice of renewed self-consecration to Christ in return
   for his sacrifice on the cross, and also the sacrifice of charity to
   the poor. Down to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the eucharistic
   elements were presented as a thank-offering by the members of the
   congregation themselves, and the remnants went to the clergy and he
   poor. In these gifts the people yielded themselves as a priestly race
   and a living thank-offering to God, to whom they owed all the blessings
   alike of providence and of grace. In later times the priest alone
   offered the sacrifice. But even the Roman Missal retains a recollection
   of the ancient custom in the plural form, "We offer," and in the
   sentence: "All you, both brethren and sisters, pray that my sacrifice
   and your sacrifice, which is equally yours as well as mine, may be meat
   for the Lord."

   This subjective offering of the whole congregation on the ground of the
   objective atoning sacrifice of Christ is the real centre of the ancient
   Christian worship, and particularly of the communion. It thus differed
   both from the later Catholic mass, which has changed the thank-offering
   into a sin-offering, the congregational offering into a priest
   offering; and from the common Protestant cultus, which, in opposition
   to the Roman mass, has almost entirely banished the idea of sacrifice
   from the celebration of the Lord's Supper, except in the customary
   offerings for the poor.

   The writers of the second century keep strictly within the limits of
   the notion of a congregational thank-offering. Thus Justin says
   expressly, prayers and thanksgivings alone are the true and acceptable
   sacrifices, which the Christians offer. Irenaeus has been brought as a
   witness for the Roman doctrine, only on the ground of a false reading.
   [424] 24 The African fathers, in the third century, who elsewhere
   incline to the symbolical interpretation of the words of institution,
   are the first to approach on this point the later Roman Catholic idea
   of a sin-offering; especially Cyprian, the steadfast advocate of
   priesthood and of episcopal authority. [425] 25 The ideas of
   priesthood, sacrifice, and altar, are intimately connected, and a
   Judaizing or paganizing conception of one must extend to all.

   plainly very near that of OEcolampadius, who puts the figure in the

   But the Zwinglian view, which puts the figure in theesti. instead of
   the predicate, appears also in Tertullian, Adv. Marc. I. 14, in the
   words: "Panem qui ipsum corpus suum repraesentat." The two
   interpretations are only grammatical modifications of the same
   symbolical theory.

   which should probably be translated: is to be understood by the bread
   (not contained in the bread).

   Comp. IV. 17, § 6: "Per Jes. Christum offert ecclesia." Stieren reads

   § 70. The Celebration of Baptism.

   The Lit. see in vol. I. § 54, p. 465 sq., especially Wall and Höfling.
   On the archaeology of baptism see Bingham's Antiquities, Augusti's
   Denkwürdigkeiten, the first vol. of Binterim, and the art. Baptism in
   Smith and Cheetham, I. 155-172. Also Schaff, on the Didache (1885), p.
   29-56. For pictorial illustrations see the monumental works of Cav. de
   Rossi, Garrucci, Roller, on the catacombs, and Schaff, l.c.

   The "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" (ch. 7,) enjoins baptism, after
   catechetical instruction, in these words: "Baptize into the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost in living (running)
   water. But if thou hast not living water, baptize into other water; and
   if thou canst not in cold, then in warm. But if thou hast neither, pour
   water upon the head thrice, into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost."

   Justin Martyr gives the following account of baptism: [426] 26 "Those
   who are convinced of the truth of our doctrine, and have promised to
   live according to it, are exhorted to prayer, fasting and repentance
   for past sins; we praying and fasting with them. Then they are led by
   its to a place where is water, and in this way they are regenerated, as
   we also have been regenerated; that is, they receive the water-bath in
   the name of God, the Father and Ruler of all, and of our Redeemer Jesus
   Christ, and of the Holy Ghost. For Christ says: Except ye be born
   again, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. (John 3:5) Thus,
   from children of necessity and ignorance, we become children of choice
   and of wisdom, and partakers of the forgiveness of former sins .... The
   baptismal bath is called also illumination (photismos) because those
   who receive it are enlightened in the understanding."

   This account may be completed by the following particulars from
   Tertullian and later writers.

   Before the act the candidate was required in a solemn vow to renounce
   the service of the devil, that is, all evil, [427] 27 give himself to
   Christ, and confess the sum of the apostolic faith in God the Father,
   the Son, and Holy Spirit. [428] 28 The Apostles' Creed, therefore, is
   properly the baptismal symbol, as it grew, in fact, out of the
   baptismal formula.

   This act of turning front sin and turning to God, or of repentance and
   faith, on the part of the candidate, was followed by an appropriate
   prayer of the minister, and then by the baptism itself into the triune
   name, with three successive immersions in which the deacons and
   deaconesses assisted. The immersion in thrice dipping the head of the
   candidate who stood nude in the water. [429] 29 Single immersion seems
   to have been introduced by Eunomius about 360, but was condemned on
   pain of degradation, yet it reappeared afterwards in Spain, and Pope
   Gregory I. declared both forms valid, the trine immersion as setting
   forth the Trinity, the single immersion the Unity of the Godhead. [430]
   30 The Eastern church, however, still adheres strictly to the trine
   immersion. [431] 31 Baptism by pouring water from a shell or vessel or
   from the hand on the head of the candidate very early occurs also and
   was probably considered equivalent to immersion. [432] 32 The Didache
   allows pouring in cases of scarcity of water. But afterwards this mode
   was applied only to infirm or sick persons; hence called clinical
   baptism. [433] 33 The validity of this baptism was even doubted by many
   in the third century; and Cyprian wrote in its defence, taking the
   ground that the mode of application of water was a matter of minor
   importance, provided that faith was present in the recipient and
   ministrant. [434] 34 According to ecclesiastical law clinical baptism
   at least incapacitated for the clerical office. [435] 35 Yet the Roman
   bishop Fabian ordained Novatian a presbyter, though he had been
   baptized on a sickbed by aspersion. [436] 36

   Thanksgiving, benediction, and the brotherly kiss concluded the sacred
   ceremony.

   Besides these essential elements of the baptismal rite, we find, so
   early as the third century, several other subordinate usages, which
   have indeed a beautiful symbolical meaning, but, like all redundancies,
   could easily obscure the original simplicity of this sacrament, as it
   appears in Justin Martyr's description. Among these appendages are the
   signing of the cross on the forehead and breast of the subject, as a
   soldier of Christ under the banner of the cross; giving him milk and
   honey (also salt) in token of sonship with God, and citizenship in the
   heavenly Canaan; also the unction of the head, the lighted taper, and
   the white robe.

   Exorcism, or the expulsion of the devil, which is not to be confounded
   with the essential formula of renunciation, was probably practised at
   first only in special cases, as of demoniacal possession. But after the
   council of Carthage, a.d. 256, we find it a regular part of the
   ceremony of baptism, preceding the baptism proper, and in some eases,
   it would seem, several times repeated during the course of catechetical
   instruction. To understand fully this custom, we should remember that
   the early church derived the whole system of heathen idolatry, which it
   justly abhorred as one of the greatest crimes, [437] 37 from the agency
   of Satan. The heathen deities, although they had been eminent men
   during their lives, were, as to their animating principle, identified
   with demons--either fallen angels or their progeny. These demons, as we
   may infer from many passages of Justin, Minucius Felix, Tertullian, and
   others, were believed to traverse the air, to wander over the earth, to
   deceive and torment the race, to take possession of men, to encourage
   sacrifices, to lurk in statues, to speak through the oracles, to direct
   the flights of birds, to work the illusions of enchantment and
   necromancy, to delude the senses by false miracles, to incite
   persecution against Christianity, and, in fact, to sustain the whole
   fabric of heathenism with all its errors and vices. But even these evil
   spirits were Subject to the powerful name of Jesus. Tertullian openly
   challenges the pagan adversaries to bring demoniacs before the
   tribunals, and affirms that the spirits which possessed them, would
   bear witness to the truth of Christianity.

   The institution of sponsors, [438] 38, first mentioned by Tertullian,
   arose no doubt from infant baptism, and was designed to secure
   Christian training, without thereby excusing Christian parents from
   their duty.

   Baptism might be administered at any time, but was commonly connected
   with Easter and Pentecost, and in the East with Epiphany also, to give
   it the greater solemnity. The favorite hour was midnight lit up by
   torches. The men were baptized first, the women afterwards. During the
   week following, the neophytes wore white garments as symbols of their
   purity.

   Separate chapels for baptism, or baptisteries, occur first in the
   fourth century, and many of them still remain in Southern Europe.
   Baptism might be performed in any place, where, as Justin says, "water
   was." Yet Cyprian, in the middle of the third century, and the
   pseudo-Apostolical Constitutions, require the element to be previously
   consecrated, that it may become the vehicle of the purifying energy of
   the Spirit. This corresponded to the consecration of the bread and wine
   in the Lord's Supper, and involved no transformation of the substance.

   fourth century, as we learn from Cyril of Jerusalem, in the vestibule
   of the baptistery, with the face towards the west, and the hand raised
   in the repelling posture, as if Satan were present (hos paronti
   apotassesthe Satana), and was sometimes accompanied with exsufflations,
   or other signs of expulsion of the evil spirit.

   [428] Homologesis, professio. The creed was either said by the
   catechumen after The priest, or confessed in answer to questions, and
   with the face turned eastwards towards the light.

   [429] See the authorities (Quoted in Smith and Cheetham, I. 161, and
   more fully in Augusti.. l.c."Ter mergitamur, " says Tertullian.
   Immersion was very natural in Southern climates. The baptisteries of
   the Nicene age, of which many remain in Asia, Africa, and Southern
   Europe, were built for immersion, and all Oriental churches still
   adhere to this mode. Garrucci (Storia della Arte Cristiana, I. 27)
   says: "Antichissimo e solenne fu il rito d' immergere la persona nell'
   acqua, e tre volte anche it capo, al pronunziare del ministro i tre
   nomi." Schultze (Die Katacomben, p. 136): "Die Taufdarstellungen
   vorkonstantinischer Zeit, deren Zahl sich auf drei beläuft, zeigen
   sämmtlich erwachsene Täuflinge, in zvei FälIen Knabent von etwa zwölf
   Jahren, im dritten Falle einen Jüngling. Der Act wird durch
   Untertauchen vollzogen." Dean Stanley delights in pictorial
   exaggeration of the baptismal immersion in patristic times as
   contrasted with modern sprinkling. "Baptism," he says, "was not only a
   bath, but a plunge--an entire submersion in the deep water, a leap as
   into the rolling sea or the rushing river, where for the moment the
   waves close over the bather's head, and he emerges again as from a
   momentary grave; or it was a shock of a shower-bath--the rush of water
   passed over the whole person from capacious vessels, so as to wrap the
   recipient as within the veil of a splashing cataract. This was the part
   of the ceremony on which the Apostles laid so much stress. It was to
   them like a burial of the old former self and the rising up again of
   the new self."Christian Institutions, (1881), p. 9. See Schaff, l.c. p.
   41 sqq.

   [430] Ep. I. 41 in reply to Leander, bishop of Hispala. Thomas Aquinas
   (Summa Theol., Tom. IV., f. 615, ed. Migne) quotes this letter with
   approval, but gives the preference to trina immersio, as expressing
   "triduum sepulturus Christi et etiam Trinitas personarum."

   [431] The Russian Orthodox Catechism defines baptism as "a sacrament,
   in which a man who believes, having his body thrice plunged in water in
   the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, dies to the
   carnal life of sin, and is born again of the Holy Ghost to a life
   spiritual and holy." In the case of infants the act is usually
   completed by pouring water over the head, the rest of the body being,
   immersed. So I was informed by a Greek priest.

   [432] Pouring or affusion is the present practice of the Roman Catholic
   church. It is first found on pictures in the Roman catacombs, one of
   which De Rossi assigns to the second century (in the cemetry of
   Calixtus). "It is remarkable that in almost all the earliest
   representations of baptism that have been preserved to us, this [the
   pouring of water from vessels over the body] is the special act
   represented." Marriott in Smith and Cheetham, I. 168. But the art of
   painting can only represent a part of the act, not the whole process;
   in all the Catacomb pictures the candidate stands with the feet in
   water, and is undressed as for immersion, total or partial.

   [433] "Baptismus clinicorum" (klinikoi, from kl'inebed) Clinicus or
   grabbatarius designated one who was baptized on the sick bed.

   [434] Ep. 69 (al. 75), ad Magnum. He answered the question as best be
   could in the absence of any ecclesiastical decision at that time. This
   Epistle, next to Tertullian's opposition to infant baptism, is the
   oldest document in the controversial baptismal literature. Cyprian
   quotes (ch. 12) several passages from the O.T. where "sprinkling" is
   spoken of as an act of cleansing (Ez. 36:25, 26; Num. 8:5-7; 19:8-13),
   and then concludes: "Whence it appears that sprinkling also of water
   prevails equally with the salutary washing (adspersionem quoque aquae
   instar salutaris lavacri obtinere); and that when this is done in the
   church where the faith both of the receiver and the giver is sound (ubi
   sit et accipieatis et dantis fides integra), all things hold and may be
   consummated and perfected by the majesty of the Lord and by the truth
   of faith." But in the same Ep., Cyprian denies the validity of
   heretical and schismatic baptism in any form. See below, §74.

   [435] The twelfth canon of the Council of Neo-Caesarea (after 314)
   ordains: "Whosoever has received clinical baptism cannot be promoted to
   the priesthood, because his [profession of] faith was not from free
   choice, but from necessity (ex anankes ,fear of death), unless he,
   excel afterwards in zeal and faith, or there is a deficiency of [able]
   men." This canon passed into the Corpus jur. can. c. 1 Dist. 57. See
   Hefele, Conciliengesch, I. 249 (2nd ed.).

   [436] Pouring and sprinkling were still exceptional in the ninth
   century according to Walafrid Strabo (De Rel. Eccl., c. 26), but they
   made gradual progress with the spread of infant baptism, as the most
   convenient mode, especially in Northern climates, and came into common
   use in the West at the end of the thirteenth century, Thomas Aquinas
   (d. 1274) says, that although it may be safer to baptize by immersion,
   yet pouring and sprinkling are also allowable (Summa Theol. P. III. Qu.
   LXVI. De Rapt. art. 7: in Migne's ed. Tom. IV. fol. 614): "Si totum
   corpus aquâ non possit perfundi propter aquae paucitatem, vel propter
   aliquam aliam causam, opportet caput perfundere, in quo manifestatur
   principium animalis vitae. In Ireland aspersion seems to have been
   practiced very early along with immersion." Trine immersion, with the
   alternative of aspersion, is ordered in the earliest extant Irish
   Baptismal Office, in the composition of which, however, Roman influence
   is strongly marked." F. E. Warren, The Liturgy and Ritual of the CeItic
   Church, Oxford (Clarendon Press), 1881, p. 65. Prof. Norman Fox and
   other Baptist writer., ;, think that " neither infant baptism nor the
   use of pouring and sprinkling for baptism would ever have been thought
   of but for the superstitious idea that baptism was necessary to
   salvation."But this idea prevailed among the fathers and in the Greek
   church fully as much as in the Roman, while it is rejected in most
   Protestant churches where sprinkling is practiced. Luther sought to
   restore immersion, but without effect. Calvin took a similar view of
   the subject as Thomas Aquinas, but he went farther and declared the
   mode of application to be a matter of indifference, Inst. IV. ch. 15,
   §19: " Whether the person who is baptized be wholly immersed (mergatur
   totus)and whether thrice or once, or whether water be only poured
   (infusa)or sprinkled upon him (aspergatur), is of no importance
   (minimum refert): but this should be left free to the churches
   according to the difference of countries. Yet the very word baptize
   signifies to immerse (mergere); and it is certain that immersion was
   the practice of the ancient church." Most Protestants agree with
   Calvin, except the Baptists, who revived the ancient practice, but only
   in part (single instead of trine immersion), and without the patristic
   ideas of baptismal regeneration, infant baptism, and the necessity of
   baptism for salvation. They regard baptism as a mere symbol which
   exhibits the fact that regeneration and conversion have already taken
   place.

   [437] Tertullian calls it "principals crimen generis humani" (De idol.
   c. 1), and Cyprian, "summum delictum" (Ep. x.).

   § 71. The Doctrine of Baptism.

   This ordinance was regarded in the ancient church as the sacrament of
   the new birth or regeneration, and as the solemn rite of initiation
   into the Christian Church, admitting to all her benefits and committing
   to all her obligations. It was supposed to be preceded, in the case of
   adults, by instruction on the part of the church, and by repentance and
   faith (i.e. conversion) on the part of the candidate, and to complete
   and seal the spiritual process of regeneration, the old man being
   buried, and the new man arising from the watery grave. Its effect
   consists in the forgiveness of sins and the communication of the Holy
   Spirit. Justin calls baptism "the water-bath for the forgiveness of
   sins and regeneration," and "the bath of conversion and the knowledge
   of God." It is often called also illumination, spiritual circumcision,
   anointing, sealing, gift of grace, symbol of redemption, death of sins,
   &c. [439] 39 Tertullian describes its effect thus: "When the soul comes
   to faith, and becomes transformed through regeneration by water and
   power from above, it discovers, after the veil of the old corruption is
   taken away, its whole light. It is received into the fellowship of the
   Holy Spirit; and the soul, which unites itself to the Holy Spirit, is
   followed by the body." He already leans towards the notion of a magical
   operation of the baptismal water. Yet the subjective condition of
   repentance and faith was universally required. Baptism was not only an
   act of God, but at the same time the most solemn surrender of man to
   God, a vow for life and death, to live henceforth only to Christ and
   his people. The keeping of this vow was the condition of continuance in
   the church; the breaking of it must be followed either by repentance or
   excommunication.

   From John 3:5 and Mark 16:16, Tertullian and other fathers argued the
   necessity of baptism to salvation. Clement of Alexandria supposed, with
   the Roman Hermas and others, that even the saints of the Old Testament
   were baptized in Hades by Christ or the apostles. But exception was
   made in favor of the bloody baptism of martyrdom as compensating the
   want of baptism with water; and this would lead to the evangelical
   principle, that not the omission, but only the contempt of the
   sacrament is damning. [440] 40

   The effect of baptism, however, was thought to extend only to sins
   committed before receiving it. Hence the frequent postponement of the
   sacrament, [441] 41 which Tertullian very earnestly recommends, though
   he censures it when accompanied with moral levity and presumption.
   [442] 42 Many, like Constantine the Great, put it off to the bed of
   sickness and of death. They preferred the risk of dying unbaptized to
   that of forfeiting forever the baptismal grace. Death-bed baptisms were
   then what death-bed repentances are now.

   But then the question arose, how the forgiveness of sins committed
   after baptism could be obtained? This is the starting point of the
   Roman doctrine of the sacrament of penance. Tertullian [443] 43 and
   Cyprian [444] 44 were the first to suggest that satisfaction must be
   made for such sins by self-imposed penitential exercises and good
   works) such as prayers and almsgiving. Tertullian held seven gross
   sins, which he denoted mortal sins, to be unpardonable after baptism,
   and to be left to the uncovenanted mercies of God; but the Catholic
   church took a milder view, and even received back the adulterers and
   apostates on their public repentance.

   Notes

   In reviewing the patristic doctrine of baptism which was sanctioned by
   the Greek and Roman, and, with some important modifications, also by
   the Lutheran and Anglican churches, we should remember that during the
   first three centuries, and even in the age of Constantine, adult
   baptism was the rule, and that the actual conversion of the candidate
   was required as a condition before administering the sacrament (as is
   still the case on missionary ground). Hence in preceding catechetical
   instruction, the renunciation of the devil, and the profession of
   faith. But when the same high view is applied without qualification to
   infant baptism, we are confronted at once with the difficulty that
   infants cannot comply with this condition. They may be regenerated
   (this being an act of God), but they cannot be converted, i.e. they
   cannot repent and believe, nor do they need repentance, having not yet
   committed any actual transgression. Infant baptism is an act of
   consecration, and looks to subsequent instruction and personal
   conversion, as a condition to full membership of the church. Hence
   confirmation came in as a supplement to infant baptism.

   The strict Roman Catholic dogma, first clearly enunciated by St.
   Augustin though with reluctant heart and in the mildest form, assigns
   all unbaptized infants to hell on the round of Adam's sin and the
   absolute necessity of baptism for salvation. A dogma horribile, but
   falsum. Christ, who is the truth, blessed unbaptized infants, and
   declared: "To such belongs again kingdom of heaven. The Augsburg
   Confession (Art. IX.) still teaches against the Anabaptists: quod
   baptismus sit necessarius ad salutem," but the leading Lutheran divines
   reduce the absolute necessity of baptism to a relative or ordinary
   necessity; and the Reformed churches, under the influence of Calvin's
   teaching went further by making salvation depend upon divine election,
   not upon the sacrament, and now generally hold to the salvation of all
   infants dying in infancy. The Second Scotch Confession (a.d. 1580) was
   the first to declare its abhorrence of "the cruel [popish] judgment
   against infants departing without the sacrament," and the doctrine of
   "the absolute necessity of baptism."

   1. The catechumenate or preparation for baptism was a very important
   institution of the early church. It dates substantially from apostolic
   times. Theophilus was "instructed" in the main facts of the gospel
   history; and Apollos was "instructed" in the way of the Lord. [445] 45
   As the church was set in the midst of a heathen world, and addressed
   herself in her missionary preaching in the first instance to the adult
   generation, she saw the necessity of preparing the susceptible for
   baptism by special instruction under teachers called "catechists," who
   were generally presbyters and deacons. [446] 46 The catechumenate
   preceded baptism (of adults); whereas, at a later period, after the
   general introduction of infant baptism, it followed. It was, on the one
   hand, a bulwark of the church against unworthy members; on the other, a
   bridge from the world to the church, a Christian novitiate, to lead
   beginners forward to maturity. The catechumens or hearers [447] 47 were
   regarded not as unbelievers, but as half-Christians, and were
   accordingly allowed to attend all the exercises of worship, except the
   celebration of the sacraments. They embraced people of all ranks, ages,
   and grades of culture, even philosophers, statesmen, and
   rhetoricians,--Justin, Athenagoras, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian,
   Cyprian, Arnobius, Lactantius, who all embraced Christianity in their
   adult years.

   The Didache contains in the first six chapters, a high-toned moral
   catechism preparatory to baptism, based chiefly on the Sermon on the
   Mount.

   There was but one or at most two classes of Catechumens. The usual
   division into three (or four) classes rests on confusion with the
   classes of Penitents. [448] 48

   The catechetical school of Alexandria was particularly renowned for its
   highly learned character.

   The duration of this catechetical instruction was fixed sometimes at
   two years [449] 49 sometimes at three, [450] 50 but might be shortened
   according to circumstances. Persons of decent moral character and
   general intelligence were admitted to baptism without delay. The
   Councils allow immediate admission in cases of sickness.

   2. Confirmation [451] 51 was originally closely connected with baptism,
   as its positive complement, and was performed by the imposition of
   hands, and the anointing of several parts of the body with fragrant
   balsam-oil, the chrism, as it was called. These acts were the medium of
   the communication of the Holy Spirit, and of consecration to the
   spiritual priesthood. Later, however, it came to be separated from
   baptism, especially in the case of infants, and to be regarded as a
   sacrament by itself. Cyprian is the first to distinguish the baptism
   with water and the baptism with the Spirit as two sacraments; yet this
   term, sacrament, was used as yet very indefinitely, and applied to all
   sacred doctrines and rites.

   The Western church, after the third century, restricted the power of
   confirmation to bishops, on the authority of Acts 8:17; they alone, as
   the successors of the apostles, being able to impart the Holy Ghost.
   The Greek church extended this function to priests and deacons. The
   Anglican church retains the Latin practice. Confirmation or some form
   of solemn reception into full communion on personal profession of
   faith, after proper instruction, was regarded as a necessary supplement
   to infant baptism, and afterwards as a special sacrament.

   1867, pp. 239-267.

   While the church was still a missionary institution in the midst of a
   heathen world, infant baptism was overshadowed by the baptism of adult
   proselytes; as, in the following periods, upon the union of church and
   state, the order was reversed. At that time, too, there could, of
   course, be no such thing, even on the part of Christian parents, as a
   compulsory baptism, which dates from Justinian's reign, and which
   inevitably leads to the profanation of the sacrament. Constantine sat
   among the fathers at the great Council of Nicaea, and gave legal effect
   to its decrees, and yet put off his baptism to his deathbed. The cases
   of Gregory of Nazianzum, St. Chrysostom, and St. Augustin, who had
   mothers of exemplary piety, and yet were not baptized before early
   manhood, show sufficiently that considerable freedom prevailed in this
   respect even in the Nicene and post-Nicene ages. Gregory of Nazianzum
   gives the advice to put off the baptism of children, where there is no
   danger of death, to their third year. [452] 52

   At the same time it seems an almost certain fact, though by many
   disputed, that, with the baptism of converts, the optional baptism of
   the children of Christian parents in established congregations, comes
   down from the apostolic age. [453] 53 Pious parents would naturally
   feel a desire to consecrate their offspring from the very beginning to
   the service of the Redeemer, and find a precedent in the ordinance of
   circumcision. This desire would be strengthened in cases of sickness by
   the prevailing notion of the necessity of baptism for salvation. Among
   the fathers, Tertullian himself not excepted--for he combats only its
   expediency--there is not a single voice against the lawfulness and the
   apostolic origin of infant baptism. No time can be fixed at which it
   was first introduced. Tertullian suggests, that it was usually based on
   the invitation of Christ: "Suffer the little children to come unto me,
   and forbid them not." The usage of sponsors, to which Tertullian
   himself bears witness, although he disapproves of it, and still more,
   the almost equally ancient abuse of infant communion, imply the
   existence of infant baptism. Heretics also practised it, and were not
   censured for it.

   The apostolic fathers make, indeed, no mention of it. But their silence
   proves nothing; for they hardly touch upon baptism at all, except
   Hermas, and he declares it necessary to salvation, even for the
   patriarchs in Hades (therefore, as we may well infer, for children
   also). Justin Martyr expressly teaches the capacity of all men for
   spiritual circumcision by baptism; and his "all" can with the less
   propriety be limited, since he is here speaking to a Jew. [454] 54 He
   also says that many old men and women of sixty and seventy years of age
   have been from childhood disciples of Christ. [455] 55 Polycarp was
   eighty-six years a Christian, and must have been baptized in early
   youth. According to Irenaeus, his pupil and a faithful bearer of
   Johannean tradition, Christ passed through all the stages of life, to
   sanctify them all, and came to redeem, through himself, "all who
   through him are born again unto God, sucklings, children, boys, youths,
   and adults." [456] 56 This profound view seems to involve an
   acknowledgment not only of the idea of infant baptism, but also of the
   practice of it; for in the mind of Irenaeus and the ancient church
   baptism and regeneration were intimately connected and almost
   identified. [457] 57 In an infant, in fact, any regeneration but
   through baptism cannot be easily conceived. A moral and spiritual
   regeneration, as distinct from sacramental, would imply conversion, and
   this is a conscious act of the will, an exercise of repentance and
   faith, of which the infant is not capable.

   In the churches of Egypt infant baptism must have been practised from
   the first. For, aside from some not very clear expressions of Clement
   of Alexandria, Origen distinctly derives it from the tradition of the
   apostles; and through his journeys in the East and West he was well
   acquainted with the practice of the church in his time. [458] 58

   The only opponent of infant baptism among the fathers is the eccentric
   and schismatic Tertullian, of North Africa. He condemns the hastening
   of the innocent age to the forgiveness of sins, and intrusting it with
   divine gifts, while we would not commit to it earthly property. [459]
   59 Whoever considers the solemnity of baptism, will shrink more from
   the receiving, than from the postponement of it. But the very manner of
   Tertullian's opposition proves as much in favor of infant baptism as
   against it. He meets it not as an innovation, but as a prevalent
   custom; and he meets it not with exegetical nor historical arguments,
   but only with considerations of religious prudence. His opposition to
   it is founded on his view of the regenerating effect of baptism, and of
   the impossibility of having mortal sins forgiven in the church after
   baptism; this ordinance cannot be repeated, and washes out only the
   guilt contracted before its reception. On the same ground he advises
   healthy adults, especially the unmarried, to postpone this sacrament
   until they shall be no longer in danger of forfeiting forever the grace
   of baptism by committing adultery, murder, apostasy, or any other of
   the seven crimes which he calls mortal sins. On the same principle his
   advice applies only to healthy children, not to sickly ones, if we
   consider that he held baptism to be the indispensable condition of
   forgiveness of sins, and taught the doctrine of hereditary sin. With
   him this position resulted from moral earnestness, and a lively sense
   of the great solemnity of the baptismal vow. But many put off baptism
   to their death-bed, in moral levity and presumption, that they might
   sin as long as they could.

   Tertullian's opposition, moreover, had no influence, at least no
   theoretical influence, even in North Africa. His disciple Cyprian
   differed from him wholly. In his day it was no question, whether the
   children of Christian parents might and should be baptized--on this all
   were agreed,--but whether they might be baptized so early as the second
   or third day after birth, or, according to the precedent of the Jewish
   circumcision, on the eighth day. Cyprian, and a council of sixty-six
   bishops held at Carthage in 253 under his lead, decided for the earlier
   time, yet without condemning the delay. [460] 60 It was in a measure
   the same view of the almost magical effect of the baptismal water, and
   of its absolute necessity to salvation, which led Cyprian to hasten,
   and Tertullian to postpone the holy ordinance; one looking more at the
   beneficent effect of the sacrament in regard to past sins, the other at
   the danger of sins to come.

   founded on what is inmost in Christianity, becoming prominent in the
   feeling of Christians, resulted the practice of infant baptism" (I.
   312, Boston ed.)

   [457] Irenaeus speaks of "the washing of regeneration, " and of the
   "baptism of regeneration unto God,"to baptisma tes eis theon
   anagenneseos (Adv. Haer. l.c. 21, § 1); he identifies the apostolic
   commission to baptize with the potestas regenerationis in Deum (III.
   17, § 1); he says that Christ descending into Hades, regenerated the
   ancient patriarchs (III. c. 22, § 4; "in sinum suum recipiens pristinos
   patres regeneravit eos in vitam Dei"), by which he probably meant
   baptism (according to the fancy of Hermas, Clement of Alex., and
   others). Compare an examination of the various passages of Irenaeus in
   the article by Powers, who comes to the conclusion (l.c. p. 267) that "
   Irenaeus everywhere implies baptism in the regeneration he so often
   names."

   [458] In Ep. ad Rom. (Opera, vol. IV. col. 1047 ed. Migne; or IV. 565
   ed. Delarue): "Pro hoc et Ecclesia ab apostolis traditionem suscepit,
   etiam parvulis baptismum dare." In Levit. Hom. VIII. (II. 496 in
   Migne), he says that "secundum Ecclesiae observantiam" baptism was
   given also to children (etiam parvulis). Comp. his Com. in Matt. XV.
   (III. 1268 sqq.) where he seems to infer this custom from the example
   of Christ blessing little children. That Origen himself was baptized in
   childhood (185 or soon after), is nowhere expressly stated in his works
   (as far as I know), but may be inferred as probable from his descent
   of, and early religious instruction, by Christian parents (reported by
   Euseb H. E. VI. 19: toOrigenei ta tes kata Christon didaskalias ek
   progonon esozeto), in connection with the Egyptian custom. Comp.
   Redepenning, Origenes, I. 49. It would certainly be more difficult to
   prove that be was not baptized in infancy. He could easily make room
   for infant baptism in his theological system, which involved the
   Platonic idea of a prehistoric fall of the individual soul. But the
   Cyprianic and Augustinian theology connected it with the historic fall
   of Adam, and the consequent hereditary depravity and guilt.

   [459] 'Quid festinat innocens aetas ad remissionem peccatorum?" The"
   innocens" here is to be taken only in a relative sense; for Tertullian
   in other plain teaches a vitium originis, or hereditary sin and guilt,
   although not as distinctly and clearly as Augustin

   [460] A later council of Carthage of the year 418 went further and
   decreed: "item placuit, ut quicunque parvulos recentes ab uteris matrum
   baptizandos negat ... anathema sit."

   § 74. Heretical Baptism.

   On Heretical Baptism comp. Eusebius: H.E. VII. 3-5. Cyprian: Epist.
   LXX.-LXXVI. The Acts of the Councils of Carthage, a.d. 255 and 256, and
   the anonymous tract, De Rebaptismate, among Cyprian's works, and in
   Routh's Reliquiae Sacrae, vol. v. 283-328.

   Hefele: Conciliengeschichte, I. 117-132 (second ed.).

   G. E. Steitz: Ketzertaufe, in Herzog, rev. ed., VII. 652-661.

   Heretical baptism was, in the third century, the subject of a violent
   controversy, important also for its bearing on the question of the
   authority of the Roman see.

   Cyprian, whose Epistles afford the clearest information on this
   subject, followed Tertullian [461] 61 in rejecting baptism by heretics
   as an inoperative mock-baptism, and demanded that all heretics coming
   over to the Catholic church be baptized (he would not say re-baptized).
   His position here was due to his high-church exclusiveness and his
   horror of schism. As the one Catholic church is the sole repository of
   all grace, there can be no forgiveness of sins, no regeneration or
   communication of the Spirit, no salvation, and therefore no valid
   sacraments, out of her bosom. So far he had logical consistency on his
   side. But, on the other hand, he departed from the objective view of
   the church, as the Donatists afterwards did, in making the efficacy of
   the sacrament depend on the subjective holiness of the priest. "How can
   one consecrate water," he asks, "who is himself unholy, and has not the
   Holy Spirit?" He was followed by the North African church, which, in
   several councils at Carthage in the years 255-6, rejected heretical
   baptism; and by the church of Asia Minor, which had already acted on
   this view, and now, in the person of the Cappadocian bishop Firmilian,
   a disciple and admirer of the great Origen, vigorously defended it
   against Rome, using language which is entirely inconsistent with the
   claims of the papacy. [462] 62

   The Roman bishop Stephen (253-257) appeared for the opposite doctrine,
   on the ground of the ancient practice of his church. [463] 63 He
   offered no argument, but spoke with the consciousness of authority, and
   followed a catholic instinct. He laid chief stress on the objective
   nature of the sacrament, the virtue of which depended neither on the
   officiating priest, nor on the receiver, but solely on the institution
   of Christ. Hence he considered heretical baptism valid, provided only
   it was administered with intention to baptize and in the right form, to
   wit, in the name of the Trinity, or even of Christ alone; so that
   heretics coming into the church needed only confirmation or the
   ratification of baptism by the Holy Ghost. "Heresy," says he, "produces
   children and exposes them; and the church takes up the exposed
   children, and nourishes them as her own, though she herself has not
   brought them forth."

   The doctrine of Cyprian was the more consistent from the hierarchical
   point of view; that of Stephen, from the sacramental. The former was
   more logical, the latter more practical and charitable. The one
   preserved the principle of the exclusiveness of the church; the other,
   that of the objective force of the sacrament, even to the borders of
   the opus operatum theory. Both were under the direction of the same
   churchly spirit, and the same hatred of heretics; but the Roman
   doctrine is after all a happy inconsistency of liberality, an inroad
   upon the principle of absolute exclusiveness, an involuntary
   concession, that baptism, and with it the remission of sin and
   regeneration, therefore salvation, are possible outside of Roman
   Catholicism. [464] 64

   The controversy itself was conducted with great warmth. Stephen, though
   advocating the liberal view, showed the genuine papal arrogance and
   intolerance. He would not even admit to his presence the deputies of
   Cyprian, who brought him the decree of the African synod, and he called
   this bishop, who in every respect excelled Stephen, and whom the Roman
   church now venerates as one of her greatest saints, a false Christ and
   false apostle. [465] 65 He broke off all intercourse with the African
   church, as he had already with the Asiatic. But Cyprian and Firmilian,
   nothing daunted, vindicated with great boldness, the latter also with
   bitter vehemence, their different view, and continued in it to their
   death. The Alexandrian bishop Dionysius endeavored to reconcile the two
   parties, but with little success. The Valerian persecution, which soon
   ensued, and the martyrdom of Stephen (257) and of Cyprian (258),
   suppressed this internal discord.

   In the course of the fourth century, however, the Roman theory
   gradually gained on the other, received the sanction of the oecumenical
   Council of Nicaea in 325, was adopted in North Africa during the
   Donatistic controversies, by a Synod of Carthage, 348, defended by the
   powerful dialectics of St. Augustin against the Donatists, and was
   afterwards confirmed by the Council of Trent with an anathema on the
   opposite view.

   Note.

   The Council of Trent declares (Sessio Sept., March 3, 1547, canon 4):
   "If any one says that the baptism, which is even given by heretics in
   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, with the
   intention of doing what the church doth, is not true baptism: let him
   be anathema." The Greek church likewise forbids the repetition of
   baptism which has been performed in the name of the Holy Trinity, but
   requires trine immersion. See the Orthodox Conf. Quaest. CII. (in
   Schaff's Creeds II. 376), and the Russian Catch. (II. 493), which says:
   "Baptism, is spiritual birth: a man is born but once, therefore he is
   also baptized but once." But the same Catechism declares "trine
   immersion" to be "most essential in the administration of baptism"(II.
   491).

   The Roman church, following the teaching of St. Augustin, bases upon
   the validity of heretical and schismatical baptism even a certain legal
   claim on all baptized persons, as virtually belonging to her communion,
   and a right to the forcible conversion of heretics under favorable
   circumstances. [466] 66 But as there may be some doubt about the
   orthodox form and intention of heretical baptism in the mind of the
   convert (e.g. if he be a Unitarian), the same church allows a
   conditional rebaptism with the formula: "If thou art not yet baptized,
   I baptize thee," etc.

   Evangelical creeds put their recognition of Roman Catholic or any other
   Christian baptism not so much on the theory of the objective virtue of
   the sacrament, as on a more comprehensive and liberal conception of the
   church. Where Christ is, there is the church, and there are true
   ordinances. The Baptists alone, among Protestants, deny the validity of
   any other baptism but by immersion (in this respect resembling the
   Greek church), but are very far on that account from denying the
   Christian status of other denominations, since baptism with them is
   only a sign (not a means) of regeneration or conversion, which precedes
   the rite and is independent of it.

   [462] See p. 162. Some Roman divines (Molkenkuhr and Tizzani, as quoted

   Firmilian (the 75th among Cyprian's Epp.) cannot be historical, and
   that the whole story of the controversy between Pope Stephen and St.
   Cyprian must be a fabrication! Dogma versus facts

   [463] According to Hippolytus (Philosoph.), the rebaptism of heretics
   was unknown before Callistus, a.d. 218-223. Cyprian does not deny the
   antiquity of the Roman customs but pleads that truth is better than
   custom ("quasi consuetudo major sit veritate"). Hefele, 1. p. 121. The
   Epistles of Stephen are lost, and we must learn his position from his
   opponents.

   [464] Unless it be maintained that the baptismal grace, if received
   outside of the Catholic communion, is of no use, but rather increases
   the guilt (like the knowledge of the heathen), and become, ; available
   only by the subjective conversion and regular confirmation of the
   heretic. This was the view of Augustin; see Steitz, l. c., p. 655 sq.

   [466] Augustin thus misinterpreted the "Coge intrare,"Luke 14:22, 23,
   as justifying persecution (Ep. ad Bonifac., c. 6). If the holy bishop
   of Hippo had foreseen the fearful consequences of his exegesis, be
   would have shrunk from it in horror.

   § 76. Origin of Christian Art.

   Christianity owed its origin neither to art nor to science, and is
   altogether independent of both. But it penetrates and pervades them
   with its heaven-like nature, and inspires them with a higher and nobler
   aim. Art reaches its real perfection in worship, as an embodiment of
   devotion in beautiful forms, which afford a pure pleasure, and at the
   same time excite and promote devotional feeling. Poetry and music, the
   most free and spiritual arts, which present their ideals in word and
   tone, and lead immediately from the outward form to the spiritual
   substance, were an essential element of worship in Judaism, and passed
   thence, in the singing of psalms, into the Christian church.

   Not so with the plastic arts of sculpture and painting, which employ
   grosser material--stone, wood, color--as the medium of representation,
   and, with a lower grade of culture, tend almost invariably to abuse
   when brought in contact with worship. Hence the strict prohibition of
   these arts by the Monotheistic religions. The Mohammedans follow in
   this respect the Jews; their mosques are as bare of images of living
   beings as the synagogues, and they abhor the image worship of Greek and
   Roman Christians as a species of idolatry.

   The ante-Nicene church, inheriting the Mosaic decalogue, and engaged in
   deadly conflict with heathen idolatry, was at first averse to those
   arts. Moreover her humble condition, her contempt for all hypocritical
   show and earthly vanity, her enthusiasm for martyrdom, and her
   absorbing expectation of the speedy destruction of the world and
   establishment of the millennial kingdom, made her indifferent to the
   ornamental part of life. The rigorous Montanists, in this respect the
   forerunners of the Puritans, were most hostile to art. But even the
   highly cultivated Clement of Alexandria put the spiritual worship of
   God in sharp contrast to the pictorial representation of the divine.
   "The habit of daily view," he says, "lowers the dignity of the divine,
   which cannot be honored, but is only degraded, by sensible material."

   Yet this aversion to art seems not to have extended to mere symbols
   such as we find even in the Old Testament, as the brazen serpent and
   the cherubim in the temple. At all events, after the middle or close of
   the second century we find the rude beginnings of Christian art in the
   form of significant symbols in the private and social life of the
   Christians, and afterwards in public worship. This is evident from
   Tertullian and other writers of the third century, and is abundantly
   confirmed by the Catacombs, although the age of their earliest
   pictorial remains is a matter of uncertainty and dispute.

   The origin of these symbols must be found in the instinctive desire of
   the Christians to have visible tokens of religious truth, which might
   remind them continually of their Redeemer and their holy calling, and
   which would at the same time furnish them the best substitute for the
   signs of heathen idolatry. For every day they were surrounded by
   mythological figures, not only in temples and public places, but in
   private houses, on the walls, floors, goblets, seal-rings, and
   grave-stones. Innocent and natural as, this effort was, it could easily
   lead, in the less intelligent multitude, to confusion of the sign with
   the thing signified, and to many a superstition. Yet this result was
   the less apparent in the first three centuries, because in that period
   artistic works were mostly confined to the province of symbol and
   allegory.

   From the private recesses of Christian homes and catacombs artistic
   representations of holy things passed into public churches ill the
   fourth century, but under protest which continued for a long time and
   gave rise to the violent image controversies which were not settled
   until the second Council of Nicaea (787), in favor of a limited image
   worship. The Spanish Council of Elvira (Granada) in 306 first raised
   such a protest, and prohibited (in the thirty-sixth canon) "pictures in
   the church (picturas in ecclessia), lest the objects of veneration and
   worship should be depicted on the walls." This sounds almost
   iconoclastic and puritanic; but in view of the numerous ancient
   pictures and sculptures in the catacombs, the prohibition must be
   probably understood as a temporary measure of expediency in that
   transition period. [467] 67

   E. Dobbert: Zur Enttehungsgeschichte des Kreuzes, Leipzig, 1880.

   The oldest and dearest, but also the, most abused, of the primitive
   Christian symbols is the cross, the sign of redemption, sometimes
   alone, sometimes with the Alpha and Omega, sometimes with the anchor of
   hope or the palm of peace. Upon this arose, as early as the second
   century, the custom of making the sign of the cross [469] 69 on rising,
   bathing, going out, eating, in short, on engaging in any affairs of
   every-day life; a custom probably attended in many cases even in that
   age, with superstitious confidence in the magical virtue of this sign;
   hence Tertullian found it necessary to defend the Christians against
   the heathen charge of worshipping the cross (staurolatria). [470] 70

   Cyprian and the Apostolical Constitutions mention the sign of the cross
   as a part of the baptismal rite, and Lactantius speaks of it as
   effective against the demons in the baptismal exorcism. Prudentius
   recommends it as a preservative against temptations and bad dreams. We
   find as frequently, particularly upon ornaments and tombs, the monogram
   of the name of Christ, X P, usually combined in the cruciform
   character, either alone, or with the Greek letters Alpha and Omega,
   "the first and the last;" in later cases with the addition "In the
   sign." [471] 71 Soon after Constantine's victory over Maxentius by the
   aid of the Labarum (312), crosses were seen on helmets, bucklers,
   standards, crowns, sceptres, coins and seals, in various forms. [472]
   72

   The cross was despised by the heathen Romans on account of the
   crucifixion, the disgraceful punishment of slaves and the worst
   criminals; but the Apologists reminded them of the unconscious
   recognition of the salutary sign in the form of their standards and
   triumphal symbols, and of the analogies in nature, as the form of man
   with the outstretched arm, the flying bird, and the sailing ship. [473]
   73 Nor was the symbolical use of the cross confined to the Christian
   church, but is found among the ancient Egyptians, the Buddhists in
   India, and the Mexicans before the conquest, and other heathen nations,
   both as a symbol of blessing and a symbol of curse. [474] 74

   The cross and the Lord's Prayer may be called the greatest martyrs in
   Christendom. Yet both the superstitious abuse and the puritanic protest
   bear a like testimony to the significance of the great fact of which it
   reminds us.

   The crucifix, that is the sculptured or carved representation of our
   Saviour attached to the cross, is of much later date, and cannot be
   clearly traced beyond the middle of the sixth century. It is not
   mentioned by any writer of the Nicene and Chalcedonian age. One of the
   oldest known crucifixes, if not the very oldest, is found in a richly
   illuminated Syrian copy of the Gospels in Florence from the year 586.
   [475] 75 Gregory of Tours (d. 595) describes a crucifix in the church
   of St. Genesius, in Narbonne, which presented the crucified One almost
   entirely naked. [476] 76 But this gave offence, and was veiled, by
   order of the bishop, with a curtain, and only at times exposed to the
   people. The Venerable Bede relates that a crucifix, bearing on one side
   the Crucified, on the other the serpent lifted up by Moses, was brought
   from Rome to the British cloister of Weremouth in 686. [477] 77

   Note.

   The first symbol of the crucifixion was the cross alone; then followed
   the cross and the lamb--either the lamb with the cross on the head or
   shoulder, or the lamb fastened on the cross; then the figure of Christ
   in connection with the cross--either Christ holding it in his right
   hand (on the sarcophagus of Probus, d. 395), or Christ with the cross
   in the background (in the church of St. Pudentiana, built 398); at last
   Christ nailed to the cross.

   An attempt has been made to trace the crucifixes back to the third or
   second century, in consequence of the discovery, in 1857, of a
   mock-crucifix on the wall in the ruins of the imperial palaces on the
   western declivity of the Palatine hill in Rome, which is preserved in
   the Museo Kircheriano. It shows the figure of a crucified man with the
   head of an ass or a horse, and a human figure kneeling before it, with
   the inscription: "Alexamenos worships his God." [478] 78 This figure
   was no doubt scratched on the wall by some heathen enemy to ridicule a
   Christian slave or page of the imperial household, or possibly even the
   emperor Alexander Severus (222-235), who, by his religious syncretism,
   exposed himself to sarcastic criticism. The date of the caricature is
   uncertain; but we know that in the second century the Christians, like
   the Jews before them, were charged with the worship of an ass, and that
   at that time there were already Christians in the imperial palace.
   [479] 79 After the third Century this silly charge disappears. Roman
   archaeologists (P. Garrucci, P. Mozzoni, and Martigny) infer from this
   mock-crucifix that crucifixes were in use among Christians already at
   the close of the second century, since the original precedes the
   caricature. But this conjecture is not supported by any evidence. The
   heathen Caecilius in Minucius Felix (ch. 10) expressly testifies the
   absence of Christian simulacra. As the oldest pictures of Christ, so
   far as we know, originated not among the orthodox Christians, but among
   the heretical and half heathenish Gnostics, so also the oldest known
   representation of the crucifix was a mock-picture from the hand of a
   heathen--an excellent illustration of the word of Paul that the
   preaching of Christ crucified is foolishness to the Greeks.

   The story of the miraculous invention and raising of the true cross of

   The connection of the cross with the a and o arose from the Apocalyptic

   by Prudentius (Cathem. hymn. IX. 10-12): "Alpha et Omega cognominatus;

   § 78. Other Christian Symbols.

   The following symbols, borrowed from the Scriptures, were frequently
   represented in the catacombs, and relate to the virtues and duties of
   the Christian life: The dove, with or without the olive branch, the
   type of simplicity and innocence; [480] 80 the ship, representing
   sometimes the church, as safely sailing through the flood of
   corruption, with reference to Noah's ark, sometimes the individual soul
   on its voyage to the heavenly home under the conduct of the
   storm-controlling Saviour; the palm-branch, which the seer of the
   Apocalypse puts into the hands of the elect, as the sign of victory;
   [481] 81 the anchor, the figure of hope; [482] 82 the lyre, denoting
   festal joy and sweet harmony; [483] 83 the cock, an admonition to
   watchfulness, with reference to Peter's fall; [484] 84 the hart which
   pants for the fresh water-brooks; [485] 85 and the vine which, with its
   branches and clusters, illustrates the union of the Christians with
   Christ according to the parable, and the richness and joyfulness of
   Christian life. [486] 86'

   The phoenix, the symbol of rejuvenation and of the resurrection, is
   derived from the well-known heathen myth. [487] 87

   Homace writes (Od. I. 1): "Palmaque nobilis Terrarum dominos evehit ad
   deos."

   [484] Matt. 26:34, and parallel passages.

   [485] Ps. 42:1.

   [486] John 15:1-6. The parables of the Good Shepherd, and of the Vine
   and the Branches, both recorded only by St. John, seem to have been the
   most prominent in the mind of the primitive Christians, as they are in
   the catacombs. "What they valued" (says Stanley, Christ. Inst., p.
   288), "what they felt, was new moral Influence, a new life stealing
   through their veins, a new health imparted to their frames, a new
   courage breathing in their faces, like wine to a weary laborer, like
   sap in the hundred branches of a spreading tree, like juice in thousand
   clusters of a spreading vine." But more important than this was the
   idea of vital union of the believers with Christ and among each other,
   symbolized by the vine and its branches.

   [487] The fabulous phoenix is nowhere mentioned in the Bible, and is
   first used by Clement of Rome, Ad Cor. c. 25, and by Tertiillian, De
   Resur. c. 13. Comp. Pliny Hist. Nat. XIII. 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 79 Historical and Allegorical Pictures

   From these emblems there was but one step to iconographic
   representations. The Bible furnished rich material for historical,
   typical, and allegorical pictures, which are found in the catacombs and
   ancient monuments. Many of them (late from the third or even the second
   century.

   The favorite pictures from the Old Testament are Adam and Eve, the
   rivers of Paradise, the ark of Noah, the sacrifice of Isaac, the
   passage through the Red Sea, the giving of the law, Moses smiting the
   rock, the deliverance of Jonah, Jonah naked under the gourd the
   translation of Elijah, Daniel in the lions' den, the three children in
   the fiery furnace. Then we have scenes from the Gospels, and from
   apostolic and post-apostolic history, such as the adoration of the
   Magi, their meeting with Herod, the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan, the
   healing of the paralytic, the changing water into wine, the miraculous
   feeding of five thousand, the ten virgins, the resurrection of Lazarus,
   the entry into Jerusalem, the Holy Supper, the portraits of St. Peter
   and St. Paul. [488] 88

   The passion and crucifixion were never represented in the early
   monuments, except by the symbol of the cross.

   Occasionally we find also mythological representations, as Psyche with
   wings, and playing with birds and flowers (an emblem of immortality),
   Hercules, Theseus, and especially Orpheus, who with his magic song
   quieted the storm and tamed the wild beasts.

   Perhaps Gnosticism had a stimulating effect in art, as it had in
   theology. At all events the sects of the Carpocratians, the
   Basilideans, and the Manichaeans cherished art. Nationality also had
   something to do with this branch of life. The Italians are by nature
   art artistic people, and shaped their Christianity accordingly.
   Therefore Rome is preëminently the home of Christian art.

   The earliest pictures in the catacombs are artistically the best, and
   show the influence of classic models in the beauty and grace of form.
   From the fourth century there is a rapid decline to rudeness and
   stiffness, and a transition to the Byzantine type.

   Some writers [489] 89 have represented this primitive Christian art
   merely as pagan art in its decay, and even the Good Shepherd as a copy
   of Apollo or Hermes. But while the form is often an imitation, the
   spirit is altogether different, and the myths are understood as
   unconscious prophecies and types of Christian verities, as in the
   Sibylline books. The relation of Christian art to mythological art
   somewhat resembles the relation of biblical Greek to classical Greek.
   Christianity could not at once invent a new art any more than a new
   language, but it emancipated the old from the service of idolatry and
   immorality, filled it with a deeper meaning, and consecrated it to a
   higher aim.

   The blending of classical reminiscences and Christian ideas is best
   embodied in the beautiful symbolic pictures of the Good Shepherd and of
   Orpheus. [490] 90

   The former was the most favorite figure, not only in the Catacombs, but
   on articles of daily use, as rings, cups, and lamps. Nearly one hundred
   and fifty such pictures have come down to us. The Shepherd, an
   appropriate symbol of Christ, is usually represented as a handsome,
   beardless, gentle youth, in light costume, with a girdle and sandals,
   with the flute and pastoral staff, carrying a lamb on his shoulder,
   standing between two or more sheep that look confidently up to him.
   Sometimes he feeds a large flock on green pastures. If this was the
   popular conception of Christ, it stood in contrast with the
   contemporaneous theological idea of the homely appearance of the
   Saviour, and anticipated the post-Constantinian conception.

   The picture of Orpheus is twice found in the cemetery of Domitilla, and
   once in that of Callistus. One on the ceiling in Domitilla, apparently
   from the second century, is especially rich: it represents the
   mysterious singer, seated in the centre on a piece of rock, playing on
   the lyre his enchanting melodies to wild and tame animals--the lion,
   the wolf, the serpent, the horse, the ram--at his feet--and the birds
   in the trees; [491] 91 around the central figure are several biblical
   scenes, Moses smiting the rock, David aiming the sling at Goliath (?),
   Daniel among the lions, the raising of Lazarus. The heathen Orpheus,
   the reputed author of monotheistic hymns (the Orphica), the centre of
   so many mysteries, the fabulous charmer of all creation, appears here
   either as a symbol and type of Christ Himself, [492] 92 or rather, like
   the heathen Sibyl, an antitype and unconscious prophet of Christ,
   announcing and foreshadowing Him as the conqueror of all the forces of
   nature, as the harmonizer of all discords, and as ruler over life and
   death.

   § 80. Allegorical Representations of Christ.

   Pictures of Christ came into use slowly and gradually, as the
   conceptions concerning his personal appearance changed. The Evangelists
   very wisely keep profound silence on the subject, and no ideal which
   human genius may devise, can do justice to Him who was God manifest in
   the flesh.

   In the ante-Nicene age the strange notion prevailed that our Saviour,
   in the state of his humiliation, was homely, according to a literal
   interpretation of the Messianic prophecy: "He hath no form nor
   comeliness." [493] 93 This was the opinion of Justin Martyr, [494] 94
   Tertullian, [495] 95 and even of the spiritualistic Alexandrian divines
   Clement, [496] 96 and Origen. [497] 97 A true and healthy feeling leads
   rather to the opposite view; for Jesus certainly had not the
   physiognomy of a sinner, and the heavenly purity and harmony of his
   soul must in some way have shone, through the veil of his flesh, as it
   certainly did on the Mount of Transfiguration. Physical deformity is
   incompatible with the Old Testament idea of the priesthood, how much
   more with the idea of the Messiah.

   Those fathers, however, had the state of humiliation alone in their
   eye. The exalted Redeemer they themselves viewed as clothed with
   unfading beauty and glory, which was to pass from Him, the Head, to his
   church also, in her perfect millennial state [498] We have here,
   therefore, not an essential opposition made between holiness and
   beauty, but only a temporary separation. Nor did the ante-Nicene
   fathers mean to deny that Christ, even in the days of his humiliation,
   had a spiritual beauty which captivated susceptible souls. Thus Clement
   of Alexandria distinguishes between two kinds of beauty, the outward
   beauty of the flesh, which soon fades away, and the beauty of the soul,
   which consists in moral excellence and is permanent. "That the Lord
   Himself," he says, "was uncomely in aspect, the Spirit testifies by
   Isaiah: 'And we saw Him, and he had no form nor comeliness; but his
   form was mean, inferior to men.' Yet who was more admirable than the
   Lord? But it was not the beauty of the flesh visible to the eye, but
   the true beauty of both soul and body, which He exhibited, which in the
   former is beneficence; in the latter--that is, the flesh--immortality."
   [499] 99 Chrysostom went further: he understood Isaiah's description to
   refer merely to the scenes of the passion, and took his idea of the
   personal appearance of Jesus from the forty-fifth Psalm, where he is
   represented as "fairer than the children of men." Jerome and Augustin
   had the same view, but there was at that time no authentic picture of
   Christ, and the imagination was left to its own imperfect attempts to
   set forth that human face divine which reflected the beauty of sinless
   holiness.

   The first representations of Christ were purely allegorical. He appears
   now as a shepherd, who lays down his life for the sheep, [500] 00 or
   carries the lost sheep on his shoulders; [501] 01 as a lamb, who bears
   the sin of the world; [502] 02 more rarely as a ram, with reference to
   the substituted victim in the history of Abraham and Isaac; [503] 03
   frequently as a fisher. [504] 04 Clement of Alexandria, in his hymn,
   calls Christ the "Fisher of men that are saved, who with his sweet life
   catches the pure fish out of the hostile flood in the sea of iniquity."

   The most favorite symbol seems to have been that of the fish. It was
   the double symbol of the Redeemer and the redeemed. The corresponding
   Greek Ichthys is a pregnant anagram, containing the initials of the
   words: "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour." [505] 05 In some pictures
   the mysterious fish is swimming in the water with a plate of bread and
   a cup of wine on his back, with evident allusion to the Lord's Supper.
   At the same time the fish represented the soul caught in the net of the
   great Fisher of men and his servants, with reference to Matt. 4:19;
   comp. 13:47. Tertullian connects the symbol with the water of baptism,
   saying: [506] 06 "We little fishes (pisciculi) are born by our Fish
   (secundum IChthUS nostrum), Jesus Christ in water, and can thrive only
   by continuing in the water;" that is if we are faithful to our
   baptismal covenant, and preserve the grace there received. The pious
   fancy made the fish a symbol of the whole mystery of the Christian
   salvation. The anagrammatic or hieroglyphic use of the Greek Ichthys
   and the Latin Piscis-Christus belonged to the Disciplina Arcani, and
   was a testimony of the ancient church to the faith in Christ's person
   as the Son of God, and his work as the Saviour of the world. The origin
   of this symbol must be traced beyond the middle of the second century,
   perhaps to Alexandria, where there was a strong love for mystic
   symbolism, both among the orthodox and the Gnostic heretics. [507] 07
   It is familiarly mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and
   Tertullian, and is found on ancient remains in the Roman catacombs,
   marked on the grave-stones, rings, lamps, vases, and wall-pictures
   [508] 08

   The Ichthys-symbol went out of use before the middle of the fourth
   century, after which it is only found occasionally as a reminiscence of
   olden times.

   Previous to the time of Constantine, we find no trace of an image of
   Christ, properly speaking, except among the Gnostic Carpocratians,
   [509] 09 and in the case of the heathen emperor Alexander Severus, who
   adorned his domestic chapel, as a sort of syncretistic Pantheon, with
   representatives of all religions. [510] 10 The above-mentioned idea of
   the uncomely personal appearance of Jesus, the entire silence of the
   Gospels about it, and the Old Testament prohibition of images,
   restrained the church from making either pictures or statues of Christ,
   until in the Nicene age a great change took place, though not without
   energetic and long-continued opposition. Eusebius gives us, from his
   own observation, the oldest report of a statue of Christ, which was
   said to have been erected by the woman with the issue of blood,
   together with her own statue, in memory of her cure, before her
   dwelling at Caesarea Philippi (Paneas). [511] 11 But the same
   historian, in a letter to the empress Constantia (the sister of
   Constantine and widow of Licinius), strongly protested against images
   of Christ, who had laid aside his earthly servant form, and whose
   heavenly glory transcends the conception and artistic skill of man.

   ignoble" (To soma mikron kai duseides kai agenes e'n). He admits the
   "ill-favored," but denies the "ignoble," and doubts the "little," of
   which there is no certain evidence. He then quotes the language of
   Isaiah 53, but adds the description of Ps. 45:3, 4 (Sept.), which
   represents the Messiah as a king arrayed in beauty. Celsus used this
   false tradition of the supposed uncomeliness of Jesus as an argument
   against his divinity, and an objection to the Christian religion.

   this explanation, goes back to Matt. 7:10, where fish (ichthus) and
   serpent (ophis) are contrasted, and suggested a contrast between Christ
   and the devil (comp. Apoc. 12:14, 1. 2 Cor. 11:3) Rather artificial.
   Merz derives the symbol from opson (hence opsarionin John 21:9) in the
   sense of "fish, flesh." In Palestine fish was, next to bread, the
   principal food, and a savory accompaniment of bread. It figures
   prominently in the miraculous; feeding of the multitude (John 6:9, 11),
   and in the meal of the risen Saviour on the shares of the Lake of
   Tiberias (John 21:9, opsarion kai arton). By an allegorical stretch,
   the fish might thus; become to the mind of the early church a symbol of
   Christ's body, as the heavenly food which he gave for the salvation of
   men (John 6:51).

   allusion to the miraculous feeding (Matt. 15:17), and the meals of the

   Catacombs (Lond. 1870, pp. 1-63); Martigny: Dict. sub "Vierge;" KRAUS:

   Marienverehrung in den 3 ersten Jahrh. (Stuttgart, 1881, p. 282 sqq.).

   It was formerly supposed that no picture of the Virgin existed before
   the Council of Ephesus (431), which condemned Nestorius and sanctioned
   the theotokos, thereby giving solemn sanction and a strong impetus to
   the cultus of Mary. But several pictures are now traced, with a high
   degree of probability, to the third, if not the second century. From
   the first five centuries nearly fifty representations of Mary have so
   far been brought to the notice of scholars, most of them in connection
   with the infant Saviour.

   The oldest is a fragmentary wall-picture in the cemetery of Priscilla:
   it presents Mary wearing a tunic and cloak, in sitting posture, and
   holding at her breast the child, who turns his face round to the
   beholder. Near her stands a young and beardless man (probably Joseph)
   clothed in the pallium, holding a book-roll in one hand, pointing to
   the star above with the other, and looking upon the mother and child
   with the expression of joy; between and above the figures is the star
   of Bethlehem; the whole represents the happiness of a family without
   the supernatural adornments of dogmatic reflection. [513] 13 In the
   same cemetery of Priscilla there are other frescos, representing
   (according to De Rossi and Garrucci) the annunciation by the angel, the
   adoration of the Magi, and the finding of the Lord in the temple. The
   adoration of the Magi (two or four, afterwards three) is a favorite
   part of the pictures of the holy family. In the oldest picture of that
   kind in the cemetery of SS. Peter and Marcellinus, Mary sits on a
   chair, holding the babe in her lap, and receiving the homage of two
   Magi, one on each side, presenting their gifts on a plate. [514] 14 In
   later pictures the manger, the ox and the ass, and the miraculous star
   are added to the scene.

   The frequent pictures of a lady in praying attitude, with uplifted or
   outstretched arms (Orans or Orante), especially when found in company
   with the Good Shepherd, are explained by Roman Catholic archaeologists
   to mean the church or the blessed Virgin, or both combined, praying for
   sinners. [515] 15 But figures of praying men as well as women are
   abundant in the catacombs, and often represent the person buried in the
   adjacent tomb, whose names are sometimes given. No Ora pro nobis, no
   Ave Maria, no Theotokos or Deipara appears there. The pictures of the
   Orans are like those of other women, and show no traces of Mariolatry.
   Nearly all the representations in the catacombs keep within the limits
   of the gospel history. But after the fourth century, and in the
   degeneracy of art, Mary was pictured in elaborate mosaics, and on
   gilded glasses, as the crowned queen of heaven, seated on a throne, in
   bejewelled purple robes, and with a nimbus of glory, worshipped by
   angels and saints.

   The noblest pictures of Mary, in ancient and modern times, endeavor to
   set forth that peculiar union of virgin purity and motherly tenderness
   which distinguish "the Wedded Maid and Virgin Mother" from ordinary
   women, and exert such a powerful charm upon the imagination and
   feelings of Christendom. No excesses of Mariolatry, sinful as they are,
   should blind us to the restraining and elevating effect of
   contemplating, with devout reverence,


   "The ideal of all womanhood,

   So mild, so merciful, so strong, so good,

   So patient, peaceful, loyal, loving, pure."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [513] See the picture in De Rossi, Plate iv., Northcote and Brownlow,
   Plate xx (II. 140), and in Schultze, Katak., p. 151. De Rossi ("
   Bulletino, " 1865, 23, as quoted by N. and B.) declares it either
   coëval with the first Christian art, or little removed from it, either
   of the age of the Flavii or of Trajan and Hadrian, or at the very
   latest, of the first Antonines. "On the roof of this tomb there was
   figured in fine stucco the Good Shepherd between two sheep, and some
   other subject, now nearly defaced." De Rossi supports his view of the
   high antiquity of this Madonna by the superior, almost classical style
   of art, and by the fact that the catacomb of Priscilla, the mother of
   Pudens, is one of the oldest. But J. H. Parker, an experienced
   antiquary, assigns this picture to a.d. 523. The young man is,
   according to De Rossi, Isaiah or some other prophet; but Marriott and
   Schultze refer him to Joseph, which is more probable, although the
   later tradition of the Greek church derived from the Apocryphal Gospels
   and strengthened by the idea of the perpetual virginity, represents him
   as an old man with several children from a previous marriage (the
   brethren of Jesus, changed into cousins by Jerome and the Latin
   church). Northcote and Brownlow (II. 141) remark: "St. Joseph certainly
   appears in some of the sarcophagi; and in the most ancient of them as a
   young and beardless man, generally clad in a tunic. In the mosaics of
   St. Mary Major's, which are of the fifth century, and in which he
   appears four or five times, he is shown of nature age, if not old; and
   from that time forward this became the more common mode of representing
   him."

   [514] See Plate xx. in N. and B. II 140. Schultze (p. 153) traces this
   picture to the beginning of the third century.

   [515] According to the usual Roman Catholic interpretation of the
   apocalyptic vision of the woman clothed with the sun, and bringing
   forth a man-child (12:1, 5). Cardinal Newman reasons inconclusively in
   a letter to Dr. Pusey on his Eirenicon (p. 62): "I do not deny that,
   under the image of the woman, the church is signified; but ... the holy
   apostle would not have spoken of the church under this particular image
   unless there had existed a blessed Virgin Mary, who was exalted on
   high, and the object of veneration of all the faithful." When
   accompanied by the Good Shepherd the Orans is supposed by Northcote and
   Brownlow (II. 137) to represent Mar y a., ; the new Eve, as the
   Shepherd is the new Adam. It must be admitted that the parallel between
   Mary and Eve is as old as Irenaeus, and contains the fruitful germ of
   Mariolatry, but in those pictures no such contrast is presented.

   § 83. Origin and History of the Catacomb.

   The Catacombs of Rome and other cities open a new chapter of Church
   history, which has recently been dug up from the bowels of the earth.
   Their discovery was a revelation to the world as instructive and
   important as the discovery of the long lost cities of Pompeii and
   Herculaneum, and of Nineveh and Babylon. Eusebius says nothing about
   them; the ancient Fathers scarcely allude to them, except Jerome and
   Prudentius, and even they give us no idea of their extent and
   importance. Hence the historians till quite recently have passed them
   by in silence. [516] 16 But since the great discoveries of Commendatore
   De Rossi and other archaeologists they can no longer be ignored. They
   confirm, illustrate, and supplement our previous knowledge derived from
   the more important literary remains.

   The name of the Catacombs is of uncertain origin, but is equivalent to
   subterranean cemeteries or resting-places for the dead. [517] 17 First
   used of the Christian cemeteries in the neighborhood of Rome, it was
   afterwards applied to those of Naples, Malta, Sicily, Alexandria,
   Paris, and other cities.

   It was formerly supposed that the Roman Catacombs were originally
   sand-pits (arenariae) or stone-quarries (lapidicinae), excavated by the
   heathen for building material, and occasionally used as receptacles for
   the vilest corpses of slaves and criminals. [518] 18 But this view is
   now abandoned on account of the difference of construction and of the
   soil. A few of the catacombs, however, about five out of thirty, are
   more or less closely connected with abandoned sand-pits. [519] 19

   The catacombs, therefore, with a few exceptions, are of Christian
   origin, and were excavated for the express purpose of Christian burial.
   Their enormous extent, and the mixture of heathen with Christian
   symbols and inscriptions, might suggest that they were used by heathen
   also; but this is excluded by the fact of the mutual aversion of
   Christians and idolaters to associate in life and in death. The
   mythological features are few, and adapted to Christian ideas. [520] 20

   Another erroneous opinion, once generally entertained, regarded the
   catacombs as places of refuge from heathen persecution. But the immense
   labor required could not have escaped the attention of the police. They
   were, on the contrary, the result of toleration. The Roman government,
   although (like all despotic governments) jealous of secret societies,
   was quite liberal towards the burial clubs, mostly of the poorer
   classes, or associations for securing, by regular contributions, decent
   interment with religious ceremonies. [521] 21 Only the worst criminals,
   traitors, suicides, and those struck down by lightning (touched by the
   gods) were left unburied. The pious care of the dead is an instinct of
   human nature, and is found among all nations. Death is a mighty leveler
   of distinctions and preacher of toleration and charity; even despots
   bow before it, and are reminded of their own vanity; even hard hearts
   are moved by it to pity and to tears. "De mortuis nihil nisi bonum."

   The Christians enjoyed probably from the beginning the privilege of
   common cemeteries, like the Jews, even without an express enactment.
   Galienus restored them after their temporary confiscation during the
   persecution of Valerian (260). [522] 22

   Being mostly of Jewish and Oriental descent, the Roman Christians
   naturally followed the Oriental custom of cutting their tombs in rocks,
   and constructing galleries. Hence the close resemblance of the Jewish
   and Christian cemeteries in Rome. [523] 23 The ancient Greeks and
   Romans under the empire were in the habit of burning the corpses
   (crematio) for sanitary reasons, but burial in the earth (humatio),
   outside of the city near the public roads, or on hills, or in natural
   grottos, was the older custom; the rich had their own sepulchres
   (sepulcra).

   In their catacombs the Christians could assemble for worship and take
   refuge in times of persecution. Very rarely they were pursued in these
   silent retreats. Once only it is reported that the Christians were shut
   up by the heathen in a cemetery and smothered to death.

   Most of the catacombs were constructed during the first three
   centuries, a few may be traced almost to the apostolic age. [524] 24
   After Constantine, when the temporal condition of the Christians
   improved, and they could bury their dead without any disturbance in the
   open air, the cemeteries were located above ground, especially above
   the catacombs, and around the basilicas; or on other land purchased or
   donated for the purpose. Some catacombs owe their origin to individuals
   or private families, who granted the use of their own grounds for the
   burial of their brethren; others belonged to churches. The Christians
   wrote on the graves appropriate epitaphs and consoling thoughts, and
   painted on the walls their favorite symbols. At funerals they turned
   these dark and cheerless abodes into chapels; under the dim light of
   the terra-cotta lamps they committed dust to dust, ashes to ashes, and
   amidst the shadows of death they inhaled the breath of the resurrection
   and life everlasting. But it is an error to suppose that the catacombs
   served as the usual places of worship in times of persecution; for such
   a purpose they were entirely unfitted; even the largest could
   accommodate, at most, only twenty or thirty persons within convenient
   distance. [525] 25

   The devotional use of the catacombs began in the Nicene age, and
   greatly stimulated the worship of martyrs and saints. When they ceased
   to be used for burial they became resorts of pious pilgrims. Little
   chapels were built for the celebration of the memory of the martyrs.
   St. Jerome relates, [526] 26 how, while a school-boy, about a.d. 350,
   he used to go with his companions every Sunday to the graves of the
   apostles and martyrs in the crypts at Rome, "where in subterranean
   depths the visitor passes to and fro between the bodies of the entombed
   on both walls, and where all is so dark, that the prophecy here finds
   its fulfillment: The living go down into Hades. [527] 27 Here and there
   a ray from above, not falling in through a window, but only pressing in
   through a crevice, softens the gloom; as you go onward, it fades away,
   and in the darkness of night which surrounds you, that verse of Virgil
   comes to your mind:

   "Horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent." [528] 28

   The poet Prudentius also, in the beginning of the fifth century,
   several times speaks of these burial places, and the devotions held
   within them. [529] 29

   Pope Damasus (366-384) showed his zeal in repairing and decorating the
   catacombs, and erecting new stair-cases for the convenience of
   pilgrims. His successors kept up the interest, but by repeated repairs
   introduced great confusion into the chronology of the works of art.

   The barbarian invasions of Alaric (410), Genseric (455), Ricimer (472),
   Vitiges (537), Totila (546), and the Lombards (754), turned Rome into a
   heap of ruins and destroyed many valuable treasures of classical and
   Christian antiquity. But the pious barbarism of relic hunters did much
   greater damage. The tombs of real and imaginary saints were rifled, and
   cartloads of dead men's bones were translated to the Pantheon and
   churches and chapels for more convenient worship. In this way the
   catacombs gradually lost all interest, and passed into decay and
   complete oblivion for more than six centuries.

   In the sixteenth century the catacombs were rediscovered, and opened an
   interesting field for antiquarian research. The first discovery was
   made May 31, 1578, by some laborers in a vineyard on the Via Salaria,
   who were digging pozzolana, and came on an old subterranean cemetery,
   ornamented with Christian paintings, Greek and Latin inscriptions and
   sculptured sarcophagi. "In that day," says De Rossi, "was born the name
   and the knowledge of Roma Sotterranea." One of the first and principal
   explorers was Antonio Bosio, "the Columbus of this subterranean world."
   His researches were published after his death (Roma, 1632). Filippo
   Neri, Carlo Borromeo, and other restorers of Romanism spent, like St.
   Jerome of old, whole nights in prayer amid these ruins of the age of
   martyrs. But Protestant divines discredited these discoveries as
   inventions of Romish divines seeking in heathen sand-pits for Christian
   saints who never lived, and Christian martyrs who never died. [530] 30

   In the present century the discovery and investigation of the catacombs
   has taken a new start, and is now an important department of Christian
   archaeology. The dogmatic and sectarian treatment has given way to a
   scientific method with the sole aim to ascertain the truth. The
   acknowledged pioneer in this subterranean region of ancient church
   history is the Cavalier John Baptist de Rossi, a devout, yet liberal
   Roman Catholic. His monumental Italian work (Roma Sotterranea,
   1864-1877) has been made accessible in judicious condensations to
   French, German, and English readers by Allard (1871), Kraus (1873 and
   1879), Northcote & Brownlow (1869 and 1879). Other writers, Protestant
   as well as Roman Catholic, are constantly adding to our stores of
   information. Great progress has been made in the chronology and the
   interpretation of the pictures in the catacombs.

   And yet the work is only begun. More than one half of ancient Christian
   cemeteries are waiting for future exploration. De Rossi treats chiefly
   of one group of Roman catacombs, that of Callistus. The catacombs in
   Naples, Syracuse, Girgenti, Melos, Alexandria, Cyrene, are very
   imperfectly known; still others in the ancient apostolic churches may
   yet be discovered, and furnish results as important for church history
   as the discoveries of Ilium, Mycenae, and Olympia for that of classical
   Greece.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [516] Mosheim and Gibbon in the last century, and even Neander,
   Gieseler, andBaur, in our age, ignore the very existence of the
   catacombs, except that Gieseler quotes the well-known passage of
   Jerome. But Dean Milman, in his History of Christianity, Hase, Kurtz,
   Kraus, and others, in their manuals, take brief notice of them.

   [517] katakumbion, catacumba, also (in some MSS.) catatumba. Various
   derivations: 1) From kata (down from, downwards, as in katabaino,
   katakeimai, katapempo), and tumbos (compare the late Latin tumba, the
   French tombe, tombeau, and the English tomb, grave), i.e. a tomb down
   in the earth, as distinct from tombs on the surface. This corresponds
   best to the thing itself. 2) From kata and koimao (to sleep), which
   would make it equivalent to koimeterion, dormitorium, sleeping place.
   3) From kata and kumbe (the hollow of a vessel) or (cup), kumbion (a
   small cup, Lat. cymbium), which would simply give us the idea of a
   hollow place. So Venables in Smith and Cheetham. Very unlikely. 4) A
   hybrid term from katav and the Latin decumbo, to lie down, to recline.
   So Marchi, and Northcote and Brownlow (I. 263). The word first occurs
   in a Christian calendar of the third or fourth century (in Catacumbas),
   and in a letter of Gregory I. to the Empress Constantia, towards the
   end of the sixth century (Epp. III. 30), with a special local
   application to San Sebastian. The earlier writers use the terms
   koimeteria, coemeteria (whence our cemetery), also cryptae, crypts

   [518] So Aringhi, Baronius; Severano, Bottari, Boldetti, and all
   writers prior to Marchi, and his pupils, the two brothers De Rossi, who
   turned the current of opinion. See Northcote and Br. I. 377 sqq.

   [519] The sand-pits and stone-quarries were made wide enough for a
   horse and cart, and are cut in the tufa litoide and pozzolana pura,
   which furnish the best building material in Rome; while the catacombs
   have generally very narrow passages, run in straight lines, often cross
   each other at sharp angles, and are excavated in the tufa granulare,
   which is too soft for building-stone, and too much mixed with earth to
   be used for cement, but easily worked, and adapted for the construction
   of galleries and chambers. See Northcote and Br. I. 376-390. The
   exceptions are also stated by these authors. J. H. Parker has
   discovered loculi for Christian burial in the recesses of a deserted
   sand-pit.

   [520] See the remarks of Northcote and Br. I. 276 against J. H. Parker,
   who asserts the mixed use of the catacombs for heathens and
   Christians."

   [521] This view is supported by Professor Mommsen, the Roman historian,
   who says (in "Contemporary Review," vol. xxvii. p. 168): "Associations
   of poor people who clubbed together for the burial of their members
   were not only tolerated but supported by the imperial government, which
   otherwise was very strict against associations. From this point of
   view, therefore, there was no legal impediment to the acquisition of
   these properties. Christian associations have from the very beginning
   paid great attention to their burials; it was considered the duty of
   the wealthier members to provide for the burial of the poor, and St.
   Ambrose still allowed churches to sell their communion plate, in order
   to enlarge the cemeteries of the faithful. The catacombs show what
   could be achieved by such means at Rome. Even if their fabulous
   dimensions are reduced to their right measure, they form an immense
   work, without beauty and ornament, despising in architecture and
   inscription not only pomp and empty phraseology, but even nicety and
   correctness, avoiding the splendor and grandeur as well as the tinsel
   and vanity of the life of the great town that was hurrying and
   throbbing above, the true commentary of the words of Christ-'My kingdom
   is not of this world.'

   [522] Euseb. H. E. VII. 13: 1, ta ton kaloumenon koimeterion
   apolambanein epitrepon choria.

   [523] Roller says (in Lichtenberger's Encycl. des Sc. Rel. II.
   685)."Les juifs ensevelissaient dans le roc. A Rome ils ont creusé de
   grandes catacombes presque identique à celles des chrétiens. Ceux-ci
   ont été leurs imitateurs. Les Etrusques se servaient aussi de grottes;
   mais ils ne les reliaient point par des galeries illimitées." Dean
   Stanley (l.c. p. 274): "The Catacombs are the standing monuments of the
   Oriental and Jewish character, even of Western Christianity. The fact
   that they are the counterparts of the rock-hewn tombs of Palestine, and
   yet more closely of the Jewish cemeteries in the neighborhood of Rome,
   corresponds to the fact that the early Roman Church was not a Latin but
   an Eastern community, speaking Greek and following the usages of Syria.
   And again, the ease with which the Roman Christians had recourse to
   these cemeteries is an indication of the impartiality of the Roman law,
   which extended (as De Rossi has well pointed out) to this despised sect
   the same protection in regard to burial, even during the times of
   persecution, that was accorded to the highest in the land. They thus
   bear witness, to the unconscious fostering care of the Imperial
   Government over the infant church. They are thus monuments, not so much
   of the persecution as of the toleration which the Christians received
   at the hands of the Roman Empire."

   [524] De Rossi (as quoted by Northcote and Brownlow I. 112): "Precisely
   in those cemeteries to which history or tradition assigns apostolic
   origin, I see, in the light of the most searching archaeological
   criticism, the cradle both of Christian subterranean sepulchres, of
   Christian art, and of Christian inscriptions; there I had memorials of
   persons who appear to belong to the times of the Flavii and of Trajan;
   and finally I discover precise dates of those times."

   [525] Schultze (Die Katak., p. 73 and 83) maintains in opposition to
   Marchi, that the catacombs were nothing but burial place, and used only
   for the burial service, and that the little chapels (ecclesiolae) were
   either private sepulchral chambers or post-Constantinian structures.

   [526] Com. in Ez. 40.

   [527] He refers to such passages as Ps. 55:15; Num. 16:33.

   [528] Aen. II. 755: "Horror on every side, and terrible even the
   silence." Or in German: "Grauen rings um mich her, und schreckvoll
   selber die Stille."

   [530] E. g. Bishop Burnet (who visited the catacombs in 1685): Letters
   from Italy and Switzerland in 1685 and 1686. He believed that the
   catacombs were the common burial places of the ancient heathen. G. S.
   Cyprian (1699), J. Basnage (1699), and Peter Zorn (1703), wrote on the
   subject in polemical interest against Rome.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 84. Description of the Catacombs.

   The Roman catacombs are long and narrow passages or galleries and
   cross-galleries excavated in the bowels of the earth in the hills
   outside and around the city, for the burial of the dead. They are dark
   and gloomy, with only an occasional ray of light from above. The
   galleries have two or more stories, all filled with tombs, and form an
   intricate net-work or subterranean labyrinth. Small compartments
   (loculi) were cut out like shelves in the perpendicular walls for the
   reception of the dead, and rectangular chambers (cubicula) for
   families, or distinguished martyrs. They were closed with a slab of
   marble or tile. The more wealthy were laid in sarcophagi. The ceiling
   is flat, sometimes slightly arched. Space was economized so as to leave
   room usually only for a single person; the average width of the
   passages being 2½ to 3 feet. This economy may be traced to the poverty
   of the early Christians, and also to their strong sense of community in
   life and in death. The little oratories with altars and episcopal
   chairs cut in the tufa are probably of later construction, and could
   accommodate only a few persons at a time. They were suited for funeral
   services and private devotion, but not for public worship.

   The galleries were originally small, but gradually extended to enormous
   length. Their combined extent is counted by hundreds of miles, and the
   number of graves by millions. [531] 31

   The oldest and best known of the Roman cemeteries is that of St.
   Sebastian, originally called Ad Catacumbas, on the Appian road, a
   little over two miles south of the city walls. It was once, it is said,
   the temporary resting-place of the bodies of St. Peter and St. Paul,
   before their removal to the basilicas named after them; also of
   forty-six bishops of Rome, and of a large number of martyrs.

   The immense cemetery of Pope Callistus (218-223) on the Via Appia
   consisted originally of several small and independent burial grounds
   (called Lucinae, Zephyrini, Callisti, Hippoliti). It has been
   thoroughly investigated by De Rossi. The most ancient part is called
   after Lucina, and measures 100 Roman feet in breadth by 180 feet in
   length. The whole group bears the name of Callistus, probably because
   his predecessor, Zephyrinus "set him over the cemetery" (of the church
   of Rome). [532] 32 He was then a deacon. He stands high in the
   estimation of the Roman church, but the account given of him by
   Hippolytus is quite unfavorable. He was certainly a remarkable man, who
   rose from slavery to the highest dignity of the church.

   The cemetery of Domitilla (named in the fourth century St. Petronillae,
   Nerei et Achillei) is on the Via Ardeatina, and its origin is traced
   back to Flavia Domitilla, grand-daughter or great-grand-daughter of
   Vespasian. She was banished by Domitian (about a.d. 95) to the island
   of Pontia "for professing Christ." [533] 33 Her chamberlains (eunuchi
   cubicularii), Nerus and Achilleus, according to an uncertain tradition,
   were baptized by St. Peter, suffered martyrdom, and were buried in a
   farm belonging to their mistress. In another part of this cemetery De
   Rossi discovered the broken columns of a subterranean chapel and a
   small chamber with a fresco on the wall, which represents an elderly
   matron named "Veneranda," and a young lady, called in the inscription
   "Petronilla martyr," and pointing to the Holy Scriptures in a chest by
   her side, as the proofs of her faith. The former apparently introduces
   the latter into Paradise. [534] 34 The name naturally suggests the
   legendary daughter of St. Peter. [535] 35 But Roman divines, reluctant
   to admit that the first pope had any children (though his marriage is
   beyond a doubt from the record of the Gospels), understand Petronilla
   to be a spiritual daughter, as Mark was a spiritual son, of the apostle
   (1 Pet. 5:13), and make her the daughter of some Roman Petronius or
   Petro connected with the family of Domitilla.

   Other ancient catacombs are those of Pruetextatus, Priscilla (St.
   Silvestri and St. Marcelli), Basilla (S. Hermetis, Basillae, Proti, et
   Hyacinthi), Maximus, St. Hippolytus, St. Laurentius, St. Peter and
   Marcellinus, St. Agnes, and the Ostrianum (Ad Nymphas Petri, or Fons
   Petri, where Peter is said to have baptized from a natural well). De
   Rossi gives a list of forty-two greater or lesser cemeteries, including
   isolated tombs of martyrs, in and near Rome, which date from the first
   four centuries, and are mentioned in ancient records. [536] 36

   The furniture of the catacombs is instructive and interesting, but most
   of it has been removed to churches and museums, and must be studied
   outside. Articles of ornament, rings, seals, bracelets, neck-laces,
   mirrors, tooth-picks, ear-picks, buckles, brooches, rare coins,
   innumerable lamps of clay (terra-cotta), or of bronze, even of silver
   and amber, all sorts of tools, and in the case of children a variety of
   playthings were inclosed with the dead. Many of these articles are
   carved with the monogram of Christ, or other Christian symbols. (The
   lamps in Jewish cemeteries bear generally a picture of the golden
   candlestick).

   A great number of flasks and cups also, with or without ornamentation,
   are found, mostly outside of the graves, and fastened to the
   grave-lids. These were formerly supposed to have been receptacles for
   tears, or, from the red, dried sediment in them, for the blood of
   martyrs. But later archaeologists consider them drinking vessels used
   in the agapae and oblations. A superstitious habit prevailed in the
   fourth century, although condemned by a council of Carthage (397), to
   give to the dead the eucharistic wine, or to put a cup with the
   consecrated wine in the grave. [537] 37

   The instruments of torture which the fertile imagination of credulous
   people had discovered, and which were made to prove that almost every
   Christian buried in the catacombs was a martyr, are simply implements
   of handicraft. The instinct of nature prompts the bereaved to deposit
   in the graves of their kindred and friends those things which were
   constantly used by them. The idea prevailed also to a large extent that
   the future life was a continuation of the occupations and amusements of
   the present, but free from sin and imperfection.

   On opening the graves the skeleton appears frequently even now very
   well preserved, sometimes in dazzling whiteness, as covered with a
   glistening glory; but falls into dust at the touch.

   [531] I hesitate to state the figures. Roman archaeologists, as Marchi,
   J. B. de Rossi and his brother Michael de R. (a practical
   mathematician), Martigny and others estimate the length of the Roman
   catacombs variously at from 350 to 900 miles, or as "more than the
   whole length of Italy" (Northcote and Brownlow, I. 2). Allowance is
   made for from four to seven millions of graves! It seems incredible
   that there should have been so many Christians in Rome in four
   centuries, even if we include the numerous strangers. All such
   estimates are purely conjectural. See Smith and Cheetham, I. 301. Smyth
   (l.c. p. 15) quotes Rawlinson as saying that 7,000,000 of graves in 400
   years' time gives an average population of from 500,000 to 700,000.
   Total population of Rome, 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 at the beginning of
   the empire.

   [532] This is so stated by Hippolytus, Philosoph. IX. 11. Zephyrinus
   was buried there contrary to the custom of burying the popes in St.
   Peter's crypt in the Vatican. Callistus was hurled from a window in
   Trastevere, and hastily removed to the nearest cemetery on the Via
   Aurelia. The whole report of Hippolytus about Callistus is discredited
   by Northcote and Brownlow (I. 497 sqq.), but without good reason.

   [533] Eusebius, H. E. III. 18. De Rossi distinguishes two Christian
   Domitillas, and defends this view against Mommsen See "Bulletino,"
   1875, pp. 69-77, and Mommsen, Corp. Inscript. Lat., Tom. VI. p. 172, as
   quoted by Northcote and Br. I. 86. See also Mommsen in "The Contemp.
   Review," XVII. 169 sq. Lightfoot. Philippians, p. 22, and S. Clement of
   R., 257.

   [537] The curious controversy about these blood-stained phials is not
   yet closed. Chemical experiments have led to no decided results. The
   Congregation of Rites and Relics decided, in 1668, that the phiolae
   cruentae or ampullae sanguinolentaewere blood-vessels of martyrs, and
   Pius IX. confirmed the decision in 1863. It was opposed by
   distinguished Roman scholars (Mabillon, Tillemont, Muratori, the Jesuit
   Père de Buck (De phialis rubricatis, Brussels, 1855), but defended
   again, though cautiously and to a very limited extent by De Rossi (III.
   602), Northcote and Brownlow (II. 330-343), and by F. X. Kraus (Die
   Blutampullen der Röm. Katakomben, 1868, and Ueber den gegenw. Stand der
   Frage nach dem Inhalt und der Bedeutung der röm. Blutampullen, 1872).
   Comp. also Schultze: Die sogen. Blutgläser der Röm. Kat. (1880), and
   Die Katakomben (1882, pp. 226-232). Roller thinks that the phials
   contained probably perfumery, or perhaps eucharistic wine.

   § 85. Pictures and Sculptures.

   The most important remains of the catacombs are the pictures,
   sculptures, and epitaphs.

   I. Pictures. These have already been described in the preceding
   chapter. They are painted al fresco on the wall and ceiling, and
   represent Christian symbols, scenes of Bible history, and allegorical
   conceptions of the Saviour. A few are in pure classic style, and betray
   an early origin when Greek art still flourished in Rome; but most of
   them belong to the period of decay. Prominence is given to pictures of
   the Good Shepherd, and those biblical stories which exhibit the
   conquest of faith and the hope of the resurrection. The mixed character
   of some of the Christian frescos may be explained partly from the
   employment of heathen artists by Christian patrons, partly from old
   reminiscences. The Etrurians and Greeks were in the habit of painting
   their tombs, and Christian Greeks early saw the value of pictorial
   language as a means of instruction. In technical skill the Christian
   art is inferior to the heathen, but its subjects are higher, and its
   meaning is deeper.

   II. The works of sculpture are mostly found on sarcophagi. Many of them
   are collected in the Lateran Museum. Few of them date from the
   ante-Nicene age. [538] 38 They represent in relief the same subjects as
   the wall-pictures, as far as they could be worked in stone or marble,
   especially the resurrection of Lazarus, Daniel among the lions, Moses
   smiting the rock, the sacrifice of Isaac.

   Among the oldest Christian sarcophagi are those of St. Helena, the
   mother of Constantine (d. 328), and of Constantia, his daughter (d.
   354), both of red porphyry, and preserved in the Vatican Museum. The
   sculpture on the former probably represents the triumphal entry of
   Constantine into Rome after his victory over Maxentius; the sculpture
   on the latter, the cultivation of the vine, probably with a symbolical
   meaning. [539] 39

   The richest and finest of all the Christian sarcophagi is that of
   Junius Bassus, Prefect of Rome, a.d. 359, and five times Consul, in the
   crypt of St. Peter's in the Vatican. [540] 40 It was found in the
   Vatican cemetery (1595). It is made of Parian marble in Corinthian
   style. The subjects represented in the upper part are the sacrifice of
   Abraham, the capture of St. Peter, Christ seated between Peter and
   Paul, the capture of Christ, and Pilate washing his hands; in the lower
   part are the temptation of Adam and Eve, suffering Job, Christ's
   entrance into Jerusalem, Daniel among the lions, and the capture of St.
   Paul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [538] Renan dates the oldest sculptures from the end of the third
   century: "Les sarcophages sculptés, représentant des scènes sacrées,
   apparaissent vers la fin du IIIe siècle. Comme les peintures
   chrétiennes, ils ne s'écartent guère, sauf pour le sujet, des habitudes
   de l'art païen du méme temps." (Marc Auréle, p. 546). Comp. also
   Schultze, Die Katak. 165-186, and especially the IXth part of John
   Henry Parker's great work, which treats on the Tombs in and near Rome,
   1877.

   pp. 41 and 42.

   § 86. Epitaphs.


   "Rudely written, but each letter

   Full of hope, and yet of heart-break,

   Full of all the tender pathos of the Here

   and the Hereafter."

   To perpetuate, by means of sepulchral inscriptions, the memory of
   relatives and friends, and to record the sentiments of love and esteem,
   of grief and hope, in the face of death and eternity, is a custom
   common to all civilized ages and nations. These epitaphs are limited by
   space, and often provoke rather than satisfy curiosity, but contain
   nevertheless in poetry or prose a vast amount of biographical and
   historical information. Many a grave-yard is a broken record of the
   church to which it belongs.

   The Catacombs abound in such monumental inscriptions, Greek and Latin,
   or strangely mixed (Latin words in Greek characters), often rudely
   written, badly spelt, mutilated, and almost illegible, with and without
   symbolical figures. The classical languages were then in a process of
   decay, like classical eloquence and art, and the great majority of
   Christians were poor and illiterate people. One name only is given in
   the earlier epitaphs, sometimes the age, and the day of burial, but not
   the date of birth.

   More than fifteen thousand epitaphs have been collected, classified,
   and explained by De Rossi from the first six centuries in Rome alone,
   and their number is constantly increasing. Benedict XIV. founded, in
   1750, a Christian Museum, and devoted a hill in the Vatican to the
   collection of ancient sarcophagi. Gregory XVI. and Pius IX. patronized
   it. In this Lapidarian Gallery the costly pagan and the simple
   Christian inscriptions and sarcophagi confront each other on opposite
   walls, and present a striking contrast. Another important collection is
   in the Kircherian Museum, in the Roman College, another in the
   Christian Museum of the University of Berlin. [541] 41 The entire field
   of ancient epigraphy, heathen and Christian in Italy and other
   countries, has been made accessible by the industry and learning of
   Gruter, Muratori, Marchi, De Rossi, Le Blant, Böckh, Kirchhoff, Orelli,
   Mommsen, Henzen, Hübner, Waddington, McCaul.

   The most difficult part of this branch of archaeology is the chronology
   (the oldest inscriptions being mostly undated). [542] 42 Their chief
   interest for the church historian is their religion, as far as it may
   be inferred from a few words.

   The key-note of the Christian epitaphs, as compared with the heathen,
   is struck by Paul in his words of comfort to the Thessalonians, that
   they should not sorrow like the heathen who have no hope, but remember
   that, as Jesus rose from the dead, so God will raise them also that are
   fallen asleep in Jesus.

   Hence, while the heathen epitaphs rarely express a belief in
   immortality, but often describe death as an eternal sleep, the grave as
   a final home, and are pervaded by a tone of sadness, the Christian
   epitaphs are hopeful and cheerful. The farewell on earth is followed by
   a welcome from heaven. Death is but a short sleep; the soul is with
   Christ and lives in God, the body waits for a joyful resurrection: this
   is the sum and substance of the theology of Christian epitaphs. The
   symbol of Christ (Ichthys) is often placed at the beginning or end to
   show the ground of this hope. Again and again we find the brief, but
   significant words: "in peace;" [543] 43 "he" or "she sleeps in peace;"
   [544] 44 "live in God," or "in Christ;" "live forever." [545] 45 "He
   rests well." "God quicken thy spirit." "Weep not, my child; death is
   not eternal." "Alexander is not dead, but lives above the stars, and
   his body rests in this tomb." [546] 46 "Here Gordian, the courier from
   Gaul, strangled for the faith, with his whole family, rests in peace.
   The maid servant, Theophila, erected this." [547] 47

   At the same time stereotyped heathen epitaphs continued to be used but
   of course not in a polytheistic sense), as "sacred to the funeral
   gods," or "to the departed spirits." [548] 48 The laudatory epithets of
   heathen epitaphs are rare, [549] 49 but simple terms of natural
   affection very frequent, as "My sweetest child;" "Innocent little
   lamb;" "My dearest husband;" "My dearest wife;" "My innocent dove;" "My
   well-deserving father," or "mother." [550] 50 A. and B. "lived
   together" (for 15, 20, 30, 50, or even 60 years) "without any complaint
   or quarrel, without taking or giving offence." [551] 51 Such
   commemoration of conjugal happiness and commendations of female
   virtues, as modesty, chastity, prudence, diligence, frequently occur
   also on pagan monuments, and prove that there were many exceptions to
   the corruption of Roman society, as painted by Juvenal and the
   satirists.

   Some epitaphs contain a request to the dead in heaven to pray for the
   living on earth. [552] 52 At a later period we find requests for
   intercession in behalf of the departed when once, chiefly through the
   influence of Pope Gregory I., purgatory became an article of general
   belief in the Western church. [553] 53 But the overwhelming testimony
   of the oldest Christian epitaphs is that the pious dead are already in
   the enjoyment of peace, and this accords with the Saviour's promise to
   the penitent thief, and with St. Paul's desire to depart and be with
   Christ, which is far better. [554] 54 Take but this example: "Prima,
   thou livest in the glory of God, and in the peace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ." [555] 55

   Notes.

   mutilated. De Rossi assigns this epitaph to the beginning of the third
   century.]

   24. Cornelius. Martyr. Ep. [iscopus].

   II. The Autun Inscription.

   This Greek inscription was discovered a.d. 1839 in the cemetery Saint
   Pierre l'Estrier near Autun (Augustodunum, the ancient capital of
   Gallia Aeduensis), first made known by Cardinal Pitra, and thoroughly
   discussed by learned archaeologists of different countries. See the
   Spicilegium Solesmense (ed. by Pitra), vols. I.-III., Raf. Garrucci,
   Monuments d' epigraphie ancienne, Paris 1856, 1857; P. Lenormant,
   Mémoire sur l' inscription d' Autun, Paris 1855; H. B. Marriott, The
   Testimony of the Catacombs, Lond. 1870, pp. 113-188. The Jesuit fathers
   Secchi and Garrucci find in it conclusive evidence of
   transubstantiation and purgatory, but Marriott takes pains to refute
   them. Comp. also Schultze, Katak. p. 118. The Ichthys-symbol figures
   prominently in the inscription, and betrays an early origin, but
   archaeologists differ: Pitra, Garrucci and others assign it to a.d.
   160-202; Kirchhoff, Marriott, and Schultze, with greater probability,
   to the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century,
   Lenormant and Le Blant to the fifth or sixth. De Rossi observes that
   the characters are not so old as the ideas which they express. The
   inscription has some gaps which must be filled out by conjecture. It is
   a memorial of Pectorius to his parents and friends, in two parts; the
   first six lines are an acrostic (Ichthys), and contain words of the
   dead (probably the mother); in the second part the son speaks. The
   first seems to be older. Schultze conjectures that it is an old
   Christian hymn. The inscription begins with Ichthuos a (uraniou hag)
   ion (or perhaps theion) genos, and concludes with mneseo Pektoriou, who
   prepared the monument for his parents. The following is the translation
   (partly conjectural) of Marriott (l.c. 118):

   'Offspring of the heavenly Ichthys, see that a heart of holy reverence
   be thine, now that from Divine waters thou hast received, while yet
   among mortals, a fount of life that is to immortality. Quicken thy
   soul, beloved one, with ever-flowing waters of wealth-giving wisdom,
   and receive the honey-sweet food of the Saviour of the saints. Eat with
   a longing hunger, holding Ichthys in thine hands.'

   'To Ichthys ... Come nigh unto me, my Lord [and] Saviour [be thou my
   Guide] I entreat Thee, Thou Light of them for whom the hour of death is
   past.'

   'Aschandius, my Father, dear unto mine heart, and thou [sweet Mother,
   and all] that are mine ... remember Pectorius.'

   [541] Under the care of Professor Piper (a pupil of Neander), who even
   before De Rossi introduced a scientific knowledge of the sepulchral
   monuments and inscriptions. Comp. his "Monumental Theology," and his
   essay "Ueber den kirchenhistorischen Gewinn aus Inschriften, in the
   Jahrbücher f. D. Theologie," 1875.

   [542] De Rossi traces some up to the first century, but Renan
   (Marc-Auréle, p. 536) maintains: "Les inscriptions chrétiennes des
   catacombes ne remontent qu' au commencement du IIIesiècle."

   (shalom).

   [544] Dormit in pace; requiescit in pace; in pace Domini; koimatai en

   meaning: a precious treasure intrusted to faithful keeping for a short
   time.

   [545] Vivas, orvive in Deo; vivas in aeternum; vivas inter sanctos.
   Contrast with these the pagan declamations: Sit tibi terra levis; Ossa
   tua bene quiescant Ave; Vale.

   [546] This inscription in the cemetery of Callistus dates from the time
   of persecution, probably in the third century, and alludes to it in
   these words: "For while on his knees, and about to sacrifice to the
   true God, he was led away to execution. O sad times! in which among
   sacred rites and prayers, even in caverns, we are not safe. What can be
   more wretched than such a life? and what than such a death? when they
   cannot be buried by their friends and relations-still at the end they
   shine like stars in heaven (tandem in caelo corruscant)." See Maitland,
   The Church in the Cat., second ed. p. 40.

   [547] This inscription is in Latin words, but in Greek uncial letters.
   See Perret, II. 152, and Aringhi, p. 387.

   [548] D. M. or D. M. S. =Dis Manibus sacrum (others explain: Deo Magno
   or Maximo);memoriae aeterrae, etc. See Schultze, p. 250 sq. Sometimes
   the monogram of Christ is inserted before S, and then the meaning may
   be Deo Magno Christo Sacrum, or Christo Salvatori. So Northcote, p. 99,
   who refers to Tit. 2:13.

   [549] More frequent in those after the middle of the fourth century, as
   inconparabilis, mirae sapientiae or innocentiae, rarissimi exempli,
   eximiae bonitatis.

   [550] Dulcis, dulcissimus, ordulcissima, carus, orcara, carissimus,
   optimus, incomparabilis, famulus Dei, puella Deo placita, agathos,
   hagios , theosebes, semnos, etc.

   [551] Sine ulla querela, sine ulla contumelia, sine laesione animi,
   sine ulla offensa, sine jurgio, sine lite motesta, etc.

   [552] "Pete, or roga, ora, pro nobis, pro parentibus, pro conjuge, pro
   filiis, pro sorore." These petitions are comparatively rare among the
   thousands of undated inscriptions before Constantine, and mostly
   confined to members of the family. The Autun inscription (probably from
   the fourth century) ends with the petition of Pectorius to his departed
   parents, to think of him as often as they look upon Christ. See
   Marriott, p. 185.

   [553] Dr. McCaul, of Toronto (as quoted in Smith and Cheetham, 1. 856)
   says: I recollect but two examples in Christian epitaphs of the first
   six centuries of the address to the reader for his prayers, so common
   in mediaeval times."

   [554] Luke 23:43; Phil. 1:23; 2 Cor. 5:8.

   [555] Prima, vives in gloria Dei et in pace Domini nostri."Scratched in
   the mortar round a grave in the cemetery of Thraso, in Rome, quoted by
   Northcote, p. 89. He also quotes Paulinus of Nola, who represents a
   whole host of saints going forth from heaven to receive the soul of St.
   Felix as soon as it had left the body, and conducting it in triumph
   before the throne of God. A distinction, however was made by Tertullian
   and other fathers between Paradise or Abraham's bosom, whither the
   pious go, and heaven proper. Comp. Roller's discussion of the idea of
   refrigerium which often meets us in the epitaphs, Les Catacombes, I.
   225 sqq.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 87. Lessons of the Catacombs.

   The catacombs represent the subterranean Christianity of the
   ante-Nicene age. They reveal the Christian life in the face of death
   and eternity. Their vast extent, their solemn darkness, their
   labyrinthine mystery, their rude epitaphs, pictures, and sculptures,
   their relics of handicrafts worship, and martyrdom give us a lively and
   impressive idea of the social and domestic condition, the poverty and
   humility, the devotional spirit, the trials and sufferings, the faith
   and hope of the Christians from the death of the apostles to the
   conversion of Constantine. A modern visitor descending alive into this
   region of the dead, receives the same impression as St. Jerome more
   than fifteen centuries ago: he is overcome by the solemn darkness, the
   terrible silence, and the sacred associations; only the darkness is
   deeper, and the tombs are emptied of their treasures. "He who is
   thoroughly steeped in the imagery of the catacombs," says Dean Stanley,
   not without rhetorical exaggeration, "will be nearer to the thoughts of
   the early church than he who has learned by heart the most elaborate
   treatise even of Tertullian or of Origen." [556] 56

   The discovery of this subterranean necropolis has been made unduly
   subservient to polemical and apologetic purposes both by Roman Catholic
   and Protestant writers. The former seek and find in it monumental
   arguments for the worship of saints, images, and relics, for the cultus
   of the Virgin Mary, the primacy of Peter, the seven sacraments, the
   real presence, even for transubstantiation, and purgatory; while the
   latter see there the evidence of apostolic simplicity of life and
   worship, and an illustration of Paul's saying that God chose the
   foolish, the weak, and the despised things of the world to put to shame
   them that are wise and strong and mighty. [557] 57

   A full solution of the controversial questions would depend upon the
   chronology of the monuments and inscriptions, but this is exceedingly
   uncertain. The most eminent archaeologists hold widely differing
   opinions. John Baptist de Rossi of Rome, the greatest authority on the
   Roman Catholic side, traces some paintings and epitaphs in the crypts
   of St. Lucina and St. Domitilia back even to the close of the first
   century or the beginning of the second. On the other hand, J. H.
   Parker, of Oxford, an equally eminent archaeologist, maintains that
   fully three-fourths of the fresco-paintings belong to the latest
   restorations of the eighth and ninth centuries, and that "of the
   remaining fourth a considerable number are of the sixth century." He
   also asserts that in the catacomb pictures "there are no religious
   subjects before the time of Constantine," that "during the fourth and
   fifth centuries they are entirely confined to Scriptural subjects," and
   that there is "not a figure of a saint or martyr before the sixth
   century, and very few before the eighth, when they became abundant."
   [558] 58 Renan assigns the earliest pictures of the catacombs to the
   fourth century, very few (in Domitilla) to the third. [559] 59 Theodore
   Mommsen deems De Rossi's argument for the early date of the Coemeterium
   Domitillae before a.d. 95 inconclusive, and traces it rather to the
   times of Hadrian and Pius than to those of the Flavian emperors. [560]
   60

   But in any case it is unreasonable to seek in the catacombs for a
   complete creed any more than in a modern grave-yard. All we can expect
   there is the popular elements of eschatology, or the sentiments
   concerning death and eternity, with incidental traces of the private
   and social life of those times. Heathen, Jewish, Mohammedan, and
   Christian cemeteries have their characteristic peculiarities, yet all
   have many things in common which are inseparable from human nature.
   Roman Catholic cemeteries are easily recognized by crosses, crucifixes,
   and reference to purgatory and prayers for the dead; Protestant
   cemeteries by the frequency of Scripture passages in the epitaphs, and
   the expressions of hope and joy in prospect of the immediate transition
   of the pious dead to the presence of Christ. The catacombs have a
   character of their own, which distinguishes them from Roman Catholic as
   well as Protestant cemeteries.

   Their most characteristic symbols and pictures are the Good Shepherd,
   the Fish, and the Vine. These symbols almost wholly disappeared after
   the fourth century, but to the mind of the early Christians they
   vividly expressed, in childlike simplicity, what is essential to
   Christians of all creeds, the idea of Christ and his salvation, as the
   only comfort in life and in death. The Shepherd, whether from the
   Sabine or the Galilean hills, suggested the recovery of the lost sheep,
   the tender care and protection, the green pasture and fresh fountain,
   the sacrifice of life: in a word, the whole picture of a Saviour. [561]
   61 The popularity of this picture enables us to understand the immense
   popularity of the Pastor of Hermas, a religious allegory which was
   written in Rome about the middle of the second century, and read in
   many churches till the fourth as a part of the New Testament (as in the
   Sinaitic Codex). The Fish expressed the same idea of salvation, under a
   different form, but only to those who were familiar with the Greek (the
   anagrammatic meaning of Ichthys) and associated the fish with daily
   food and the baptismal water of regeneration. The Vine again sets forth
   the vital union of the believer with Christ and the vital communion of
   all believers among themselves.

   Another prominent feature of the catacombs is their hopeful and joyful
   eschatology. They proclaim in symbols and words a certain conviction of
   the immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body, rooted
   and grounded in a living union with Christ in this world. [562] 62
   These glorious hopes comforted and strengthened the early Christians in
   a time of poverty, trial, and persecution. This character stands in
   striking contrast with the preceding and contemporary gloom of
   paganism, for which the future world was a blank, and with the
   succeeding gloom of the mediaeval eschatology which presented the
   future world to the most serious Christians as a continuation of penal
   sufferings. This is the chief, we may say, the only doctrinal, lesson
   of the catacombs.

   On some other points they incidentally shed new light, especially on
   the spread of Christianity and the origin of Christian art. Their
   immense extent implies that Christianity was numerically much stronger
   in heathen Rome than was generally supposed. [563] 63 Their numerous
   decorations prove conclusively, either that the primitive Christian
   aversion to pictures and sculptures, inherited from the Jews, was not
   so general nor so long continued as might be inferred from some
   passages of ante-Nicene writers, or, what is more likely, that the
   popular love for art inherited from the Greeks and Romans was little
   affected by the theologians, and ultimately prevailed over the scruples
   of theorizers.

   The first discovery of the catacombs was a surprise to the Christian
   world, and gave birth to wild fancies about the incalculable number of
   martyrs, the terrors of persecution, the subterranean assemblies of the
   early Christians, as if they lived and died, by necessity or
   preference, in darkness beneath the earth. A closer investigation has
   dispelled the romance, and deepened the reality.

   There is no contradiction between the religion of the ante-Nicene
   monuments and the religion of the ante-Nicene literature. They
   supplement and illustrate each other. Both exhibit to us neither the
   mediaeval Catholic nor the modern Protestant, but the post-apostolic
   Christianity of confessors and martyrs, simple, humble, unpretending,
   unlearned, unworldly, strong in death and in the hope of a blissful
   resurrection; free from the distinctive dogmas and usages of later
   times; yet with that strong love for symbolism, mysticism, asceticism,
   and popular superstitions which we find in the writings of Justin
   Martyr, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen.

   [558] Catacombs, Pref. p. xi. The writer of the article Catacombs in
   the "Encycl. Brit." v. 214 (ninth ed.), is of the same opinion: "It is
   tolerably certain that the existing frescos are restorations of the
   eighth, or even a later century, from which the character of the
   earlier work can only very imperfectly be discovered." He then refers
   to Parker's invaluable photographs taken in the catacombs by magnesian
   light, and condemns, with Milman, the finished drawings in Perret's
   costly work as worthless to the historian, who wants truth and
   fidelity.

   [561] Stanley, 1.c., p. 283: "What was the popular Religion of the
   first Christians? It was, in one word, the Religion of the Good
   Shepherd. The kindness, the courage, the grace, the love, the beauty of
   the Good Shepherd was to them, if we may so say, Prayer Book and
   Articles, Creeds and Canons, all in one. They looked on that figure,
   and it conveyed to them all that they wanted. As ages passed on, the
   Good Shepherd faded away from the mind of the Christian world, and
   other emblems of the Christian faith have taken his place. Instead of
   the gracious and gentle Pastor, there came the Omnipotent Judge or the
   Crucified Sufferer, or the Infant in His Mother's arms, or the Master
   in His Parting Supper, or the figures of innumerable saints and angels,
   or the elaborate expositions of the various forms of theological
   controversy."

   [562] See the concluding chapter in the work of Roller, II. 347 sqq.
   Raoul-Rochette characterizes the art of the Catacombs as "unsystème
   d'illusions consolantes." Schultze sees in the sepulchral symbols
   chiefly Auferstehungsgedanken and Auferstehungshoffnungen. Heinrici
   dissents from him by extending the symbolism to the present life as a
   life of hope in Christ. "Nicht der Gedanke an die Auferstehung des
   Fleisches für sich, sondern die christliche Hoffnung überhaupt, wie sie
   aus der sicheren Lebensgemeinschaft mit Christus erblüht und Leben wie
   Sterben des Gläubigen beherrscht, bedingt die Wahl der religiös
   bedeutsamen Bilder. Sie sind nicht Symbole der einstigen Auferstehung,
   sondern des unverlierbaren Heilsbesitzes in Christus." ("Studien und
   Krit." 1842, p. 729).

   [563] Theodore Mommsen (in "The Contemp. Rev." for May, 1871, p. 167):
   The enormous space occupied by the burial vaults of Christian Rome, in
   their extent not surpassed even by the system of cloacae or sewers of
   Republican Rome, is certainly the work of that community which St. Paul
   addressed in his Epistle to the Romans--a living witness of its immense
   development corresponding to the importance of the capital."

   § 89. Moral Corruption of the Roman Empire.

   Besides the Lit. quoted in § 88, comp. the historical works on the
   Roman Empire by Gibbon, Merivale, and Ranke; also J. J. A. Ampère's
   Histoire Romaine à Rome (1856-64, 4 vols.).

   Friedlaender'sSittengeschichte Roms (from Augustus to the Antonines.

   der römischen Alterthümer (Leipz. 1871, second ed. 1876, 7 vols.,
   divided into Staatsrecht, Staatsverwaltung, Privatleben).

   Christianity is not only the revelation of truth, but also the fountain
   of holiness under the unceasing inspiration of the spotless example of
   its Founder, which is more powerful than all the systems of moral
   philosophy. It attests its divine origin as much by its moral workings
   as by its pure doctrines. By its own inherent energy, without noise and
   commotion, without the favor of circumstance--nay, in spite of all
   possible obstacles, it has gradually wrought the greatest moral
   reformation, we should rather say, regeneration of society which
   history has ever seen while its purifying, ennobling, and cheering
   effects upon the private life of countless individuals are beyond the
   reach of the historian, though recorded in God's book of life to be
   opened on the day of judgment.

   To appreciate this work, we must first review the moral condition of
   heathenism in its mightiest embodiment in history.

   When Christianity took firm foothold on earth, the pagan civilization
   and the Roman empire had reached their zenith. The reign of Augustus
   was the golden age of Roman literature; his successors added Britain
   and Dacia to the conquests of the Republic; internal organization was
   perfected by Trajan and the Antonines. The fairest countries of Europe,
   and a considerable part of Asia and Africa stood under one imperial
   government with republican forms, and enjoyed a well-ordered
   jurisdiction. Piracy on the seas was abolished; life and property were
   secure. Military roads, canals, and the Mediterranean Sea facilitated
   commerce and travel; agriculture was improved, and all branches of
   industry flourished. Temples, theatres, aqueducts, public baths, and
   magnificent buildings of every kind adorned the great cities;
   institutions of learning disseminated culture; two languages with a
   classic literature were current in the empire, the Greek in the East,
   the Latin in the West; the book trade, with the manufacture of paper,
   was a craft of no small importance, and a library belonged to every
   respectable house. The book stores and public libraries were in the
   most lively streets of Rome, and resorted to by literary people.
   Hundreds of slaves were employed as scribes, who wrote simultaneously
   at the dictation of one author or reader, and multiplied copies almost
   as fast as the modern printing press. [564] 64 The excavations of
   Pompeii and Herculaneum reveal a high degree of convenience and taste
   in domestic life even in provincial towns; and no one can look without
   amazement at the sublime and eloquent ruins of Rome, the palaces of the
   Caesars, the Mausoleum of Hadrian, the Baths of Caracalla, the
   Aqueducts, the triumphal arches and columns, above all the Colosseum,
   built by Vespasian, to a height of one hundred and fifty feet, and for
   more than eighty thousand spectators. The period of eighty-four years
   from the accession of Nerva to the death of Marcus Aurelius has been
   pronounced by high authority "the most happy and prosperous period in
   the history of the world." [565] 65

   But this is only a surface view. The inside did not correspond to the
   outside. Even under the Antonines the majority of men groaned under the
   yoke of slavery or poverty; gladiatorial shows brutalized the people;
   fierce wars were raging on the borders of the empire; and the most
   virtuous and peaceful of subjects--the Christians--had no rights, and
   were liable at any moment to be thrown before wild beasts, for no other
   reason than the profession of their religion. The age of the full bloom
   of the Graeco-Roman power was also the beginning of its decline. This
   imposing show concealed incurable moral putridity and indescribable
   wretchedness. The colossal piles of architecture owed their erection to
   the bloody sweat of innumerable slaves, who were treated no better than
   so many beasts of burden; on the Flavian amphitheatre alone toiled
   twelve thousand Jewish prisoners of war; and it was built to gratify
   the cruel taste of the people for the slaughter of wild animals and
   human beings made in the image of God. The influx of wealth from
   conquered nations diffused the most extravagant luxury, which collected
   for a single meal peacocks from Samos, pike from Pessinus, oysters from
   Tarentum, dates from Egypt, nuts from Spain, in short the rarest dishes
   from all parts of the world, and resorted to emetics to stimulate
   appetite and to lighten the stomach. "They eat," says Seneca, "and then
   they vomit; they vomit, and then they eat." Apicius, who lived under
   Tiberius, dissolved pearls in the wine he drank, squandered an enormous
   fortune on the pleasures of the table, and then committed suicide.
   [566] 66 He found imperial imitators in Vitellius and Heliogabalus (or
   Elaogabal). A special class of servants, the cosmetes, had charge of
   the dress, the smoothing of the wrinkles, the setting of the false
   teeth, the painting of the eye-brows, of wealthy patricians. Hand in
   hand with this luxury came the vices of natural and even unnatural
   sensuality, which decency forbids to name. Hopeless poverty stood in
   crying contrast with immense wealth; exhausted provinces, with
   revelling cities. Enormous taxes burdened the people, and misery was
   terribly increased by war, pestilence, and famine. The higher or ruling
   families were enervated, and were not strengthened or replenished by
   the lower. The free citizens lost physical and moral vigor, and sank to
   an inert mass. The third class was the huge body of slaves, who
   performed all kinds of mechanical labor, even the tilling of the soil,
   and in times of danger were ready to join the enemies of the empire. A
   proper middle class of industrious citizens, the only firm basis of a
   healthy community, cannot coëxist with slavery, which degrades free
   labor. The army, composed largely of the rudest citizens and of
   barbarians, was the strength of the nation, and gradually stamped the
   government with the character of military despotism. The virtues of
   patriotism, and of good faith in public intercourse, were extinct. The
   basest avarice, suspicion and envy, usuriousness and bribery, insolence
   and servility, everywhere prevailed.

   The work of demoralizing the people was systematically organized and
   sanctioned from the highest places downwards. There were, it is true,
   some worthy emperors of old Roman energy and justice, among whom
   Trajan, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius stand foremost; all honor
   to their memory. But the best they could do was to check the process of
   internal putrefaction, and to conceal the sores for a little while;
   they could not heal them. Most of the emperors were coarse military
   despots, and some of them monsters of wickedness. There is scarcely an
   age in the history of the world, in which so many and so hideous vices
   disgraced the throne, as in the period from Tiberius to Domitian, and
   from Commodus to Galerius. "The annals of the emperors," says Gibbon,
   "exhibit a strong and various picture of human nature, which we should
   vainly seek among the mixed and doubtful characters of modern history.
   In the conduct of those monarchs we may trace the utmost lines of vice
   and virtue; the most exalted perfection and the meanest degeneracy of
   our own species." [567] 67 "Never, probably," says Canon Farrar, "was
   there any age or any place where the worst forms of wickedness were
   practised with a more unblushing effrontery than in the city of Rome
   under the government of the Caesars." [568] 68 We may not even except
   the infamous period of the papal pornocracy, and the reign of Alexander
   Borgia, which were of short duration, and excited disgust and
   indignation throughout the church.

   The Pagan historians of Rome have branded and immortalized the vices
   and crimes of the Caesars: the misanthropy, cruelty, and voluptuousness
   of Tiberius; the ferocious madness of Caius Caligula, who had men
   tortured, beheaded, or sawed in pieces for his amusement, who seriously
   meditated the butchery of the whole senate, raised his horse to the
   dignity of consul and priest, and crawled under the bed in a storm; the
   bottomless vileness of Nero, "the inventor of crime," who poisoned or
   murdered his preceptors Burrhus and Seneca, his half-brother and
   brother-in-law Britannicus, his mother Agrippina, his wife Octavia, his
   mistress Poppaea, who in sheer wantonness set fire to Rome, and then
   burnt innocent Christians for it as torches in his gardens, figuring
   himself as charioteer in the infernal spectacle; the swinish gluttony
   of Vitellins, who consumed millions of money in mere eating; the
   refined wickedness of Domitian, who, more a cat than a tiger, amused
   himself most with the torments of the dying and with catching flies;
   the shameless revelry of Commodus with his hundreds of concubines, and
   ferocious passion for butchering men and beasts on the arena; the mad
   villainy of Heliogabalus, who raised the lowest men to the highest
   dignities, dressed himself in women's clothes, married a dissolute boy
   like himself, in short, inverted all the laws of nature and of decency,
   until at last he was butchered with his mother by the soldiers, and
   thrown into the muddy Tiber. And to fill the measure of impiety and
   wickedness, such imperial monsters were received, after their death, by
   a formal decree of the Senate, into the number of divinities and their
   abandoned memory was celebrated by festivals, temples, and colleges of
   priests! The emperor, in the language of Gibbon, was at once "a priest,
   an atheist, and a god." Some added to it the dignity of amateur actor
   and gladiator on the stage. Domitian, even in his lifetime, caused
   himself to be called "Dominus et Deus noster," and whole herds of
   animals to be sacrificed to his gold and silver statues. It is
   impossible to imagine a greater public and official mockery of all
   religion.

   The wives and mistresses of the emperors were not much better. They
   revelled in luxury and vice, swept through the streets in chariots
   drawn by silver-shod mules, wasted fortunes on a single dress,
   delighted in wicked intrigues, aided their husbands in dark crimes and
   shared at last in their tragic fate, Messalina the wife of Claudius,
   was murdered by the order of her husband in the midst of her nuptial
   orgies with one of her favorites; and the younger Agrippina, the mother
   of Nero, after poisoning her husband, was murdered by her own son, who
   was equally cruel to his wives, kicking one of them to death when she
   was in a state of pregnancy. These female monsters were likewise
   deified, and elevated to the rank of Juno or Venus.

   From the higher regions the corruption descended into the masses of the
   people, who by this time had no sense for anything but "Panem et
   Circenses," and, in the enjoyment of these, looked with morbid
   curiosity and interest upon the most flagrant vices of their masters.

   No wonder that Tacitus, who with terse eloquence and old Roman severity
   exposes the monstrous character of Nero and other emperors to eternal
   infamy, could nowhere, save perhaps among the barbarian Germans,
   discover a star of hope, and foreboded the fearful vengeance of the
   gods, and even the speedy destruction of the empire. And certainly
   nothing could save it from final doom, whose approach was announced
   with ever-growing distinctness by wars, insurrections, inundations,
   earthquakes, pestilence, famine, irruption of barbarians, and prophetic
   calamities of every kind. Ancient Rome, in the slow but certain process
   of dissolution and decay, teaches the


   "... sad moral of all human tales;

   'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past;

   First freedom, and then glory--when that fails,

   Wealth, vice, corruption, barbarism at last."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [564] Friedländer, III. 369 sqq. (5th ed.), gives much interesting
   information about the book trade in Rome, which was far more extensive
   than is generally supposed, and was facilitated by slave-labor. Books
   were cheap. The first book of Martial (over 700 verses in 118 poems)
   cost in the best outfit only 5 denarii (80 cts.). Julius Caesar
   conceived the plan of founding public libraries, but was prevented from
   carrying it into effect. In the fourth century there were no less than
   twenty-eight public libraries in Rome. The ease and enjoyment of
   reading, however, were considerably diminished by the many errors, the
   absence of division and punctuation. Asinius Pollio introduced the
   custom of public readings of new works before invited circles.

   [565] Gibbon, Decline and Fall, ch. III. Renan expresses the same view.

   [566] Either from disgust of life, or because he thought he could not
   live off the remaining ten million of sesterces, after he had wasted
   sixty or a hundred million. Seneca, Ad Helv. x. 9. Heliogabalus chose
   Apicius as his model. These, however, are exceptional cases, and became
   proverbial. See on this whole subject of Roman luxury the third volume
   of Friedlaender's Sittengeschichte, pp. 1-152. He rather modifies the
   usual view, and thinks that Apicius had more imitators among French
   epicures under Louis XIV., XV., and XVI. than among the Roman nobles,
   and that some petty German princes of the eighteenth century, like King
   August of Saxony (who wasted eighty thousand thalers on a single
   opera), and Duke Karl of Württemberg, almost equalled the heathen
   emperors in extravagance and riotous living, at the expense of their
   poor subjects. The wealth of the old Romans was much surpassed by that
   of some modern Russian and English noblemen, French bankers, and
   American merchant princes, but had a much greater purchasing value. The
   richest Romans were Ca. Lentulus, and Narcissus (a freedman of Nero),
   and their fortune amounted to four hundred million sesterces (from
   sixty-five to seventy million marks); while Mazarin left two hundred
   million francs, Baron James Rothschild (d. 1868) two thousand million
   francs (l.c. p. 13 sqq.). The architecture of the imperial age
   surpassed all modern palaces in extravagance and splendor, but in parks
   and gardens the modem English far surpass the ancient Romans (p. 78
   sqq.).

   German by O. J. Reichel. London (Longman, Green & Co.), 1870. Chs.

   F. W. Farrar (Canon of Westminster): Seekers a after God. London
   (Macmillan & Co.), first ed. n. d. (1869), new ed. 1877 (Seneca,
   Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, 336 pages).

   Comp. also the essays on Seneca and Paul by Fleury, Aubertin, Baur,
   Lightfoot, and Reuss (quoted in vol. I. 283).

   Let us now turn to the bright side of heathen morals, as exhibited in
   the teaching and example of Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and
   Plutarch--three pure and noble characters--one a slave, the second an
   emperor, the third a man of letters, two of them Stoics, one a
   Platonist. It is refreshing to look upon a few green spots in the moral
   desert of heathen Rome. We may trace their virtue to the guidance of
   conscience (the good demon of Socrates), or to the independent working
   of the Spirit of God, or to the indirect influence of Christianity,
   which already began to pervade the moral atmosphere beyond the limits
   of the visible church, and to infuse into legislation a spirit of
   humanity and justice unknown before, or to all these causes combined.
   It is certain that there was in the second century a moral current of
   unconscious Christianity, which met the stronger religious current of
   the church and facilitated her ultimate victory.

   It is a remarkable fact that two men who represent the extremes of
   society, the lowest and the highest, were the last and greatest
   teachers of natural virtue in ancient Rome. They shine like lone stars
   in the midnight darkness of prevailing corruption. Epictetus the slave,
   and Marcus Aurelius, the crowned ruler of an empire, are the purest
   among the heathen moralists, and furnish the strongest "testimonies of
   the naturally Christian soul."

   Both belonged to the school of Zeno.

   The Stoic philosophy was born in Greece, but grew into manhood in Rome.
   It was predestinated for that stern, grave, practical, haughty,
   self-governing and heroic character which from the banks of the Tiber
   ruled over the civilized world. [569] 69 In the Republican period Cato
   of Utica lived and died by his own hand a genuine Stoic in practice,
   without being one in theory. Seneca, the contemporary of St. Paul, was
   a Stoic in theory, but belied his almost Christian wisdom in practice,
   by his insatiable avarice, anticipating Francis Bacon as "the wisest,
   brightest, meanest of mankind." [570] 70 Half of his ethics is mere
   rhetoric. In Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius the Stoic theory and
   practice met in beautiful harmony, and freed from its most
   objectionable features. They were the last and the best of that school
   which taught men to live and to die, and offered an asylum for
   individual virtue and freedom when the Roman world at large was rotten
   to the core.

   Stoicism is of all ancient systems of philosophy both nearest to, and
   furthest from, Christianity: nearest in the purity and sublimity of its
   maxims and the virtues of simplicity, equanimity, self-control, and
   resignation to an all-wise Providence; furthest in the spirit of pride,
   self-reliance, haughty contempt, and cold indifference. Pride is the
   basis of Stoic virtue, while humility is the basis of Christian
   holiness; the former is inspired by egotism, the latter by love to God
   and man; the Stoic feels no need of a Saviour, and calmly resorts to
   suicide when the house smokes; while the Christian life begins with a
   sense of sin, and ends with triumph over death; the resignation of the
   Stoic is heartless apathy and a surrender to the iron necessity of
   fate; the resignation of the Christian, is cheerful submission to the
   will of an all-wise and all-merciful Father in heaven; the Stoic sage
   resembles a cold, immovable statue, the Christian saint a living body,
   beating in hearty sympathy with every joy and grief of his fellow-men.
   At best, Stoicism is only a philosophy for the few, while Christianity
   is a religion for all.

   [569] Zeller, l.c. p. 37: "Nearly all the most important Stoics before
   the Christian era belong by birth to Asia Minor, to Syria, and to the
   islands of the Eastern Archipelago. Then follow a line of Roman Stoics,
   among whom the Phrygian Epictetus occupies a prominent place; but
   Greece proper is exclusively represented by men of third or fourth-rate
   capacity."

   [570] Niebuhr says of Seneca: "He acted on the principle that he could
   dispense with the laws of morality which he laid down for others."
   Macaulay: "The business of the philosopher was to declaim in praise of
   poverty, with two millions sterling at usury; to meditate epigrammatic
   conceits about the evils of luxury in gardens which moved the envy of
   sovereigns; to rant about liberty while fawning on the insolent and
   pampered freedman of a tyrant; to celebrate the divine beauty of virtue
   with the same pen which had just before written a defense of the murder
   of a mother by a son." Farrar (l.c. p. 161): "In Seneca's life, we see
   as clearly as in those of many professed Christians, that it is
   impossible to be at once worldly and righteous. His utter failure was
   due to the vain attempt to combine in his own person two opposite
   characters--that of a Stoic and that of a courtier .... In him we see
   some of the most glowing pictures of the nobility of poverty combined
   with the most questionable avidity in the pursuit of wealth." For a
   convenient collection of Seneca's resemblances to Scripture, see
   Farrar, ch. XV., 174-185. The most striking passages are: "A sacred
   spirit dwells within us, the observer and guardian of all our evil and
   our good ... there is no good man without God."Ep. ad Lucil. 41. Comp.
   1 Cor. 3:16."Not one of us is without fault ... no man is found who can
   acquit himself." De Ira I.14; II. 27. Comp. 1 John 1:8. "Riches ....

   § 91. Epictetus.

   Epicteti. Dissertationum ab Arriano digestarum Libri IV. Euiusdem
   Enchiridion et ex deperditis Sermonibus Fragmenta ... recensuit ...
   Joh. Schweighäuser. Lips. 1799, 1800. 5 vols. The Greek text with a
   Latin version and notes.

   The Works of Epictetus. Consisting of his Discourses, in four books,
   the Enchiridion, and Fragments. A translation from the Greek, based on
   that of Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, by Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Boston
   (Little, Brown & Co.), 1865. A fourth ed. of Mrs. Carter's translation
   was published in 1807 with introduction and notes.

   The Discourses of Epictetus, with the Enchiridion and Fragments.
   Translated, with Notes, etc., by George Long. London (George Bell &
   Sons), 1877.

   There are also other English, as well as German and French, versions.

   Epictetus was born before the middle of the first century, at
   Hierapolis, a city in Phrygia, a few miles from Colossae and Laodicea,
   well known to us from apostolic history. He was a compatriot and
   contemporary of Epaphras, a pupil of Paul, and founder of Christian
   churches in that province. [571] 71 There is a bare possibility that he
   had a passing acquaintance with him, if not with Paul himself. He came
   as a slave to Rome with his master, Epaphroditus, a profligate freedman
   and favorite of Nero (whom he aided in committing suicide), and was
   afterwards set at liberty. He rose above his condition. "Freedom and
   slavery," he says in one of his Fragments, "are but names of virtue and
   of vice, and both depend upon the will. No one is a slave whose will is
   free." He was lame in one foot and in feeble health. The lameness, if
   we are to credit the report of Origen, was the result of ill treatment,
   which he bore heroically. When his master put his leg in the torture,
   he quietly said: "You will break my leg;" and when the leg was broken,
   he added: "Did I not tell you so?" This reminds one of Socrates who is
   reported to have borne a scolding and subsequent shower from Xantippe
   with the cool remark: After the thunder comes the rain. Epictetus heard
   the lectures of Musonius Rufus, a distinguished teacher of the Stoic
   philosophy under Nero and Vespasian, and began himself to teach. He was
   banished from Rome by Domitian, with all other philosophers, before
   a.d. 90. He settled for the rest of his life in Nicopolis, in Southern
   Epirus, not far from the scene of the battle of Actium. There he
   gathered around him a large body of pupils, old and young, rich and
   poor, and instructed them, as a second Socrates, by precept and
   example, in halls and public places. The emperor Hadrian is reported to
   have invited him back to Rome (117), but in vain. The date of his death
   is unknown.

   Epictetus led from principle and necessity a life of poverty and
   extreme simplicity, after the model of Diogenes, the arch-Cynic. His
   only companions were an adopted child with a nurse. His furniture
   consisted of a bed, a cooking vessel and earthen lamp. Lucian ridicules
   one of his admirers, who bought the lamp for three thousand drachmas,
   in the hope of becoming a philosopher by using it. Epictetus
   discouraged marriage and the procreation of children. Marriage might do
   well in a "community of wise men," but "in the present state of
   things," which he compared to "an army in battle array," it is likely
   to withdraw the philosopher from the service of God. [572] 72 This
   view, as well as the reason assigned, resembles the advice of St. Paul,
   with the great difference, that the apostle had the highest conception
   of the institution of marriage as reflecting the mystery of Christ's
   union with the church. "Look at me," says Epictetus, "who am without a
   city, without a house, without possessions, without a slave; I sleep on
   the ground; I have no wife, no children, no praetorium, but only the
   earth and the heavens, and one poor cloak. And what do I want? Am I not
   without sorrow? Am I not without fear? Am I not free? ... Did I ever
   blame God or man? ... Who, when he sees me, does not think that he sees
   his king and master?" His epitaph fitly describes his character: "I was
   Epictetus, a slave, and maimed in body, and a beggar for poverty, and
   dear to the immortals."

   Epictetus, like Socrates, his great exemplar, wrote nothing himself,
   but he found a Xenophon. His pupil and friend, Flavius Arrianus, of
   Nicomedia, in Bithynia, the distinguished historian of Alexander the
   Great, and a soldier and statesman under Hadrian, handed to posterity a
   report of the oral instructions and familiar conversations (diatribai)
   of his teacher. Only four of the original eight books remain. He also
   collected his chief maxims in a manual (Enchiridion). His biography of
   that remarkable man is lost.

   Epictetus starts, like Zeno and Cleanthes, with a thoroughly practical
   view of philosophy, as the art and exercise of virtue, in accordance
   with reason and the laws of nature. He bases virtue on faith in God, as
   the supreme power of the universe, who directs all events for
   benevolent purposes. The philosopher is a teacher of righteousness, a
   physician and surgeon of the sick who feel their weakness, and are
   anxious to be cured. He is a priest and messenger of the gods to erring
   men, that they might learn to be happy even in utter want of earthly
   possessions. If we wish to be good, we must first believe that we are
   bad. Mere knowledge without application to life is worthless. Every man
   has a guardian spirit, a god within him who never sleeps, who always
   keeps him company, even in solitude; this is the Socratic daimonion,
   the personified conscience. We must listen to its divine voice. "Think
   of God more often than you breathe. Let discourse of God be renewed
   daily, more surely than your food." The sum of wisdom is to desire
   nothing but freedom and contentment, and to bear and forbear. All
   unavoidable evil in the world is only apparent and external, and does
   not touch our being. Our happiness depends upon our own will, which
   even Zeus cannot break. The wise man joyously acquiesces in what he
   cannot control, knowing that an all-wise Father rules the whole. "We
   ought to have these two rules always in readiness: that there is
   nothing good or evil except in the will; and that we ought not to lead
   events, but to follow them." [573] 73 If a brother wrongs me, that is
   his fault; my business is to conduct myself rightly towards him. The
   wise man is not disturbed by injury and injustice, and loves even his
   enemies. All men are brethren and children of God. They own the whole
   world; and hence even banishment is no evil. The soul longs to be freed
   from the prison house of the body and to return to God.

   Yet Epictetus does not clearly teach the immortality of the soul. He
   speaks of death as a return to the elements in successive
   conflagrations. Seneca approaches much more nearly the Platonic and
   Socratic, we may say Christian, view of immortality. The prevailing
   theory of the Stoics was, that at the end of the world all individual
   souls will be resolved into the primary substance of the Divine Being.
   [574] 74

   Epictetus nowhere alludes directly to Christianity, but he speaks once
   of "Galileans," who by enthusiasm or madness were free from all fear.
   [575] 75 He often recurs to his predecessors, Socrates, Diogenes, Zeno,
   Musonius Rufus. His ethical ideal is a cynic philosopher, naked,
   penniless, wifeless, childless, without want or desire, without passion
   or temper, kindly, independent, contented, imperturbable, looking
   serenely or indifferently at life and death. It differs as widely from
   the true ideal as Diogenes who lived in a tub, and sought with a
   lantern in daylight for "a man," differs from Christ who, indeed, had
   not where to lay his head, but went about doing good to the bodies and
   souls of men.

   Owing to the purity of its morals, the Enchiridion of Epictetus was a
   favorite book. Simplicius, a Neo-Platonist, wrote an elaborate
   commentary on it; and monks in the middle ages reproduced and
   Christianized it. Origen thought Epictetus had done more good than
   Plato. Niebuhr says: "His greatness cannot be questioned, and it is
   impossible for any person of sound mind not to be charmed by his
   works." Higginson says: "I am acquainted with no book more replete with
   high conceptions of the deity and noble aims of man." This is, of
   course, a great exaggeration, unless the writer means to confine his
   comparison to heathen works.

   attributes to obstinacy what Epictetus attributes to "habit." But

   § 92. Marcus Aurelius.

   Markou Antoninou tou autokratoros ton eis heauton biblia ib' (De Rebus
   suis libri xii). Ed. by Thomas Gataker, with a Latin Version and Notes
   (including those of Casaubon). Trajecti ad Rhenum, 1697, 2 vols. fol.
   The second vol. contains critical dissertations. (The first ed.
   appeared at Cambridge, 1652, in 1 vol.) English translation by George
   Long, revised ed. London, 1880.

   See the liter. quoted in § 20, above (especially Renan's Marc. Auréle,
   1882).

   Marcus Aurelius, the last and best representative of Stoicism, ruled
   the Roman Empire for twenty years (a.d. 161-180) at the height of its
   power and prosperity. He was born April 26, 121, in Rome, and carefully
   educated and disciplined in Stoic wisdom. Hadrian admired him for his
   good nature, docility, and veracity, and Antoninus Pius adopted him as
   his son and successor. He learned early to despise the vanities of the
   world, maintained the simplicity of a philosopher in the splendor of
   the court, and found time for retirement and meditation amid the cares
   of government and border wars, in which he was constantly engaged.
   Epictetus was his favorite author. He left us his best thoughts, a sort
   of spiritual autobiography, in the shape of a diary which he wrote, not
   without some self-complacency, for his own improvement and enjoyment
   during the last years of his life (172-175) in the military camp among
   the barbarians. He died in Panonia of the pestilence which raged in the
   army (March 17, 180). [576] 76 His last words were: "Weep not for me,
   weep over the pestilence and the general misery, [577] 77 and save the
   army. Farewell!" He dismissed his servants and friends, even his son,
   after a last interview, and died alone.

   The philosophic emperor was a sincere believer in the gods, their
   revelations and all-ruling providence. His morality and religion were
   blended. But he had no clear views of the divinity. He alternately uses
   the language of the polytheist, the deist, and the pantheist. He
   worshipped the deity of the universe and in his own breast. He thanks
   the gods for his good parents and teachers, for his pious mother, for a
   wife, whom he blindly praises as "amiable, affectionate, and pure," and
   for all the goods of life. His motto was "never to wrong any man in
   deed or word." [578] 78 He claimed no perfection, yet was conscious of
   his superiority, and thankful to the gods that he was better than other
   men. He traced the sins of men merely to ignorance and error. He was
   mild, amiable, and gentle; in these respects the very reverse of a hard
   and severe Stoic, and nearly approaching a disciple of Jesus. We must
   admire his purity, truthfulness, philanthropy, conscientious devotion
   to duty, his serenity of mind in the midst of the temptations of power
   and severe domestic trials, and his resignation to the will of
   providence. He was fully appreciated in his time, and universally
   beloved by his subjects. We may well call him among the heathen the
   greatest and best man of his age. [579] 79 "It seems" (says an able
   French writer, Martha), "that in him the philosophy of heathenism grows
   less proud, draws nearer and nearer to a Christianity which it ignored
   or which it despised, and is ready to fling itself into the arms of the
   'Unknown God.' In the sad Meditations of Aurelius we find a pure
   serenity, sweetness, and docility to the commands of God, which before
   him were unknown, and which Christian grace has alone surpassed. If he
   has not yet attained to charity in all that fullness of meaning which
   Christianity has given to the world, he already gained its unction, and
   one cannot read his book, unique in the history of Pagan philosophy,
   without thinking of the sadness of Pascal and the gentleness of
   Fénélon."

   The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius are full of beautiful moral maxims,
   strung together without system. They bear a striking resemblance to
   Christian ethics. They rise to a certain universalism and
   humanitarianism which is foreign to the heathen spirit, and a prophecy
   of a new age, but could only be realized on a Christian basis. Let us
   listen to some of his most characteristic sentiments:

   "It is sufficient to attend to the demon [the good genius] within, and
   to reverence it sincerely. And reverence for the demon consists in
   keeping it pure from passion and thoughtlessness and dissatisfaction
   with what comes from God and men." [580] 80 "Do not act as if thou wert
   going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over thee. While thou
   livest, while it is in thy power, be good." [581] 81 "Do not disturb
   thyself. Make thyself all simplicity. Does any one do wrong? It is to
   himself that he does the wrong. Has anything happened to thee? Well;
   out of the universe from the beginning everything which happens has
   been apportioned and spun out to thee. In a word, thy life is short.
   Thou must turn to profit the present by the aid of reason and justice.
   Be sober in thy relaxation. Either it is a well-arranged universe or a
   chaos huddled together, but still a universe." [582] 82 "A man must
   stand erect, and not be kept erect by others ." [583] 83 Have I done
   something for the general interest? Well, then, I have had my reward.
   Let this always be present to my mind, and never stop [doing good]."
   [584] 84 "What is thy art? to be good." [585] 85 "It is a man's duty to
   comfort himself and to wait for the natural dissolution, and not to be
   vexed at the delay." [586] 86 "O Nature: from thee are all things, in
   thee are all things, to thee all things return." [587] 87 "Willingly
   give thyself up to Clotho" [one of the fates], "allowing her to spin
   thy thread into whatever things she pleases. Every thing is only for a
   day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered." [588] 88
   "Consider that before long thou wilt be nobody and nowhere, nor will
   any of the things exist which thou now seest, nor any of those who are
   now living. For all things are formed by nature to change and be
   turned, and to perish, in order that other things in continuous
   succession may exist." [589] 89 "It is best to leave this world as
   early as possible, and to bid it friendly farewell." [590] 90

   These reflections are pervaded by a tone of sadness; they excite
   emotion, but no enthusiasm; they have no power to console, but leave an
   aching void, without hope of an immortality, except a return to the
   bosom of mother nature. They are the rays of a setting, not of a
   rising, sun; they are the swansong of dying Stoicism. The end of that
   noble old Roman was virtually the end of the antique world. [591] 91

   The cosmopolitan philosophy of Marcus Aurelius had no sympathy with
   Christianity, and excluded from its embrace the most innocent and most
   peaceful of his subjects. He makes but one allusion to the Christians,
   and unjustly traces their readiness for martyrdom to "sheer obstinacy"
   and a desire for "theatrical display." [592] 92 He may have had in view
   some fanatical enthusiasts who rushed into the fire, like Indian
   gymnosophists, but possibly such venerable martyrs as Polycarp and
   those of Southern Gaul in his own reign. Hence the strange phenomenon
   that the wisest and best of Roman emperors permitted (we cannot say,
   instigated, or even authorized) some of the most cruel persecutions of
   Christians, especially in Lugdunum and Vienne. We readily excuse him on
   the ground of ignorance. He probably never saw the Sermon on the Mount,
   nor read any of the numerous Apologies addressed to him.

   But persecution is not the only blot on his reputation. He wasted his
   affections upon a vicious and worthless son, whom he raised in his
   fourteenth year to full participation of the imperial power, regardless
   of the happiness of millions, and upon a beautiful but faithless and
   wicked wife, whom he hastened after her death to cover with divine
   honors. His conduct towards Faustina was either hypocritical or
   unprincipled. [593] 93 After her death he preferred a concubine to a
   second wife and stepmother of his children.

   His son and successor left the Christians in peace, but was one of the
   worst emperors that disgraced the throne, and undid all the good which
   his father had done. [594] 94

   Aristotle was the teacher of Alexander; Seneca, the teacher of Nero;
   Marcus Aurelius, the father of Commodus.

   [576] According to less probable accounts he died of suicide, or of
   poison administered to him by order of his son, Commodus. See Renan, p.
   485.

   la philosophie a régné. Un moment, grâce à lui, le monde a été gouverné
   par l'homme le meilleur et le plus grand de son siècle." But elsewhere
   he puts Antoninus Pius above Aurelius. "Of the two, " he says
   (Conférences d'Angleterre, translated by Clara Erskine Clement, p. 140
   sq.): "I consider Antonine the greatest. His goodness did not lead him
   into faults: he was not tormented with that internal trouble which
   disturbed, without ceasing, the heart of his adopted son. This strange
   malady, this restless study of himself, this demon of scrupulousness,
   this fever of perfection, are signs of a less strong and distinguished
   nature. As the finest thoughts are those which are not written,
   Antonins had in this respect also a superiority over Marcus Aurelius.
   But let us add, that we should be ignorant of Antonine, if Marcus
   Aurelius had not transmitted to us that exquisite portrait of his
   adopted father, in which he seems to have applied himself through
   humility, to painting the picture of a better man than himself."

   must be separated from the body, and ready either to be extinguished or
   dispersed, or continue to exist; but so that this readiness comes from
   a man's own judgment, not from mere obstinacy, as with the Christians,
   but considerately and with dignity, and in a way to persuade another
   without scenic show (atragodos)." I have availed myself in these
   extracts of Long's excellent translation, but compared them with the
   Greek original in Gataker's edition.

   [593] At his earnest request the obsequious Senate declared Faustina a
   goddess; she was represented in her temples with the attributes of
   Juno, Venus, and Ceres; and it was decreed that on the day of their
   nuptials the youth of both sexes should pay their vows before the altar
   of this adulterous woman. See Gibbon, ch. IV. A bas-relief in the
   museum of the Capitol at Rome represents Faustina borne to heaven by a
   messenger of the gods, and her husband looking at her with admiration
   and love. Renan apologizes for his favorite hero on the ground of the
   marvellous beauty of Faustina, and excuses her, because she naturally
   grew tired of the dull company of an ascetic philosopher!

   [594] Renan thus describes the sudden relapse (p. 490): "Horrible
   déception pourles gens de bien! Tant de vertu, tant d'amour
   n'aboutissant qu'à mettre le monde entre les mains d'un équarrisseur de
   bêtes, d'un gladiateur ! Aprés cette belle apparition d'un monde
   élyséen sur la terre, retomber dans l'enfer des Césars, qu'on
   croyaitfermé pour toujours ! La foi dans le bien fut alors perdue.
   Après Caligula, après Néron, après Domitien, on avait pu espérer
   encore. Les expériences n' avaient pas été décisives. Maintenant, c'est
   après le plus grand effort de rationalisme gouvernemental, oprès
   quatre-ving quatre ans d'un régime excellent, après Nerva, Trajan,
   Adrien, Antonin., Marc-Aurèle, que le règne du mal recommence, pire que
   jamais. Adieu, verta; adieu, raison. Puisque Marc-Aurèle n'a pas pu
   sauver le monde, qui le sauvera?"

   Equally remarkable, as a representative of "unconscious Christianity"
   and "seeker after the unknown God" though from a different
   philosophical standpoint, is the greatest biographer and moralist of
   classical antiquity.

   It is strange that Plutarch's contemporaries are silent about him. His
   name is not even mentioned by any Roman writer. What we know of him is
   gathered from his own works. He lived between a.d. 50 and 125, mostly
   in his native town of Chaeroneia, in Boeotia, as a magistrate and
   priest of Apollos. He was happily married, and had four sons and a
   daughter, who died young. His Conjugal Precepts are full of good advice
   to husbands and wives. The letter of consolation he addressed to his
   wife on the death of a little daughter, Timoxena, while she was absent
   from home, gives us a favorable impression of his family life, and
   expresses his hope of immortality. "The souls of infants," he says at
   the close of this letter, "pass immediately into a better and more
   divine state." He spent some time in Rome (at least twice, probably
   under Vespasian and Domitian), lectured on moral philosophy to select
   audiences, and collected material for his Parallel Lives of Greeks and
   Romans. He was evidently well-bred, in good circumstances, familiar
   with books, different countries, and human nature and society in all
   its phases. In his philosophy he stands midway between Platonism and
   Neo-Platonism. He was "a Platonist with an Oriental tinge." [595] 95 He
   was equally opposed to Stoic pantheism and Epicurean naturalism, and
   adopted the Platonic dualism of God and matter. He recognized a supreme
   God, and also the subordinate divinities of the Hellenic religion. The
   gods are good, the demons are divided between good and bad, the human
   soul combines both qualities. He paid little attention to metaphysics,
   and dwelt more on the practical questions of philosophy, dividing his
   labors between historical and moral topics. He was an utter stranger to
   Christianity, and therefore neither friendly nor hostile. There is in
   all his numerous writings not a single allusion to it, although at his
   time there must have been churches in every considerable city of the
   empire. He often speaks of Judaism, but very superficially, and may
   have regarded Christianity as a Jewish sect. But his moral philosophy
   makes a very near approach to Christian ethics.

   His aim, as a writer, was to show the greatness in the acts and in the
   thoughts of the ancients, the former in his "Parallel Lives," the
   latter in his "Morals," and by both to inspire his contemporaries to
   imitation. They constitute together an encyclopaedia of well-digested
   Greek and Roman learning. He was not a man of creative genius, but of
   great talent, extensive information, amiable, spirit, and universal
   sympathy. Emerson calls him "the chief example of the illumination of
   the intellect by the force of morals." [596] 96

   Plutarch endeavored to build up morality on the basis of religion. He
   is the very opposite of Lucian, who as an architect of ruin, ridiculed
   and undermined the popular religion. He was a strong believer in God,
   and his argument against atheism is well worth quoting." There has
   never been," he says, "a state of atheists. You may travel over the
   world, and you may find cities without walls, without king, without
   mint, without theatre or gymnasium; but you will never find a city
   without God, without prayer, without oracle, without sacrifice. Sooner
   may a city stand without foundations, than a state without belief in
   the gods. This is the bond of all society and the pillar of all
   legislation." [597] 97

   In his treatise on The Wrong Fear of the Gods, he contrasts
   superstition with atheism as the two extremes which often meet, and
   commends piety or the right reverence of the gods as the golden mean.
   Of the two extremes he deems superstition the worse, because it makes
   the gods capricious, cruel, and revengeful, while they are friends of
   men, saviours (soteres), and not destroyers. (Nevertheless
   superstitious people can more easily be converted to true faith than
   atheists who have destroyed all religious instincts.)

   His remarkable treatise on The Delays of Divine Justice in punishing
   the wicked, [598] 98 would do credit to any Christian theologian. It is
   his solution of the problem of evil, or his theodicy. He discusses the
   subject with several of his relatives (as Job did with his friends),
   and illustrates it by examples. He answers the various objections which
   arise from the delay of justice and vindicates Providence in his
   dealings with the sinner. He enjoins first modesty and caution in view
   of our imperfect knowledge. God only knows best when and how and how
   much to punish. He offers the following considerations: 1) God teaches
   us to moderate our anger, and never to punish in a passion, but to
   imitate his gentleness and forbearance. 2) He gives the wicked an
   opportunity to repent and reform. 3) He permits them to live and
   prosper that he may use them as executioners of his justice on others.
   He often punishes the sinner by the sinner. 4) The wicked are sometimes
   spared that they may bless the world by a noble posterity. 5)
   Punishment is often deferred that the hand of Providence may be more
   conspicuous in its infliction. Sooner or later sin will be punished, if
   not in this world, at least in the future world, to which Plutarch
   points as the final solution of the mysteries of Providence. He looked
   upon death as a good thing for the good soul, which shall then live
   indeed; while the present life "resembles rather the vain illusions of
   some dream."

   The crown of Plutarch's character is his humility, which was so very
   rare among ancient philosophers, especially the Stoics, and which comes
   from true self-knowledge. He was aware of the native depravity of the
   soul, which he calls "a storehouse and treasure of many evils and
   maladies." [599] 99 Had he known the true and radical remedy for sin,
   he would no doubt have accepted it with gratitude.

   We do not know how far the influence of these saints of ancient
   paganism, as we may call Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Plutarch,
   extended over the heathens of their age, but we do know that their
   writings had and still have an elevating and ennobling effect upon
   Christian readers, and hence we may infer that their teaching and
   example were among the moral forces that aided rather than hindered the
   progress and final triumph of Christianity. But this religion alone
   could bring about such a general and lasting moral reform as they
   themselves desired.

   § 94. Christian Morality.

   The ancient world of classic heathenism, having arrived at the height
   of its glory, and at the threshold of its decay, had exhausted all the
   resources of human nature left to itself, and possessed no recuperative
   force, no regenerative principle. A regeneration of society could only
   proceed from religion. But the heathen religion had no restraint for
   vice, no comfort for the poor and oppressed; it was itself the muddy
   fountain of immorality. God, therefore, who in his infinite mercy
   desired not the destruction but the salvation of the race, opened in
   the midst of this hopeless decay of a false religion a pure fountain of
   holiness, love, and peace, in the only true and universal religion of
   his Son Jesus Christ.

   In the cheerless waste of pagan corruption the small and despised band
   of Christians was an oasis fresh with life and hope. It was the salt of
   the earth, and the light of the world. Poor in this world's goods, it
   bore the imperishable treasures of' the kingdom of heaven. Meek and
   lowly in heart, it was destined, according to the promise of the Lord
   without a stroke of the sword, to inherit the earth. In submission it
   conquered; by suffering and death it won the crown of life.

   The superiority of the principles of Christian ethics over the heathen
   standards of morality even under its most favorable forms is
   universally admitted. The superiority of the example of Christ over all
   the heathen sages is likewise admitted. The power of that peerless
   example was and is now as great as the power of his teaching. It is
   reflected in every age and every type of purity and goodness. But every
   period, while it shares in the common virtues and graces, has its
   peculiar moral physiognomy. The ante-Nicene age excelled in
   unworldliness, in the heroic endurance of suffering and persecution, in
   the contempt of death, and the hope of resurrection, in the strong
   sense of community, and in active benevolence.

   Christianity, indeed, does not come "with observation." Its deepest
   workings are silent and inward. The operations of divine grace commonly
   shun the notice of the historian, and await their revelation on the
   great day of account, when all that is secret shall be made known. Who
   can measure the depth and breadth of all those blessed experiences of
   forgiveness, peace, gratitude, trust in God, love for God and love for
   man, humility and meekness, patience and resignation, which have
   bloomed as vernal flowers on the soil of the renewed heart since the
   first Christian Pentecost? Who can tell the number and the fervor of
   Christian prayers and intercessions which have gone up from lonely
   chambers, caves, deserts, and martyrs' graves in the silent night and
   the open day, for friends and foes, for all classes of mankind, even
   for cruel persecutors, to the throne of the exalted Saviour? But where
   this Christian life has taken root in the depths of the soul it must
   show itself in the outward conduct, and exert an elevating influence on
   every calling and sphere of action. The Christian morality surpassed
   all that the noblest philosophers of heathendom had ever taught or
   labored for as the highest aim of man. The masterly picture of it in
   the anonymous Epistle to Diognetus is no mere fancy sketch, but a
   faithful copy from real life. [600] 00

   When the apologists indignantly repel the heathen calumnies, and
   confidently point to the unfeigned piety, the brotherly love, the love
   for enemies, the purity and chastity, the faithfulness and integrity,
   the patience and gentleness, of the confessors of the name of Jesus,
   they speak from daily experience and personal observation. "We, who
   once served lust," could Justin Martyr say without exaggeration, "now
   find our delight only in pure morals; we, who once followed sorcery,
   have now consecrated ourselves to the eternal good God; we, who once
   loved gain above all, now give up what we have for the common use, and
   share with every needy one; we, who once hated and killed each other;
   we, who would have no common hearth with foreigners for difference of
   customs, now, since the appearance of Christ, live with them, pray for
   our enemies, seek to convince those who hate us without cause, that
   they may regulate their life according to the glorious teaching of
   Christ, and receive from the all-ruling God the same blessings with
   ourselves." Tertullian could boast that he knew no Christians who
   suffered by the hand of the executioner, except for their religion.
   Minutius Felix tells the heathens [601] 01: "You prohibit adultery by
   law, and practise it in secret; you punish wickedness only in the overt
   act; we look upon it as criminal even in thought. You dread the
   inspection of others; we stand in awe of nothing but our own
   consciences as becomes Christians. And finally your prisons are
   overflowing with criminals; but they are all heathens, not a Christian
   is there, unless he be an apostate." Even Pliny informed Trajan, that
   the Christians, whom he questioned on the rack respecting the character
   of their religion, had bound themselves by an oath never to commit
   theft, robbery, nor adultery, nor to break their word and this, too at
   a time when the sins of fraud, uncleanness and lasciviousness of every
   form abounded all around. Another heathen, Lucian, bears testimony to
   their benevolence and charity for their brethren in distress, while he
   attempts to ridicule this virtue as foolish weakness in an age of
   unbounded selfishness.

   The humble and painful condition of the church under civil oppression
   made hypocrisy more rare than in times of peace, and favored the
   development of the heroic virtues. The Christians delighted to regard
   themselves as soldiers of Christ, enlisted under the victorious
   standard of the cross against sin, the world, and the devil. The
   baptismal vow was their oath of perpetual allegiance; [602] 02 the
   Apostles' creed their parole; [603] 03 the sign of the cross upon the
   forehead, their mark of service; [604] 04 temperance, courage, and
   faithfulness unto death, their cardinal virtues; the blessedness of
   heaven, their promised reward. "No soldier," exclaims Tertullian to the
   Confessors, "goes with his sports or from his bed-chamber to the
   battle; but from the camp, where he hardens and accustoms himself to
   every inconvenience. Even in peace warriors learn to bear labor and
   fatigue, going through all military exercises, that neither soul nor
   body may flag .... Ye wage a good warfare, in which the living God is
   the judge of the combat, the Holy Spirit the leader, eternal glory the
   prize." To this may be added the eloquent passage of Minutius Felix
   [605] 05: "How fair a spectacle in the sight of God is a Christian
   entering the lists with affliction, and with noble firmness combating
   menaces and tortures, or with a disdainful smile marching to death
   through the clamors of the people, and the insults of the executioners;
   when he bravely maintains his liberty against kings and princes, and
   submits to God, whose servant he is; when, like a conqueror, he
   triumphs over the judge that condemns him. For he certainly is
   victorious who obtains what he fights for. He fights under the eye of
   God, and is crowned with length of days. You have exalted some of your
   stoical sufferers to the skies; such as Scaevola who, having missed his
   aim in an attempt to kill the king voluntarily burned the mistaking
   hand. Yet how many among us have suffered not only the hand, but the
   whole body to be consumed without a complaint, when their deliverance
   was in their own power! But why should I compare our elders with your
   Mutius, or Aquilius, or Regulus, when our very children, our sons and
   daughters, inspired with patience, despise your racks and wild beasts,
   and all other instruments of cruelty? Surely nothing but the strongest
   reasons could persuade people to suffer at this rate; and nothing else
   but Almighty power could support them under their sufferings."

   Yet, on the other hand, the Christian life of the period before
   Constantine has been often unwarrantably idealized. In a human nature
   essentially the same, we could but expect the same faults which we
   found even in the apostolic churches. The Epistles of Cyprian afford
   incontestable evidence, that, especially in the intervals of repose, an
   abatement of zeal soon showed itself, and, on the reopening of
   persecution, the Christian name was dishonored by hosts of apostates.
   And not seldom did the most prominent virtues, courage in death, and
   strictness of morals, degenerate into morbid fanaticism and unnatural
   rigor.

   § 95. The Church and Public Amusements.

   Tertullian: De Spectaculis. On the Roman Spectacles see the abundant
   references in Friedlaender, II. 255-580 (5th ed.)

   Christianity is anything but sanctimonious gloominess and misanthropic
   austerity. It is the fountain of true joy, and of that peace which
   "passeth all understanding." But this joy wells up from the
   consciousness of pardon and of fellowship with God, is inseparable from
   holy earnestness, and has no concord with worldly frivolity and sensual
   amusement, which carry the sting of a bad conscience, and beget only
   disgust and bitter remorse. "What is more blessed," asks Tertullian,
   "than reconciliation with God our Father and Lord; than the revelation
   of the truth, the knowledge of error; than the forgiveness of so great
   past misdeeds? Is there a greater joy than the disgust with earthly
   pleasure, than contempt for the whole world, than true freedom, than an
   unstained conscience, than contentment in life and fearlessness in
   death?"

   Contrast with this the popular amusements of the heathen: the theatre,
   the circus, and the arena. They were originally connected with the
   festivals of the gods, but had long lost their religious character and
   degenerated into nurseries of vice. The theatre, once a school of
   public morals in the best days of Greece, when Aeschylos and Sophocles
   furnished the plays, had since the time of Augustus room only for low
   comedies and unnatural tragedies, with splendid pageantry, frivolous
   music, and licentious dances. [606] 06 Tertullian represents it as the
   temple of Venus and Bacchus, who are close allies as patrons of lust
   and drunkenness. [607] 07 The circus was devoted to horse and chariot
   races, hunts of wild beasts, military displays and athletic games, and
   attracted immense multitudes. "The impatient crowd," says the historian
   of declining Rome [608] 08 "rushed at the dawn of day to secure their
   places, and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in
   the adjacent porticos. From the morning to the evening careless of the
   sun or of the rain, the spectators, who sometimes amounted to the
   number of four hundred thousand, remained in eager attention; their
   eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers, their minds agitated with
   hope and fear for the success of the colors which they espoused; and
   the happiness of Rome appeared to hang on the event of a race. The same
   immoderate ardor inspired their clamors and their applause as often as
   they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various
   modes of theatrical representation."

   The most popular, and at the same time the most inhuman and brutalizing
   of these public spectacles were the gladiatorial fights in the arena.
   There murder was practised as an art, from sunrise to sunset, and
   myriads of men and beasts were sacrificed to satisfy a savage curiosity
   and thirst for blood. At the inauguration of the Flavian amphitheatre
   from five to nine thousand wild beasts (according to different
   accounts) were slain in one day. No less than ten thousand gladiators
   fought in the feasts which Trajan gave to the Romans after the conquest
   of Dacia, and which lasted four months (a.d. 107). Under Probus (a.d.
   281) as many as a hundred lions, a hundred lionesses, two hundred
   leopards, three hundred bears, and a thousand wild boars were massacred
   in a single day. [609] 09 The spectacles of the worthless Carinus (284)
   who selected his favorites and even his ministers from the dregs of the
   populace, are said to have surpassed those of all his predecessors. The
   gladiators were condemned criminals, captives of war, slaves, and
   professional fighters; in times of persecution innocent Christians were
   not spared, but thrown before lions and tigers. Painted savages from
   Britain, blonde Germans from the Rhine and Danube, negroes from Africa,
   and wild beasts, then much more numerous than now, from all parts of
   the world, were brought to the arena. Domitian arranged fights of
   dwarfs and women.

   The emperors patronized these various spectacles as the surest means of
   securing the favor of the people, which clamored for "Panem et
   Circenses." Enormous sums were wasted on them from the public treasury
   and private purses. Augustus set the example. Nero was so extravagantly
   liberal in this direction that the populace forgave his horrible vices,
   and even wished his return from death. The parsimonious Vespasian built
   the most costly and colossal amphitheatre the world has ever seen,
   incrusted with marble, decorated with statues, and furnished with gold,
   silver, and amber. Titus presented thousands of Jewish captives after
   the capture of Jerusalem to the provinces of the East for slaughter in
   the arena. Even Trajan and Marcus Aurelius made bountiful provision for
   spectacles, and the latter, Stoic as he was, charged the richest
   senators to gratify the public taste during his absence from Rome. Some
   emperors as Nero, Commodus, and Caracalla, were so lost to all sense of
   dignity and decency that they delighted and gloried in histrionic and
   gladiatorial performances. Nero died by his own hand, with the
   explanation: "What an artist perishes in me." Commodus appeared no less
   than seven hundred and thirty-five times on the stage in the character
   of Hercules, with club and lion's skin, and from a secure position
   killed countless beasts and men.

   The theatrical passion was not confined to Rome, it spread throughout
   the provinces. Every considerable city had an amphitheatre, and that
   was the most imposing building, as may be seen to this day in the ruins
   at Pompeii, Capua, Puteoli, Verona, Nismes, Autun (Augustodunum), and
   other places. [610] 10

   Public opinion favored these demoralizing amusements almost without a
   dissenting voice. [611] 11 Even such a noble heathen as Cicero
   commended them as excellent schools of courage and contempt of death.
   Epictetus alludes to them with indifference. Seneca is the only Roman
   author who, in one of his latest writings, condemned the bloody
   spectacles from the standpoint of humanity, but without effect.
   Paganism had no proper conception of the sanctity of human life; and
   even the Stoic philosophy, while it might disapprove of bloody games as
   brutal and inhuman, did not condemn them as the sin of murder.

   To this gigantic evil the Christian church opposed an inexorable
   Puritanic rigor in the interest of virtue and humanity. No compromise
   was possible with such shocking public immorality. Nothing would do but
   to flee from it and to warn against it. The theatrical spectacles were
   included in "the pomp of the devil," which Christians renounced at
   their baptism. They were forbidden, on pain of excommunication, to
   attend them. It sometimes happened that converts, who were overpowered
   by their old habits and visited the theatre, either relapsed into
   heathenism, or fell for a long time into a state of deep dejection.
   Tatianus calls the spectacles terrible feasts, in which the soul feeds
   on human flesh and blood. Tertullian attacked them without mercy, even
   before he joined the rigorous Montanists. He reminds the catechumens,
   who were about to consecrate themselves to the service of God, that
   "the condition of faith and the laws of Christian discipline forbid,
   among other sins of the world, the pleasures of the public shows." They
   excite, he says, all sorts of wild and impure passions, anger, fury,
   and lust; while the spirit of Christianity is a spirit of meekness,
   peace, and purity." What a man should not say he should not hear. All
   licentious speech, nay, every idle word is condemned by God. The things
   which defile a man in going out of his mouth, defile him also when they
   go in at his eyes and ears. The true wrestlings of the Christian are to
   overcome unchastity by chastity, perfidy by faithfulness, cruelty by
   compassion and charity." Tertullian refutes the arguments with which
   loose Christians would plead for those fascinating amusements; their
   appeals to the silence of the Scriptures, or even to the dancing of
   David before the ark, and to Paul's comparison of the Christian life
   with the Grecian games. He winds up with a picture of the fast
   approaching day of judgment, to which we should look forward. He
   inclined strongly to the extreme view, that all art is a species of
   fiction and falsehood, and inconsistent with Christian truthfulness. In
   two other treatises [612] 12 he warned the Christian women against all
   display of dress, in which the heathen women shone in temples,
   theatres, and public places. Visit not such places, says he to them,
   and appear in public only for earnest reasons. The handmaids of God
   must distinguish themselves even outwardly from the handmaids of Satan,
   and set the latter a good example of simplicity, decorum, and chastity.

   The opposition of the Church had, of course, at first only a moral
   effect, but in the fourth century it began to affect legislation, and
   succeeded at last in banishing at least the bloody gladiatorial games
   from the civilized world (with the single exception of Spain and the
   South American countries, which still disgrace themselves by
   bull-fights). Constantine, even as late as 313, committed a great
   multitude of defeated barbarians to the wild beasts for the amusement
   of the people, and was highly applauded for this generous act by a
   heathen orator; but after the Council of Nicaea, in 325, he issued the
   first prohibition of those bloody spectacles in times of peace, and
   kept them out of Constantinople. [613] 13 "There is scarcely," says a
   liberal historian of moral progress, "any other single reform so
   important in the moral history of mankind as the suppression of the
   gladiatorial shows, and this feat must be almost exclusively ascribed
   to the Christian church. When we remember how extremely few of the best
   and greatest men of the Roman world had absolutely condemned the games
   of the amphitheatre, it is impossible to regard, without the deepest
   admiration, the unwavering and uncompromising consistency of the
   patristic denunciations." [614] 14

   § 96. Secular Callings and Civil Duties.

   As to the various callings of life, Christianity gives the instruction:
   "Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called." [615] 15 It
   forbids no respectable pursuit, and only requires that it be followed
   in a new spirit to the glory of God and the benefit of men. This is one
   proof of its universal application--its power to enter into all the
   relations of human life and into all branches of society, under all
   forms of government. This is beautifully presented by the unknown
   author of the Epistle to Diognetus. Tertullian protests to the
   heathens: [616] 16 "We are no Brahmins nor Indian gymnosophists, no
   hermits, no exiles from life. [617] 17 We are mindful of the thanks we
   owe to God, our Lord and Creator; we despise not the enjoyment of his
   works; we only temper it, that we may avoid excess and abuse. We dwell,
   therefore, with you in this world, not without markets and fairs, not
   without baths, inns, shops, and every kind of intercourse. We carry on
   commerce and war, [618] 18 agriculture and trade with you. We take part
   in your pursuits, and give our labor for your use."

   But there were at that time some callings which either ministered
   solely to sinful gratification, like that, of the stage-player, or were
   intimately connected with the prevailing idolatry, like the
   manufacture, decoration, and sale of mythological images and symbols,
   the divination of astrologers, and all species of magic. These callings
   were strictly forbidden in the church, and must be renounced by the
   candidate for baptism. Other occupations, which were necessary indeed,
   but commonly perverted by the heathens to fraudulent
   purposes--inn-keeping, for example--were elevated by the Christian
   spirit. Theodotus at Ancyra made his house a refuge for the Christians
   and a place of prayer in the Diocletian persecution, in which he
   himself suffered martyrdom.

   In regard to military and civil offices under the heathen government,
   opinion was divided. Some, on the authority of such passages as Matt.
   5:39 and 26:52, condemned all war as unchristian and immoral;
   anticipating the views of the Mennonites and Friends. Others appealed
   to the good centurion of Capernaum and Cornelius of Caesarea, and held
   the military life consistent with a Christian profession. The tradition
   of the legio fulminatrix indicates that there were Christian soldiers
   in the Roman armies under Marcus Aurelius, and at the time of
   Diocletian the number of Christians at the court and in civil office
   was very considerable.

   But in general the Christians of those days, with their lively sense of
   foreignness to this world, and their longing for the heavenly home, or
   the millennial reign of Christ, were averse to high office in a heathen
   state. Tertullian expressly says, that nothing was more alien to them
   than politics. [619] 19 Their conscience required them to abstain
   scrupulously from all idolatrous usages, sacrifices, libations, and
   flatteries connected with public offices; and this requisition must
   have come into frequent collision with their duties to the state, so
   long as the state remained heathen. They honored the emperor as
   appointed to earthly government by God, and as standing nearest of all
   men to him in power; and they paid their taxes, as Justin Martyr
   expressly states, with exemplary faithfulness. But their obedience
   ceased whenever the emperor, as he frequently did, demanded of them
   idolatrous acts. Tertullian thought that the empire would last till the
   end of the world,--then supposed to be near at hand--and would be
   irreconcilable with the Christian profession. Against the idolatrous
   worship of the emperor he protests with Christian boldness: "Augustus,
   the founder of the empire, would never be called Lord; for this is a
   surname of God. Yet I will freely call the emperor so, only not in the
   place of God. Otherwise I am free from him; for I have only one Lord,
   the almighty and eternal God, who also is the emperor's Lord .... Far
   be it from me to call the emperor God, which is not only the most
   shameful, but the most pernicious flattery."

   The comparative indifference and partial aversion of the Christians to
   the affairs of the state, to civil legislation and administration
   exposed them to the frequent reproach and contempt of the heathens.
   Their want of patriotism was partly the result of their superior
   devotion to the church as their country, partly of their situation in a
   hostile world. It must not be attributed to an "indolent or criminal
   disregard for the public welfare" (as Gibbon intimates), but chiefly to
   their just abhorrence of the innumerable idolatrous rites connected
   with the public and private life of the heathens. While they refused to
   incur the guilt of idolatry, they fervently and regularly prayed for
   the emperor and the state, their enemies and persecutors. [620] 20 They
   were the most peaceful subjects, and during this long period of almost
   constant provocation, abuse, and persecutions, they never took part in
   those frequent insurrections and rebellions which weakened and
   undermined the empire. They renovated society from within, by revealing
   in their lives as well as in their doctrine a higher order of private
   and public virtue, and thus proved themselves patriots in the best
   sense of the word.

   The patriotism of ancient Greece and republican Rome, while it commands
   our admiration by the heroic devotion and sacrifice to the country, was
   after all an extended selfishness, and based upon the absolutism of the
   State and the disregard of the rights of the individual citizen and the
   foreigner. It was undermined by causes independent of Christianity. The
   amalgamation of different nationalities in the empire extinguished
   sectionalism and exclusivism, and opened the wide view of a universal
   humanity. Stoicism gave this cosmopolitan sentiment a philosophical and
   ethical expression in the writings of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus
   Aurelius. Terence embodied it in his famous line: "Homo sum: humani
   nihil a me alienum puto." But Christianity first taught the fatherhood
   of God, the redemption by Christ, the common brotherhood of believers,
   the duty of charity for all men made in the image of God. It is true
   that monasticism, which began to develop itself already in the third
   century, nursed indifference to the state and even to the family, and
   substituted the total abandonment of the world for its reformation and
   transformation. It withdrew a vast amount of moral energy and
   enthusiasm from the city to the desert, and left Roman society to
   starvation and consumption. But it preserved and nursed in solitude the
   heroism of self-denial and consecration, which, in the collapse of the
   Roman empire, became a converting power of the barbarian conquerors,
   and laid the foundation for a new and better civilization. The decline
   and fall of the Roman empire was inevitable; Christianity prolonged its
   life in the East, and diminished the catastrophe of its collapse in the
   West, by converting and humanizing the barbarian conquerors. [621] 21
   St. Augustin pointed to the remarkable fact that amid the horrors of
   the sack of Rome by the Goths, "the churches of the apostles and the
   crypts of the martyrs were sanctuaries for all who fled to them,
   whether Christian or pagan," and "saved the lives of multitudes who
   impute to Christ the ills that have befallen their city." [622] 22

   for good. Standing between the conflicting form, almost indifferent to
   the issue, and notoriously exempt from the passions of the combat, they
   obtained with the conqueror, and used for the benefit of the conquered,
   a degree of influence they would never have possessed had they been
   regarded as Roman patriots."

   § 97. The Church and Slavery.

   See Lit. vol. I. § 48, especially Wallon's Histoire de l'esclavage
   (Paris, new ed. 1879, 3 vols). Comp. also V. Lechler: Sklaverei und
   Christenthum. Leipzig, 1877, 1878; Theod. Zahn: Sklaverei und
   Christenthum In Der Alten Welt. Heidelberg, 1879. Overbeck: Verh. d.
   alten Kirche zur Sclaverei im röm. Reiche. 1875.

   Heathenism had no conception of the general and natural rights of men.
   The ancient republics consisted in the exclusive dominion of a minority
   over an oppressed majority. The Greeks and Romans regarded only the
   free, i.e. the free-born rich and independent citizens as men in the
   full sense of the term, and denied this privilege to the foreigners,
   the laborers, the poor, and the slaves. They claimed the natural right
   to make war upon all foreign nations, without distinction of race, in
   order to subject them to their iron rule. Even with Cicero the
   foreigner and the enemy are synonymous terms. The barbarians were taken
   in thousands by the chance of war (above 100,000 in the Jewish war
   alone) and sold as cheap as horses. Besides, an active slave-trade was
   carried on in the Euxine, the eastern provinces, the coast of Africa,
   and Britain. The greater part of mankind in the old Roman empire was
   reduced to a hopeless state of slavery, and to a half brutish level.
   And this evil of slavery was so thoroughly interwoven with the entire
   domestic and public life of the heathen world, and so deliberately
   regarded, even by the greatest philosophers, Aristotle for instance, as
   natural and indispensable, that the abolition of it, even if desirable,
   seemed to belong among the impossible things.

   Yet from the outset Christianity has labored for this end; not by
   impairing the right of property, not by outward violence, nor sudden
   revolution; this, under the circumstances, would only have made the
   evil worse; but by its moral power, by preaching the divine descent and
   original unity of all men, their common redemption through Christ, the
   duty of brotherly love, and the true freedom of the spirit. It placed
   slaves and masters on the same footing of dependence on God and of
   freedom in God, the Father, Redeemer, and Judge of both. It conferred
   inward freedom even under outward bondage, and taught obedience to God
   and for the sake of God, even in the enjoyment of outward freedom. This
   moral and religious freedom must lead at last to the personal and civil
   liberty of the individual. Christianity redeems not only the soul but
   the body also, and the process of regeneration will end in the
   resurrection and glorification of the entire natural world.

   In the period before us, however, the abolition of slavery, save
   isolated cases of manumission, was utterly out of question, considering
   only the enormous number of the slaves. The world was far from ripe for
   such a step. The church, in her persecuted condition, had as yet no
   influence at all over the machinery of the state and the civil
   legislation. And she was at that time so absorbed in the transcendent
   importance of the higher world and in her longing for the speedy return
   of the Lord, that she cared little for earthly freedom or temporal
   happiness. Hence Ignatius, in his epistle to Polycarp, counsels
   servants to serve only the more zealously to the glory of the Lord,
   that they may receive from God the higher freedom; and not to attempt
   to be redeemed at the expense of their Christian brethren, lest they be
   found slaves to their own caprice. From this we see that slaves, in
   whom faith awoke the sense of manly dignity and the desire of freedom,
   were accustomed to demand their redemption at the expense of the
   church, as a right, and were thus liable to value the earthly freedom
   more than the spiritual. Tertullian declares the outward freedom
   worthless without the ransom of the soul from the bondage of sin. "How
   can the world," says he, "make a servant free? All is mere show in the
   world, nothing truth. For the slave is already free, as a purchase of
   Christ; and the freedman is a servant of Christ. If thou takest the
   freedom which the world can give for true, thou hast thereby become
   again the servant of man, and hast lost the freedom of Christ, in that
   thou thinkest it bondage." Chrysostom, in the fourth century, was the
   first of the fathers to discuss the question of slavery at large in the
   spirit of the apostle Paul, and to recommend, though cautiously, a
   gradual emancipation.

   But the church before Constantine labored with great success to elevate
   the intellectual and moral condition of the slaves, to adjust inwardly
   the inequality between slaves and masters, as the first and efficient
   step towards the final outward abolition of the evil, and to influence
   the public opinion even of the heathens. Here the church was aided by a
   concurrent movement in philosophy and legislation. The cruel views of
   Cato, who advised to work the slaves, like beasts of burden, to death
   rather than allow them to become old and unprofitable, gave way to the
   milder and humane views of Seneca, Pliny, and Plutarch, who very nearly
   approach the apostolic teaching. To the influence of the later Stoic
   philosophy must be attributed many improvements in the slave-code of
   imperial Rome. But the most important improvements were made from the
   triumph of Constantine to the reign of Justinian, under directly
   Christian influences. Constantine issued a law in 315, forbidding the
   branding of slaves on the face to prevent the disfiguration of the
   figure of celestial beauty (i.e. the image of God). [623] 23 He also
   facilitated emancipation, in an edict of 316, by requiring only a
   written document, signed by the master, instead of the previous
   ceremony in the presence of the prefect and his lictor.

   It is here to be considered, first of all, that Christianity spread
   freely among the slaves, except where they were so rude and degraded as
   to be insensible to all higher impressions. They were not rarely (as
   Origen observes) the instruments of the conversion of their masters,
   especially of the women, and children, whose training was frequently
   intrusted to them. Not a few slaves died martyrs, and were enrolled
   among the saints; as Onesimus, Eutyches, Victorinus, Maro, Nereus,
   Achilleus, Blandina, Potamiaena, Felicitas. Tradition makes Onesimus,
   the slave of Philemon, a bishop. The church of St. Vital at
   Ravenna--the first and noblest specimen of Byzantine architecture in
   Italy--was dedicated by, Justinian to the memory of a martyred slave.
   But the most remarkable instance is that of Callistus, who was
   originally a slave, and rose to the chair of St. Peter in Rome
   (218-223). Hippolytus, who acquaints us with his history, attacks his
   doctrinal and disciplinarian views, but does not reproach him for his
   former condition. Callistus sanctioned the marriages between free
   Christian women and Christian slaves. Celsus cast it up as a reproach
   to Christianity, that it let itself down so readily to slaves, fools,
   women, and children. But Origen justly saw an excellence of the new
   religion in this very fact, that it could raise this despised and, in
   the prevailing view, irreclaimable class of men to the level of moral
   purity and worth. If, then, converted slaves, with the full sense of
   their intellectual and religious superiority still remained obedient to
   their heathen masters, and even served them more faithfully than
   before, resisting decidedly only their immoral demands (like
   Potamiaena, and other chaste women and virgins in the service of
   voluptuous masters)--they showed, in this very self-control, the best
   proof of their ripeness for civil freedom, and at the same time
   furnished the fairest memorial of that Christian faith, which raised
   the soul, in the enjoyment of sonship with God and in the hope of the
   blessedness of heaven, above the sufferings of earth. Euelpistes, a
   slave of the imperial household, who was carried with Justin Martyr to
   the tribunal of Rusticus, on being questioned concerning his condition,
   replied: "I am a slave of the emperor, but I am also a Christian, and
   have received liberty from Jesus Christ; by his grace I have the same
   hope as my brethren." Where the owners of the slaves themselves became
   Christians, the old relation virtually ceased; both came together to
   the table of the Lord, and felt themselves brethren of one family, in
   striking contrast with the condition of things among their heathen
   neighbors as expressed in the current proverb: "As many enemies as
   slaves." [624] 24 Clement of Alexandria frequently urges that "slaves
   are men like ourselves," though he nowhere condemns the institution
   itself. That there actually were such cases of fraternal fellowship,
   like that which St. Paul recommended to Philemon, we have the testimony
   of Lactantius, at the end of our period, who writes in his Institutes,
   no doubt from life: "Should any say: Are there not also among you poor
   and rich, servants and masters, distinctions among individuals? No; we
   call ourselves brethren for no other reason than that we hold ourselves
   all equal. For since we measure everything human not by its outward
   appearance, but by its intrinsic value we have notwithstanding the
   difference of outward relations, no slaves, but we call them and
   consider them brethren in the Spirit and fellow-servants in religion."
   [625] 25 The same writer says: "God would have all men equal .... With
   him there is neither servant nor master. If he is the same Father to
   all, we are all with the same right free. So no one is poor before God,
   but he who is destitute of righteousness; no one rich, but he who is
   full of virtues." [626] 26

   The testimony of the catacombs, as contrasted with pagan epitaphs,
   shows that Christianity almost obliterated the distinction between the
   two classes of society. Slaves are rarely mentioned. "While it is
   impossible," says De Rossi, "to examine the pagan sepulchral
   inscriptions of the same period without finding mention of a slave or a
   freedman, I have not met with one well-ascertained instance among the
   inscriptions of the Christian tombs." [627] 27

   The principles of Christianity naturally prompt Christian slave-holders
   to actual manumission. The number of slaveholders before Constantine
   was very limited among Christians, who were mostly poor. Yet we read in
   the Acts of the martyrdom of the Roman bishop Alexander, that a Roman
   prefect, Hermas, converted by that bishop, in the reign of Trajan,
   received baptism at an Easter festival with his wife and children and
   twelve hundred and fifty slaves, and on this occasion gave all his
   slaves their freedom and munificent gifts besides. [628] 28 So in the
   martyrology of St. Sebastian, it is related that a wealthy Roman
   prefect, Chromatius, under Diocletian, on embracing Christianity,
   emancipated fourteen hundred slaves, after having them baptized with
   himself, because their sonship with God put an end to their servitude
   to man. [629] 29 Several epitaphs in the catacombs mention the fact of
   manumission. In the beginning of the fourth century St. Cantius,
   Cantianus, and Cantianilla, of an old Roman family, set all their
   slaves, seventy-three in number, at liberty, after they had received
   baptism. [630] 30 St. Melania emancipated eight thousand slaves; St.
   Ovidius, five thousand; Hermes, a prefect in the reign of Trajan,
   twelve hundred and fifty. [631] 31

   These legendary traditions may indeed be doubted as to the exact facts
   in the case, and probably are greatly exaggerated; but they, are
   nevertheless conclusive as the exponents of the spirit which animated
   the church at that time concerning the duty of Christian masters. It
   was felt that in a thoroughly Christianized society there can be no
   room for despotism on the one hand and slavery on the other.

   After the third century the manumission became a solemn act, which took
   place in the presence of the clergy and the congregation. It was
   celebrated on church festivals, especially on Easter. The master led
   the slave to the altar; there the document of emancipation was read,
   the minister pronounced the blessing, and the congregation received him
   as a free brother with equal rights and privileges. Constantine found
   this custom already established, and African councils of the fourth
   century requested the emperor to give it general force. He placed it
   under the superintendence of the clergy.

   Notes.

   H. Wallon, in his learned and able Histoire de l'esclavage dans
   l'antiquité (second ed. Paris, 1879, 3 vols.), shows that the gospel in
   such passages as Matt. 23:8; Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:11; 1 Cor. 12:13 sounded
   the death knell of slavery, though it was very long in dying, and thus
   sums up the teaching of the ante-Nicene church (III. 237): "Minutius
   Félix, Tertullien et tous ceux communauté de, nature, cette communauté
   de patrie dans la république du monde, en un language familier à la
   philosophie, mais qui trouvait parmi les chrétiens avec une sanction
   plus haute et un sens plus complet, une application plus sérieuse.
   Devant cc droit commun des hommes, fondé sur le droit divin, le
   prétendu droit des gens n'était plus qu' une monstrueuse injustice."
   For the views of the later fathers and the influence of the church on
   the imperial legislation, see ch. VIII. to X. in his third volume.

   Lecky discusses the relation of Christianity to slavery in the second
   vol. of his History of European Morals, pp. 66-90, and justly remarks:
   "The services of Christianity in this sphere were of three kinds. It
   supplied a new order of relations, in which the distinction of classes
   was unknown. It imparted a moral dignity to the servile classes, and it
   gave an unexampled impetus to the movement of enfranchisement."

   § 98. The Heathen Family.

   In ancient Greece and Rome the state was the highest object of life,
   and the only virtues properly recognized--wisdom, courage, moderation,
   and justice--were political virtues. Aristotle makes the state, that is
   the organized body of free citizens [632] 32 (foreigners and slaves are
   excluded), precede the family and the individual, and calls man
   essentially a "political animal." In Plato's ideal commonwealth the
   state is everything and owns everything, even the children.

   This political absolutism destroys the proper dignity and rights of the
   individual and the family, and materially hinders the development of
   the domestic and private virtues. Marriage was allowed no moral
   character, but merely a political import for the preservation of the
   state, and could not be legally contracted except by free citizens.
   Socrates, in instructing his son concerning this institution, tells
   him, according to Xenophon, that we select only such wives as we hope
   will yield beautiful children. Plato recommends even community of women
   to the class of warriors in his ideal republic, as the best way to
   secure vigorous citizens. Lycurgus, for similar reasons, encouraged
   adultery under certain circumstances, requiring old men to lend their
   young and handsome wives to young and strong men.

   Woman was placed almost on the same level with the slave. She differs,
   indeed, from the slave, according to Aristotle, but has, after all,
   really no will of her own, and is hardly capable of a higher virtue
   than the slave. Shut up in a retired apartment of the house, she spent
   her life with the slaves. As human nature is essentially the same in
   all ages, and as it in never entirely forsaken by the guidance of a
   kind Providence, we must certainly suppose that female virtue was
   always more or less maintained and appreciated even among the heathen.
   Such characters as Penelope, Nausicaa, Andromache, Antigone, Iphigenia,
   and Diotima, of the Greek poetry and history, bear witness of this.
   Plutarch's advice to married people, and his letter of consolation to
   his wife after the death of their daughter, breathe a beautiful spirit
   of purity and affection. But the general position assigned to woman by
   the poets, philosophers, and legislators of antiquity, was one of
   social oppression and degradation. In Athens she was treated as a minor
   during lifetime, and could not inherit except in the absence of male
   heirs. To the question of Socrates: "Is there any one with whom you
   converse less than with the wife?" his pupil, Aristobulus, replies: "No
   one, or at least very few." If she excelled occasionally, in Greece, by
   wit and culture, and, like Aspasia, Phryne, Laïs, Theodota, attracted
   the admiration and courtship even of earnest philosophers like
   Socrates, and statesmen like Pericles, she generally belonged to the
   disreputable class of the hetaerae or amicae. In Corinth they were
   attached to the temple of Aphrodite, and enjoyed the sanction of
   religion for the practice of vice. [633] 33 These dissolute women were
   esteemed above housewives, and became the proper and only
   representatives of some sort of female culture and social elegance. To
   live with them openly was no disgrace even for married men. [634] 34
   How could there be any proper conception and abhorrence of the sin of
   licentiousness and adultery, if the very gods, a Jupiter, a Mars, and a
   Venus, were believed to be guilty of those sins! The worst vices of
   earth were transferred to Olympus.

   Modesty forbids the mention of a still more odious vice, which even
   depraved nature abhors, which yet was freely discussed and praised by
   ancient poets and philosophers, practised with neither punishment nor
   dishonor, and likewise divinely sanctioned by the example of Apollo and
   Hercules, and by the lewdness of Jupiter with Ganymede. [635] 35

   The Romans were originally more virtuous, domestic, and chaste, as they
   were more honest and conscientious, than the Greeks. With them the wife
   was honored by the title domina, matrona, materfamilias. At the head of
   their sacerdotal system stood the flamens of Jupiter, who represented
   marriage in its purity, and the vestal virgins, who represented
   virginity. The Sabine women interceding between their parents and their
   husbands, saved the republic; the mother and the wife of Coriolanus by
   her prayers averted his wrath, and raised the siege of the Volscian
   army; Lucretia who voluntarily sacrificed her life to escape the
   outrage to her honor offered by king Tarquin, and Virginia who was
   killed by her father to save her from slavery and dishonor, shine in
   the legendary history of Rome as bright examples of unstained purity.
   But even in the best days of the republic the legal status of woman was
   very low. The Romans likewise made marriage altogether subservient to
   the interest of the state, and allowed it in its legal form to free
   citizens alone. The proud maxims of the republic prohibited even the
   legitimate nuptials of a Roman with a foreign queen; and Cleopatra and
   Berenice were, as strangers, degraded to the position of concubines of
   Mark Antony and Titus. According to ancient custom the husband bought
   his bride from her parents, and she fulfilled the coëmption by
   purchasing, with three pieces of copper, a just introduction to his
   house and household deities. But this was for her simply an exchange of
   one servitude for another. She became the living property of a husband
   who could lend her out, as Cato lent his wife to his friend Hortensius,
   and as Augustus took Livia from Tiberius Nero." Her husband or master,
   says Gibbon, [636] 36 "was invested with the plenitude of paternal
   power. By his judgment or caprice her behavior was approved or
   censured, or chastised; he exercised the jurisdiction of life and
   death; and it was allowed, that in cases of adultery or drunkenness,
   the sentence might be properly inflicted. She acquired and inherited
   for the sole profit of her lord; and so clearly was woman defined, not
   as a person, but as a thing, that, if the original title were
   deficient, she might be claimed like other movables, by the use and
   possession of an entire year."

   Monogamy was the rule both in Greece and in Rome, but did not exclude
   illegitimate connexions. Concubinage, in its proper legal sense, was a
   sort of secondary marriage with a woman of servile or plebeian
   extraction, standing below the dignity of a matron and above the infamy
   of a prostitute. It was sanctioned and regulated by law; it prevailed
   both in the East and the West from the age of Augustus to the tenth
   century, and was preferred to regular marriage by Vespasian, and the
   two Antonines, the best Roman emperors. Adultery was severely punished,
   at times even with sudden destruction of the offender; but simply as an
   interference with the rights and property of a free man. The wife had
   no legal or social protection against the infidelity of her husband.
   The Romans worshipped a peculiar goddess of domestic life; but her name
   Viriplaca, the appeaser of husbands, indicates her partiality. The
   intercourse of a husband with the slaves of his household and with
   public prostitutes was excluded from the odium and punishment of
   adultery. We say nothing of that unnatural abomination alluded to in
   Rom. 1:26, 27, which seems to have passed from the Etruscans and Greeks
   to the Romans, and prevailed among the highest as well as the lowest
   classes. The women, however, were almost as corrupt as their husbands,
   at least in the imperial age. Juvenal calls a chaste wife a "rara avis
   in terris." Under Augustus free-born daughters could no longer be found
   for the service of Vesta, and even the severest laws of Domitian could
   not prevent the six priestesses of the pure goddess from breaking their
   vow. The pantomimes and the games of Flora, with their audacious
   indecencies, were favorite amusements." The unblushing, undisguised
   obscenity of the Epigrams of Martial, of the Romances of Apuleius and
   Petronius, and of some of the Dialogues of Lucian, reflected but too
   faithfully the spirit of their times." [637] 37

   Divorce is said to have been almost unknown in the ancient days of the
   Roman republic, and the marriage tie was regarded as indissoluble. A
   senator was censured for kissing his wife in the presence of their
   daughter. But the merit of this virtue is greatly diminished if we
   remember that the husband always had an easy outlet for his sensual
   passions in the intercourse with slaves and concubines. Nor did it
   outlast the republic. After the Punic war the increase of wealth and
   luxury, and the influx of Greek and Oriental licentiousness swept away
   the stern old Roman virtues. The customary civil and religious rites of
   marriage were gradually disused; the open community of life between
   persons of similar rank was taken as sufficient evidence of their
   nuptials; and marriage, after Augustus, fell to the level of any
   partnership, which might be dissolved by the abdication of one of the
   associates. "Passion, interest, or caprice," says Gibbon on the
   imperial age, "suggested daily, motives for the dissolution of
   marriage; a word, a sign, a message, a letter, the mandate of a
   freedman, declared the separation; the most tender of human connections
   was degraded to a transient society of profit or pleasure." [638] 38

   Various remedies were tardily adopted as the evil spread, but they
   proved inefficient, until the spirit of Christianity gained the control
   of public opinion and improved the Roman legislation, which, however,
   continued for a long time to fluctuate between the custom of heathenism
   and the wishes of the church. Another radical evil of heathen family
   life, which the church had to encounter throughout the whole extent of
   the Roman Empire, was the absolute tyrannical authority of the parent
   over the children, extending even to the power of life and death, and
   placing the adult son of a Roman citizen on a level with the movable
   things and slaves, "whom the capricious master might alienate or
   destroy, without being responsible to any earthly tribunal."

   With this was connected the unnatural and monstrous custom of exposing
   poor, sickly, and deformed children to a cruel death, or in many cases
   to a life of slavery and infamy-a custom expressly approved, for the
   public interest, even by a Plato, an Aristotle, and a Seneca!
   "Monstrous offspring," says the great Stoic philosopher, "we destroy;
   children too, if born feeble and ill-formed, we drown. It is not wrath,
   but reason, thus to separate the useless from the healthy." "The
   exposition of children"--to quote once more from Gibbon--"was the
   prevailing and stubborn vice of antiquity: it was sometimes prescribed,
   often permitted, almost always practised with impunity by the nations
   who never entertained the Roman ideas of paternal power; and the
   dramatic poets, who appeal to the human heart, represent with
   indifference a popular custom which was palliated by the motives of
   economy and compassion .... The Roman Empire was stained with the blood
   of infants, till such murders were included, by Valentinian and his
   colleagues, in the letter and spirit of the Cornelian law. The lessons
   of jurisprudence and Christianity had been insufficient to eradicate
   this inhuman practice, till their gentle influence was fortified by the
   terrors of capital punishment." [639] 39

   [633] Their name hetairai was an Attic euphonism for pornai. In the
   temple of Aphrodite at Corinth more than a thousand hetaerae were
   employed as hierodulae and were the ruin of foreigners (Strabo, VIII.
   6, 20). Korinthia kore was a synonym for hetaera, and expressive of the
   acme of voluptuousness. A full account of these hetaerae and of the
   whole domestic life of the ancient Greeks may be found in Becker's
   Charicles, translated by Metcalf, third ed. London, 1866. Becker says
   (p. 242), that in the period of the greatest refinement of classical
   Greece, "sensuality, if not the mother, was at all events the nurse of
   the Greek perception of the beautiful." Plato himself, even in his
   ideal state, despaired of restricting his citizens to the lawful
   intercourse of marriage.

   [634] Aspasia bewitched Pericles by her beauty and genius; and Socrates
   acknowledged his deep obligation to the instructions of a courtesan
   named Diotima.

   [635] Lecky (II. 311) derives this unnatural vice of Greece from the
   influence of the public games, which accustomed men to the
   contemplation of absolute nudity, and awoke unnatural passions. See the
   thirteenth book of Athenaeus, Grote on the Symposium of Plato, and the
   full account in Döllinger's Heidenthum und Judenthum, 1857, p. 684 sqq.
   He says: "Bei den Griechen tritt das Laster der Paederastie mit allen
   symptomen einer grossen nationalen Krankheit, gleichsam eines ethischen
   Miasma auf; es zeigt. sich als ein Gefühl, das stärker and heftiger
   wirkte, als die Weiberliebe bei andern Völkern, massloser,
   leidenschaftlicher in seinem Ausbrüchen war ... In der ganzen Literatur
   der vorchristlichen Periode ist kaum ein Schriftsteller zu finden, der
   sich entschieden dagegen erklärt hätte. Vielmehr war die ganze
   Gesellschaft davon angesteckt, und man athmete das Miama, so zu sagen,
   mit der Luft ein." Even Socrates and Plato gave this morbid vice the
   sanction of their great authority, if not in practice, at least in
   theory. Comp. Xenophon's Mem. VIII. 2, Plato's Charmides, and his
   descriptions of Eros, and Döllinger, l.c. p. 686 sq. Zeno, the founder
   of the austere sect of Stoics, was praised for the moderation with
   which he practiced this vice.

   [636] Chapter XLIV., where he discusses at length the Roman code of
   laws.

   [637] Lecky, II. 321.

   [638] Gibbon (ch. XLIV.) confirms the statement by several examples, to
   which more might be added. Maecenas, "qui uxores millies duxit"
   (Seneca, Ep. 114) was as notorious for his levity in forming and
   dissolving the nuptial tie, as famous for his patronage of literature
   and art. Martial (Epigr. VI. 7), though in evident poetical
   exaggeration, speaks of ten husbands in one month. Juvenal (Satir. VI.
   229) exposes a matron, who in five years submitted to the embraces of
   eight husbands. Jerome (Ad Gerontiam) "saw at Rome a triumphant husband
   bury his twenty-first wife, who had interred twenty-two of his less
   sturdy predecessors." These are extreme cases, and hardly furnish a
   sufficient basis for a general judgment of the state of society in
   Rome, much less in the provinces. We should not forget the noble and
   faithful Roman women even in the days of imperial corruption, as
   Mallonia, who preferred suicide to the embraces of Tiberius; Helvia,
   the mother of Seneca, and Paulina his wife, who opened her vein to
   accompany him to the grave; the elder Arria who, when her husband
   Paetus was condemned to death under Claudius (42), and hesitated to
   commit suicide, plunged the dagger in her breast, and, drawing it out,
   said to him with her dying breath: "My Paetus, it does not pain"
   (Paete, non dolet); and her worthy daughter, Caecinia Arria, the wife
   of Thrasea, who was condemned to death (66), and her granddaughter
   Fannia, who accompanied her husband Helvidius Priscus twice into
   banishment, and suffered a third for his sake after his execution (93).
   See Pliny, Epist. III.16; Tacitus, Ann. XVI. 30-34; Friedlaender, I.
   459 sqq. . Nor should we overlook the monumental evidences of conjugal
   devotion and happiness in numerous Roman epitaphs. See Friedlaender, I.
   463. Yet sexual immorality reached perhaps its lowest depths in
   imperial Rome, far lower than in the worst periods of the dark ages, or
   in England under Charles II., or in France under Louis XIV. and XV. And
   it is also certain, as Lecky says (II. 326), "that frightful excesses
   of unnatural passion, of which the most corrupt of modern courts
   present no parallel, were perpetrated with but little concealment on
   the Palatine." Prenuptial unchastity of men was all but universal among
   the Romans, according to Cicero's testimony. Even Epictetus, the
   severest among the Stoic moralists, enjoins only moderation, not entire
   abstinence, from this form of vice. Lampridius relates of Alexander
   Severus, who otherwise legislated against vice, that he provided his
   unmarried provincial governors with a concubine as a part of their
   outfit, because "they could not exist without one" (quod sine
   concubinis esse non possent)."

   Brace, Gesta Christi, p. 72-83.

   § 99. The Christian Family.

   Such was the condition of the domestic life of the ancient world, when
   Christianity, with its doctrine of the sanctity of marriage, with its
   injunction of chastity, and with its elevation of woman from her
   half-slavish condition to moral dignity and equality with man, began
   the work of a silent transformation, which secured incalculable
   blessings to generations yet unborn. It laid the foundation for a
   well-ordered family life. It turned the eye from the outward world to
   the inward sphere of affection, from the all-absorbing business of
   politics and state-life into the sanctuary of home; and encouraged the
   nurture of those virtues of private life, without which no true public
   virtue can exist. But, as the evil here to be abated, particularly the
   degradation of the female sex and the want of chastity, was so deeply
   rooted and thoroughly interwoven in the whole life of the old world,
   this ennobling of the family, like the abolition of slavery, was
   necessarily a very slow process. We cannot wonder, therefore, at the
   high estimate of celibacy, which in the eyes of many seemed to be the
   only radical escape from the impurity and misery of married life as it
   generally stood among the heathen. But, although the fathers are much
   more frequent and enthusiastic in the praise of virginity than in that
   of marriage, yet their views on this subject show an immense advance
   upon the moral standard of the greatest sages and legislators of Greece
   and Rome.

   Chastity before marriage, in wedlock, and in celibacy, in man as well
   as in woman, so rare in paganism, was raised to the dignity of a
   cardinal virtue and made the corner-stone of the family. Many a female
   martyr preferred cruel torture and death to the loss of honor. When St.
   Perpetua fell half dead from the horns of a wild bull in the arena, she
   instinctively drew together her dress, which had been torn in the
   assault. The acts of martyrs and saints tell marvellous stories,
   exaggerated no doubt, yet expressive of the ruling Christian sentiment,
   about heroic resistance to carnal temptation, the sudden punishment of
   unjust charges of impurity by demoniacal possession or instant death,
   the rescue of courtesans from a life of shame and their radical
   conversion and elevation even to canonical sanctity. [640] 40 The
   ancient councils deal much with carnal sins so fearfully prevalent, and
   unanimously condemn them in every shape and form. It is true, chastity
   in the early church and by the unanimous consent of the fathers was
   almost identified with celibacy, as we shall see hereafter; but this
   excess should not blind us to the immense advance of patristic over
   heathen morals.

   Woman was emancipated, in the best sense of the term, from the bondage
   of social oppression, and made the life and light of a Christian home.
   Such pure and heroic virgins as the martyred Blandina, and Perpetua,
   and such devoted mothers as Nonna, Anthusa, and Monica, we seek in vain
   among the ancient Greek and Roman maidens and matrons, and we need not
   wonder that the heathen Libanius, judging from such examples as the
   mother of his pupil Chrysostom, reluctantly exclaimed: "What women have
   these Christians!" The schoolmen of the middle ages derived from the
   formation of woman an ingenious argument for her proper position: Eve
   was not taken from the feet of Adam to be his slave, nor from his head
   to be his ruler, but from his side to be his beloved partner. [641] 41

   At the same time here also we must admit that the ancient church was
   yet far behind the ideal set up in the New Testament, and
   counterbalanced the elevation of woman by an extravagant over-estimate
   of celibacy. It was the virgin far more than the faithful wife and
   mother of children that was praised and glorified by the fathers; and
   among the canonized saints of the Catholic calendar there is little or
   no room for husbands and wives, although the patriarchs, Moses, and
   some of the greatest prophets (Isaiah, Ezekiel), and apostles (Peter
   taking the lead) lived in honorable wedlock.

   Marriage was regarded in the church from the beginning as a sacred
   union of body and soul for the propagation of civil society, and the
   kingdom of God, for the exercise of virtue and the promotion of
   happiness. It was clothed with a sacramental or semi-sacramental
   character on the basis of Paul's comparison of the marriage union with
   the relation of Christ to his church. [642] 42 It was in its nature
   indissoluble except in case of adultery, and this crime was charged not
   only to the woman, but to the man as even the more guilty party, and to
   every extra-connubial carnal connection. Thus the wife was equally
   protected against the wrongs of the husband, and chastity was made the
   general law of the family life.

   We have a few descriptions of Christian homes from the ante-Nicene age,
   one from an eminent Greek father, another from a married presbyter of
   the Latin church.

   Clement of Alexandria enjoins upon Christian married persons united
   prayer and reading of the Scriptures, [643] 43 as a daily morning
   exercise, and very beautifully says: "The mother is the glory of her
   children, the wife is the glory of her husband, both are the glory of
   the wife, God is the glory of all together." [644] 44

   Tertullian, at the close of the book which he wrote to his wife, draws
   the following graphic picture, which, though somewhat idealized, could
   be produced only from the moral spirit of the gospel and actual
   experience: [645] 45 "How can I paint the happiness of a marriage which
   the church ratifies, the oblation (the celebration of the communion)
   confirms, the benediction seals, angels announce, the Father declares
   valid. Even upon earth, indeed, sons do not legitimately marry without
   the consent of their fathers. What a union of two believers--one hope,
   one vow, one discipline, and one worship! They are brother and sister,
   two fellow-servants, one spirit and one flesh. Where there is one
   flesh, there is also one spirit. They pray together, fast together,
   instruct, exhort, and support each other. They go together to the
   church of God, and to the table of the Lord. They share each other's
   tribulation, persecution, and revival. Neither conceals anything from
   the other; neither avoids, neither annoys the other. They delight to
   visit the sick, supply the needy, give alms without constraint, and in
   daily zeal lay their offerings before the altar without scruple or
   hindrance. They do not need to keep the sign of the cross hidden, nor
   to express slyly their Christian joy, nor to suppress the blessing.
   Psalms and hymns they sing together, and they vie with each other in
   singing to God. Christ rejoices when he sees and hears this. He gives
   them his peace. Where two are together in his name, there is he; and
   where he is, there the evil one cannot come."

   A large sarcophagus represents a scene of family worship: on the right,
   four men, with rolls in their hands, reading or singing; on the left,
   three women and a girl playing a lyre.

   For the conclusion of a marriage, Ignatius [646] 46 required "the
   consent of the bishop, that it might be a marriage for God, and not for
   pleasure. All should be done to the glory of God." In Tertullian's
   time, [647] 47 as may be inferred from the passage just quoted, the
   solemnization of marriage was already at least a religious act, though
   not a proper sacrament, and was sealed by the celebration of the holy
   communion in presence of the congregation. The Montanists were disposed
   even to make this benediction of the church necessary to the validity
   of marriage among Christians. All noisy and wanton Jewish and heathen
   nuptial ceremonies, and at first also the crowning of the bride, were
   discarded; but the nuptial ring, as a symbol of union, was retained.

   In the catacombs the marriage ceremony is frequently represented by the
   man and the woman standing side by side and joining hands in token of
   close union, as also on heathen documents. On a gilded glass of the
   fourth century, the couple join hands over a small nuptial altar, and
   around the figures are inscribed the words (of the priest): "May ye
   live in God." [648] 48

   Mixed marriages with heathens and also with heretics, were unanimously
   condemned by the voice of the church in agreement with the Mosaic
   legislation, unless formed before conversion, in which case they were
   considered valid. [649] 49 Tertullian even classes such marriages with
   adultery. What heathen, asks he, will let his wife attend the nightly
   meetings of the church, and the slandered supper of the Lord, take care
   of the sick even in the poorest hovels, kiss the chains of the martyrs
   in prison rise in the night for prayer, and show hospitality to strange
   brethren? Cyprian calls marriage with an unbeliever a prostitution of
   the members of Christ. The Council of Elvira in Spain (306) forbade
   such mixed marriages on pain of excommunication, but did not dissolve
   those already existing. We shall understand this strictness, if, to say
   nothing of the heathen marriage rites, and the wretchedly loose notions
   on chastity and conjugal fidelity, we consider the condition of those
   times, and the offences and temptations which met the Christian in the
   constant sight of images of the household gods, mythological pictures
   on the walls, the floor, and the furniture; in the libations at table;
   in short, at every step and turn in a pagan house.

   Second marriage.--From the high view of marriage, and also from an
   ascetic over-estimate of celibacy, arose a very, prevalent aversion to
   re-marriage, particularly of widows. The Shepherd of Hermas allows this
   reunion indeed, but with the reservation, that continuance in single
   life earns great honor with the Lord. Athenagoras goes so far as to
   call the second marriage a "decent adultery." [650] 50

   The Montanists and Novatians condemned re-marriage, and made it a
   subject of discipline.

   Tertullian came forward with the greatest decision, as advocate of
   monogamy against both successive and simultaneous polygamy. [651] 51 He
   thought thus to occupy the true middle ground between the ascetic
   Gnostics, who rejected marriage altogether, and the Catholics, who
   allowed more than one. [652] 52 In the earlier period of his life, when
   he drew the above picture of Christian marriage, before his adoption of
   Montanism., he already placed a high estimate on celibacy as a superior
   grade of Christian holiness, appealing to 1 Cor. 7:9 and advised at
   least his wife, in case of his death, not to marry again, especially
   with a heathen; but in his Montanistic writings, "De Exhortatione
   Castitatis" and "De Monogamia," he repudiates second marriage from
   principle, and with fanatical zeal contends against it as unchristian,
   as an act of polygamy, nay of "stuprum" and "adulterium." He opposes it
   with all sorts of acute argument; now, on the ground of an ideal
   conception of marriage as a spiritual union of two souls for time and
   eternity; now, from an opposite sensuous view; and again, on principles
   equally good against all marriage and in favor of celibacy. Thus, on
   the one hand, he argues, that the second marriage impairs the spiritual
   fellowship with the former partner, which should continue beyond the
   grave, which should show itself in daily intercessions and in yearly
   celebration of the day of death, and which hopes even for outward
   reunion after the resurrection. [653] 53 On the other hand, however, he
   places the essence of marriage in the communion of flesh, [654] 54 and
   regards it as a mere concession, which God makes to our sensuality, and
   which man therefore should not abuse by repetition. The ideal of the
   Christian life, with him, not only for the clergy, but the laity also,
   is celibacy. He lacks clear perception of the harmony of the moral and
   physical elements which constitutes the essence of marriage; and
   strongly as he elsewhere combats the Gnostic dualism, he here falls in
   with it in his depreciation of matter and corporeity, as necessarily
   incompatible with spirit. His treatment of the exegetical arguments of
   the defenders of second marriage is remarkable. The levirate law, he
   says, is peculiar to the Old Testament economy. To Rom. 7:2 he replies,
   that Paul speaks here from the position of the Mosaic law, which,
   according to the same passage is no longer binding on Christians. In 1
   Cor. 7, the apostle allows second marriage only in his subjective,
   human judgment, and from regard to our sensuous infirmity; but in the
   same chapter (1 Cor 7:40) he recommends celibacy to all, and that on
   the authority of the Lord, adding here, that he also has the Holy
   Spirit, i.e. the principle, which is active in the new prophets of
   Montanism. The appeal to 1 Tim. 3:2; Tit. 1:6, from which the right of
   laymen to second marriage was inferred, as the prohibition of it there
   related only to the clergy, he met with the doctrine of the universal
   priesthood of believers, which admitted them all both to the privileges
   and to the obligations of priests. But his reasoning always amounts in
   the end to this: that the state of original virgin purity, which has
   nothing at all to do with the sensual, is the best. The true chastity
   consists therefore not in the chaste spirit of married partners, but in
   the entire continence of "virgines" and "spadones." The desire of
   posterity, he, contrary to the Old Testament, considers unworthy of a
   Christian, who, in fact, ought to break away entirely from the world,
   and renounce all inheritance in it. Such a morality, forbidding the
   same that it allows, and rigorously setting as an ideal what it must in
   reality abate at least for the mass of mankind, may be very far above
   the heathen level, but is still plainly foreign to the deeper substance
   and the world-sanctifying principle of Christianity.

   The Catholic church, indeed, kept aloof from this Montanistic
   extravagance, and forbade second marriage only to the clergy (which the
   Greek church does to this day); yet she rather advised against it, and
   leaned very decidedly towards a preference for celibacy, as a higher
   grade of Christian morality. [655] 55

   As to the relation of parents and children, Christianity exerted from
   the beginning a most salutary influence. It restrained the tyrannical
   power of the father. It taught the eternal value of children as heirs
   of the kingdom of heaven, and commenced the great work of education on
   a religious and moral basis. It resisted with all energy the exposition
   of children, who were then generally devoured by dogs and wild beasts,
   or, if found, trained up for slavery or doomed to a life of infamy.
   Several apologists, the author to the Epistle of Diognetus, Justin
   Martyr, [656] 56 Minutius Felix, Tertullian, and Arnobius speak with
   just indignation against this unnatural custom. Athenagoras declares
   abortion and exposure to be equal to murder. [657] 57 No heathen
   philosopher had advanced so far. Lactantius also puts exposure on a par
   with murder even of the worst kind, and admits no excuse on the ground
   of pity or poverty, since God provides for all his creatures. [658] 58
   The Christian spirit of humanity gradually so penetrated the spirit of
   the age that the better emperors, from the time of Trajan, began to
   direct their attention to the diminution of these crying evils; but the
   best legal enactments would never have been able to eradicate them
   without the spiritual influence of the church. The institutions and
   donations of Trajan, Antonins Pius, Septimius Severus, and private
   persons, for the education of poor children, boys and girls, were
   approaches of the nobler heathen towards the genius of Christianity.
   Constantine proclaimed a law in 315 throughout Italy "to turn parents
   from using a parricidal hand on their new-born children, and to dispose
   their hearts to the best sentiments." The Christian fathers, councils,
   emperors, and lawgivers united their efforts to uproot this monstrous
   evil and to banish it from the civilized world. [659] 59

   [640] Among the converted courtesans of the ancient church in the Roman
   calendar are St. Mary Magdalene, St. Mary of Egypt, St. Afra, St.
   Pelagia, St. Thais, and St. Theodota. See Charles de Bussy Les
   Courtisanes saintes. St. Vitalius, it is said, visited dens of vice
   every night, gave money to the inmates to keep them from sin, and
   offered up prayers for their conversion. A curious story is told of St.
   Serapion, who went to such a place by appointment, and prayed and
   prayed and prayed till the unfortunate courtesan was converted and fell
   half dead at his feet. See Lecky, II. 338.

   [641] This beautiful idea (often attributed to Matthew Henry, the
   commentator) was first suggested by Augustin. De Genesi ad Literam, l.
   IX. c. 13 (in Migne's ed. of Opera, III.col. 402), and fully stated by
   Peter the Lombard, Sentent. l. II. Dist. XVIII. (de formatione
   mulieris): "Mulier de viro, non de qualibet parte corporis viri, sed de
   latere eius formata est, ut ostenderetur quia in consortium creabatur
   dilectionis, ne forte, si fuisset de capite facta, viro ad dominationem
   videretur preferenda, aut si de pedibus, ad servitutem subjicienda.
   Quia igitur viro nec domina, nec ancilla parabatur, sed socia, nec
   capite, nec de pedibus, sed de latere fuerat producenda, ut juxta se
   ponendam cognosceret quam de suo latere sumptam didicisset." And again
   by Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theol. Pars. I. Quaest. XCII. Art. III. (in
   Migne's ed. l.col. 1231).

   [642] Eph. 5:28-32. The Vulgate translates to musterion in ver. 32 by
   sacramentum, and thus furnished a quasi-exegetical foundation to the
   Catholic doctrine of the sacrament of marriage. The passage is so used
   by the Council of Trent and in the Roman Catechism. Ellicott (in loc.)
   judges that "the words cannot possibly be urged in favor of the
   sacramental nature of marriage, but that the very fact of the
   comparison does place marriage on a far holier and higher basis than
   modern theories are disposed to admit." Bengel refers "the mystery "
   not to marriage, but to the union of Christ with the church ("non
   matrimonium humanum sed ipsa conjunctio Christi et ecclesiae "). Meyer
   refers it to the preceding quotation from Genesis; Estius and Ellicott
   to the intimate conjugal relationship.

   [655] "Non prohibemus secundas nuptias, " says Ambrose, "sed non
   suademus." None of the fathers recommends remarriage or even approves
   of it. Jerome represented the prevailing view of the Nicene age. He
   took the lowest view of marriage as a mere safeguard against
   fornication and adultery, and could conceive of no other motive for
   second or third marriage but animal passion. "The first Adam, " he
   says, "had one wife; the second Adam had no wife. Those who approve of
   digamy hold forth a third Adam, who was twice married, whom they
   follow" (Contra Jovin. 1). Gregory of Nazianzum infers from the analogy
   of marriage to the union of Christ with his church that second marriage
   is to be reproved, as there is but one Christ and one church (Orat.
   XXXI).

   But men (that there may be no crime with which they may not pollute
   their hands) deprive souls as yet innocent and simple of the light
   which they themselves have not given. Can they be considered innocent
   who expose their own offspring as a prey to dogs, and as far as it
   depends upon themselves, kill them in a more cruel manner than if they
   had strangled them? Who can doubt that he is impious who gives occasion
   for the pity of others? For, although that which he has wished should
   befall the child--namely, that it should be brought up--he has
   certainly consigned his own offspring either to servitude or to the
   brothel? But who does not understand, who is ignorant what things may
   happen, or are accustomed to happen, in the case of each sex, even
   through error? For this is shown by the example of OEdipus alone,
   confused with twofold guilt. It is therefore as wicked to expose as it
   is to kill. But truly parricides complain of the scantiness of their
   means, and allege that they have not enough for bringing up more
   children; as though, in truth, their means were in the power of these
   who possess them, or God did not daily make the rich poor, and the poor
   rich. Wherefore, if any one on account of poverty shall be unable to
   bring up children, it is better to abstain from marriage than with
   wicked hands to mar the work of God."

   § 100. Brotherly Love, and Love for Enemies.

   Schaubach: Das Verhältniss der Moral des classischen Alterthums zur
   christlichen, beleuchtet durch vergleichende Erörterung der Lehre von
   der Feindesliebe, in the "Studien und Kritiken" for 1851, p. 59-121.
   Also the works of Schmidt, Chastel, Uhlhorn, etc., quoted at § 88
   above.

   It is generally admitted, that selfishness was the soul of heathen
   morality. The great men of antiquity rose above its sordid forms, love
   of gain and love of pleasure, but were the more under the power of
   ambition and love of fame. It was for fame that Miltiades and
   Themistocles fought against the Persians; that Alexander set out on his
   tour of conquest; that Herodotus wrote his history, that Pindar sang
   his odes, that Sophocles composed his tragedies, that Demosthenes
   delivered his orations, that Phidias sculptured his Zeus. Fame was set
   forth in the Olympian games as the highest object of life; fame was
   held up by Aeschylus as the last comfort of the suffering; fame was
   declared by Cicero, before a large assembly, the ruling passion of the
   very best of men. [660] 60 Even the much-lauded patriotism of the
   heroes of ancient Greece and Rome was only an enlarged egotism. In the
   catalogue of classical virtues we look in vain for the two fundamental
   and cardinal virtues, love and humility. The very word which
   corresponds in Greek to humility [661] 61 signifies generally, in
   classical usage, a mean, abject mind. The noblest and purest form of
   love known to the heathen moralist is friendship, which Cicero praises
   as the highest good next to wisdom. But friendship itself rested, as
   was freely admitted, on a utilitarian, that is, on an egotistic basis,
   and was only possible among persons of equal or similar rank in
   society. For the stranger, the barbarian, and the enemy, the Greek and
   Roman knew no love, but only contempt and hatred. The jus talionis, the
   return of evil for evil, was universally acknowledged throughout the
   heathen world as a just principle and maxim, in direct opposition to
   the plainest injunctions of the New Testament. [662] 62 We must offend
   those who offend us, says Aeschylus. [663] 63 Not to take revenge was
   regarded as a sign of weakness and cowardice. To return evil for good
   is devilish; to return good for good is human and common to all
   religions; to return good for evil is Christlike and divine, and only
   possible in the Christian religion.

   On the other hand, however, we should suppose that every Christian
   virtue must find some basis in the noblest moral instincts and
   aspirations of nature; since Christianity is not against nature, but
   simply above it and intended for it. Thus we may regard the liberality,
   benevolence, humanity and magnanimity which we meet with in heathen
   antiquity, as an approximation to, and preparation for, the Christian
   virtue of charity. The better schools of moralists rose more or less
   above the popular approval of hatred of the enemy, wrath and revenge.
   Aristotle and the Peripatetics, without condemning this passion as
   wrong in itself, enjoined at least moderation in its exercise. The
   Stoics went further, and required complete apathy or suppression of all
   strong and passionate affections. Cicero even declares placability and
   clemency one of the noblest traits in the character of a great man,
   [664] 64 and praises Caesar for forgetting nothing except injuries.
   Seneca, Epictetus, Plutarch, and Marcus Aurelius, who were already
   indirectly and unconsciously under the influence of the atmosphere of
   Christian morality, decidedly condemn anger and vindictiveness, and
   recommend kindness to slaves, and a generous treatment even of enemies.

   But this sort of love for an enemy, it should be remembered, in the
   first place, does not flow naturally from the spirit of heathenism, but
   is, as it were, an accident and exception; secondly, it is not enjoined
   as a general duty, but expected only from the great and the wise;
   thirdly, it does not rise above the conception of magnanimity, which,
   more closely considered, is itself connected with a refined form of
   egotism, and with a noble pride that regards it below the dignity of a
   gentleman to notice the malice of inferior men; [665] 65 fourthly, it
   is commended only in its negative aspect as refraining from the right
   of retaliation, not as active benevolence and charity to the enemy,
   which returns good for evil; and finally it is nowhere derived from a
   religious principle, the love of God to man, and therefore has no
   proper root, and lacks the animating soul.

   No wonder, then, that in spite of the finest maxims of a few
   philosophers, the imperial age was controlled by the coldest
   selfishness, so that, according to the testimony of Plutarch,
   friendship had died out even in families, and the love of brothers and
   sisters was supposed to be possible only in a heroic age long passed
   by. The old Roman world was a world without charity. Julian the
   Apostate, who was educated a Christian, tried to engraft charity upon
   heathenism, but in vain. The idea of the infinite value of each human
   soul, even the poorest and humblest, was wanting, and with it the basis
   for true charity.

   It was in such an age of universal egotism that Christianity first
   revealed the true spirit of love to man as flowing from the love of
   God, and exhibited it in actual life. This cardinal virtue we meet
   first within the Church itself, as the bond of union among believers,
   and the sure mark of the genuine disciple of Jesus. "That especially,"
   says Tertullian to the heathen, in a celebrated passage of his
   Apologeticus, "which love works among us, exposes us to many a
   suspicion. 'Behold,' they say, 'how they love one another!' Yea, verily
   this must strike them; for they hate each other. 'And how ready they
   are to die for one another!' Yea, truly; for they are rather ready to
   kill one another. And even that we call each other 'brethren,' seems to
   them suspicious for no other reason, than that, among them, all
   expressions of kindred are only feigned. We are even your brethren, in
   virtue of the common nature, which is the mother of us all; though ye,
   as evil brethren, deny your human nature. But how much more justly are
   those called and considered brethren, who acknowledge the one God as
   their Father; who have received the one Spirit of holiness; who have
   awaked from the same darkness of uncertainty to the light of the same
   truth?... And we, who are united in spirit and in soul, do not hesitate
   to have also all things common, except wives. For we break fellowship
   just where other men practice it."

   This brotherly love flowed from community of life in Christ. Hence
   Ignatius calls believers "Christ-bearers" and "God-bearers." [666] 66
   The article of the Apostles' Creed: "I believe in the communion of
   saints;" the current appellation of "brother" and "sister;" and the
   fraternal kiss usual on admission into the church, and at the Lord's
   Supper, were not empty forms, nor even a sickly sentimentalism, but the
   expression of true feeling and experience, only strengthened by the
   common danger and persecution. A travelling Christian, of whatever
   language or country, with a letter of recommendation from his bishop,
   [667] 67 was everywhere hospitably received as a long known friend. It
   was a current phrase: In thy brother thou hast seen the Lord himself.
   The force of love reached beyond the grave. Families were accustomed to
   celebrate at appointed times the memory, of their departed members; and
   this was one of the grounds on which Tertullian opposed second
   marriage.

   The brotherly love expressed itself, above all, in the most
   self-sacrificing beneficence to the poor and sick, to widows and
   orphans, to strangers and prisoners, particularly to confessors in
   bonds. It magnifies this virtue in our view, to reflect, that the
   Christians at that time belonged mostly to the lower classes, and in
   times of persecution often lost all their possessions. Every
   congregation was a charitable society, and in its public worship took
   regular collections for its needy members. The offerings at the
   communion and love-feasts, first held on the evening, afterwards on the
   morning of the Lord's Day, were considered a part of worship. [668] 68
   To these were added numberless private charities, given in secret,
   which eternity alone will reveal. The church at Rome had under its care
   a great multitude of widows, orphans, blind, lame, and sick, [669] 69
   whom the deacon Laurentius, in the Decian persecution, showed to the
   heathen prefect, as the most precious treasures of the church. It
   belonged to the idea of a Christian housewife, and was particularly the
   duty of the deaconesses, to visit the Lord, to clothe him, and give him
   meat and drink, in the persons of his needy disciples. Even such
   opponents of Christianity as Lucian testify to this zeal of the
   Christians in labors of love, though they see in it nothing but an
   innocent fanaticism. "It is incredible," says Lucian, "to see the ardor
   with which the people of that religion help each other in their wants.
   They spare nothing. Their first legislator has put into their heads
   that they are all brethren." [670] 70

   This beneficence reached beyond the immediate neighborhood. Charity
   begins at home, but does not stay at, home. In cases of general
   distress the bishops appointed special collections, and also fasts, by
   which food might be saved for suffering brethren. The Roman church sent
   its charities great distances abroad. [671] 71 Cyprian of Carthage,
   who, after his conversion, sold his own estates for the benefit of the
   poor, collected a hundred thousand sestertia, or more than three
   thousand dollars, to redeem Christians of Numidia, who had been taken
   captive by neighboring barbarians; and he considered it a high
   privilege "to be able to ransom for a small sum of money him, who has
   redeemed us from the dominion of Satan with his own blood." A father,
   who refused to give alms on account of his children, Cyprian charged
   with the additional sin of binding his children to an earthly
   inheritance, instead of pointing them to the richest and most loving
   Father in heaven.

   Finally, this brotherly love expanded to love even for enemies, which
   returned the heathens good for evil, and not rarely, in persecutions
   and public misfortunes, heaped coals of fire on their heads. During the
   persecution under Gallus (252), when the pestilence raged in Carthage,
   and the heathens threw out their dead and sick upon the streets, ran
   away from them for fear of the contagion, and cursed the Christians as
   the supposed authors of the plague, Cyprian assembled his congregation,
   and exhorted them to love their enemies; whereupon all went to work;
   the rich with their money, the poor with their hands, and rested not,
   till the dead were buried, the sick cared for, and the city saved from
   desolation. The same self-denial appeared in the Christians of
   Alexandria during a ravaging plague under the reign of Gallienus. These
   are only a few prominent manifestations of a spirit which may be traced
   through the whole history of martyrdom and the daily prayers of the
   Christians for their enemies and persecutors. For while the love of
   friends, says Tertullian, is common to all men, the love of enemies is
   a virtue peculiar to Christians. [672] 72 "You forget," he says to the
   heathens in his Apology, "that, notwithstanding your persecutions, far
   from conspiring against you, as our numbers would perhaps furnish us
   with the means of doing, we pray for you and do good to you; that, if
   we give nothing for your gods, we do give for your poor, and that our
   charity spreads more alms in your streets than the offerings presented
   by your religion in your temples."

   The organized congregational charity of the ante-Nicene age provided
   for all the immediate wants. When the state professed Christianity,
   there sprang up permanent charitable institutions for the poor, the
   sick, for strangers, widows, orphans, and helpless old men. [673] 73
   The first clear proof of such institutions we find in the age of Julian
   the Apostate, who tried to check the progress of Christianity and to
   revive paganism by directing the high priest of Galatia, Arsacius, to
   establish in every town a Xenodochium to be supported by the state and
   also by private contributions; for, he said, it was a shame that the
   heathen should be left without support from their own, while "among the
   Jews no beggar can be found, and the godless Galilaeans" (i.e. the
   Christians) "nourish not only their own, but even our own poor." A few
   years afterwards (370) we hear of a celebrated hospital at Caesarea,
   founded by St. Basilius, and called after him "Basilias," and similar
   institutions all over the province of Cappadocia. We find one at
   Antioch at the time of Chrysostom, who took a practical interest in it.
   At Constantinople there were as many as thirty-five hospitals. In the
   West such institutions spread rapidly in Rome, Sicily, Sardinia, and
   Gaul. [674] 74

   § 101. Prayer and Fasting.

   In regard to the importance and the necessity of prayer, as the pulse
   and thermometer of spiritual life, the ancient church had but one
   voice. Here the plainest and the most enlightened Christians met; the
   apostolic fathers, the steadfast apologists, the realistic Africans,
   and the idealistic Alexandrians. Tertullian sees in prayer the daily
   sacrifice of the Christian, the bulwark of faith, the weapon against
   all the enemies of the soul. The believer should not go to his bath nor
   take his food without prayer; for the nourishing and refreshing of the
   spirit must precede that of the body, and the heavenly must go before
   the earthly. "Prayer," says he, "blots out sins, repels temptations,
   quenches persecutions, comforts, the desponding, blesses the
   high-minded, guides the wanderers, calms the billows, feeds the poor,
   directs the rich, raises the fallen, holds up the falling, preserves
   them that stand." Cyprian requires prayer by day and by night; pointing
   to heaven, where we shall never cease to pray and give thanks. The same
   father, however, falls already into that false, unevangelical view,
   which represents prayer as a meritorious work and a satisfaction to be
   rendered to God. [675] 75 Clement of Alexandria conceives the life of a
   genuine Christian as an unbroken prayer. "In every place he will pray,
   though not openly, in the sight of the multitude. Even on his walks, in
   his intercourse with others, in silence, in reading, and in labor, he
   prays in every way. And though he commune with God only in the chamber
   of his soul, and call upon the Father only with a quiet sigh, the
   Father is near him." The same idea we find in Origen, who discourses in
   enthusiastic terms of the mighty inward and outward effects of prayer,
   and with all his enormous learning, regards prayer as the sole key to
   the spiritual meaning of the Scriptures.

   The order of human life, however, demands special times for this
   consecration of the every-day business of men. The Christians generally
   followed the Jewish usage, observed as times of prayer the hours of
   nine, twelve, and three, corresponding also to the crucifixion of
   Christ, his death, and his descent from the cross; the cock-crowing
   likewise, and the still hour of midnight they regarded as calls to
   prayer.

   With prayer for their own welfare, they united intercessions for the
   whole church, for all classes of men, especially for the sick and the
   needy, and even for the unbelieving. Polycarp enjoins on the church of
   Philippi to pray for all the saints, for kings and rulers, for haters
   and persecutors, and for the enemies of the cross. "We pray," says
   Tertullian, "even for the emperors and their ministers, for the holders
   of power on earth, for the repose of all classes, and for the delay of
   the end of the world."

   With the free outpourings of the heart, without which living piety
   cannot exist, we must suppose, that, after the example of the Jewish
   church, standing forms of prayer were also used, especially such as
   were easily impressed on the memory and could thus be freely delivered.
   The familiar "ex pectore" and "sine monitore" of Tertullian prove
   nothing against this; for a prayer committed to memory may and should
   be at the same time a prayer of the heart, as a familiar psalm or hymn
   may be read or sung with ever new devotion. The general use of the
   Lord's Prayer in the ancient church in household and public worship is
   beyond all doubt. The Didache (ch. 8) enjoins it three times a day.
   Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen, wrote special treatises upon it. They
   considered it the model prayer, prescribed by the Lord for the whole
   church. Tertullian calls it the "regular and usual prayer, a brief
   summary of the whole gospel, and foundation of all the other prayers of
   the Christians." The use of it, however, was restricted to
   communicants; because the address presupposes the worshipper's full
   sonship with God, and because the fourth petition was taken in a
   mystical sense, as referring to the holy Supper, and was therefore
   thought not proper for catechumens.

   As to posture in prayer; kneeling or standing, the raising or closing
   of the eyes, the extension or elevation of the hands, were considered
   the most suitable expressions of a bowing spirit and a soul directed
   towards God. On Sunday the standing posture was adopted, in token of
   festive joy over the resurrection from sin and death. But there was no
   uniform law in regard to these forms. Origen lays chief stress on the
   lifting of the soul to God and the bowing of the heart before him; and
   says that, where circumstances require, one can worthily pray sitting,
   or lying, or engaged in business.

   After the Jewish custom, fasting was frequently joined with prayer,
   that the mind, unencumbered by earthly matter, might devote itself with
   less distraction to the contemplation of divine things. The apostles
   themselves sometimes employed this wholesome discipline, [676] 76
   though without infringing the gospel freedom by legal prescriptions. As
   the Pharisees were accustomed to fast twice in the week, on Monday and
   Thursday, the Christians appointed Wednesday and especially Friday, as
   days of half-fasting or abstinence from flesh, [677] 77 in
   commemoration of the passion and crucifixion of Jesus. They did this
   with reference to the Lord's words: "When the bridegroom shall be taken
   away from them, then will they fast." [678] 78

   In the second century arose also the custom of Quadragesimal fasts
   before Easter, which, however, differed in length in different
   countries; being sometimes reduced to forty hours, sometimes extended
   to forty days, or at least to several weeks. Perhaps equally ancient
   are the nocturnal fasts or vigils before the high festivals, suggested
   by the example of the Lord and the apostles. [679] 79 But the
   Quatemporal fasts [680] 80 are of later origin, though founded likewise
   on a custom of the Jews after the exile. On special occasions the
   bishops appointed extraordinary fasts, and applied the money saved to
   charitable purposes; a usage which became often a blessing to the poor.
   Yet hierarchical arrogance and Judaistic legalism early intruded here,
   even to the entire destruction of the liberty of a Christian man. [681]
   81

   This rigidity appeared most in the Montanists. Besides the usual fasts,
   they observed special Xerophagiae [682] 82 as they were called; seasons
   of two weeks for eating only dry or properly uncooked food, bread,
   salt, and water. The Catholic church, with true feeling, refused to
   sanction these excesses as a general rule, but allowed ascetics to
   carry fasting even to extremes. A confessor in Lyons, for example,
   lived on bread and water alone, but forsook that austerity when
   reminded that he gave offence to other Christians by so despising the
   gifts of God.

   Against the frequent over-valuation of fasting, Clement of Alexandria
   quotes the word of Paul: The kingdom of God is not meat and drink,
   therefore neither abstinence from wine and flesh, but righteousness and
   peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.

   § 102. Treatment of the Dead

   Comp. Chapter VII. on the Catacombs.

   The pious care of the living for the beloved dead is rooted in the
   noblest instincts of human future, and is found among all nations,
   ancient and modern, even among barbarians. Hence the general custom of
   surrounding the funeral with solemn rites and prayers, and giving the
   tomb a sacred and inviolable character. The profane violation of the
   dead and robbery of graves were held in desecration, and punished by
   law. [683] 83 No traditions and laws were more sacred among the
   Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans than those that guarded and protected the
   shades of the departed who can do no harm to any of the living. "It is
   the popular belief," says Tertullian, "that the dead cannot enter Hades
   before they are buried." Patroclus appears after his death to his
   friend Achilles in a dream, and thus exhorts him to provide for his
   speedy burial:


   "Achilles, sleepest thou, forgetting me?

   Never of me unmindful in my life,

   Thou dost neglect me dead. O, bury me

   Quickly, and give me entrance through the gates

   Of Hades; for the souls, the forms of those

   Who live no more, repulse me, suffering not

   That I should join their company beyond

   The river, and I now must wander round

   The spacious portals of the House of Death." [684] 84

   Christianity intensified this regard for the departed, and gave it a
   solid foundation by the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and the
   resurrection of the body. Julian the Apostate traced the rapid spread
   and power of that religion to three causes: benevolence, care of the
   dead, and honesty. [685] 85 After the persecution under Marcus
   Aurelius, the Christians in Southern Gaul were much distressed because
   the enraged heathens would not deliver them the corpses of their
   brethren for burial. [686] 86 Sometimes the vessels of the church were
   sold for the purpose. During the ravages of war, famine, and
   pestilence, they considered it their duty to bury the heathen as well
   as their fellow-Christians. When a pestilence depopulated the cities in
   the reign of the tyrannical persecutor Maximinus, "the Christians were
   the only ones in the midst of such distressing circumstances that
   exhibited sympathy and humanity in their conduct. They continued the
   whole day, some in the care and burial of the dead, for numberless were
   they for whom there was none to care; others collected the multitude of
   those wasting by the famine throughout the city, and distributed bread
   among all. So that the fact was cried abroad, and men glorified the God
   of the Christians, constrained, as they were by the facts, to
   acknowledge that these were the only really pious and the only real
   worshippers of God." [687] 87 Lactantius says: "The last and greatest
   office of piety is the burying of strangers and the poor; which subject
   these teachers of virtue and justice have not touched upon at all, as
   they measure all their duties by utility. We will not suffer the image
   and workmanship of God to lie exposed as a prey to beasts and birds;
   but we will restore it to the earth, from which it had its origin; and
   although it be in the case of an unknown man, we will fulfil the office
   of relatives, into whose place, since they are wanting, let kindness
   succeed; and wherever there shall be need of man, there we will think
   that our duty is required." [688] 88

   The early church differed from the pagan and even from the Jewish
   notions by a cheerful and hopeful view of death, and by discarding
   lamentations, rending of clothes, and all signs of extravagant grief.
   The terrors of the grave were dispelled by the light of the
   resurrection, and the idea of death was transformed into the idea of a
   peaceful slumber. No one, says Cyprian, should be made sad by death,
   since in living is labor and peril, in dying peace and the certainty of
   resurrection; and he quotes the examples of Enoch who was translated,
   of Simeon who wished to depart in peace, several passages from Paul,
   and the assurance of the Lord that he went to the Father to prepare
   heavenly mansions for us. [689] 89 The day of a believer's death,
   especially if he were a martyr, was called the day of his heavenly
   birth. His grave was surrounded with symbols of hope and of victory;
   anchors, harps, palms, crowns. The primitive Christians always showed a
   tender care for the dead; under a vivid impression of the unbroken
   communion of saints and the future resurrection of the body in glory.
   For Christianity redeems the body as well as the soul, and consecrates
   it a temple of the Holy Spirit. Hence the Greek and Roman custom of
   burning the corpse (crematio) was repugnant to Christian feeling and
   the sacredness of the body. [690] 90 Tertullian even declared it a
   symbol of the fire of hell, and Cyprian regarded it as equivalent to
   apostasy. In its stead, the church adopted the primitive Jewish usage
   of burial (inhumatio), [691] 91 practiced also by the Egyptians and
   Babylonians. The bodies of the dead were washed, [692] 92 wrapped in
   linen cloths, [693] 93 sometimes embalmed, [694] 94 and then, in the
   presence of ministers, relatives, and friends, with prayer and singing
   of psalms, committed as seeds of immortality to the bosom of the earth.
   Funeral discourses were very common as early as the Nicene period.
   [695] 95 But in the times of persecution the interment was often
   necessarily performed as hastily and secretly as possible. The
   death-days of martyrs the church celebrated annually at their graves
   with oblations, love feasts, and the Lord's Supper. Families likewise
   commemorated their departed members in the domestic circle. The current
   prayers for the dead were originally only thanksgiving for the grace of
   God manifested to them. But they afterwards passed into intercessions,
   without any warrant in the reaching of the apostles, and in connection
   with questionable views in regard to the intermediate state.
   Tertullian, for instance, in his argument against second marriage, says
   of the Christian widow, she prays for the soul of her departed husband,
   [696] 96 and brings her annual offering on the day of his departure.

   The same feeling of the inseparable communion of saints gave rise to
   the usage, unknown to the heathens, of consecrated places of common
   burial. [697] 97 For these cemeteries, the Christians, in the times of
   persecution, when they were mostly poor and enjoyed no corporate
   rights, selected remote, secret spots, and especially subterranean
   vaults, called at first crypts, but after the sixth century commonly
   termed catacombs, or resting-places, which have been discussed in a
   previous chapter.

   We close with a few stanzas of the Spanish poet Prudentius (d. 405), in
   which he gives forcible expression to the views and feelings of the
   ancient church before the open grave: [698] 98


   "No more, ah, no more sad complaining;

   Resign these fond pledges to earth:

   Stay, mothers, the thick-falling tear-drops;

   This death is a heavenly birth.


   Take, Earth, to thy bosom so tender,--

   Take, nourish this body. How fair,

   How noble in death! We surrender

   These relics of man to thy care


   This, this was the home of the spirit,

   Once built by the breath of our God;

   And here, in the light of his wisdom,

   Christ, Head of the risen, abode.


   Guard well the dear treasure we lend thee

   The Maker, the Saviour of men:

   Shall never forget His beloved,

   But claim His own likeness again."

   § 103. Summary of Moral Reforms.

   Christianity represents the thoughts and purposes of God in history.
   They shine as so many stars in the darkness of sin and error. They are
   unceasingly opposed, but make steady progress and are sure of final
   victory. Heathen ideas and practices with their degrading influences
   controlled the ethics, politics, literature, and the house and home of
   emperor and peasant, when the little band of despised and persecuted
   followers of Jesus of Nazareth began the unequal struggle against
   overwhelming odds and stubborn habits. It was a struggle of faith
   against superstition, of love against selfishness, of purity against
   corruption, of spiritual forces against political and social power.

   Under the inspiring influence of the spotless purity of Christ's
   teaching and example, and aided here and there by the nobler instincts
   and tendencies of philosophy, the Christian church from the beginning
   asserted the individual rights of man, recognized the divine image in
   every rational being, taught the common creation and common redemption,
   the destination of all for immortality and glory, raised the humble and
   the lowly, comforted the prisoner and captive, the stranger and the
   exile, proclaimed chastity as a fundamental virtue, elevated woman to
   dignity and equality with man, upheld the sanctity and inviolability of
   the marriage tie, laid the foundation of a Christian family and happy
   home, moderated the evils and undermined the foundations of slavery,
   opposed polygamy and concubinage, emancipated the children from the
   tyrannical control of parents, denounced the exposure of children as
   murder, made relentless war upon the bloody games of the arena and the
   circus, and the shocking indecencies of the theatre, upon cruelty and
   oppression and every vice infused into a heartless and loveless world
   the spirit of love and brotherhood, transformed sinners into saints,
   frail women into heroines, and lit up the darkness of the tomb by the
   bright ray of unending bliss in heaven.

   Christianity reformed society from the bottom, and built upwards until
   it reached the middle and higher classes, and at last the emperor
   himself. Then soon after the conversion of Constantine it began to
   influence legislation, abolished cruel institutions, and enacted laws
   which breathe the spirit of justice and humanity. We may deplore the
   evils which followed in the train of the union of church and state, but
   we must not overlook its many wholesome effects upon the Justinian code
   which gave Christian ideas an institutional form and educational power
   for whole generations to this day. From that time on also began the
   series of charitable institutions for widows and orphans, for the poor
   and the sick, the blind and the deaf, the intemperate and criminal, and
   for the care of all unfortunate,--institutions which we seek in vain in
   any other but Christian countries.

   Nor should the excesses of asceticism blind us against the moral
   heroism of renouncing rights and enjoyments innocent in themselves, but
   so generally abused and poisoned, that total abstinence seemed to most
   of the early fathers the only radical and effective cure. So in our
   days some of the best of men regard total abstinence rather than
   temperance, the remedy of the fearful evils of intemperance.

   Christianity could not prevent the irruption of the Northern barbarians
   and the collapse of the Roman empire. The process of internal
   dissolution had gone too far; nations as well as individuals may
   physically and morally sink so low that they, are beyond the
   possibility of recovery. Tacitus, the heathen Stoic in the second
   century, and Salvianus, the Christian presbyter in the fifth, each a
   Jeremiah of his age, predicted the approaching doom and destruction of
   Roman society, looked towards the savage races of the North for fresh
   blood and new vigor. But the Keltic and Germanic conquerors would have
   turned Southern Europe into a vast solitude (as the Turks have laid
   waste the fairest portions of Asia), if they had not embraced the
   principles, laws, and institutions of the Christian church.

   Here we enter a field where the early church appears most remote from
   the free spirit of evangelical Protestantism and modern ethics and
   stands nearest the legalistic and monastic ethics of Greek and Roman
   Catholicism. Christian life was viewed as consisting mainly in certain
   outward exercises, rather than an inward disposition, in a multiplicity
   of acts rather than a life of faith. The great ideal of virtue was,
   according to the prevailing notion of the fathers and councils, not so
   much to transform the world and sanctify the natural things and
   relations created by God, as to flee from the world into monastic
   seclusion, and voluntarily renounce property and marriage. The Pauline
   doctrine of faith and of justification by grace alone steadily
   retreated, or rather, it was never yet rightly enthroned in the general
   thought and life of the church. The qualitative view of morality
   yielded more and more to quantitative calculation by the number of
   outward meritorious and even supererogatory works, prayer, fasting,
   alms-giving, voluntary poverty, and celibacy. This necessarily brought
   with it a Judaizing self-righteousness and overestimate of the ascetic
   life, which developed, by an irresistible impulse, into the hermit-life
   and monasticism of the Nicene age. All the germs of this asceticism
   appear in the second half of the third century, and even earlier.

   Asceticism in general is a rigid outward self-discipline, by which the
   spirit strives after full dominion over the flesh, and a superior grade
   of virtue. [699] 99 It includes not only that true moderation or
   restraint of the animal appetites, which is a universal Christian duty,
   but total abstinence from enjoyments in themselves lawful, from wine,
   animal food, property, and marriage, together with all kinds of
   penances and mortifications of the body. In the union of the
   abstractive and penitential elements, or of self-denial and
   self-punishment, the catholic asceticism stands forth complete in light
   and shade; exhibiting, on the one hand, wonderful examples of heroic
   renunciation of self and the world, but very often, on the other, a
   total misapprehension and perversion of Christian morality; the
   renunciation involving, more or less a Gnostic contempt of the gifts
   and ordinances of the God of nature, and the penance or self-punishment
   running into practical denial of the all-sufficient merits of Christ.
   The ascetic and monastic tendency rests primarily upon a lively, though
   in morbid sense of the sinfulness, of the flesh and the corruption of
   the world; then upon the desire for solitude and exclusive occupation
   with divine things; and finally, upon the ambition to attain
   extraordinary holiness and merit. It would anticipate upon earth the
   life of angels in heaven. [700] 00 It substitutes all abnormal,
   self-appointed virtue and piety for the normal forms prescribed by the
   Creator; and not rarely looks down upon the divinely-ordained standard
   with spiritual pride. It is a mark at once of moral strength and moral
   weakness. It presumes a certain degree of culture, in which man has
   emancipated himself from the powers of nature and risen to the
   consciousness of his moral calling; but thinks to secure itself against
   temptation only by entire separation from the world, instead of
   standing in the world to overcome it and transform it into the kingdom
   of God.

   Asceticism is by no means limited to the Christian church, but it there
   developed its highest and noblest form. We observe kindred phenomena
   long before Christ; among the Jews, in the Nazarites, the Essenes, and
   the cognate Therapeutae, [701] 01 and still more among the heathens, in
   the old Persian and Indian religions, especially among the Buddhists,
   who have even a fully developed system of monastic life, which struck
   some Roman missionaries as the devil's caricature of the Catholic
   system. In Egypt the priests of Serapis led a monastic life. [702] 02
   There is something in the very climate of the land of the Pharaohs, in
   its striking contrast between the solitude of the desert and the
   fertility of the banks of the Nile, so closely bordering on each other,
   and in the sepulchral sadness of the people, which induces men to
   withdraw from the busy turmoil and the active duties of life. It is
   certain that the first Christian hermits and monks were Egyptians. Even
   the Grecian philosophy was conceived by the Pythagoreans, the
   Platonists, and the Stoics, not as theoretical knowledge merely, but
   also as practical wisdom, and frequently joined itself to the most
   rigid abstemiousness, so that "philosopher" and "ascetic" were
   interchangeable terms. Several apologists of the second century had by
   this practical philosophy particularly the Platonic, been led to
   Christianity; and they on this account retained their simple dress and
   mode of life. Tertullian congratulates the philosopher's cloak on
   having now become the garb of a better philosophy. In the show of
   self-denial the Cynics, the followers of Diogenes, went to the extreme;
   but these, at least in their later degenerate days, concealed under the
   guise of bodily squalor, untrimmed nails, and uncombed hair, a vulgar
   cynical spirit, and a bitter hatred of Christianity.

   In the ancient church there was a special class of Christians of both
   sexes who, under the name of "ascetics" or "abstinents," [703] 03
   though still living in the midst of the community, retired from
   society, voluntarily renounced marriage and property, devoted
   themselves wholly to fasting, prayer, and religious contemplation, and
   strove thereby to attain Christian perfection. Sometimes they formed a
   society of their own, [704] 04 for mutual improvement, an ecclesiola in
   ecelesia, in which even children could be received and trained to
   abstinence. They shared with the confessors the greatest regard from
   their fellow-Christians, had a separate seat in the public worship, and
   were considered the fairest ornaments of the church. In times of
   persecution they sought with enthusiasm a martyr's death as the crown
   of perfection.

   While as yet each congregation was a lonely oasis in the desert of the
   world's corruption, and stood in downright opposition to the
   surrounding heathen world, these ascetics had no reason for separating
   from it and flying into the desert. It was under and after Constantine,
   and partly as the result of the union of church and state, the
   consequent transfer of the world into the church, and the cessation of
   martyrdom, that asceticism developed itself to anchoretism and monkery,
   and endeavored thus to save the virgin purity of the church by carrying
   it into the wilderness. The first Christian hermit, Paul of Thebes, is
   traced back to the middle of the third century, but is lost in the mist
   of fable; St. Anthony, the real father of monks, belongs to the age of
   Constantine. [705] 05 At the time of Cyprian [706] 06 there was as yet
   no absolutely binding vow. The early origin and wide spread of this
   ascetic life are due to the deep moral earnestness of Christianity, and
   the prevalence of sin in all the social relations of the then still
   thoroughly pagan world. It was the excessive development of the
   negative, world-rejecting element in Christianity, which preceded its
   positive effort to transform and sanctify the world.

   The ascetic principle, however, was not confined, in its influence, to
   the proper ascetics and monks. It ruled more or less the entire
   morality and piety of the ancient and mediaeval church; though on the
   other hand, there were never wanting in her bosom protests of the free
   evangelical spirit against moral narrowness and excessive regard to the
   outward works of the law. The ascetics were but the most consistent
   representatives of the old catholic piety, and were commended as such
   by the apologists to the heathens. They formed the spiritual nobility,
   the flower of the church, and served especially as examples to the
   clergy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [699] Askesis, from askeo,to exercise, to strengthen; primarily applied
   to athletic and gymnastic exercise-, but used also, even by the
   heathens and by Philo, of moral self-discipline. Clement of Alex.
   represents the whole Christian life as an askesis (Strom. IV. 22) and
   calls the patriarch Jacob an asketes(Paedlag. I. 7). But at the same
   time the term asketaiwas applied from the middle of the second century
   by Athenagoras, Tertullian, Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius, Epiphanius,
   Jerome, etc., to a special class of self-denying Christians. Clement of
   Alex., styles them eklekton eklektoteroi(Quis Dives salv. 36; Strom.
   VIII. 15). Thus " ascetics" assumed the same meaning as " religious" in
   the middle ages. Zöckler takes a comprehensive view of asceticism, and
   divides it into eight branches, 1) the asceticism of penal discipline
   and self-castigation; 2) of domestic life; 3) of diet (fasting,
   abstinence); 4) of sexual life (celibacy); 5) of devotion; 6) of
   contemplation; 7) of practical life; 8) of social life (solitude,
   poverty, obedience).

   [700] Matt. 22:30. Hence the frequent designation of monastic life as a
   vita angelica.

   [701] As described by Philo in his tract De vita contemplativa (peri
   biou theoretikou). Eusebius (II. 17) mistook the Therapeutae for
   Christian ascetics, and later historians for Christian monks. It was
   supposed that Philo was converted by the Apostle Peter. This error was
   not dispelled till after the Reformation. Lucius in his recent
   monograph, sees in that tract an apology of Christian asceticism
   written at the close of the third century under the name of Philo. But
   Weingarten (in Herzog X. 761 sqq.) again argues for the Jewish, though
   post-Philonic origin of that book.

   [702] The Serapis monks have been made known by the researches of
   Letronne, Boissier, and especially Brunet de Presle (Mémoire sur le
   Sérapeum de Memphis, 1852 and 1865). Weingarten derives Christian
   monasticism from this source, and traces the resemblance of the two.
   Pachomius was himself a monk of Serapis before his conversion. See
   Revillout, Le reclus du Serapeum (Paris 1880, quoted by Weingarten in
   Herzog X. 784).

   [703] Asketai, continentes also parthenoi, virgines.

   [704] Asketerion.

   [705] Paul of Thebes withdrew in his sixteenth year, under the Decian
   persecution (250), to a cavern in the lower Thebais, and lived there
   for one hundred and thirteen years, fed by a raven, and known only to
   God until St. Anthony, about 350, revealed his existence to the world.
   But his biography is a pious romance of Jerome, the most zealous
   promoter of asceticism and monasticism in the West. "The Life of St.
   Anthony" (d. about 356) is usually ascribed to St. Athanasius, and has
   undoubtedly a strong historic foundation. Eusebius never mentions him,
   for the two passages in the Chronicon (ed. Schöne II. 192, 195) belong
   to the continuation of Jerome. But soon after the middle of the fourth
   century Anthony was regarded as the patriarch of monasticism, and his
   biography exerted great influence upon Gregory of Nazianzum, Jerome,
   and Augustin. See vol. III. 179 sqq. Weingarten denies the Athanasian
   authorship of the biography, but not the historic existence of Anthony
   (in Herzog, revised ed. vol. X. 774).

   [706] Epist. LXII.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 105. Heretical and Catholic Asceticism.

   But we must now distinguish two different kinds of asceticism in
   Christian antiquity: a heretical and an orthodox or Catholic. The
   former rests on heathen philosophy, the latter is a development of
   Christian ideas.

   The heretical asceticism, the beginnings of which are resisted in the
   New Testament itself, [707] 07 meets us in the Gnostic and Manichaean
   sects. It is descended from Oriental and Platonic ideas, and is based
   on a dualistic view of the world, a confusion of sin with matter, and a
   perverted idea of God and the creation. It places God and the world at
   irreconcilable enmity, derives the creation from an inferior being,
   considers the human body substantially evil, a product of the devil or
   the demiurge, and makes it the great moral business of man to rid
   himself of the same, or gradually to annihilate it, whether by
   excessive abstinence or by unbridled indulgence. Many of the Gnostics
   placed the fall itself in the first gratification of the sexual desire,
   which subjected man to the dominion of the Hyle.

   The orthodox or catholic asceticism starts from a literal and
   overstrained construction of certain passages of Scripture. It admits
   that all nature is the work of God and the object of his love, and
   asserts the divine origin and destiny of the human body, without which
   there could, in fact, be no resurrection, and hence no admittance to
   eternal glory. [708] 08 It therefore aims not to mortify the body, but
   perfectly to control and sanctify it. For the metaphysical dualism
   between spirit and matter, it substitutes the ethical conflict between
   the spirit and the flesh. But in practice it exceeds the simple and
   sound limits of the Bible, falsely substitutes the bodily appetites and
   affections, or sensuous nature, as such, for the flesh, or the
   principle of selfishness, which resides in the soul as well as the
   body; and thus, with all its horror of heresy, really joins in the
   Gnostic and Manichaean hatred of the body as the prison of the spirit.
   This comes out especially in the depreciation of marriage and the
   family life, that divinely appointed nursery of church and state, and
   in excessive self-inflictions, to which the apostolic piety affords not
   the remotest parallel. The heathen Gnostic principle of separation from
   the world and from the body, [709] 09 as a means of self-redemption,
   after being theoretically exterminated, stole into the church by a back
   door of practice, directly in face of the Christian doctrine of the
   high destiny of the body and perfect redemption through Christ.

   The Alexandrian fathers furnished a theoretical basis for this
   asceticism in the distinction of a lower and higher morality, which
   corresponds to the Platonic or Pythagorean distinction between the life
   according to nature and the life above nature or the practical and
   contemplative life. It was previously suggested by Hermas about the
   middle of the second century. [710] 10 Tertullian made a corresponding
   opposite distinction of mortal and venial sins. [711] 11 Here was a
   source of serious practical errors, and an encouragement both to moral
   laxity and ascetic extravagance. The ascetics, and afterwards the
   monks, formed or claimed to be a moral nobility, a spiritual
   aristocracy, above the common Christian people; as the clergy stood in
   a separate caste of inviolable dignity above the laity, who were
   content with a lower grade of virtue. Clement of Alexandria, otherwise
   remarkable for his elevated ethical views, requires of the sage or
   gnostic, that he excel the plain Christian not only by higher
   knowledge, but also by higher, emotionless virtue, and stoical
   superiority to all bodily conditions; and he inclines to regard the
   body, with Plato, as the grave and fetter [712] 12 of the soul. How
   little he understood the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith,
   may be inferred from a passage in the Stromata, where be explains the
   word of Christ: "Thy faith hath saved thee," as referring, not to faith
   simply, but to the Jews only, who lived according to the law; as if
   faith was something to be added to the good works, instead of being the
   source and principle of the holy life. [713] 13 Origen goes still
   further, and propounds quite distinctly the catholic doctrine of two
   kinds of morality and piety, a lower for all Christians, and a higher
   for saints or the select few. [714] 14 He includes in the higher
   morality works of supererogation, [715] 15 i.e. works not enjoined
   indeed in the gospel, yet recommended as counsels of perfection, [716]
   16 which were supposed to establish a peculiar merit and secure a
   higher degree of blessedness. He who does only what is required of all
   is an unprofitable servant; [717] 17 but he who does more, who
   performs, for example, what Paul, in 1 Cor. 7:25, merely recommends,
   concerning the single state, or like him, resigns his just claim to
   temporal remuneration for spiritual service, is called a good and
   faithful servant. [718] 18

   Among these works were reckoned martyrdom, voluntary poverty, and
   voluntary celibacy. All three, or at least the last two of these acts,
   in connection with the positive Christian virtues, belong to the idea
   of the higher perfection, as distinguished from the fulfilment of
   regular duties, or ordinary morality. To poverty and celibacy was
   afterwards added absolute obedience; and these three things were the
   main subjects of the consilia evangelica and the monastic vow.

   The ground on which these particular virtues were so strongly urged is
   easily understood. Property, which is so closely allied to the
   selfishness of man and binds him to the earth, and sexual intercourse,
   which brings out sensual passion in its greatest strength, and which
   nature herself covers with the veil of modesty;--these present
   themselves as the firmest obstacles to that perfection, in which God
   alone is our possession, and Christ alone our love and delight.

   In these things the ancient heretics went to the extreme. The Ebionites
   made poverty the condition of salvation. The Gnostics were divided
   between the two excesses of absolute self-denial and unbridled
   self-indulgence. The Marcionites, Carpocratians, Prodicians, false
   Basilidians, and Manichaeans objected to individual property, from
   hatred to the material world; and Epiphanes, in a book "on Justice"
   about 125, defined virtue as a community with equality, and advocated
   the community of goods and women. The more earnest of these heretics
   entirely prohibited marriage and procreation as a diabolical work, as
   in the case of Saturninus, Marcion, and the Encratites; while other
   Gnostic sects substituted for it the most shameless promiscuous
   intercourse, as in Carpocrates, Epiphanes, and the Nicolaitans.

   The ancient church, on the contrary, held to the divine institution of
   property and marriage, and was content to recommend the voluntary
   renunciation of these intrinsically lawful pleasures to the few elect,
   as means of attaining Christian perfection. She declared marriage holy,
   virginity more holy. But unquestionably even the church fathers so
   exalted the higher holiness of virginity, as practically to neutralize,
   or at least seriously to weaken, their assertion of the holiness of
   marriage. The Roman church, in spite of the many Bible examples of
   married men of God from Abraham to Peter, can conceive no real holiness
   without celibacy, and therefore requires celibacy of its clergy without
   exception.

   § 106. Voluntary Poverty.

   The recommendation of voluntary poverty was based on a literal
   interpretation of the Lord's advice to the rich young ruler, who had
   kept all the commandments from his youth up: "If thou wouldest be
   perfect, go, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
   have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me." [719] 19 To this were
   added the actual examples of the poverty of Christ and his apostles,
   and the community of goods in the first Christian church at Jerusalem.
   Many Christians, not of the ascetics only, but also of the clergy, like
   Cyprian, accordingly gave up all their property at their conversion,
   for the benefit of the poor. The later monastic societies sought to
   represent in their community of goods the original equality and the
   perfect brotherhood of men.

   Yet on the other hand, we meet with more moderate views. Clement of
   Alexandria, for example, in a special treatise on the right use of
   wealth, [720] 20 observes, that the Saviour forbade not so much the
   possession of earthly property, as the love of it and desire for it;
   and that it is possible to retain the latter, even though the
   possession itself be renounced. The earthly, says he, is a material and
   a means for doing good, and the unequal distribution of property is a
   divine provision for the exercise of Christian love and beneficence.
   The true riches are the virtue, which can and should maintain itself
   under all outward conditions; the false are the mere outward
   possession, which comes and goes.

   § 107. Voluntary Celibacy.

   The old catholic exaggeration of celibacy attached itself to four
   passages of Scripture, viz. Matt. 19:12; 22:30; 1 Cor. 7:7 sqq.; and
   Rev. 14:4; but it went far beyond them, and unconsciously admitted
   influences from foreign modes of thought. The words of the Lord in
   Matt. 22:30 (Luke 20:35 sq.) were most frequently cited; but they
   expressly limit unmarried life to the angels, without setting it up as
   the model for men. Rev. 14:4 was taken by some of the fathers more
   correctly in the symbolical sense of freedom from the pollution of
   idolatry. The example of Christ, though often urged, cannot here
   furnish a rule; for the Son of God and Saviour of the world was too far
   above all the daughters of Eve to find an equal companion among them,
   and in any case cannot be conceived as holding such relations. The
   whole church of the redeemed is his pure bride. Of the apostles some at
   least were married, and among them Peter, the oldest and most prominent
   of all. The advice of Paul in 1 Cor. 7 is so cautiously given, that
   even here the view of the fathers found but partial support; especially
   if balanced with the Pastoral Epistles, where marriage is presented as
   the proper condition for the clergy. Nevertheless he was frequently
   made the apologist of celibacy by orthodox and heretical writers. [721]
   21 Judaism--with the exception of the paganizing Essenes, who abstained
   from marriage--highly honors the family life; it allows marriage even
   to the priests and the high-priests, who had in fact to maintain their
   order by physical reproduction; it considers unfruitfulness a disgrace
   or a curse.

   Heathenism, on the contrary, just because of its own degradation of
   woman, and its low, sensual conception of marriage, frequently includes
   celibacy in its ideal of morality, and associates it with worship. The
   noblest form of heathen virginity appears in the six Vestal virgins of
   Rome, who, while girls of from six to ten years, were selected for the
   service of the pure goddess, and set to keep the holy fire burning on
   its altar; but, after serving thirty years, were allowed to return to
   secular life and marry. The penalty for breaking their vow of chastity
   was to be buried alive in the campus sceleratus.

   The ascetic depreciation of marriage is thus due, at least in part, to
   the influence of heathenism. But with this was associated the Christian
   enthusiasm for angelic purity in opposition to the horrible
   licentiousness of the Graeco-Roman world. It was long before
   Christianity raised woman and the family life to the purity and dignity
   which became them in the kingdom of God. In this view, we may the more
   easily account for many expressions of the church fathers respecting
   the female sex, and warnings against intercourse with women, which to
   us, in the present state of European and American civilization, sound
   perfectly coarse and unchristian. John of Damascus has collected in his
   Parallels such patristic expressions as these: "A woman is an evil." "A
   rich woman is a double evil." "A beautiful woman is a whited
   sepulchre." "Better is a man's wickedness than a woman's goodness." The
   men who could write so, must have forgotten the beautiful passages to
   the contrary in the proverbs of Solomon; yea, they must have forgotten
   their own mothers.

   On the other hand, it may be said, that the preference given to
   virginity had a tendency to elevate woman in the social sphere and to
   emancipate her from that slavish condition under heathenism, where she
   could be disposed of as an article of merchandise by parents or
   guardians, even in infancy or childhood. It should not be forgotten
   that many virgins of the early church devoted their whole energies as
   deaconesses to the care of the sick and the poor, or exhibited as
   martyrs a degree of passive virtue and moral heroism altogether unknown
   before. Such virgins Cyprian, in his rhetorical language, calls "the
   flowers of the church, the masterpieces of grace, the ornament of
   nature, the image of God reflecting the holiness of our Saviour, the
   most illustrious of the flock of Jesus Christ, who commenced on earth
   that life which we shall lead once in heaven."

   The excessive regard for celibacy and the accompanying depreciation of
   marriage date from about the middle of the second century, and reach
   their height in the Nicene age.

   Ignatius, in his epistle to Polycarp, expresses himself as yet very
   moderately: "If any one can remain in chastity of the flesh to the
   glory of the Lord of the flesh" [or, according to another reading, "of
   the flesh of the Lord], let him remain thus without boasting; [722] 22
   if he boast, he is lost, and if it be made known, beyond the bishop,
   [723] 23 he is ruined." What a stride from this to the obligatory
   celibacy of the clergy! Yet the admonition leads us to suppose, that
   celibacy was thus early, in the beginning of the second century, in
   many cases, boasted of as meritorious, and allowed to nourish spiritual
   pride. Ignatius is the first to call voluntary virgins brides of Christ
   and jewels of Christ.

   Justin Martyr goes further. He points to many Christians of both sexes
   who lived to a great age unpolluted; and he desires celibacy to prevail
   to the greatest possible extent. He refers to the example of Christ,
   and expresses the singular opinion, that the Lord was born of a virgin
   only to put a limit to sensual desire, and to show that God could
   produce without the sexual agency of man. His disciple Tatian ran even
   to the Gnostic extreme upon this point, and, in a lost work on
   Christian perfection, condemned conjugal cohabitation as a fellowship
   of corruption destructive of prayer. At the same period Athenagoras
   wrote, in his Apology: "Many may be found among us, of both sexes, who
   grow old unmarried, full of hope that they are in this way more closely
   united to God."

   Clement of Alexandria is the most reasonable of all the fathers in his
   views on this point. He considers eunuchism a special gift of divine
   grace, but without yielding it on this account preference above the
   married state. On the contrary, he vindicates with great decision the
   moral dignity and sanctity of marriage against the heretical
   extravagances of his time, and lays down the general principle, that
   Christianity stands not in outward observances, enjoyments, and
   privations, but in righteousness and peace of heart. Of the Gnostics he
   says, that, under the fair name of abstinence, they act impiously
   towards the creation and the holy Creator, and repudiate marriage and
   procreation on the ground that a man should not introduce others into
   the world to their misery, and provide new nourishment for death. He
   justly charges them with inconsistency in despising the ordinances of
   God and yet enjoying the nourishment created by the same hand,
   breathing his air, and abiding in his world. He rejects the appeal to
   the example of Christ, because Christ needed no help, and because the
   church is his bride. The apostles also he cites against the impugners
   of marriage. Peter and Philip begot children; Philip gave his daughters
   in marriage; and even Paul hesitated not to speak of a female companion
   (rather only of his right to lead about such an one, as well as Peter).
   We seem translated into an entirely different, Protestant atmosphere,
   when in this genial writer we read: The perfect Christian, who has the
   apostles for his patterns, proves himself truly a man in this, that he
   chooses not a solitary life, but marries, begets children, cares for
   the household, yet under all the temptations which his care for wife
   and children, domestics and property, presents, swerves not from his
   love to God, and as a Christian householder exhibits a miniature of the
   all-ruling Providence.

   But how little such views agreed with the spirit of that age, we see in
   Clement's own stoical and Platonizing conception of the sensual
   appetites, and still more in his great disciple Origen, who voluntarily
   disabled himself in his youth, and could not think of the act of
   generation as anything but polluting. Hieracas, or Hierax, of
   Leontopolis in Egypt, who lived during the Diocletian persecution, and
   probably also belonged to the Alexandrian school, is said to have
   carried his asceticism to a heretical extreme, and to have declared
   virginity a condition of salvation under the gospel dispensation.
   Epiphanius describes him as a man of extraordinary biblical and medical
   learning, who knew the Bible by heart, wrote commentaries in the Greek
   and Egyptian languages, but denied the resurrection of the material
   body and the salvation of children, because there can be no reward
   without conflict, and no conflict without knowledge (1 Tim. 2:11). He
   abstained from wine and animal food, and gathered around him a society
   of ascetics, who were called Hieracitae. [724] 24 Methodius was an
   opponent of the spiritualistic, but not of the ascetic Origen, and
   wrote an enthusiastic plea for virginity, founded on the idea of the
   church as the pure, unspotted, ever young, and ever beautiful bride of
   God. Yet, quite remarkably, in his "Feast of the Ten Virgins," the
   virgins express themselves respecting the sexual relations with a
   minuteness which, to our modern taste, is extremely indelicate and
   offensive.

   As to the Latin fathers: The views of Tertullian for or and against
   marriage, particularly against second marriage, we have already
   noticed. [725] 25 His disciple Cyprian differs from him in his ascetic
   principles only by greater moderation in expression, and, in his
   treatise De Habitu Virginum, commends the unmarried life on the ground
   of Matt. 19:12; 1 Cor. 7, and Rev. 14:4.

   Celibacy was most common with pious virgins, who married themselves
   only to God or to Christ, [726] 26 and in the spiritual delights of
   this heavenly union found abundant compensation for the pleasures of
   earthly matrimony. But cases were not rare where sensuality, thus
   violently suppressed, asserted itself under other forms; as, for
   example, in indolence and ease at the expense of the church, which
   Tertullian finds it necessary to censure; or in the vanity and love of
   dress, which Cyprian rebukes; and, worst of all, in a desperate venture
   of asceticism, which probably often enough resulted in failure, or at
   least filled the imagination with impure thoughts. Many of these
   heavenly brides [727] 27 lived with male ascetics, and especially with
   unmarried clergyman, under pretext of a purely spiritual fellowship, in
   so intimate intercourse as to put their continence to the most perilous
   test, and wantonly challenge temptation, from which we should rather
   pray to be kept. This unnatural and shameless practice was probably
   introduced by the Gnostics; Irenaeus at least charges it upon them. The
   first trace of it in the church appears early enough, though under a
   rather innocent allegorical form, in the Pastor Hermae, which
   originated in the Roman church. [728] 28 It is next mentioned in the
   Pseudo-Clementine Epistles Ad Virgines. In the third century it
   prevailed widely in the East and West. The worldly-minded bishop Paulus
   of Antioch favored it by his own example. Cyprian of Carthage came out
   earnestly, [729] 29 and with all reason, against the vicious practice,
   in spite of the solemn protestation of innocence by these "sisters,"
   and their appeal to investigations through midwives. Several councils
   at Elvira, Ancyra, Nicaea, &c., felt called upon to forbid this
   pseudo-ascetic scandal. Yet the intercourse of clergy with "mulieres
   subintroductae" rather increased than diminished with the increasing
   stringency of the celibate laws and has at all times more or less
   disgraced the Roman priesthood.

   As the clergy were supposed to embody the moral ideal of Christianity,
   and to be in the full sense of the term the heritage of God, they were
   required to practise especially rigid sexual temperance after receiving
   their ordination. The virginity of the church of Christ, who was
   himself born of a virgin, seemed, in the ascetic spirit of the age, to
   recommend a virgin priesthood as coming nearest his example, and best
   calculated to promote the spiritual interests of the church.

   There were antecedents in heathenism to sacerdotal celibacy. Buddhism
   rigorously enjoined it under a penalty, of expulsion. The Egyptian
   priests were allowed one, but forbidden a second, marriage, while the
   people practiced unrestrained polygamy. The priestesses of the Delphic
   Apollo, the Achaian Juno, the Scythian Diana, and the Roman Vesta were
   virgins.

   In the ante-Nicene period sacerdotal celibacy did not as yet become a
   matter of law, but was left optional, like the vow of chastity among
   the laity. In the Pastoral Epistles of Paul marriage, if not expressly
   enjoined, is at least allowed to all ministers of the gospel (bishops
   and deacons), and is presumed to exist as the rule. [730] 30 It is an
   undoubted fact that Peter and several apostles, as well as the Lord's
   brothers, were married, [731] 31 and that Philip the deacon and
   evangelist had four daughters. [732] 32 It is also self-evident that,
   if marriage did not detract from the authority and dignity of an
   apostle, it cannot be inconsistent with the dignity and purity of any
   minister of Christ. The marriage relation implies duties and
   privileges, and it is a strange perversion of truth if some writers
   under the influence of dogmatic prejudice have turned the apostolic
   marriages, and that between Joseph and Mary into empty forms. Paul
   would have expressed himself very differently if he had meant to deny
   to the clergy the conjugal intercourse after ordination, as was done by
   the fathers and councils in the fourth century. He expressly classes
   the prohibition of marriage (including its consequences) among the
   doctrines of demons or evil spirits that control the heathen religions,
   and among the signs of the apostacy of the latter days. [733] 33 The
   Bible represents marriage as the first institution of God dating from
   the state of man's innocency, and puts the highest dignity upon it in
   the Old and New Covenants. Any reflection on the honor and purity of
   the married state and the marriage bed reflects on the patriarchs,
   Moses, the prophets, and the apostles, yea, on the wisdom and goodness
   of the Creator. [734] 34

   There was all early departure from these Scripture views in the church
   under the irresistible influence of the ascetic enthusiasm for virgin
   purity. The undue elevation of virginity necessarily implied a
   corresponding depreciation of marriage.

   The scanty documents of the post-apostolic age give us only incidental
   glimpses into clerical households, yet sufficient to prove the unbroken
   continuance of clerical marriages, especially in the Eastern churches,
   and at the same time the superior estimate put upon an unmarried
   clergy, which gradually limited or lowered the former.

   Polycarp expresses his grief for Valens, a presbyter in Philippi, "and
   his wife," on account of his covetousness. [735] 35 Irenaeus mentions a
   married deacon in Asia Minor who was ill-rewarded for his hospitality
   to a Gnostic heretic, who seduced his wife. [736] 36 Rather unfortunate
   examples. Clement of Alexandria, one of the most enlightened among the
   ante-Nicene father, describes the true ideal of a Christian Gnostic as
   one who marries and has children, and so attains to a higher
   excellence, because he conquers more temptations than that of the
   single state. [737] 37 Tertullian, though preferring celibacy, was a
   married priest, and exhorted his wife to refrain after his death from a
   second marriage in order to attain to that ascetic purity which was
   impossible during their married life. [738] 38 He also draws a
   beautiful picture of the holy beauty of a Christian family. An African
   priest, Novatus--another unfortunate example--was arraigned for
   murdering his unborn child. [739] 39 There are also examples of married
   bishops. Socrates reports that not even bishops were bound in his age
   by any law of celibacy, and that many bishops during their episcopate
   begat children. [740] 40 Athanasius says: [741] 41 "Many bishops have
   not contracted matrimony; while, on the other hand, monks have become
   fathers. Again, we see bishops who have children, and monks who take no
   thought of having posterity." The father of Gregory of Nazianzum (d.
   390) was a married bishop. and his mother, Nonna, a woman of exemplary
   piety, prayed earnestly for male issue, saw her future son in a
   prophetic vision, and dedicated him, before his birth, to the service
   of God, and he became the leading theologian of his age. Gregory of
   Nyssa (d. about 394) was likewise a married bishop, though he gave the
   preference to celibacy. Synesius, the philosophic disciple of Hypasia
   of Alexandria, when pressed to accept the bishopic, of Ptolemais (a.d.
   410), declined at first, because he was unwilling to separate from his
   wife, and desired numerous offspring; but he finally accepted the
   office without a separation. This proves that his case was already
   exceptional. The sixth of the Apostolical Canons directs: "Let not a
   bishop, a priest, or a deacon cast off his own wife under pretence of
   piety; but if he does cast her off, let him be suspended. If he go on
   in it, let him be deprived." The Apostolical Constitutions nowhere
   prescribe clerical celibacy, but assume the single marriage of bishop,
   priest, and deacon as perfectly legitimate. [742] 42

   The inscriptions on the catacombs bear likewise testimony to clerical
   marriages down to the fifth century. [743] 43

   At the same time the tendency towards clerical celibacy set in very
   early, and made steady and irresistible progress, especially in the
   West. This is manifest in the qualifications of the facts and
   directions just mentioned. For they leave the impression that there
   were not many happy clerical marriages and model pastors' wives in the
   early centuries; nor could there be so long as the public opinion of
   the church, contrary to the Bible, elevated virginity above marriage.

   1. The first step in the direction of clerical celibacy was the
   prohibition of second marriage to the clergy, on the ground that Paul's
   direction concerning "the husband of one wife" is a restriction rather
   than a command. In the Western church, in the early part of the third
   century, there were many clergymen who had been married a second or
   even a third time, and this practice was defended on the ground that
   Paul allowed remarriage, after the death of one party, as lawful
   without any restriction or censure. This fact appears from the protest
   of the Montanistic Tertullian, who makes it a serious objection to the
   Catholics, that they allow bigamists to preside, to baptize, and to
   celebrate the communion. [744] 44 Hippolytus, who had equally
   rigoristic views on discipline, reproaches about the same time the
   Roman bishop Callistus with admitting to sacerdotal and episcopal
   office those who were married a second and even a third time, and
   permitting the clergy to marry after having been ordained. [745] 45 But
   the rigorous practice prevailed, and was legalized in the Eastern
   church. The Apostolical Constitutions expressly forbid bishops,
   priests, and deacons to marry a second time. They also forbid clergymen
   to marry a concubine, or a slave, or a widow, or a divorced woman, and
   extend the prohibition of second marriage even to cantors, readers, and
   porters. As to the deaconess, she must be "a pure virgin, or a widow
   who has been but once married, faithful and well esteemed." [746] 46
   The Apostolical Canons give similar regulations, and declare that the
   husband of a second wife, of a widow, a courtesan, an actress, or a
   slave was ineligible to the priesthood. [747] 47

   2. The second step was the prohibition of marriage and conjugal
   intercourse after ordination. This implies the incompatibility of the
   priesthood with the duties and privileges of marriage. Before the
   Council of Elvira in Spain (306) no distinction was made in the Latin
   church between marriages before and after ordination. [748] 48 But that
   rigoristic council forbade nuptial intercourse to priests of all ranks
   upon pain of excommunication. [749] 49 The Council of Arles (314)
   passed a similar canon. [750] 50 And so did the Council of Ancyra
   (314), which, however, allows deacons to marry as deacons, in case they
   stipulated for it before taking orders. [751] 51 This exception was
   subsequently removed by the 27th Apostolic Canon, which allows only the
   lectors and cantors (belonging to the minor orders) to contract
   marriage. [752] 52

   At the Oecumenical Council of Nicaea (325) an attempt was made,
   probably under the lead of Hosius, bishop of Cordova--the connecting
   link between Elvira and Nicaea--to elevate the Spanish rule to the
   dignity and authority of an oecumenical ordinance, that is, to make the
   prohibition of marriage after ordination and the strict abstinence of
   married priests from conjugal intercourse, the universal law of the
   Church; but the attempt was frustrated by the loud protest of
   Paphnutius, a venerable bishop and confessor of a city in the Upper
   Thebaid of Egypt, who had lost one eye in the Diocletian persecution,
   and who had himself never touched a woman. He warned the fathers of the
   council not to impose too heavy a burden on the clergy, and to remember
   that marriage and conjugal intercourse were venerable and pure. He
   feared more harm than good from excessive rigor. It was sufficient, if
   unmarried clergymen remain single according to the ancient tradition of
   the church; but it was wrong to separate the married priest from his
   legitimate wife, whom he married while yet a layman. This remonstrance
   of a strict ascetic induced the council to table the subject and to
   leave the continuance or discontinuance of the married relation to the
   free choice of every clergyman. It was a prophetic voice of warning.
   [753] 53

   The Council of Nicaea passed no law in favor of celibacy; but it
   strictly prohibited in its third canon the dangerous and scandalous
   practice of unmarried clergymen to live with an unmarried woman, [754]
   54 unless she be "a mother or sister or aunt or a person above
   suspicion." [755] 55 This prohibition must not be confounded with
   prohibition of nuptial intercourse any more than those spiritual
   concubines are to be identified with regular wives. It proves, however,
   that nominal clerical celibacy must have extensively prevailed at the
   time.

   The Greek Church substantially retained the position of the fourth
   century, and gradually adopted the principle and practice of limiting
   the law of celibacy to bishops (who are usually taken from
   monasteries), and making a single marriage the rule for the lower
   clergy; the marriage to take place before ordination, and not to be
   repeated. Justinian excluded married men from the episcopate, and the
   Trullan Synod (a.d. 692) legalized the existing practice. In Russia
   (probably since 1274), the single marriage of the lower clergy was made
   obligatory. This is an error in the opposite direction. Marriage, as
   well as celibacy, should be left free to each man's conscience.

   3. The Latin Church took the third and last step, the absolute
   prohibition of clerical marriage, including even the lower orders. This
   belongs to the next period; but we will here briefly anticipate the
   result. Sacerdotal marriage was first prohibited by Pope Siricius (a.d.
   385), then by Innocent I. (402), Leo I. (440), Gregory I. (590), and by
   provincial Synods of Carthage (390 and 401), Toledo (400), Orleans
   (538), Orange (441), Arles (443 or 452), Agde (506), Gerunda (517). The
   great teachers of the Nicene and post-Nicene age, Jerome, Augustin, and
   Chrysostom, by their extravagant laudations of the superior sanctity of
   virginity, gave this legislation the weight of their authority. St.
   Jerome, the author of the Latin standard version of the Bible, took the
   lead in this ascetic crusade against marriage, and held up to the
   clergy as the ideal aim of the saint, to "cut down the wood of marriage
   by the axe of virginity." He was willing to praise marriage, but only
   as the nursery of virgins. [756] 56

   Thus celibacy was gradually enforced in the West under the combined
   influence of the sacerdotal and hierarchical interests to the advantage
   of the hierarchy, but to the injury of morality. [757] 57

   For while voluntary abstinence, or such as springs from a special gift
   of grace, is honorable and may be a great blessing to the church, the
   forced celibacy of the clergy, or celibacy as a universal condition of
   entering the priesthood, does violence to nature and Scripture, and,
   all sacramental ideas of marriage to the contrary notwithstanding,
   degrades this divine ordinance, which descends from the primeval state
   of innocence, and symbolizes the holiest of all relations, the union of
   Christ with his church. But what is in conflict with nature and
   nature's God is also in conflict with the highest interests of
   morality. Much, therefore, as Catholicism has done to raise woman and
   the family life from heathen degradation, we still find, in general,
   that in Evangelical Protestant countries, woman occupies a far higher
   grade of intellectual and moral culture than in exclusively Roman
   Catholic countries. Clerical marriages are probably the most happy as a
   rule, and have given birth to a larger number of useful and
   distinguished men and women than those of any other class of society.
   [758] 58
     __________________________________________________________________

   [730] The passages 1 Tim. 3:2, 12; Tit. 1:5, where St. Paul directs
   that presbyter-bishops and deacons must be husbands of "one wife" (mias
   gunaikos andris), are differently interpreted. The Greek church takes
   the words both as commanding (dei) one marriage of the clergy (to the
   exclusion, however, of bishops who must be unmarried), and as
   prohibiting a second marriage. The Roman circle understands Paul as
   conceding one marriage to the weakness of the flesh, but as intimating
   the better way of total abstinence (Comp. 1 Cor. 7:7, 32, 33).
   Protestant commentators are likewise divided; some refer the two
   passages to simultaneous, others to successive polygamy. The former
   view was held even by some Greek writers, Theodore of Mopstueste and
   Theodoret; but the parallel expression henos andros gune, 1 Tim. 5:9,
   seems to favor the latter view, since it is very unlikely that
   polyandry existed in apostolic churches. And yet Paul expressly allows
   without a censure second marriage after the death of the former husband
   or wife, Rom. 7:2, 3; 1 Cor. 7:39; 1 Tim. 5:14. For this reason some
   commentators Matthies, Hofmann, Huther in Meyer's Com. understand the
   apostle as prohibiting concubinage or all illegitimate connubial
   intercourse.

   [731] 1 Cor. 9:5: "Have we no right (hexousian)to lead about a wife
   that is a believer (adelphen gunaika ), even as the rest of the
   apostles (hoi loipoi ap.) and the brothers of the Lord (hoi adelphoi t.
   Kuriou), and Cephas.?" The definite article seems to indicate that the
   majority, if not all, the apostles and brothers of the Lord were
   married. The only certain exception is John, and probably also Paul,
   though he may have been a widower. Tertullian in his blind zeal argued
   that gunaika is to be rendered mulierem, not uxorem (De Monog. c. 8),
   but his contemporary, Clement of Alex., does not question the true
   interpretation, speaks of Peter, Paul, and Philip, as married, and of
   Philip as giving his daughters in marriage. Tradition ascribes to Peter
   a daughter , St. Petronilla.

   miscarriage, but he does not censure, him for his marriage.

   [740] Hist. Eccl. V. 22: "in the East all clergymen, and even the
   bishops themselves to abstain from their wives: but this they do of
   their own accord, there being no law in force to make it necessary; for
   there have been among them many bishops who have had children by their
   lawful wives during their episcopate."

   [741] In a letter to the Egyptian in monk Dracontius, who had scruples
   about accepting a call to the episcopate.

   [742] This is substantially also the position of Eusebius, Epiphanius,
   and Chrysostom, as far as we may infer from allusions, and their
   expositions of 1 Tim. 3:2, although all preferred celibacy as a higher
   state. See Funk, l.c. p. 305. The Synod of Gangra, after the middle of
   the fourth century, anathematized (Can. 4) those who maintained that it
   was wrong to attend the eucharistic services of priests living in
   marriage. See Hefele I. 782, who remarks against Baronius, that the
   canon means such priests as not only, had wives, but lived with them in
   conjugal intercourse (mit denselben ehelich leben). TheCodex Ecclesiae
   Rom ed. by Quesnel omits this canon.

   [743] Lundy (Monumental Christianity, N. Y. 1876, p. 343 sqq.) quotes
   the following inscriptions of this kind from Gruter, Bosio, Arringhi,
   Burgon, and other sources: "The place of the Presbyter Basil and his
   Felicitas. They made it for themselves."
   "Susanna, once the happy daughter of the Presbyter Gabinus, Here lies
   in peace joined with her father."
   "Gaudentius, the Presbyter, for himself and his wife Severa, a virtuous
   woman, who lived 42 years, 3 months, 10 days. Buried on the 4th after
   the nones of April, Timasius and Promus; being consuls."
   "Petronia, the wife of a Levite, type of modesty. In this place I lay
   my bones; spare your tears, dear husband and daughters, and believe
   that it is forbidden to weep for one who lives in God. Buried in peace,
   on the third before the nones of October." The names of three children
   appear on the, same tablet, and are no doubt those referred to by
   Petronis; hers, with the consular dates of their burial. Her own
   interment was a.d. 472. Gruter and Le Blant both publish a very long
   and elaborate inscription at Narbonne, a.d. 427, to the effect that
   Rusticus the Bishop, son of Bonosius a Bishop, nephew of Aratoris
   another Bishop, etc., in connection with the presbyter Ursus and the
   deacon Hermetus began to build the church; and that Montanus the
   sub-deacon finished the apse, etc.

   [744] He asks the Catholics with indignation: "Quot enim et digami
   praesident apud vos, insultantes utique apostolo, certe non
   erubescentes, cum haec sub illis leguntur? .... Digamus tinguis?
   digamus offers?"De Monog. c. 12.

   [746] Const. Ap. VI. 17.

   [747] Can. 17, 18, 19, 27. The Jewish high-priests were likewise
   required to marry a virgin of their own people. Lev. 21:16.

   [748] Admitted by Prof. Funk (R. Cath.), who quotes Innocent, Ep. ad
   Episc. Maced. c. 2; Leo I. Ep. XII.c. 5. He also admits that Paul's
   direction excludes such a distinction. See Kraus, Real-Enc. I. 304 sq.

   [749] Can. 33 Placuit in totum prohibere episcopis, presbyteris, et
   diaconibus, vel omnibus clericis positis in ministerio, abstinere se a
   conjugibus suis, et non generare filios; quicunque vero fecerit, ab
   honore clericatus exterminetur." Hefele says (I. 168): " This
   celebrated canon contains the first law of celibacy. "It is strange
   that the canon in its awkward latinity seems to prohibit the clergy to
   abstain from their wives, when in fact it means to prohibit the
   intercourse. On account of the words positis in ministerio, some would
   see here only a prohibition of sexual commerce at the time of the
   performance of clerical functions, as in the Jewish law; but this was
   self-understood, and would not come up to the disciplinary standard of
   that age. How little, however, even in Spain, that first law on
   celibacy was obeyed, may be inferred from the letter of Pope Siricius
   to Bishop Himerius of Tarragona, that there were, at the close of the
   fourth century, plurimi sacerdotes Christi et levitu living in wedlock.

   [750] Can. 6 (29, see Hefele I. 217) Praeterea, quod dignum, pudicum et
   honestum est, suademus fratribus, ut sacerdotes et levitae cum uxoribus
   satis non cogant, quia ministerio quotidiano occupantur. Quicunque
   contra hanc constitutionem fecerit, a cleritatus honore deponatur."

   [751] Can. 10 (Hefele, Conciliengesch. I. p. 230, 2te Aufl). The canon
   is adopted in the Corpus juris can. c. 8. Dist. 28. The Synod of
   Neo-Caesarea, between 314-325, can. 1, forbids the priests to marry on
   pain of deposition. This does not conflict with the other canon, and
   likewise passed into the Canon Law, c. 9, Dist. 28. See Hefele, I. 244.

   [752] "Of those who come into the clergy unmarried, we permit only the
   readers and singers if they are so minded, to marry afterward."

   [753] This important incident of Paphnutius rests on the unanimous
   testimony of the well informed historians Socrates (Hist. Eccl. I. 11),
   Sozoinen (H. E. I. 23), and Gelasius Cyzic. (Hist. Conc. Nic. II. 32);
   see Mansi, Harduin, and Hefele (I. 431-435). It agrees moreover with
   the directions of the Apost. Const. and Canons, and with the present
   practice of the Eastern churches on this subject. The objections of
   Baronius, Bellarmine, Valesius. and other Romanists are unfounded and
   refuted by Natalis Alexander, and Hefele (l.c.). Funk (R.C.)says: "Die
   Einwendungen, die qeqen den Bericht, vorgebracht wurden, sind völlig
   nichtig" (utterly futile).

   [754] Euphoniously called suneisaktos, subiatroducta (introduced as a
   companion), agapete, soror. See Hefele, T. 380. Comp. on this canon W.
   Bright, Notes on the Canons of the First Four General Councils. Oxford,
   1882, pp. 8, 9. A Council of Antioch had deposed Paul of Samosata,
   bishop of Antioch, for this nasty practice, and for heresy. Euseb. H.
   E. VII. 30.

   [755] Notwithstanding this canonical prohibition the disreputable
   practice continued. Chrysostom wrote a discourse "against persons
   echontas parthenous suneisaktous"and another urging the dedicated
   virgins not to live with them. Jerome complains of the "pestis
   agapetarum"(Ep. XXII. 14).

   [756] Ep. XXII. "Laudo nuptias, laudo conjugium, sed quia mihi virgines
   generant." Comp. Ep. CXXIII.

   [757] And the Roman Church seems to care more for the power, than for
   the purity of the clergy. Gregory VII., who used all his unflinching
   energy to enforce celibacy, said openly: "Non liberari potest ecclesia
   a servitude laicorum, nisi liberentur clerici ab uxoribus." As clerical
   celibacy is a matter of discipline, not of doctrine, the Pope might at
   any time abolish it, and Aeneas Sylvius, before he ascended the chair
   of Peter as Pius II. (1458 to 1464), remarked that marriage had been
   denied to priests for good and sufficient reasons, but that still
   stronger ones now required its restoration. The United Greeks and
   Maronites are allowed to retain their wives. Joseph II. proposed to
   extend the permission. During the French Revolution, and before the
   conclusion of the Concordat (1801), many priests and nuns were married.
   But the hierarchical interest always defeated in the end such
   movements, and preferred to keep the clergy aloof from the laity in
   order to exercise a greater power over it. "The Latin church," says Lea
   in his History of Celibacy, "is the most wonderful structure in
   history, and ere its leaders can consent to such a reform they must
   confess that its career, so full of proud recollections, has been an
   error."

   § 110. External History of Montanism.

   All the ascetic, rigoristic, and chiliastic elements of the ancient
   church combined in Montanism. They there asserted a claim to universal
   validity, which the catholic church was compelled, for her own
   interest, to reject; since she left the effort after extraordinary
   holiness to the comparatively small circle of ascetics and priests, and
   sought rather to lighten Christianity than add to its weight, for the
   great mass of its professors. Here is the place, therefore, to speak of
   this remarkable phenomenon, and not under the head of doctrine, or
   heresy, where it is commonly placed. For Montanism was not, originally,
   a departure from the faith, but a morbid overstraining of the practical
   morality and discipline of the early church. It was an excessive
   supernaturalism and puritanism against Gnostic rationalism and Catholic
   laxity. It is the first example of an earnest and well-meaning, but
   gloomy and fanatical hyper-Christianity, which, like all
   hyper-spiritualism, is apt to end in the flesh.

   Montanism originated in Asia Minor, the theatre of many movements of
   the church in this period; yet not in Ephesus or any large city, but in
   some insignificant villages of the province of Phrygia, once the home
   of a sensuously mystic and dreamy nature-religion, where Paul and his
   pupils had planted congregations at Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis.
   [759] 59 The movement was started about the middle of the second
   century during the reign of Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius, by a
   certain Montanus. [760] 60 He was, according to hostile accounts,
   before his conversion, a mutilated priest of Cybele, with no special
   talents nor culture, but burning with fanatical zeal. He fell into
   somnambulistic ecstasies, and considered himself the inspired organ of
   the promised Paraclete or Advocate, the Helper and Comforter in these
   last times of distress. His adversaries wrongly inferred from the use
   of the first person for the Holy Spirit in his oracles, that he made
   himself directly the Paraclete, or, according to Epiphanius, even God
   the Father. Connected with him were two prophetesses, Priscilla and
   Maximilla, who left their husbands. During the bloody persecutions
   under the Antonines, which raged in Asia Minor, and caused the death of
   Polycarp (155), all three went forth as prophets and reformers of the
   Christian life, and proclaimed the near approach of the age of the Holy
   Spirit and of the millennial reign in Pepuza, a small village of
   Phrygia, upon which the new Jerusalem was to come down. Scenes took
   place similar to those under the preaching of the first Quakers, and
   the glossolalia and prophesying in the Irvingite congregations. The
   frantic movement soon far exceeded the intention of its authors, spread
   to Rome and North Africa, and threw the whole church into commotion. It
   gave rise to the first Synods which are mentioned after the apostolic
   age.

   The followers of Montanus were called Montanists, also Phrygians,
   Cataphrygians (from the province of their origin), Pepuziani,
   Priscillianists (from Priscilla, not to be confounded with the
   Priscillianists of the fourth century). They called themselves
   spiritual Christians (peumatikoi), in distinction from the psychic or
   carnal Christians (psuchikoi).

   The bishops and synods of Asia Minor, though not with one voice,
   declared the new prophecy the work of demons, applied exorcism, and cut
   off the Montanists from the fellowship of the church. All agreed that
   it was supernatural (a natural interpretation of such psychological
   phenomena being then unknown), and the only alternative was to ascribe
   it either to God or to his great Adversary. Prejudice and malice
   invented against Montanus and the two female prophets slanderous
   charges of immorality, madness and suicide, which were readily
   believed. Epiphanius and John of Damascus tell the absurd story, that
   the sacrifice of an infant was a part of the mystic worship of the
   Montanists, and that they made bread with the blood of murdered
   infants. [761] 61

   Among their literary opponents in the East are mentioned Claudius
   Apolinarius of Hierapolis, Miltiades, Appollonius, Serapion of Antioch,
   and Clement of Alexandria.

   The Roman church, during the episcopate of Eleutherus (177-190), or of
   Victor (190-202), after some vacillation, set itself likewise against
   the new prophets at the instigation of the presbyter Caius and the
   confessor Praxeas from Asia, who, as Tertullian sarcastically says, did
   a two-fold service to the devil at Rome by driving away prophecy and
   bringing in heresy (patripassianism), or by putting to flight the Holy
   Spirit and crucifying God the Father. Yet the opposition of Hippolytus
   to Zephyrinus and Callistus, as well as the later Novatian schism, show
   that the disciplinary rigorism of Montanism found energetic advocates
   in Rome till after the middle of the third century.

   The Gallic Christians, then severely tried by persecution, took a
   conciliatory posture, and sympathized at least with the moral
   earnestness, the enthusiasm for martyrdom, and the chiliastic hopes of
   the Montanists. They sent their presbyter (afterwards bishop) Irenaeus
   to Eleutherus in Rome to intercede in their behalf. This mission seems
   to have induced him or his successor to issue letters of peace, but
   they were soon afterwards recalled. This sealed the fate of the party.
   [762] 62

   In North Africa the Montanists met with extensive sympathy, as the
   Punic national character leaned naturally towards gloomy and rigorous
   acerbity. [763] 63 Two of the most distinguished female martyrs,
   Perpetua and Felicitas, were addicted to them, and died a heroic death
   at Carthage in the persecution of Septimius Severus (203).

   Their greatest conquest was the gifted and fiery, but eccentric and
   rigoristic Tertullian. He became in the year 201 or 202, from ascetic
   sympathies, a most energetic and influential advocate of Montanism, and
   helped its dark feeling towards a twilight of philosophy, without,
   however, formally seceding from the Catholic Church, whose doctrines he
   continued to defend against the heretics. At all events, he was not
   excommunicated, and his orthodox writings were always highly esteemed.
   He is the only theologian of this schismatic movement, which started in
   purely practical questions, and we derive the best of our knowledge of
   it from his works. Through him, too, its principles reacted in many
   respects on the Catholic Church; and that not only in North Africa, but
   also in Spain, as we may see from the harsh decrees of the Council of
   Elvira in 306. It is singular that Cyprian, who, with all his
   high-church tendencies and abhorrence of schism, was a daily reader of
   Tertullian, makes no allusion to Montanism. Augustin relates that
   Tertullian left the Montanists, and founded a new sect, which was
   called after him, but was, through his (Augustin's) agency, reconciled
   to the Catholic congregation of Carthage. [764] 64

   As a separate sect, the Montanists or Tertullianists, as they were also
   called in Africa, run down into the sixth century. At the time of
   Epiphanius the sect had many adherents in Phrygia, Galatia, Cappadocia,
   Cilicia, and in Constantinople. The successors of Constantine, down to
   Justinian (530), repeatedly enacted laws against them. Synodical
   legislation about the validity of Montanist baptism is inconsistent.
   [765] 65
     __________________________________________________________________

   [759] Neander first pointed to the close connection of Montanism with
   the Phrygian nationality, and it is true as far as it goes, but does
   not explain the spread of the system in North Africa. Schwegler and
   Baur protested against Neander's view, but Renan justly reasserts it:
   "La Phrygie était un des pays de l'antiquité les plus portés aux
   rêveries religieuses. Les Phrygiens passaient, en général pour niais et
   simple. Le christianisme eut chez eux, dès l'origine un charactère
   essentiellement mystique et ascétique. Déjà, dans l'épitre aux
   Colossiens,, Paul combat des erreurs où les signes précitrseurs du,
   gnosticisme et les excès d'un asétisme mal entendu semblent se mêler.
   Presque partout ailleurs, le christianisme fut une religion de grander
   villes; ici, comme dans la Syrie au delà du Jourdain, ce fut une
   religion de ourgades et de campagnards."

   [760] The chronology is uncertain, and varies between 126-180. See the
   note of Renan in Marc-Aur. p. 209, Hefele (I. 85), Soyres (p. 25-29 and
   157), and Bonwetsch (140-145). Eusebius assigns the rise of Montanism
   to the year 172, which is certainly too late; Epiphanius is confused,
   but leans to 157. Soyres dates it back as far as 130, Hefele to 140,
   Neander, Bonwetsch, and Möller (in Herzog, new ed. X. 255) to 156,
   Renan to 167. The recent change of the date of Polycarp's martyrdom
   from 167 to 155, establishes the fact of persecutions in Asia Minor
   under Antoninus Pius. Hefele thinks that the Pastor Hermae, which was
   written before 151 under Pius I., already combats Montanist opinions.
   Bonwetsch puts the death of Montanus and Maximilla between 180 and 200.
   The name Montanus occurs on Phrygian inscriptions.

   [761] Renan says of these slanders (p. 214): "Ce sont là les calomnies
   ordinaires, qui ne manquent jamais sous la plume des écrivains
   orthodoxes, quand il s'agit de noircir les dissidents."

   [762] Tertullian, who mentions these "littteras pacis jam emissas " in
   favor of the Montanists in Asia (Adv. Prax. 1) leaves us in the dark as
   to the name of the "episcopus Romanus" from whom they proceeded and of
   the other by whom they were recalled, and as to the cause of this
   temporary favor. Victor condemned the Quartodecimanians with whom the
   Montanists were affiliated. Irenaeus protested against it. See
   Bonwetsch, p. 173 sq.

   [763] This disposition, an hethos pikron, skuthroton, and skleron, even
   Plutarch notices in the Carthaginians (in his Politika parangelmata, c.
   3), and contrasts with the excitable and cheerful character of the
   Athenians.

   [764] De Haeresibus, § 6.

   [765] See Hefele, Conciliengesch., I. 754. He explains the
   inconsistency by the fact that the Montanists were regarded by, some
   orthodox, by others heretical, in the doctrine of the Trinity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 111. Character and Tenets of Montanism.

   I. In doctrine, Montanism agreed in all essential points with the
   Catholic Church, and held very firmly to the traditional rule of faith.
   [766] 66 Tertullian was thoroughly orthodox according to the standard
   of his age. He opposed infant baptism on the assumption that mortal
   sins could not be forgiven after baptism; but infant baptism was not
   yet a catholic dogma, and was left to the discretion of parents. He
   contributed to the development of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity,
   by asserting against Patripassianism a personal distinction in God, and
   the import of the Holy Spirit. Montanism was rooted neither, like
   Ebionism, in Judaism, nor, like Gnosticism, in heathenism, but in
   Christianity; and its errors consist in a morbid exaggeration of
   Christian ideas and demands. Tertullian says, that the administration
   of the Paraclete consists only in the reform of discipline, in deeper
   understanding of the Scriptures, and in effort after higher perfection;
   that it has the same faith, the same God, the same Christ, and the same
   sacraments with the Catholics. The sect combated the Gnostic heresy
   with all decision, and forms the exact counterpart of that system,
   placing Christianity chiefly in practical life instead of theoretical
   speculation, and looking for the consummation of the kingdom of God on
   this earth, though not till the millennium, instead of transferring it
   into an abstract ideal world. Yet between these two systems, as always
   between opposite extremes, there were also points of contact; a common
   antagonism, for example, to the present order of the world, and the
   distinction of a pneumatic and a psychical church.

   Tertullian conceived religion as a process of development, which he
   illustrates by the analogy of organic growth in nature. He
   distinguishes in this process four stages:--(1.) Natural religion, or
   the innate idea of God; (2.) The legal religion of the Old Testament;
   (3.) The gospel during the earthly life of Christ; and (4.) the
   revelation of the Paraclete; that is, the spiritual religion of the
   Montanists, who accordingly called themselves the pneumatics, or the
   spiritual church, in distinction from the psychical (or carnal)
   Catholic church. This is the first instance of a theory of development
   which assumes an advance beyond the New Testament and the Christianity
   of the apostles; misapplying the parables of the mustard seed and the
   leaven, and Paul's doctrine of the growth of the church in Christ (but
   not beyond Christ). Tertullian, however, was by no means rationalistic
   in his view. On the contrary, he demanded for all new revelations the
   closest agreement with the traditional faith of the church, the regula
   fidei, which, in a genuine Montanistic work, he terms "immobilis et
   irreformabilis." Nevertheless he gave the revelations of the Phrygian
   prophets on matters of practice an importance which interfered with the
   sufficiency of the Scriptures.

   II. In the field of practical life and discipline, the Montanistic
   movement and its expectation of the near approach of the end of the
   world came into conflict with the reigning Catholicism; and this
   conflict, consistently carried out, must of course show itself to some
   extent in the province of doctrine. Every schismatic tendency is apt to
   become in its progress more or less heretical.

   1. Montanism, in the first place, sought a forced continuance of the
   miraculous gifts of the apostolic church, which gradually disappeared
   as Christianity became settled in humanity, and its supernatural
   principle was naturalized on earth. [767] 67 It asserted, above all,
   the continuance of prophecy, and hence it went generally under the name
   of the nova prophetia. It appealed to Scriptural examples, John,
   Agabus, Judas, and Silas, and for their female prophets, to Miriam and
   Deborah, and especially to the four daughters of Philip, who were
   buried in Hierapolis, the capital of Phrygia. Ecstatic oracular
   utterances were mistaken for divine inspirations. Tertullian calls the
   mental status of those prophets an "amentia," an "excidere sensu," and
   describes it in a way which irresistibly reminds one of the phenomena
   of magnetic clairvoyance. Montanus compares a man in the ecstasy with a
   musical instrument, on which the Holy Spirit plays his melodies.
   "Behold," says he in one of his oracles, in the name of the Paraclete,
   "the man is as a lyre, and I sweep over him as a plectrum. The man
   sleeps; I wake. Behold, it is the Lord who puts the hearts of men out
   of themselves, and who gives hearts to men." [768] 68 As to its matter,
   the Montanistic prophecy related to the approaching heavy judgments of
   God, the persecutions, the millennium, fasting, and other ascetic
   exercises, which were to be enforced as laws of the church.

   The Catholic church did not deny, in theory, the continuance of
   prophecy and the other miraculous gifts, but was disposed to derive the
   Montanistic revelations from satanic inspirations, [769] 69 and
   mistrusted them all the more for their proceeding not from the regular
   clergy, but in great part from unauthorized laymen and fanatical women.

   2. This brings us to another feature of the Montanistic movement, the
   assertion of the universal priesthood of Christians, even of females,
   against the special priesthood in the Catholic church. Under this view
   it may be called a democratic reaction against the clerical
   aristocracy, which from the time of Ignatius had more and more
   monopolized all ministerial privileges and functions. The Montanists
   found the true qualification and appointment for the office of teacher
   in direct endowment by the Spirit of God, in distinction from outward
   ordination and episcopal succession. They everywhere proposed the
   supernatural element and the free motion of the Spirit against the
   mechanism of a fixed ecclesiastical order.

   Here was the point where they necessarily assumed a schismatic
   character, and arrayed against themselves the episcopal hierarchy. But
   they only brought another kind of aristocracy into the place of the
   condemned distinction of clergy and laity. They claimed for their
   prophets what they denied to the Catholic bishops. They put a great
   gulf between the true spiritual Christians and the merely psychical;
   and this induced spiritual pride and false pietism. Their affinity with
   the Protestant idea of the universal priesthood is more apparent than
   real; they go on altogether different principles.

   3. Another of the essential and prominent traits of Montanism was a
   visionary millennarianism, founded indeed on the Apocalypse and on the
   apostolic expectation of the speedy return of Christ, but giving it
   extravagant weight and a materialistic coloring. The Montanists were
   the warmest millennarians in the ancient church, and held fast to the
   speedy return of Christ in glory, all the more as this hope began to
   give way to the feeling of a long settlement of the church on earth,
   and to a corresponding zeal for a compact, solid episcopal
   organization. In praying, "Thy kingdom come," they prayed for the end
   of the world. They lived under a vivid impression of the great final
   catastrophe, and looked therefore with contempt upon the present order
   of things, and directed all their desires to the second advent of
   Christ. Maximilla says: "After me there is no more prophecy, but only
   the end of the world." [770] 70

   The failure of these predictions weakened, of course, all the other
   pretensions of the system. But, on the other hand, the abatement of
   faith in the near approach of the Lord was certainly accompanied with
   an increase of worldliness in the Catholic church. The millennarianism
   of the Montanists has reappeared again and again in widely differing
   forms.

   4. Finally, the Montanistic sect was characterized by fanatical
   severity in asceticism and church discipline. It raised a zealous
   protest against the growing looseness of the Catholic penitential
   discipline, which in Rome particularly, under Zephyrinus and Callistus,
   to the great grief of earnest minds, established a scheme of indulgence
   for the grossest sins, and began, long before Constantine, to obscure
   the line between the church and the world. Tertullian makes the
   restoration of a rigorous discipline the chief office of the new
   prophecy. [771] 71

   But Montanism certainly went to the opposite extreme, and fell from
   evangelical freedom into Jewish legalism; while the Catholic church in
   rejecting the new laws and burdens defended the cause of freedom.
   Montanism turned with horror from all the enjoyments of life, and held
   even art to be incompatible with Christian soberness and humility. It
   forbade women all ornamental clothing, and required virgins to be
   veiled. It courted the blood-baptism of martyrdom, and condemned
   concealment or flight in persecution as a denial of Christ. It
   multiplied fasts and other ascetic exercises, and carried them to
   extreme severity, as the best preparation for the millennium. It
   prohibited second marriage as adultery, for laity as well as clergy,
   and inclined even to regard a single marriage as a mere concession on
   the part of God to the sensuous infirmity of man. It taught the
   impossibility of a second repentance, and refused to restore the lapsed
   to the fellowship of the church. Tertullian held all mortal sins (of
   which he numbers seven), committed after baptism, to be unpardonable,
   [772] 72 at least in this world, and a church, which showed such lenity
   towards gross offenders, as the Roman church at that time did,
   according to the corroborating testimony of Hippolytus, he called worse
   than a den of thieves," even a "spelunca maechorum et fornicatorum."
   [773] 73

   The Catholic church, indeed, as we have already seen, opened the door
   likewise to excessive ascetic rigor, but only as an exception to her
   rule; while the Montanists pressed their rigoristic demands as binding
   upon all. Such universal asceticism was simply impracticable in a world
   like the present, and the sect itself necessarily dwindled away. But
   the religious earnestness which animated it, its prophecies and
   visions, its millennarianism, and the fanatical extremes into which it
   ran, have since reappeared, under various names and forms, and in new
   combinations, in Novatianism, Donatism, the spiritualism of the
   Franciscans, Anabaptism, the Camisard enthusiasm, Puritanism,
   Quakerism, Quietism, Pietism, Second Adventism, Irvingism, and so on,
   by way of protest and wholesome reaction against various evils in the
   church. [774] 74
     __________________________________________________________________

   [766] This was acknowledged by its opponents. Epipbanius, Haer. XLVIII.
   1, says, the Cataphrygians receive the entire Scripture of the Old and
   New Testament, and agree with the Catholic church in their views on the
   Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

   [767] In this point, as in others, Montanism bears a striking affinity
   to Irvingism, but differs from it by its democratic, anti-hierarchical
   constitution. Irvingism asserts not only the continuance of the
   apostolic gifts, but also of all the apostolic offices, especially the
   twelvefold apostolate, and is highly ritualistic.

   [768] Epiph. Haer. xlviii. 4: idou, ho anthropos hosei lura, kago
   ephiptamai hosei plektron, ho anthropos koimatai, kago gregoro, idou,
   kurios estin ho existanon kardias anthropon kai didous kardian
   anthropois .

   [769] Tert. De Jun. 11:"Spiritus diaboli est, dicis, o psychice."
   Tertullian himself, however, always occupied an honorable rank among
   the church written, though not numbered among the church fathers in the
   technical sense

   [770] Bonwetsch, p. 149: "Das Wesen des Montanismus ist eine Reaktion
   angesichts der nahen Parusie gegen Verweltlichung der Kirche." Baur,
   too, emphasizes this point and puts the chief difference between
   Montanism and Gnosticism in this that the latter looked at the
   beginning, the former at the end of all things."Wie die Gnosis
   denAnfangspunkt ins Auge fasst, von welchem alles ausgeht, die
   absoluten Principien, durch welche der Selbstoffenbarungsprocess Gottes
   und der Gang der Weltentwicklung bedingt ist, so ist im Montanismus der
   Hauptpunkt um welchen sich alles bewegt, das Ende der Dinge, die
   Katastrophe, welcher der Weltertlauf entgegengeht." (K. Gesch. I. 235).

   [771] De Monog. c. 2, he calls the Paraclete "novae disciplinae
   institutor, " but in c. 4 he says, correcting himself: "Paraclete
   restitutor potius quam instilator disiplinae."

   [772] Comp. De Pud. c. 2. and 19.

   [773] De Pudic. c 1: "Audio etiam edictum esse propositum, et quidem
   peremptorium. Pontifex scilicet maximus, quod est episcopus episcoporum
   (so he calls, ironically, the Roman bishop; in all probability he
   refers to Zephyrinus or Callistus), edicit: Ego et moechiae et
   fornicationis delicta poenitentia functis dimitto ... Absit, absit a
   sponsa Christi tale praeconium! IIla, quae vera est. quae pudica, quae
   sancta, carebit etiam aurium macula. Non habet quibus hoc repromittit,
   et si habuerit, non repromittat, quoniam et terrenum Dei templum citius
   spelunca latronum (Matt. 21:13) appellari potuit a Domino quam
   moechorum et fornicatorum.

   [774] Comp. on these analogous phenomena Soyres, p. 118 sqq. and 142
   sqq. He also mentions Mormonism as an analogous movement, and so does
   Renan (Marc-Aurèle, p. 209), but this is unjust to Montanism, which in
   its severe ascetic morality differs widely from the polygamous
   pseudo-theocracy in Utah. Montanism much more nearly resembles
   Irvingism, whose leaders are eminently pure and devout men (as Irving,
   Thierscb, W. W. Andrews).

CHAPTER XI:

   THE HERESIES OF THE ANTE-NICENE AGE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 112. Judaism and Heathenism within the Church.

   Having described in previous chapters the moral and intellectual
   victory of the church over avowed and consistent Judaism and
   heathenism, we must now look at her deep and mighty struggle with those
   enemies in a hidden and more dangerous form: with Judaism and
   heathenism concealed in the garb of Christianity and threatening to
   Judaize and paganize the church. The patristic theology and literature
   can never be thoroughly understood without a knowledge of the heresies
   of the patristic age, which play as important a part in the theological
   movements of the ancient Greek and Latin churches as Rationalism with
   its various types in the modern theology of the Protestant churches of
   Europe and America.

   Judaism, with its religion and its sacred writings, and Graeco-Roman
   heathenism, with its secular culture, its science, and its art, were
   designed to pass into Christianity to be transformed and sanctified.
   But even in the apostolic age many Jews and Gentiles were baptized only
   with water, not with the Holy Spirit and fire of the gospel, and
   smuggled their old religious notions and practices into the church.
   Hence the heretical tendencies, which are combated in the New
   Testament, especially in the Pauline and Catholic Epistles. [775] 75

   The same heresies meet us at the beginning of the second century, and
   thenceforth in more mature form and in greater extent in almost all
   parts of Christendom. They evince, on the one hand, the universal
   import of the Christian religion in history, and its irresistible power
   over all the more profound and earnest minds of the age. Christianity
   threw all their religious ideas into confusion and agitation. They were
   so struck with the truth, beauty, and vigor of the new religion, that
   they could no longer rest either in Judaism or in heathenism; and yet
   many were unable or unwilling to forsake inwardly their old religion
   and philosophy. Hence strange medleys of Christian and unchristian
   elements in chaotic ferment. The old religions did not die without a
   last desperate effort to save themselves by appropriating Christian
   ideas. And this, on the other hand, exposed the specific truth of
   Christianity to the greatest danger, and obliged the church to defend
   herself against misrepresentation, and to secure herself against
   relapse to the Jewish or the heathen level.

   As Christianity was met at its entrance into the world by two other
   religions, the one relatively true, and the other essentially false,
   heresy appeared likewise in the two leading forms of ebionism and
   gnosticism, the germs of which, as already observed, attracted the
   notice of the apostles. The remark of Hegesippus, that the church
   preserved a virginal purity of doctrine to the time of Hadrian, must be
   understood as made only in view of the open advance of Gnosticism in
   the second century, and therefore as only relatively true. The very
   same writer expressly observes, that heresy had been already secretly
   working from the days of Simon Magus. Ebionism is a Judaizing,
   pseudo-Petrine Christianity, or, as it may equally well be called, a
   Christianizing Judaism; Gnosticism is a paganizing or pseudo-Pauline
   Christianity, or a pseudo-Christian heathenism.

   These two great types of heresy are properly opposite poles. Ebionism
   is a particularistic contraction of the Christian religion; Gnosticism,
   a vague expansion of it. The one is a gross realism and literalism; the
   other, a fantastic idealism and spiritualism. In the former the spirit
   is bound in outward forms; in the latter it revels in licentious
   freedom. Ebionism makes salvation depend on observance of the law;
   Gnosticism, on speculative knowledge. Under the influence of Judaistic
   legalism, Christianity must stiffen and petrify; under the influence of
   Gnostic speculation, it must dissolve into empty notions and fancies.
   Ebionism denies the divinity of Christ, and sees in the gospel only a
   new law; Gnosticism denies the true humanity of the Redeemer, and makes
   his person and his work a mere phantom, a docetistic illusion.

   The two extremes, however, meet; both tendencies from opposite
   directions reach the same result--the denial of the incarnation, of the
   true and abiding union of the divine and the human in Christ and his
   kingdom; and thus they fall together under St. John's criterion of the
   antichristian spirit of error. In both Christ ceases to be mediator and
   reconciler and his religion makes no specific advance upon the Jewish
   and the heathen, which place God and man in abstract dualism, or allow
   them none but a transient and illusory union.

   Hence, there were also some forms of error, in which Ebionistic and
   Gnostic elements were combined. We have a Gnostic or theosophic
   Ebionism the pseudo-Clementine), and a Judaizing Gnosticism (in
   Cerinthus and others). These mixed forms also we find combated in the
   apostolic age. Indeed, similar forms of religious syncretism we meet
   with even before the time and beyond the field of Christianity, in the
   Essenes, the Therapeutae, and the Platonizing Jewish philosopher,
   Philo.

   The Jewish Christianity, represented in the apostolic church by Peter
   and James, combined with the Gentile Christianity of Paul, to form a
   Christian church, in which "neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
   uncircumcision, but a new creature in Christ."

   I. A portion of the Jewish Christians, however, adhered even after the
   destruction of Jerusalem, to the national customs of their fathers, and
   propagated themselves in some churches of Syria down to the end of the
   fourth century, under the name of Nazarenes; a name perhaps originally
   given in contempt by the Jews to all Christians as followers of Jesus
   of Nazareth. [776] 76 They united the observance of the Mosaic ritual
   law with their belief in the Messiahship and divinity of Jesus, used
   the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew, deeply mourned the unbelief of their
   brethren, and hoped for their future conversion in a body and for a
   millennial reign of Christ on the earth. But they indulged no antipathy
   to the apostle Paul, and never denounced the Gentile Christians and
   heretics for not observing the law. They were, therefore, not heretics,
   but stunted separatist Christians; they stopped at the obsolete
   position of a narrow and anxious Jewish Christianity, and shrank to an
   insignificant sect. Jerome says of them, that, wishing to be Jews and
   Christians alike, they were neither one nor the other.

   II. From these Nazarenes we must carefully distinguish the heretical
   Jewish Christians, or the ebionites, who were more numerous. Their name
   comes not, as Tertullian first intimated, [777] 77 from a supposed
   founder of the sect, Ebion, of whom we know nothing, but from the
   Hebrew word, 'vyrn, poor. It may have been originally, like "Nazarene"
   and "Galilean," a contemptuous designation of all Christians, the
   majority of whom lived in needy circumstances; [778] 78 but it was
   afterwards confined to this sect; whether in reproach, to denote the
   poverty of their doctrine of Christ and of the law, as Origen more
   ingeniously than correctly explains it; or, more probably, in honor,
   since the Ebionites regarded themselves as the genuine followers of the
   poor Christ and his poor disciples, and applied to themselves alone the
   benediction on the poor in spirit. According to Epiphanius, Ebion
   spread his error first in the company of Christians which fled to Pella
   after the destruction of Jerusalem; according to Hegesippus in
   Eusebius, one Thebutis, after the death of the bishop Symeon of
   Jerusalem, about 107, made schism among the Jewish Christians, and led
   many of them to apostatize, because he himself was not elected to the
   bishopric.

   We find the sect of the Ebionites in Palestine and the surrounding
   regions, on the island of Cyprus, in Asia Minor, and even in Rome.
   Though it consisted mostly of Jews, Gentile Christians also sometimes
   attached themselves to it. It continued into the fourth century, but at
   the time of Theodoret was entirely extinct. It used a Hebrew Gospel,
   now lost, which was probably a corruption of the Gospel of Matthew.

   The characteristic marks of Ebionism in all its forms are: degradation
   of Christianity to the level of Judaism; the principle of the universal
   and perpetual validity of the Mosaic law; and enmity to the apostle
   Paul. But, as there were different sects in Judaism itself, we have
   also to distinguish at least two branches of Ebionism, related to each
   other as Pharisaism and Essenism, or, to use a modern illustration, as
   the older deistic and the speculative pantheistic rationalism in
   Germany, or the practical and the speculative schools in Unitarianism.

   1. The common Ebionites, who were by far the more numerous, embodied
   the Pharisaic legalism, and were the proper successors of the Judaizers
   opposed in the Epistle to the Galatians. Their doctrine may be reduced
   to the following propositions:

   (a) Jesus is, indeed, the promised Messiah, the son of David, and the
   supreme lawgiver, yet a mere man, like Moses and David, sprung by
   natural generation from Joseph and Mary. The sense of his Messianic
   calling first arose in him at his baptism by John, when a higher spirit
   joined itself to him. Hence, Origen compared this sect to the blind man
   in the Gospel, who called to the Lord, without seeing him: "Thou son of
   David, have mercy on me."

   (b) Circumcision and the observance of the whole ritual law of Moses
   are necessary to salvation for all men.

   (c) Paul is an apostate and heretic, and all his epistles are to be
   discarded. The sect considered him a native heathen, who came over to
   Judaism in later life from impure motives.

   (d) Christ is soon to come again, to introduce the glorious millennial
   reign of the Messiah, with the earthly Jerusalem for its seat.

   2. The second class of Ebionites, starting with Essenic notions, gave
   their Judaism a speculative or theosophic stamp, like the errorists of
   the Epistle to the Colossians. They form the stepping-stone to
   Gnosticism. Among these belong the Elkesaites. [779] 79 They arose,
   according to Epiphanius, in the reign of Trajan, in the regions around
   the Dead Sea, where the Essenes lived. Their name is derived from their
   supposed founder, Elxai or Elkasai, and is interpreted: "hidden power,"
   which (according to Gieseler's suggestion) signifies the Holy Spirit.
   [780] 80 This seems to have been originally the title of a book, which
   pretended, like the book of Mormon, to be revealed by an angel, and was
   held in the highest esteem by the sect. This secret writing, according
   to the fragments in Origen, and in the "Philosophumena" of Hippolytus,
   contains the groundwork of the remarkable pseudo-Clementine system.
   [781] 81 (See next section.) It is evidently of Jewish origin,
   represents Jerusalem as the centre of the religious world, Christ as a
   creature and the Lord of angels and all other creatures, the Holy
   Spirit as a female, enjoins circumcision as well as baptism, rejects
   St. Paul, and justifies the denial of faith in time of persecution. It
   claims to date from the third year of Trajan (101). This and the
   requirement of circumcision would make it considerably older than the
   Clementine Homilies. A copy of that book was brought to Rome from Syria
   by a certain Alcibiades about a.d. 222, and excited attention by
   announcing a new method of forgiveness of sins.

   3. A similar sect are the Mandaeans, from Manda, knowledge (gnosis)
   also Sabians, i.e. Baptists (from sâbi, to baptize, to wash), and
   Mughtasilah, which has the same meaning. On account of their great
   reverence for John the Baptist, they were called "Christians of John."
   [782] 82 Their origin is uncertain. A remnant of them still exists, in
   Persia on the eastern banks of the Tigris. Their sacred language is an
   Aramaic dialect of some importance for comparative philology. [783] 83
   At present they speak Arabic and Persian. Their system is very
   complicated with the prevalence of the heathen element, and comes
   nearest to Manichaeism. [784] 84

   The system of the pseudo-Clementine Homilies exhibits Ebionism at once
   in its theosophic perfection, and in its internal dissolution. It
   represents rather an individual opinion, than a sect, but holds
   probably some connection, not definitely ascertained, with the
   Elkesaites, who, as appears from the "Philosophumena," branched out
   even to Rome. It is genuinely Ebionitic or Judaistic in its
   monotheistic basis, its concealed antagonism to Paul, and its assertion
   of the essential identity of Christianity and Judaism, while it
   expressly rejects the Gnostic fundamental doctrine of the demiurge. It
   cannot, therefore, properly be classed, as it is by Baur, among the
   Gnostic schools.

   The twenty Clementine Homilies bear the celebrated name of the Roman
   bishop Clement, mentioned in Phil. 4:3, as a helper of Paul, but
   evidently confounded in the pseudo-Clementine literature with Flavius
   Clement, kinsman of the Emperor Domitian. They really come from an
   unknown, philosophically educated author, probably a Jewish Christian,
   of the second half of the second century. They are a
   philosophico-religious romance, based on some historical traditions,
   which it is now impossible to separate from apocryphal accretions. The
   conception of Simon as a magician was furnished by the account in the
   eighth chapter of Acts, and his labors in Rome were mentioned by Justin
   Martyr. The book is prefaced by a letter of Peter to James, bishop of
   Jerusalem, in which he sends him his sermons, and begs him to keep them
   strictly secret; and by a letter of the pseudo-Clement to the same
   James in which he relates how Peter, shortly before his death,
   appointed him (Clement) his successor in Rome, and enjoined upon him to
   send to James a work composed at the instance of Peter, entitled
   "Clementis Epitome praedicationum Petri in peregrinationibus." [785] 85
   By these epistles it was evidently designed to impart to the pretended
   extract from the itinerant sermons and disputations of Peter, the
   highest apostolical authority, and at the same time to explain the long
   concealment of them. [786] 86

   The substance of the Homilies themselves is briefly this: Clement, an
   educated Roman, of the imperial family, not satisfied with heathenism,
   and thirsting for truth, goes to Judaea, having heard, under the reign
   of Tiberius, that Jesus had appeared there. In Caesarea he meets the
   apostle Peter, and being instructed and converted by him, accompanies
   him on his missionary journeys in Palestine, to Tyre, Tripolis,
   Laodicea, and Antioch. He attends upon the sermons of Peter and his
   long, repeated disputations with Simon Magus, and, at the request of
   the apostle, commits the substance of them to writing. Simon Peter is
   thus the proper hero of the romance, and appears throughout as the
   representative of pure, primitive Christianity, in opposition to Simon
   Magus, who is portrayed as a "man full of enmity," and a "deceiver,"
   the author of all anti-Jewish heresies, especially of the Marcionite
   Gnosticism. The author was acquainted with the four canonical Gospels,
   and used them, Matthew most, John least; and with them another work of
   the same sort, probably of the Ebionitic stamp, but now unknown. [787]
   87

   It has been ingeniously conjectured by Baur (first in 1831), and
   adopted by his pupils, that the pseudo-Clementine Peter combats, under
   the mask of the Magician, the apostle Paul (nowhere named in the
   Homilies), as the first and chief corrupter of Christianity. [788] 88
   This conjecture, which falls in easily with Baur's view of the
   wide-spread and irreconcilable antagonism of Petrinism and Paulinism in
   the primitive church, derives some support from several malicious
   allusions to Paul, especially the collision in Antioch. Simon Magus is
   charged with claiming that Christ appeared to him in a vision, and
   called him to be an apostle, and yet teaching a doctrine contrary to
   Christ, hating his apostles, and denouncing Peter, the firm rock and
   foundation of the church, as "self-condemned." [789] 89 But this
   allusion is probably only an incidental sneer at Paul. The whole design
   of the Homilies, and the account given of the origin, history and
   doctrine of Simon, are inconsistent with such an identification of the
   heathen magician with the Christian apostle. Simon Magus is described
   in the Homilies [790] 90 as a Samaritan, who studied Greek in
   Alexandria, and denied the supremacy of God and the resurrection of the
   dead, substituted Mount Gerizim for Jerusalem, and declared himself the
   true Christ. He carried with him a companion or mistress, Helena, who
   descended from the highest heavens, and was the primitive essence and
   wisdom. If Paul had been intended, the writer would have effectually
   concealed and defeated his design by such and other traits, which find
   not the remotest parallel in the history and doctrine of Paul, but are
   directly opposed to the statements in his Epistles and in the Acts of
   the Apostles.

   In the Recognitions the anti-Pauline tendency is moderated, yet Paul's
   labors are ignored, and Peter is made the apostle of the Gentiles.

   The doctrine which pseudo-Clement puts into the mouth of Peter, and
   very skillfully interweaves with his narrative, is a confused mixture
   of Ebionitic and Gnostic, ethical and metaphysical ideas and fancies.
   He sees in Christianity only the restoration of the pure primordial
   religion, [791] 91 which God revealed in the creation, but which, on
   account of the obscuring power of sin and the seductive influence of
   demons, must be from time to time renewed. The representatives of this
   religion are the pillars of the world: Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham,
   Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and Christ. These are in reality only seven
   different incarnations of the same Adam or primal man, the true prophet
   of God, who was omniscient and infallible. What is recorded unfavorable
   to these holy men, the drunkenness of Noah, the polygamy of the
   patriarchs, the homicide of Moses, and especially the blasphemous
   history of the fall of Adam, as well as all unworthy anthropopathical
   passages concerning God, were foisted into the Old Testament by the
   devil and his demons. Thus, where Philo and Origen resorted to
   allegorical interpretation, to remove what seems offensive in
   Scripture, pseudo-Clement adopts the still more arbitrary hypothesis of
   diabolical interpolations. Among the true prophets of God, again, he
   gives Adam, Moses, and Christ peculiar eminence, and places Christ
   above all, though without raising him essentially above a prophet and
   lawgiver. The history of religion, therefore, is not one of progress,
   but only of return to the primitive revelation. Christianity and
   Mosaism are identical, and both coincide with the religion of Adam.
   Whether a man believe in Moses or in Christ, it is all the same,
   provided he blaspheme neither. But to know both, and find in both the
   same doctrine, is to be rich in God, to recognize the new as old, and
   the old as become new. Christianity is an advance only in its extension
   of the gospel to the Gentiles, and its consequent universal character.

   As the fundamental principle of this pure religion, our author lays
   down the doctrine of one God, the creator of the world. This is
   thoroughly Ebionitic, and directly opposed to the dualism of the
   demiurgic doctrine of the Gnostics. But then he makes the whole stream
   of created life flow forth from God in a long succession of sexual and
   ethical antitheses and syzygies, and return into him as its absolute
   rest; here plainly touching the pantheistic emanation-theory of
   Gnosticism. God himself one from the beginning, has divided everything
   into counterparts, into right and left, heaven and earth, day and
   night, light and darkness, life and death. The monad thus becomes the
   dyad. The better came first, the worse followed; but from man onward
   the order was reversed. Adam, created in the image of God, is the true
   prophet; his wife, Eve, represents false prophecy. They were followed,
   first, by wicked Cain, and then by righteous Abel. So Peter appeared
   after Simon Magus, as light after darkness, health after sickness. So,
   at the last, will antichrist precede the advent of Christ. And finally,
   the whole present order of things loses itself in the future; the pious
   pass into eternal life; the ungodly, since the soul becomes mortal by
   the corruption of the divine image, are annihilated after suffering a
   punishment, which is described as a purifying fire. [792] 92 When the
   author speaks of eternal punishment, he merely accommodates himself to
   the popular notion. The fulfilling of the law, in the Ebionitic sense,
   and knowledge, on a half-Gnostic principle, are the two parts of the
   way of salvation. The former includes frequent fasts, ablutions,
   abstinence from animal food, and voluntary poverty; while early
   marriage is enjoined, to prevent licentiousness. In declaring baptism
   to be absolutely necessary to the forgiveness of sin, the author
   approaches the catholic system. He likewise adopts the catholic
   principle involved, that salvation is to be found only in the external
   church.

   As regards ecclesiastical organization, he fully embraces the
   monarchical episcopal view. The bishop holds the place of Christ in the
   congregation, and has power to bind and loose. Under him stand the
   presbyters and deacons. But singularly, and again in true Ebionitic
   style, James, the brother of the Lord, bishop of Jerusalem, which is
   the centre of Christendom, is made the general vicar of Christ, the
   visible head of the whole church, the bishop of bishops. Hence even
   Peter must give him an account of his labors; and hence, too, according
   to the introductory epistles, the sermons of Peter and Clement's
   abstract of them were sent to James for safe-keeping, with the
   statement, that Clement had been named by Peter as his successor at
   Rome.

   It is easy to see that this appeal to a pseudo-Petrine primitive
   Christianity was made by the author of the Homilies with a view to
   reconcile all the existing differences and divisions in Christendom. In
   this effort he, of course, did not succeed, but rather made way for the
   dissolution of the Ebionitic element still existing in the orthodox
   catholic church.

   Besides these Homilies, of which the Epitome is only a poor
   abridgement, there are several other works, some printed, some still
   unpublished, which are likewise forged upon Clement of Rome, and based
   upon the same historical material, with unimportant deviations, but are
   in great measure free, as to doctrine, from Judaistic and Gnostic
   ingredients, and come considerably nearer the line of orthodoxy.

   The most important of these are the Recognitions of Clement, in ten
   books, mentioned by Origen, but now extant only in a Latin translation
   by Rufinus. They take their name from the narrative, in the last books,
   of the reunion of the scattered members of the Clementine family, who
   all at last find themselves together in Christianity, and are baptized
   by Peter.

   On the question of priority between these two works, critics are
   divided, some making the Recognitions an orthodox, or at least more
   nearly orthodox, version of the Homilies; [793] 93 others regarding the
   Homilies as a heretical corruption of the Recognitions. [794] 94 But in
   all probability both works are based upon older and simpler
   Jewish-Christian documents, under the assumed names of Peter and
   Clement. [795] 95

   As to their birth-place, the Homilies probably originated in East
   Syria, the Recognitions in Rome. They are assigned to the second half
   of the second century.

   In a literary point of view, these productions are remarkable, as the
   first specimens of Christian romance, next to the "Pastor Hermae." They
   far surpass, in matter, and especially in moral earnestness and tender
   feeling, the heathen romances of a Chariton and an Achilles Tatios, of
   the fourth or fifth centuries. The style, though somewhat tedious, is
   fascinating in its way, and betrays a real artist in its combination of
   the didactic and historical, the philosophic and the poetic elements.

   Notes.

   Lagarde (in the Preface to his edition of the Clementina, p. 22) and G.
   E. Stietz (in the lengthy review of Lagarde in the "Studien und
   Kritiken" for 1867, No. III p. 556 sqq), draw a parallel between the
   pseudo-Clementine fiction of Simon and the German story of Faust, the
   magician, and derive the latter from the former through the medium of
   the Recognitions, which were better known in the church than the
   homilies. George Sabellicus , about a.d. 1507, called himself Faustus
   junior, magus secundus. Clement's father is called Faustus, and his two
   brothers, Fatistinus and Faustinianus (in the Recognitions Faustus, and
   Faustinus), were brought up with Simon the magician, and at first
   associated with him. The characters of Helena and Homunculus appear in
   both stories, though very differently. I doubt whether these
   resemblances are sufficient to establish a connection between the two
   otherwise widely divergent popular fictions.

   [786] The Tübingen School, under the lead of Dr. Baur, has greatly
   exaggerated the importance of these heretical fictions which the
   unknown author never intended to present as solid facts. Thus
   Hilgenfeld says (l. c. p. 1) There is scarcely a single writing which
   is of so great importance for the history of Christianity in its first
   age, and which has already given such brilliant disclosures [?] at the
   hands of the most renowned critics in regard to the earliest history of
   the Christian Church, as the writing ascribed to the Roman Clement, the
   Recognitions and Homilies."Their importance is confined to the history
   of heresy, which with the Tübingen school is the most interesting
   portion of ancient church history.

   [787] The Tübingen school first denied the use of the fourth Gospel,
   but the discovery of the missing portion by Dressel in 1853 has settled
   this point, for it contains (Hom. XIX. 22) a clear quotation from John
   9:1-3.

   [788] The hypothesis has been most fully carried out by Lipsius in his
   article on Simon Magus in Schenkel's "Bibellexicon, " vol. V. 301-321.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 116. Meaning, Origin and Character of Gnosticism.

   The Judaistic form of heresy was substantially conquered in the
   apostolic age. More important and more widely spread in the second
   period was the paganizing heresy, known by the name of Gnosticism. It
   was the Rationalism of the ancient church; it pervaded the intellectual
   atmosphere, and stimulated the development of catholic theology by
   opposition.

   The Greek word gnosis may denote all schools of philosophical or
   religious knowledge, in distinction from superficial opinion or blind
   belief. The New Testament makes a plain distinction between true and
   false gnosis. The true consists in a deep insight into the essence and
   structure of the Christian truth, springs from faith, is accompanied by
   the cardinal virtues of love and humility, serves to edify the church,
   and belongs among the gifts of grace wrought by the Holy Spirit. [796]
   96 In this sense, Clement of Alexandria and Origen aimed at gnosis, and
   all speculative theologians who endeavor to reconcile reason and
   revelation, may be called Christian Gnostics. The false gnosis [797] 97
   on the contrary, against which Paul warns Timothy, and which he
   censures in the Corinthians and Colossians is a morbid pride of wisdom,
   an arrogant, self-conceited, ambitious knowledge, which puffs up,
   instead of edifying, [798] 98 runs into idle subtleties and disputes,
   and verifies in its course the apostle's word: "Professing themselves
   to be wise, they became fools." [799] 99

   In this bad sense, the word applies to the error of which we now speak,
   and which began to show itself at least as early as the days of Paul
   and John. It is a one-sided intellectualism on a dualistic heathen
   basis. It rests on an over-valuation of knowledge or gnosis, and a
   depreciation of faith or pistis. The Gnostics contrasted themselves by
   this name with the Pistics, or the mass of believing Christians. They
   regarded Christianity as consisting essentially in a higher knowledge;
   fancied themselves the sole possessors of an esoteric, philosophical
   religion, which made them genuine, spiritual men, and looked down with
   contempt upon the mere men of the soul and of the body. They
   constituted the intellectual aristocracy, a higher caste in the church.
   They, moreover, adulterated Christianity with sundry elements entirely
   foreign, and thus quite obscured the true essence of the gospel. [800]
   00

   We may parallelize the true and false, the believing and unbelieving
   forms of Gnosticism with the two forms of modern Rationalism and modern
   Agnosticism. There is a Christian Rationalism which represents the
   doctrines of revelation as being in harmony with reason, though
   transcending reason in its present capacity; and there is an
   anti-Christian Rationalism which makes natural reason (ratio) the judge
   of revelation, rejects the specific doctrines of Christianity, and
   denies the supernatural and miraculous. And there is an Agnosticism
   which springs from the sense of the limitations of thought, and
   recognizes faith as the necessary organ of the supernatural and
   absolute; [801] 01 while the unbelieving Agnosticism declares the
   infinite and absolute to be unknown and unknowable and tends to
   indifferentism and atheism. [802] 02

   We now proceed to trace the origin of Gnosticism.

   As to its substance, Gnosticism is chiefly of heathen descent. It is a
   peculiar translation or transfusion of heathen philosophy and religion
   into Christianity. This was perceived by the church-fathers in their
   day. Hippolytus particularly, in his "Philosophumena" endeavors to
   trace the Gnostic heresies to the various systems of Greek philosophy,
   making Simon Magus, for example, dependent on Heraclitus, Valentine on
   Pythagoras and Plato, Basilides on Aristotle, Marcion on Empedocles;
   and hence he first exhibits the doctrines of the Greek philosophy from
   Thales down. Of all these systems Platonism had the greatest influence,
   especially on the Alexandrian Gnostics; though not so much in its
   original Hellenic form, as in its later orientalized eclectic and
   mystic cast, of which Neo-Platonism was another fruit. The Platonic
   speculation yielded the germs of the Gnostic doctrine of aeons, the
   conceptions of matter, of the antithesis of an ideal and a real world,
   of all ante-mundane fall of souls from the ideal world, of the origin
   of sin from matter, and of the needed redemption of the soul from the
   fetters of the body. We find also in the Gnostics traces of the
   Pythagorean symbolical use of numbers, the Stoic physics and ethics,
   and some Aristotelian elements.

   But this reference to Hellenic philosophy, with which Massuet was
   content, is not enough. Since Beausobre and Mosheim the East has been
   rightly joined with Greece, as the native home of this heresy. This may
   be inferred from the mystic, fantastic, enigmatic form of the Gnostic
   speculation, and from the fact, that most of its representatives sprang
   from Egypt and Syria. The conquests of Alexander, the spread of the
   Greek language and literature, and the truths of Christianity, produced
   a mighty agitation in the eastern mind, which reacted on the West.
   Gnosticism has accordingly been regarded as more or less parallel with
   the heretical forms of Judaism, with Essenism, Therapeutism, Philo's
   philosophico-religious system, and with the Cabbala, the origin of
   which probably dates as far back as the first century. The affinity of
   Gnosticism also with the Zoroastrian dualism of a kingdom of light and
   a kingdom of darkness is unmistakable, especially in the Syrian
   Gnostics. Its alliance with the pantheistic, docetic, and ascetic
   elements of Buddhism, which had advanced at the time of Christ to
   western Asia, is equally plain. Parsic and Indian influence is most
   evident in Manichaeism, while the Hellenic element there amounts to
   very little.

   Gnosticism, with its syncretistic tendency, is no isolated fact. It
   struck its roots deep in the mighty revolution of ideas induced by the
   fall of the old religions and the triumph of the new. Philo, of
   Alexandria, who was a contemporary of Christ, but wholly ignorant of
   him, endeavored to combine the Jewish religion, by allegorical
   exposition, or rather imposition, with Platonic philosophy; and this
   system, according as it might be prosecuted under the Christian or the
   heathen influence, would prepare the way either for the speculative
   theology of the Alexandrian church fathers, or for the heretical
   Gnosis. Still more nearly akin to Gnosticism is Neo-Platonism, which
   arose a little later than Philo's system, but ignored Judaism, and
   derived its ideas exclusively from eastern and western heathenism. The
   Gnostic syncretism, however, differs materially from both the Philonic
   and the Neo-Platonic by taking up Christianity, which the
   Neo-Platonists directly or indirectly opposed. This the Gnostics
   regarded as the highest stage of the development of religion, though
   they so corrupted it by the admixture of foreign matter, as to destroy
   its identity.

   Gnosticism is, therefore, the grandest and most comprehensive form of
   speculative religious syncretism known to history. It consists of
   Oriental mysticism, Greek philosophy, Alexandrian, Philonic, and
   Cabbalistic Judaism, and Christian ideas of salvation, not merely
   mechanically compiled, but, as it were, chemically combined. At least,
   in its fairly developed form in the Valentinian system, it is, in its
   way, a wonderful structure of speculative or rather imaginative
   thought, and at the same time all artistic work of the creative fancy,
   a Christian mythological epic. The old world here rallied all its
   energies, to make out of its diverse elements some new thing, and to
   oppose to the real, substantial universalism of the catholic church an
   ideal, shadowy universalism of speculation. But this fusion of all
   systems served in the end only to hasten the dissolution of eastern and
   western heathenism, while the Christian element came forth purified and
   strengthened from the crucible.

   The Gnostic speculation, like most speculative religions, failed to
   establish a safe basis for practical morals. On the one side, a
   spiritual pride obscured the sense of sin, and engendered a frivolous
   antinomianism, which often ended in sensuality and debaucheries. On the
   other side, an over-strained sense of sin often led the Gnostics, in
   gIaring contrast with the pagan deification of nature, to ascribe
   nature to the devil, to abhor the body as the seat of evil, and to
   practice extreme austerities upon themselves.

   This ascetic feature is made prominent by Möhler, the Roman Catholic
   divine. But he goes quite too far, when he derives the whole phenomenon
   of Gnosticism (which he wrongly views as a forerunner of Protestantism)
   directly and immediately from Christianity. He represents it as a
   hyper-Christianity, an exaggerated contempt for the world, [803] 03
   which, when seeking for itself a speculative basis, gathered from older
   philosophemes, theosophies, and mythologies, all that it could use for
   its purpose.

   The number of the Gnostics it is impossible to ascertain. We find them
   in almost all portions of the ancient church; chiefly where
   Christianity came into close contact with Judaism and heathenism, as in
   Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor; then in Rome, the rendezvous of all forms
   of truth and falsehood; in Gaul, where they were opposed by Irenaeus;
   and in Africa, where they were attacked by Tertullian, and afterwards
   by Augustin, who was himself a Manichaean for several years. They found
   most favor with the educated, and threatened to lead astray the
   teachers of the church. But they could gain no foothold among the
   people; indeed, as esoterics, they stood aloof from the masses; and
   their philosophical societies were, no doubt, rarely as large as the
   catholic congregations.

   The flourishing period of the Gnostic schools was the second century.
   In the sixth century, only faint traces of them remained; yet some
   Gnostic and especially Manichaean ideas continue to appear in several
   heretical sects of the middle ages, such as the Priscillianists, the
   Paulicians, the Bogomiles, and the Catharists; and even the history of
   modern theological and philosophical speculation shows kindred
   tendencies.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 117. The System of Gnosticism. Its Theology.

   Gnosticism is a heretical philosophy of religion, or, more exactly a
   mythological theosophy, which reflects intellectually the peculiar,
   fermenting state of that remarkable age of transition from the heathen
   to the Christian order of things. If it were merely an unintelligible
   congeries of puerile absurdities and impious blasphemies, as it is
   grotesquely portrayed by older historians, [804] 04 it would not have
   fascinated so many vigorous intellects and produced such a
   long-continued agitation in the ancient church. It is an attempt to
   solve some of the deepest metaphysical and theological problems. It
   deals with the great antitheses of God and world, spirit and matter,
   idea and phenomenon; and endeavors to unlock the mystery of the
   creation; the question of the rise, development, and end of the world;
   and of the origin of evil. [805] 05 It endeavors to harmonize the
   creation of the material world and the existence of evil with the idea
   of an absolute God, who is immaterial and perfectly good. This problem
   can only be solved by the Christian doctrine of redemption; but
   Gnosticism started from a false basis of dualism, which prevents a
   solution.

   In form and method it is, as already observed, more Oriental than
   Grecian. The Gnostics, in their daring attempt to unfold the mysteries
   of an upper world, disdained the trammels of reason, and resorted to
   direct spiritual intuition. Hence they speculate not so much in logical
   and dialectic mode, as in an imaginative, semi-poetic way, and they
   clothe their ideas not in the simple, clear, and sober language of
   reflection, but in the many-colored, fantastic, mythological dress of
   type, symbol, and allegory. Thus monstrous nonsense and the most absurd
   conceits are chaotically mingIed up with profound thoughts and poetic
   intuitions.

   This spurious supernaturalism which substitutes the irrational for the
   supernatural, and the prodigy for the miracle, pervades the
   pseudo-historical romances of the Gnostic Gospels and Acts. These
   surpass the Catholic traditions in luxuriant fancy and incredible
   marvels. "Demoniacal possessions," says one who has mastered this
   literature, [806] 06 "and resurrections from the dead, miracles of
   healing and punishment are accumulated without end; the constant
   repetition of similar events gives the long stories a certain monotony,
   which is occasionally interrupted by colloquies, hymns and prayers of
   genuine poetic value. A rich apparatus of visions, angelic appearances,
   heavenly voices, speaking animals, defeated and humbled demons is
   unfolded, a superterrestrial splendor of light gleams up, mysterious
   signs from heaven, earthquakes, thunder and lightning frighten the
   impious; fire, earth, wind and water obey the pious; serpents, lions,
   leopards, tigers, and bears are tamed by a word of the apostles and
   turn upon their persecutors; the dying martyrs are surrounded by
   coronets, roses, lilies, incense, while the abyss opens to swallow up
   their enemies."

   The highest source of knowledge, with these heretics was a secret
   tradition, in contrast with the open, popular tradition of the Catholic
   church. In this respect, they differ from Protestant sects, which
   generally discard tradition altogether and appeal to the Bible only, as
   understood by themselves. They appealed also to apocryphal documents,
   which arose in the second century in great numbers, under eminent names
   of apostolic or pre-Christian times. Epiphanius, in his 26^th Heresy,
   counts the apocrypha of the Gnostics by thousands, and Irenaeus found
   among the Valentinians alone a countless multitude of such writings.
   [807] 07 And finally, when it suited their purpose, the Gnostics
   employed single portions of the Bible, without being able to agree
   either as to the extent or the interpretation of the same. The Old
   Testament they generally rejected, either entirely, as in the case of
   the Marcionites and the Manichaeans, or at least in great part; and in
   the New Testament they preferred certain books or portions, such as the
   Gospel of John, with its profound spiritual intuitions, and either
   rejected the other books, or wrested them to suit their ideas. Marcion,
   for example, thus mutilated the Gospel of Luke, and received in
   addition to it only ten of Paul's Epistles, thus substituting an
   arbitrary canon of eleven books for the catholic Testament of
   twenty-seven. In interpretation they adopted, even with far less
   moderation than Philo, the most arbitrary and extravagant allegorical
   principles; despising the letter as sensuous, and the laws of language
   and exegesis as fetters of the mind. The number 30 in the New
   Testament, for instance, particularly in the life of Jesus, is made to
   denote the number of the Valentinian aeons; and the lost sheep in the
   parable is Achamoth. Even to heathen authors, to the poems of Homer,
   Aratus, Anacreon, they applied this method, and discovered in these
   works the deepest Gnostic mysteries. [808] 08 They gathered from the
   whole field of ancient mythology, astronomy, physics, and magic,
   everything which could, serve in any way to support their fancies.

   The common characteristics of nearly all the Gnostic systems are (1)
   Dualism; the assumption of an eternal antagonism between God and
   matter. (2) The demiurgic notion; the separation of the creator of the
   world or the demiurgos from the proper God. (3) Docetism; the
   resolution of the human element in the person of the Redeemer into mere
   deceptive appearance. [809] 09

   We will endeavor now to present a clear and connected view of the
   theoretical and practical system of Gnosticism in as it comes before us
   in its more fully developed forms, especially the Valentinian school.

   1. The Gnostic Theology. The system starts from absoIute primal being.
   God is the unfathomable abyss, [810] 10 locked up within himself,
   without beginning, unnamable, and incomprehensible; on the one hand,
   infinitely exalted above every existence; yet, on the other hand, the
   original aeon, the sum of all ideas and spiritual powers. Basilides
   would not ascribe even existence to him, and thus, like Hegel, starts
   from absolute nonentity, which, however, is identical with absolute
   being. [811] 11 He began where modern Agnosticism ends.

   2. Kosmology. The abyss opens; God enters upon a process of
   development, and sends forth from his bosom the several aeons; that is,
   the attributes and unfolded powers of his nature, the ideas of the
   eternal spirit-world, such as mind, reason, wisdom, power, truth, life.
   [812] 12 These emanate from the absolute in a certain order, according
   to Valentine in pairs with sexual polarity. The further they go from
   the great source, the poorer and weaker they become. Besides the notion
   of emanation, [813] 13 the Gnostics employed also, to illustrate the
   self-revelation of the absolute, the figure of the evolution of numbers
   from an original unit, or of utterance in tones gradually diminishing
   to the faint echo. [814] 14 The cause of the procession of the aeons
   is, with some, as with Valentine, the self-limiting love of God; with
   others, metaphysical necessity. The whole body of aeons forms the ideal
   world, or light-world, or spiritual foulness, the Pleroma, as opposed
   to the Kenoma, or the material world of emptiness. The one is the
   totality of the divine powers and attributes, the other the region of
   shadow and darkness. Christ belongs to the Pleroma, as the chief of the
   aeons; the Demiurge or Creator belongs to the Kenoma. In opposition to
   the incipient form of this heresy, St. Paul taught that Jesus Christ is
   the whole pleroma of the Godhead (Col. 1:19; 2:9), and the church the
   reflected pleroma of Christ (Eph. 1:22).

   The material visible world is the abode of the principle of evil. This
   cannot proceed from God; else he were himself the author of evil. It
   must come from an opposite principle. This is Matter (hule), which
   stands in eternal opposition to God and the ideal world. The Syrian
   Gnostics, and still more the Manichaeans, agreed with Parsism in
   conceiving Matter as an intrinsically evil substance, the raging
   kingdom of Satan, at irreconcilable warfare with the kingdom of light.
   The Alexandrian Gnostics followed more the Platonic idea of the hule
   and conceived this as kenoma, emptiness, in contrast with pleroma, the
   divine, vital fulness, or as the me on, related to the divine being as
   shadow to light, and forming the dark limit beyond which the mind
   cannot pass. This Matter is in itself dead, but becomes animated by a
   union with the Pleroma, which again is variously described. In the
   Manichaean system there are powers of darkness, which seize by force
   some parts of the kingdom of light. But usually the union is made to
   proceed from above. The last link in the chain of divine aeons, either
   too weak to keep its hold on the ideal world, or seized with a sinful
   passion for the embrace of the infinite abyss, falls as a spark of
   light into the dark chaos of matter, and imparts to it a germ of divine
   life, but in this bondage feels a painful longing after redemption,
   with which the whole world of aeons sympathizes. This weakest aeon is
   called by Valentine the lower Wisdom, or Achamoth, [815] 15 and marks
   the extreme point, where spirit must surrender itself to matter, where
   the infinite must enter into the finite, and thus form a basis for the
   real world. The myth of Achamoth is grounded in the thought, that the
   finite is incompatible with the absolute, yet in some sense demands it
   to account for itself.

   Here now comes in the third principle of the Gnostic speculation,
   namely, the world-maker, commonly called the Demiurge, [816] 16 termed
   by Basilides "Archon" or world-ruler, by the Ophites. "Jaldabaoth," or
   son of chaos. He is a creature of the fallen aeon, formed of physical
   material, and thus standing between God and Matter. He makes out of
   Matter the visible sensible world, and rules over it. He has his throne
   in the planetary heavens, and presides over time and over the sidereal
   spirits. Astrological influences were generally ascribed to him. He is
   the God of Judaism, the Jehovah, who imagines himself to be the supreme
   and only God. But in the further development of this idea the systems
   differ; the anti-Jewish Gnostics, Marcion and the Ophites, represent
   the Demiurge as an insolent being, resisting the purposes of God; while
   the Judaizing Gnostics, Basilides and Valentine, make him a restricted,
   unconscious instrument of God to prepare the way for redemption.

   3. Christology and Soteriology. Redemption itself is the liberation of
   the light-spirit from the chains of dark Matter, and is effected by
   Christ, the most perfect aeon, who is the mediator of return from the
   sensible phenomenal world to the supersensuous ideal world, just as the
   Demiurge is the mediator of apostacy from the Pleroma to the Kenoma.
   This redeeming aeon, called by Valentine soter or Iesous descends
   through the sphere of heaven, and assumes the ethereal appearance of a
   body; according to another view, unites himself with the man Jesus, or
   with the Jewish Messiah, at the baptism, and forsakes him again at the
   passion. At all events, the redeemer, however conceived in other
   respects, is allowed no actual contact with sinful matter. His human
   birth, his sufferings and death, are explained by Gnosticism after the
   manner of the Indian mythology, as a deceptive appearance, a transient
   vision, a spectral form, which he assumed only to reveal himself to the
   sensuous nature of man. Reduced to a clear philosophical definition,
   the Gnostic Christ is really nothing more than the ideal spirit of
   himself, as in the mythical gospel-theory of Strauss. The Holy Ghost is
   commonly conceived as a subordinate aeon. The central fact in the work
   of Christ is the communication of the Gnosis to a small circle of the
   initiated, prompting and enabling them to strive with clear
   consciousness after the ideal world and the original unity. According
   to Valentine, the heavenly Soter brings Achamoth after innumerable
   sufferings into the Pleroma, and unites himself with her--the most
   glorious aeon with the Iowest--in an eternal spirit-marriage. With
   this, all disturbance in the heaven of aeons is allayed, and a blessed
   harmony and inexpressible delight are restored, in which all spiritual
   (pneumatic) men, or genuine Gnostics, share. Matter is at last entirely
   consumed by a fire breaking out from its dark bosom.

   4. The Anthropology of the Gnostics corresponds with their theology.
   Man is a microcosm consisting of spirit, body, and soul reflecting the
   three principles, God, Matter, and Demiurge, though in very different
   degrees. There are three classes of men: the spiritual, [817] 17 in
   whom the divine element, a spark of light from the ideal world,
   predominates; the material, [818] 18 bodily, carnal, physical, in whom
   matter, the gross sensuous principle, rules; and the psychical, [819]
   19 in whom the demiurgic, quasi-divine rules; principle, the mean
   between the two preceding, prevails.

   These three classes are frequently identified with the adherents of the
   three religions respectively; the spiritual with the Christians, the
   carnal with the heathens, the psychical with the Jews. But they also
   made the same distinction among the professors of any one religion,
   particularly among the Christians; and they regarded themselves as the
   genuine spiritual men in the full sense of the word; while they looked
   upon the great mass of Christians [820] 20 as only psychical, not able
   to rise from blind faith to true knowledge, too weak for the good, and
   too tender for the evil, longing for the divine, yet unable to attain
   it, and thus hovering between the Pleroma of the ideal world and the
   Kenoma of the sensual.

   Ingenious as this thought is, it is just the basis of that unchristian
   distinction of esoteric and exoteric religion, and that pride of
   knowledge, in which Gnosticism runs directly counter to the Christian
   virtues of humility and love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [804] Even some of the more recent writers, as Bishop Kaye (Eccl.
   History of the Second arid Third Centuries), and the translators of
   Irenaeus in the "Ante-Nicene Christian Library" (Edinb. 1868, vol. 1st,
   Introductory Notice) have the same idea of the Gnostic system as an
   impenetrable wilderness, of absurdities. But Mansel, Lightfoot, and
   Salmon show a clear knowledge of the subject, and agree; substantially
   with Neander's account.

   § 118. Ethics of Gnosticism.

   All the Gnostic heretics agree in disparaging the divinely created
   body, and over-rating the intellect. Beyond this, we perceive among
   them two opposite tendencies: a gloomy asceticism, and a frivolous
   antinomianism; both grounded in the dualistic principle, which falsely
   ascribes evil to matter, and traces nature to the devil. The two
   extremes frequently met, and the Nicolaitan maxim in regard to the
   abuse of the flesh [821] 21 was made to serve asceticism first, and
   then libertinism.

   The ascetic Gnostics, like Marcion, Saturninus, Tatian, and the
   Manichaeans were pessimists. They felt uncomfortable in the sensuous
   and perishing world, ruled by the Demiurge, and by Satan; they abhorred
   the body as formed from Matter, and forbade the use of certain kinds of
   food and all nuptial intercourse, as an adulteration of themselves with
   sinful Matter; like the Essenes and the errorists noticed by Paul in
   the Colossians and Pastoral Epistles. They thus confounded sin with
   matter, and vainly imagined that, matter being dropped, sin, its
   accident, would fall with it. Instead of hating sin only, which God has
   not made, they hated the world, which he has made.

   The licentious Gnostics, as the Nicolaitans, the Ophites, the
   Carpocratians, and the Antitactes, in a proud conceit of the exaltation
   of the spirit above matter, or even on the diabolical principle, that
   sensuality must be overcome by indulging it, bade defiance to all moral
   laws, and gave themselves up to the most shameless licentiousness. It
   is no great thing, said they, according to Clement of Alexandria, to
   restrain lust; but it is surely a great thing not to be conquered by
   Iust, when one indulges in it. According to Epiphanius there were
   Gnostic sects in Egypt, which, starting from a filthy, materialistic
   pantheism and identifying Christ with the generative powers of nature,
   practised debauchery as a mode of worship, and after having, as they
   thought, offered and collected all their strength, blasphemously
   exclaimed: "I am Christ." From these pools of sensuality and Satanic
   pride arose the malaria of a vast literature, of which, however,
   fortunately, nothing more than a few names has come down to us.

   § 119. Cultus and Organization.

   In cultus, the Gnostic docetism and hyper-spiritualism led consistently
   to naked intellectual simplicity; sometimes to the rejection of all
   sacraments and outward means of grace; if not even, as in the
   Prodicians, to blasphemous self-exaltation above all that is called God
   and worshiped. [822] 22

   But with this came also the opposite extreme of a symbolic and mystic
   pomp, especially in the sect of the Marcosians. These Marcosians held
   to a two-fold baptism, that applied to the human Jesus, the Messiah of
   the psychical, and that administered to the heavenly Christ, the
   Messiah of the spiritual; they decorated the baptistery like a
   banquet-hall; and they first introduced extreme unction. As early as
   the second century the Basilideans celebrated the feast of Epiphany.
   The Simonians and Carpocratians used images of Christ and of their
   religious heroes in their worship. The Valentinians and Ophites sang in
   hymns the deep longing of Achamoth for redemption from the bonds of
   Matter. Bardesanes is known as the first Syrian hymn-writer. Many
   Gnostics, following their patriarch, Simon, gave themselves to magic,
   and introduced their arts into their worship; as the Marcosians did in
   the celebration of the Lord's Supper.

   Of the outward organization of the Gnostics (with the exception of the
   Manichaeans, who will be treated separately), we can say little. Their
   aim was to resolve Christianity into a magnificent speculation; the
   practical business of organization was foreign to their exclusively
   intellectual bent. Tertullian charges them with an entire want of order
   and discipline. [823] 23 They formed, not so much a sect or party, as a
   multitude of philosophical schools, like the modern Rationalists. Many
   were unwilling to separate at all from the Catholic church, but assumed
   in it, as theosophists, the highest spiritual rank. Some were even
   clothed with ecclesiastical office, as we must no doubt infer from the
   Apostolic Canons (51 or 50), where it is said, with evident reference
   to the gloomy, perverse asceticism of the Gnostics: "If a bishop, a
   priest, or a deacon, or any ecclesiastic abstain from marriage, from
   flesh, or from wine, not for practice in self-denial, but from disgust,
   [824] 24 forgetting that God made everything very good, that he made
   also the male and the female, in fact, even blaspheming the creation;
   [825] 25 he shall either retract his error, or be deposed and cast out
   of the church. A layman also shall be treated in like manner." Here we
   perceive the polemical attitude which the Catholic church was compelled
   to assume even towards the better Gnostics.

   § 120. Schools of Gnosticism.

   The arbitrary and unbalanced subjectivity of the Gnostic speculation
   naturally produced a multitude of schools. These Gnostic schools have
   been variously classified.

   Geographically they may be reduced to two great families, the Egyptian
   or Alexandrian, and the Syrian, which are also intrinsically different.
   In the former (Basilides, Valentine, the Ophites), Platonism and the
   emanation theory prevail, in the latter (Saturninus, Bardesanes,
   Tatian), Parsism and dualism. Then, distinct in many respects from both
   these is the more practical school of Marcion, who sprang neither from
   Egypt nor from Syria, but from Asia Minor, where St. Paul had left the
   strong imprint of his free gospel in opposition to Jewish legalism and
   bondage.

   Examined further, with reference to its doctrinal character, Gnosticism
   appears in three forms, distinguished by the preponderance of the
   heathen, the Jewish, and the Christian elements respectively in its
   syncretism. The Simonians, Nicolaitans, Ophites, Carpocratians,
   Prodicians, Antitactes, and Manichaeans belong to a paganizing class;
   Cerinthus, Basilides, Valentine, and Justin (as also the
   Pseudo-Clementine Homilies, though these are more properly Ebionitic),
   to a Judaizing; Saturninus, Marcion, Tatian, and the Encratites, to a
   Christianizing division. But it must be remembered here that this
   distinction is only relative; all the Gnostic systems being, in fact,
   predominantly heathen in their character, and essentially opposed alike
   to the pure Judaism of the Old Testament and to the Christianity of the
   New. The Judaism of the so-called Judaizing Gnostics is only of an
   apocryphal sort, whether of the Alexandrian or the Cabalistic tinge.
   [826] 26

   The ethical point of view, from which the division might as well be
   made, would give likewise three main branches: the speculative or
   theosophic Gnostics (Basilides, Valentine), the practical and ascetic
   (Marcion, Saturninus, Tatian), and the antinomian and libertine
   (Simonians, Nicolaitans, Ophites, Carpocratians, Antitactes).

   Having thus presented the general character of Gnosticism, and pointed
   out its main branches, we shall follow chiefly the chronological order
   in describing the several schools, beginning with those which date from
   the age of the apostles.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [826] Gibbon, who devotes four pages (Ch. XV.) to the Gnostics, dwells
   exclusively on the anti-Jewish feature, and makes them express his own
   aversion to the Old Testament. He calls them (from very superficial
   knowledge, but with his masterly skill of insinuation) "the most
   polite, the most learned, and the most wealthy of the Christian name,"
   and says that, being mostly averse to the pleasures of sense, "they
   morosely arraigned the polygamy of the patriarchs, the gallantries of
   David, and the seraglio of Solomon," and were at a loss to reconcile
   "the conquest of Canaan, and the extirpation of the unsuspecting
   natives with the common notions of humanity and justice."

   § 121. Simon Magus and the Simonians.

   I. Commentaries on Acts 8:9-24. Justin Martyr: Apol. I. 26 and 56. The
   pseudo-Clementine Homilies and Recognitions. Irenaeus, I. 23.
   Hippolytus, VI. 2-15, etc.

   II. Simson: Leben und Lehre Simon des Magiers, in the "Zeitschrift für
   hist. Theologie" for 1841.

   Hilgenfeld: Der Magier Simon, in the "Zeischrift für wissenschaftl.
   Theologie" for 1868.

   Lipsius: Simon d. Mag. in Schenkel's "Bibel-Lexikon," vol. V. (1875),
   p. 301-321. Comp. the literature quoted there, p. 320.

   Simon Magus is a historical character known to us from the eighth
   chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. [827] 27 He was probably a native
   of Gitthon, in Samaria, as Justin Martyr, himself a Samaritan, reports;
   [828] 28 but he may nevertheless be identical with the contemporaneous
   Jewish magician of the same name, whom Josephus mentions as a native of
   Cyprus and as a friend of Procurator Felix, who employed him to
   alienate Drusilla, the beautiful wife of king Azizus of Emesa, in
   Syria, from her husband, that he might marry her. [829] 29

   Simon represented himself as a sort of emanation of the deity ("the
   Great Power of God"), [830] 30 made a great noise among the half-pagan,
   half-Jewish Samaritans by his sorceries, was baptized by Philip about
   the year 40, but terribly rebuked by Peter for hypocrisy and abuse of
   holy things to sordid ends. [831] 31 He thus affords the first instance
   in church history of a confused syncretism in union with magical arts;
   and so far as this goes, the church fathers are right in styling him
   the patriarch, or, in the words of Irenaeus, the "magister" and
   progenitor" of all heretics, and of the Gnostics in particular. Besides
   him, two other contemporaneous Samaritans, Dositheus and Menander, bore
   the reputation of heresiarchs. Samaria was a fertile soil of religious
   syncretism even before Christ, and the natural birth-place of that
   syncretistic heresy which goes by the name of Gnosticism.

   The wandering life and teaching of Simon were fabulously garnished in
   the second and third centuries by Catholics and heretics, but
   especially by the latter in the interest of Ebionism and with bitter
   hostility to Paul. In the pseudo-Clementine romances he represents all
   anti-Jewish heresies. Simon the Magician is contrasted, as the apostle
   of falsehood, with Simon Peter, the apostle of truth; he follows him,
   as darkness follows the light, from city to city, in company with
   Helena (who had previously been a prostitute at Tyre, but was now
   elevated to the dignity of divine intelligence); he is refuted by Peter
   in public disputations at Caesarea, Antioch, and Rome; at last he is
   ignominiously defeated by him after a mock-resurrection and
   mock-ascension before the Emperor Nero; he ends with suicide, while
   Peter gains the crown of martyrdom. [832] 32 There is a bare
   possibility that, like other heretics and founders of sects, he may
   have repaired to Rome (before Peter); but Justin Martyr's account of
   the statue of Simon is certainly a mistake. [833] 33

   The Gnosticism which Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and other fathers ascribe to
   this Simon and his followers is crude, and belongs to the earlier phase
   of this heresy. It was embodied in a work entitled "The Great
   Announcement" or "Proclamation" [834] 34 of which Hippolytus gives an
   analysis. [835] 35 The chief ideas are the "great power," "the great
   idea," the male and female principle. He declared himself an
   incarnation of the creative world-spirit, and his female companion,
   Helena, the incarnation of the receptive world-soul. Here we have the
   Gnostic conception of the syzygy.

   The sect of the Simonians, which continued into the third century, took
   its name, if not its rise, from Simon Magus, worshipped him as a
   redeeming genius, chose, like the Cainites, the most infamous
   characters of the Old Testament for its heroes, and was immoral in its
   principles and practices. The name, however, is used in a very
   indefinite sense, for various sorts of Gnostics.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [827] The Tübingen school, which denies the historical character of the
   Acts, resolves also the story of Simon into a Jewish Christian fiction,
   aimed at the apostle Paul as the real heretic and magician. So Baur,
   Zeller, and Volkmar. Lipsius ingeniously carries out this Simon-Paul
   hypothesis, and declares (I. c. p. 303): "Der Kern der Sage ist niches
   als ein vollständig ausgeführtes Zerrbild des Heidenapostels, dessen
   Zäge bis in's einzelne hinein die Person, die Lehre, und die
   Lebenschicksale des Paulus persifliren sollen." But the book of Acts
   gives the earliest record of Simon and is the production, if not of
   Luke, as we believe with the unanimous testimony of antiquity, at all
   events of a writer friendly to Paul, and therefore utterly unlikely to
   insert an anti-Pauline fiction which would stultify the greater part of
   his own book. Comp. the remarks above, §114, p. 438.

   [828] Apol. I, 26 (Simona men tina Samarea, ton apo komes legomenes
   Gitton); comp. Clem. Hom. I. 15; II. 22 (apo Gitthon); Hippol. Philos.
   VI. 7 (ho Gittenos).There was such a place as Gittai, not far from
   Flavia Neapolis (Nablus), Justin's birthplace. It is now called Kuryet
   Jît (Dschit). See Robinson's Pal. II. 308, and Otto's note on the
   passage in Justin (Opera I. 78).

   [829] According to Josephus, Ant. XX. 7, 2. The identity is assumed by
   Neander, De Wette, Hilgenfeld. There was on the island of Cyprus a city
   named Kition (Thucyd. I. 112, 1), which Justin M. may possibly have
   confounded with Gitthon, in Samaria, as he confounded Simo and Semo on
   the statue in Rome. But it is much more likely that Josephus was
   mistaken on a question of Samaria than Justin, a native of Flavia
   Neapolis (the ancient Shechem).

   [830] he Dunamis tou theou he Megale, Acts 8:10. According to the
   Clementine Homilies (II. 22) and Recognitions (II.7), Simon called
   himself " the Supreme Power of God"(anotate dunamis ,Virtus Suprema).

   [831] The memory of this incident is perpetuated in the name of simony
   for profane traffic in ecclesiastical offices.

   [832] The legendary accounts, both catholic and heretical, vary
   considerably. Justin M. reports Simon's visit to Rome, but assigns it
   to the reign of Claudius (41-54), and says nothing of an encounter with
   Peter. Other reports put the journey in the reign of Nero (54-68).
   According to Hippolytus, Simon was buried alive at his own request,
   being confident of rising again on the third day, as a pseudo-Christ.
   According to the Apostolical Constitutions, he attempted to fly, but
   fell and broke his thigh and ankle-bone in answer to the prayers of
   Peter, and died in consequence of this injury. According to Arnobius,
   he attempted to ascend in a fiery chariot, like Elijah, but broke his
   leg, and in the confusion of shame committed suicide by throwing
   himself from a high mountain. See Lipsius, l.c. p. 310.

   [833] He reports (Apol. I26 and 56) that Simon Magus made such an
   impression by his magical arts upon the Roman Senate and people that
   they paid him divine homage, and erected a statue to him on the island
   of the Tiber. But he mistook Semo Sancus or Sangus, a Sabine-Roman
   divinity unknown to him, for Simo Sanctus. For in 1574 a statue was
   found in the place described, with the inscription: Semoni Sanco Deo
   Fidio sacrum, etc. The mistake is repeated by Irenaeus Adv. Hoer. I.
   23, 1, Tertullian Apol. 13, and Eusebius, but Hippolytus who resided at
   Rome does not mention it. See Otto's note on Just. I. 26, Opera I. 79

   § 122. The Nicolaitans.

   Irenaeus: Adv. Haer. I. 26, 3; Clement Of Alex.: Strom. III. 4 (and in
   Euseb. H. E. III. 29); Hippolytus: Philos. VII. 24; Epiphanius: Haer.
   I. 2, 25.

   The Nicolaitans are mentioned as a licentious sect in the Apocalypse
   2:6, 15. They claimed as their founder Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch
   and one of the seven deacons of the congregation of Jerusalem (Acts
   6:5). He is supposed to have apostatized from the true faith, and
   taught the dangerous principle that the flesh must be abused, [836] 36
   that is, at least as understood by his disciples, one must make the
   whole round of sensuality, to become its perfect master.

   But the views of the fathers are conflicting. Irenaeus (who is followed
   substantially by Hippolytus) gives a very unfavorable account.

   "The Nicolaitanes," he says, "are the followers of that Nicolas who was
   one of the seven first ordained to the diaconate by the apostles. They
   lead lives of unrestrained indulgence. The character of these men is
   very plainly pointed out in the Apocalypse of John, where they are
   represented as teaching that it is a matter of indifference to practice
   adultery, and to eat things sacrificed to idols. Wherefore the Word has
   also spoken of them thus: 'But this thou hast, that thou hatest the
   deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.' "

   Clement of Alexandria says that Nicolas was a faithful husband, and
   brought up his children in purity, but that his disciples misunderstood
   his saying (which he attributes also to the Apostle Matthias), "that we
   must fight against the flesh and abuse it." [837] 37

   [837] He adds the curious statement (Strom. III.c. 4) that on a certain
   occasion Nicolas was sharply reproved by the Apostles as a jealous
   husband, and repelled the charge by offering to allow his beautiful
   wife to become the wife of any other person. Extremely improbable.

   Cerinthus [838] 38 appeared towards the close of the first century in
   Asia Minor, and came in conflict with the aged Apostle John, who is
   supposed by Irenaeus to have opposed his Gnostic ideas in the Gospel
   and Epistles. The story that John left a public bath when he saw
   Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, fearing that the bath might fall in,
   and the similar story of Polycarp meeting Marcion and calling him "the
   first born of Satan," reveal the intense abhorrence with which the
   orthodox churchmen of those days looked upon heresy. [839] 39

   Cerinthus was (according to the uncertain traditions collected by
   Epiphanius) an Egyptian and a Jew either by birth or conversion,
   studied in the school of Philo in Alexandria, was one of the false
   apostles who opposed Paul and demanded circumcision (Gal. 2:4; 2 Cor.
   11:13), claimed to have received angelic revelations, travelled through
   Palestine and Galatia, and once came to Ephesus. The time of his death
   is unknown.

   His views, as far as they can be ascertained from confused accounts,
   assign him a position between Judaism and Gnosticism proper. He
   rejected all the Gospels except a mutilated Matthew, taught the
   validity of the Mosaic law and the millennial kingdom. He was so far
   strongly Judaistic, and may be counted among the Ebionites; but in true
   Gnostic style he distinguished the world-maker from God, and
   represented the former as a subordinate power, as an intermediate,
   though not exactly hostile, being. In his Christology he separates the
   earthly man Jesus, who was a son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly
   Christ, [840] 40 who descended upon the man Jesus in the form of a dove
   at the baptism in the Jordan, imparted to him the genuine knowledge of
   God and the power of miracles, but forsook him in the passion, to
   rejoin him only at the coming of the Messianic kingdom of glory. The
   school of Valentine made more clearly the same distinction between the
   Jesus of the Jews and the divine Saviour, or the lower and the higher
   Christ--a crude anticipation of the modern distinction (of Strauss)
   between the Christ of history and the Christ of faith. The millennium
   has its centre in Jerusalem, and will be followed by the restoration of
   all things. [841] 41

   The Alogi, an obscure anti-trinitarian and anti-chiliastic sect of the
   second century, regarded Cerinthus as the author of the Apocalypse of
   John on account of the chiliasm taught in it. They ascribed to him also
   the fourth Gospel, although it is the best possible refutation of all
   false Gnosticism from the highest experimental Gnosis of faith.

   Simon Magus, the Nicolaitans and Cerinthus belong to the second half of
   the first century. We now proceed to the more developed systems of
   Gnosticism, which belong to the first half of the second century, and
   continued to flourish till the middle of the third.

   The most important and influential of these systems bear the names of
   Basilides, Valentinus, and Marcion. They deserve, therefore, a fuller
   consideration. They were nearly contemporaneous, and matured during the
   reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. Basilides flourished in
   Alexandria a.d. 125; Valentine came to Rome in 140; Marcion taught in
   Rome between 140 and 150.

   Basilides (Basileides) produced the first well-developed system of
   Gnosis; but it was too metaphysical and intricate to be popular. He
   claimed to be a disciple of the apostle Matthias and of an interpreter
   (hermeneus) of St. Peter, named Glaucias. He taught in Alexandria
   during the reign of Hadrian (A. D. 117-138). His early youth fell in
   the second generation of Christians, and this gives his quotations from
   the writings of the New Testament considerable apologetic value. He
   wrote (according to his opponent, Agrippa Castor) "twenty-four books
   (biblia) on the Gospel." This work was probably a commentary on the
   canonical Gospels, for Clement of Alexandria quotes from "the
   thirty-third book" of a work of Basilides which he calls Exegetica."
   [842] 42

   His doctrine is very peculiar, especially according to the extended and
   original exhibition of it in the "Philosophumena." Hippolytus deviates
   in many respects from the statements of Irenaeus and Epiphanius, but
   derived his information probably from the works of Basilides himself,
   and he therefore must be chiefly followed. [843] 43 The system is based
   on the Egyptian astronomy and the Pythagorean numerical symbolism. It
   betrays also the influence of Aristotle; but Platonism, the
   emanation-theory, and dualism do not appear.

   Basilides is monotheistic rather than dualistic in his primary idea,
   and so far differs from the other Gnostics, though later accounts make
   him a dualist. He starts from the most abstract notion of the absolute,
   to which he denies even existence, thinking of it as infinitely above
   all that can be imagined and conceived. [844] 44 This ineffable and
   unnamable God, [845] 45 not only super-existent, but non-existent,
   [846] 46 first forms by his creative word (not by emanation) the
   world-seed or world-embryo, [847] 47 that is, chaos, from which the
   world develops itself according to arithmetical relations, in an
   unbroken order, like the branches and leaves of the tree from the
   mustard seed, or like the many-colored peacock from the egg. Everything
   created tends upwards towards God, who, himself unmoved, moves all,
   [848] 48 and by the charm of surpassing beauty attracts all to himself.

   In the world-seed Basilides distinguishes three kinds of sonship, [849]
   49 of the same essence with the non-existent God, but growing weaker in
   the more remote gradations; or three races of children of God, a
   pneumatic, a psychic, and a hylic. The first sonship liberates itself
   immediately from the world-seed, rises with the lightning-speed of
   thought to God, and remains there as the blessed spirit-world, the
   Pleroma. It embraces the seven highest genii, [850] 50 which, in union
   with the great Father, form the first ogdoad, the type of all the lower
   circles of creation. The second sonship, with the help of the Holy
   Spirit, whom it produces, and who bears it up, as the wing bears the
   bird, strives to follow the first, [851] 51 but can only attain the
   impenetrable firmament, [852] 52 that is the limit of the Pleroma, and
   could endure the higher region no more than the fish the mountain air.
   The third sonship, finally, remains fixed in the world-seed, and in
   need of purification and redemption.

   Next Basilides makes two archons or world-rulers (demiurges) issue from
   the world-seed. The first or great archon, whose greatness and beauty
   and power cannot be uttered, creates the ethereal world or the upper
   heaven, the ogdoad, as it is called; the second is the maker and ruler
   of the lower planetary heaven below the moon, the hebdomad. Basilides
   supposed in all three hundred and sixty-five heavens or circles of
   creation, [853] 53 corresponding to the days of the year, and
   designated them by the mystic name Abrasax, or Abraxas, [854] 54 which,
   according to the numerical value of the Greek letters, is equal to 365.
   [855] 55 This name also denotes the great archon or ruler of the 365
   heavens. It afterwards came to be used as a magical formula, with all
   sorts of strange figures, the "Abraxas gems," of which many are still
   extant.

   Each of the two archons, however, according to a higher ordinance,
   begets a son, who towers far above his father, communicates to him the
   knowledge received from the Holy Spirit, concerning the upper
   spirit-world and the plan of redemption, and leads him to repentance.
   With this begins the process of the redemption or return of the sighing
   children of God, that is, the pneumatics, to the supra-mundane God.
   This is effected by Christianity, and ends with the consummation, or
   apokatastasis of all things. Like Valentine, Basilides also properly
   held a threefold Christ--the son of the first archon, the son of the
   second archon, and the son of Mary. But all these are at bottom the
   same principle, which reclaims the spiritual natures from the
   world-seed to the original unity. The passion of Christ was necessary
   to remove the corporeal and psychical elements, which he brought with
   him from the primitive medley and confusion (sunchusis archike). His
   body returned, after death, into shapelessness (amorphia); his soul
   rose from the grave, and stopped in the hebdomad, or planetary heaven,
   where it belongs; but his spirit soared, perfectly purified, above all
   the spheres of creation, to the blessed first sonship (huiotes) and the
   fellowship of the non-existent or hyper-existent God.

   In the same way with Jesus, the first-fruits, all other pneumatic
   persons must rise purified to the place where they by nature belong,
   and abide there. For all that continues in its place is imperishable;
   but all that transgresses its natural limits is perishable. Basilides
   quotes the passage of Paul concerning the groaning and travailing of
   the creation expecting the revelation of the sons of God (Rom. 8:19).
   In the process of redemption he conceded to faith (pistis) more
   importance than most of the Gnostics, and his definition of faith was
   vaguely derived from Hebrews 11:1.

   In his moral teaching Basilides inculcated a moderate asceticism, from
   which, however, his school soon departed. He used some of Paul's
   Epistles and the canonical Gospels; quoting for example, John 1:9 ("The
   true light, which enlightens every man, was coming into the world"), to
   identify his idea of the world seed with John's doctrine of the Logos
   is the light of the world. [856] 56 The fourth Gospel was much used and
   commented upon also by the Ophites, Perates, and Valentinians before
   the middle of the second century. The Gnostics were alternately
   attracted by the mystic Gnosis of that Gospel (especially the
   Prologue), and repelled by its historic realism, and tried to make the
   best use of it. They acknowledged it, because they could not help it.
   The other authorities of Basilides were chiefly the secret tradition of
   the apostle Matthias, and of a pretended interpreter of Peter, by the
   name of Glaucias.

   His son Isidore was the chief, we may say the only important one, of
   his disciples. He composed a system of ethics and other books, from
   which Clement of Alexandria has preserved a few extracts. The
   Basilidians, especially in the West, seem to have been dualistic and
   docetic in theory, and loose, even dissolute in practice. They
   corrupted and vulgarized the high-pitched and artificial system of the
   founder. The whole life of Christ was to them a mere sham. It was Simon
   of Cyrene who was crucified; Jesus exchanged forms with him on the way,
   and, standing unseen opposite in Simon's form, mocked those who
   crucified him, and then ascended to heaven. They held it prudent to
   repudiate Christianity in times of persecution, regarding the noble
   confession of martyrs as costing dearly before swine, and practiced
   various sorts of magic, in which the Abraxas gems did them service. The
   spurious Basilidian sect maintained itself in Egypt till the end of the
   fourth century, but does not seem to have spread beyond, except that
   Marcus, a native of Memphis, is reported by Sulpicius Severus to have
   brought some of its doctrines to Spain.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [842] Comp. Euseb. Hist. Eccl. IV. 7 and Clem. Alex. Strom. IV. 12. p.
   599 sq. Origen (Hom. in Luc. I: 1) says that Basilides "had the
   audacity (etolmesen) to write a Gospel according to Basilides;" but he
   probably mistook the commentary for an apocryphal Gospel. Hippolytus
   expressly asserts that Basilides, in his account of all things
   concerning the Saviour after "the birth of Jesus" agreed with "the
   Gospels."

   [843] The prevailing opinion is that Hippolytus gives the system of
   Basilides himself, Irenaeus that of his school. So Jacobi, Uhlhorn,
   Baur, Schaff (first ed.), Möller, Mansel, Hort. The opposite view is
   defended by Hilgenfeld, Lipsius, Volkmar and Scholten. The reasoning of
   Hort in favor of the former view, l.c. p. 269 sq., is based on the
   extracts of Clement of Alex. from the exegetika of Basilides. He
   assumes the priority of the Valentinian system, from which Basilides
   proceeded to construct his own by contrast. But history puts Valentinus
   about a decade later.

   [844] Herein, as already remarked, be resembles Hegel, who likewise
   begins with the idea of absolute non-entity, and reconstructs the
   universe ex nihilo. In both systems "nothing" must be understood in a
   non-natural sense, as opposed to all definite, concrete being or form
   of existence. It is in fact identical with the most abstract conception
   of pure being. Nichts ist sein, and Sein ist Nichts, but, set in motion
   by a dialectic process, they produce the Werden, and the werden results
   in Dasein. And here again the latest German philosophy meets with the
   oldest Hindu mythology. See the note on p. 453.

   inclined to think that the engravers of the Abrasax gems and the
   Basilidians received the mystic name from an older common source. Dr.
   Hort suggests the derivation from Ab-razach, Ab-zarach, i.e. "the

   Movers, Serach was a Phoenician name for Adonist, whose worship was

   formula "according to them (kat' autous). The joint testimony of these

   the heathen Celsus) is overwhelming against the Tübingen hypothesis of

   Valentinus or Valentine [857] 57 is the author of the most profound and
   luxuriant, as well as the most influential and best known of the
   Gnostic systems. Irenaeus directed his work chiefly against it, and we
   have made it the basis of our general description of Gnosticism. [858]
   58 He founded a large school, and spread his doctrines in the West. He
   claimed to have derived them from Theodas or Theudas, a pupil of St.
   Paul. [859] 59 He also pretended to have received revelations from the
   Logos in a vision. Hippolytus calls him a Platonist and Pythagorean
   rather than a Christian. He was probably of Egyptian Jewish descent and
   Alexandrian education. [860] 60 Tertullian reports, perhaps from his
   own conjecture, that he broke with the orthodox church from
   disappointed ambition, not being made a bishop. [861] 61 Valentine came
   to Rome as a public teacher during the pontificate of Hyginus
   (137-142), and remained there till the pontificate of Anicetus (154).
   [862] 62 He was then already celebrated; for Justin Martyr, in his lost
   "Syntagma against all Heresies," which he mentions in his "First
   Apology" (140), combated the Valentinians among other heretics before
   a.d. 140. At that time Rome had become the centre of the church and the
   gathering place of all sects. Every teacher who wished to exercise a
   general influence on Christendom naturally looked to the metropolis.
   Valentine was one of the first Gnostics who taught in Rome, about the
   same time with Cerdo and Marcion; but though he made a considerable
   impression by his genius and eloquence, the orthodoxy of the church and
   the episcopal authority were too firmly settled to allow of any great
   success for his vagaries. He was excommunicated, and went to Cyprus,
   where he died about a.d. 160.

   His system is an ingenious theogonic and cosmogonic epos. It describes
   in three acts the creation, the fall, and the redemption; first in
   heaven, then on earth. Great events repeat themselves in different
   stages of being. He derived his material from his own fertile
   imagination, from Oriental and Greek speculations, and from Christian
   ideas. He made much use of the Prologue of John's Gospel and the
   Epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians; but by a wild exegesis he put
   his own pantheistic and mythological fancies into the apostolic words,
   such as Logos, Only Begotten, Truth, Life, Pleroma, Ecclesia.

   Valentine starts from the eternal primal Being, which he significantly
   calls Bythos or Abyss. [863] 63 It is the fathomless depth in which the
   thinking mind is lost, the ultimate boundary beyond which it cannot
   pass. The Bythos is unbegotten, infinite, invisible, incomprehensible,
   nameless, the absolute agnoston; yet capable of evolution and
   development, the universal Father of all beings. He continues for
   immeasurable ages in silent contemplation of his own boundless
   grandeur, glory, and beauty. This "Silence" or "Solitude" (he sige) is
   his Spouse or suzugos. It is the silent self-contemplation, the
   slumbering consciousness of the Infinite. He also calls it "Thought"
   (ennoia), and "Grace" (charis). [864] 64 The pre-mundane Bythos
   includes, therefore, at least according to some members of the school,
   the female as well as the male principle; for from the male principle
   alone nothing could spring. According to Hippolytus, Valentine derived
   this sexual duality from the essential nature of love, and said: "God
   is all love; but love is not love except there is some object of
   affection." [865] 65 He grappled here with a pre-mundane mystery, which
   the Orthodox theology endeavors to solve by the doctrine of the
   immanent eternal trinity in the divine essence: God is love, therefore
   God is triune: a loving subject, a beloved object, and a union of the
   two. "Ubi amor, ibi trinitas."

   After this eternal silence, God enters upon a process of evolution or
   emanation, i.e. a succession of generations of antithetic and yet
   supplementary ideas or principles. From the Abyss emanate thirty aeons
   in fifteen pairs, [866] 66 according to the law of sexual polarity, in
   three generations, the first called the ogdoad, the second the decad,
   the third the dodecad. The Aeons are the unfolded powers and attributes
   of the divinity. They correspond to the dynameis in the system of
   Basilides. God begets first the masculine, productive Mind or Reason
   (ho nous), [867] 67 with the feminine, receptive Truth (he aletheia);
   these two produce the Word (ho logos) and the Life (he zoe), and these
   again the (ideal) Man (ho anthropos) and the (ideal) Church (he
   ekklesia). The influence of the fourth Gospel is unmistakable here,
   though of course the terminology of John is used in a sense different
   from that of its author. The first two syzygies constitute the sacred
   Tetraktys, the root of all things. [868] 68 The Nous and the Aletheia
   produce ten aeons (five pairs); the Logos and the Zoë, twelve aeons
   (six pairs). At last the Nous or Monogenes and the Aletheia bring forth
   the heavenly Christ (ho ano Christos) and the (female) Holy Spirit (to
   pneuma hagion), and therewith complete the number thirty. These aeons
   constitute together the Pleroma, the plenitude of divine powers, an
   expression which St. Paul applied to the historical Christ (Col. 2:9).
   They all partake in substance of the life of the Abyss; but their form
   is conditioned by the Horos (horos), the limiting power of God. This
   genius of limitation stands between the Pleroma and the Hysterema
   outside, and is the organizing power of the universe, and secures
   harmony. [869] 69 If any being dares to transcend its fixed boundaries
   and to penetrate beyond revelation into the hidden being of God, it is
   in danger of sinking into nothing. Two actions are ascribed to the
   Horos, a negative by which he limits every being and sunders from it
   foreign elements, and the positive by which he forms and establishes
   it. [870] 70 The former action is emphatically called Horos, the latter
   is called Stauros (cross, post), because he stands firm and immovable,
   the guardian of the Aeons, so that nothing can come from the Hysterema
   into the neighborhood of the aeons in the Pleroma.

   The process of the fall and redemption takes place first in the ideal
   world of the Pleroma, and is then repeated in the lower world. In this
   process the lower Wisdom or Sophia, also called Achamoth or Chakmuth
   plays an important part. [871] 71 She is the mundane soul, a female
   aeon, the weakest and most remote member of the series of aeons (in
   number the twenty-eighth), and forms, so to speak, the bridge which
   spans the abyss between God and the real world. Feeling her loneliness
   and estrangement from the great Father, she wishes to unite herself
   immediately, without regard to the intervening links, with him who is
   the originating principle of the universe, and alone has the power of
   self-generation. She jumps, as it were by a single bound, into the
   depth of the eternal Father, and brings forth of herself alone an
   abortion (ektroma), a formless and inchoate substance, [872] 72 of
   which Moses speaks when he says: "The earth was without form and void."
   By this sinful passion she introduces confusion and disturbance into
   the Pleroma. [873] 73 She wanders about outside of it, and suffers with
   fear, anxiety, and despair on account of her abortion. This is the
   fall; an act both free and necessary.

   But Sophia yearns after redemption; the aeons sympathize with her
   sufferings and aspirations; the eternal Father himself commands the
   projection of the last pair of aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, "for
   the restoration of Form, the destruction of the abortion, and for the
   consolation and cessation of the groans of Sophia." They comfort and
   cheer the Sophia, and separate the abortion from the Pleroma. At last,
   the thirty aeons together project in honor of the Father the aeon Soter
   or Jesus, "the great High Priest," "the Joint Fruit of the Pleroma,"
   and "send him forth beyond the Pleroma as a Spouse for Sophia, who was
   outside, and as a rectifier of those sufferings which she underwent in
   searching after Christ." After many sufferings, Sophia is purged of all
   passions and brought back as the bride of Jesus, together with all
   pneumatic natures, into the ideal world. The demiurge, the fiery and
   jealous God of the Jews, as "the friend of the bridegroom," [874] 74
   with the psychical Christians on the border of the Pleroma, remotely
   shares the joy of the festival, while matter sinks back into nothing.

   In Valentine's Christology, we must distinguish properly three
   redeeming beings: (1) The ano Christos or heavenly Christ, who, after
   the fall of Sophia, emanates from the aeon monogenes, and stands in
   conjunction with the female principle, the pneuma hagion. He makes the
   first announcement to the aeons of the plan of redemption, whereupon
   they strike up anthems of praise and thanksgiving in responsive choirs.
   (2) The soter or Iesous, produced by all the aeons together, the star
   of the Pleroma. He forms with the redeemed Sophia the last and highest
   syzygy. (3) The kato Christos, the psychical or Jewish Messiah, who is
   sent by the Demiurge, passes through the body of Mary as water through
   a pipe, and is at last crucified by the Jews, but, as he has merely an
   apparent body, does not really suffer. With him Soter, the proper
   redeemer, united himself in the baptism in the Jordan, to announce his
   divine gnosis on earth for a year, and lead the pneumatic persons to
   perfection.

   Notes.

   Dr. Baur, the great critical historian of ancient Gnosticism and the
   master spirit of modern Gnosticism, ingeniously reproduces the
   Valentinian system in Hegelian terminology. I quote the chief part, as
   a fair specimen of his historic treatment, from his Kirchengeschichte,
   vol. I. 201 sqq. (comp. his Gnosis, p. 124 sqq.):

   "Der Geist, oder Gott als der Geist an sich, geht aus sich heraus, in
   dieser Sebstoffenbarung Gottes entsteht die Welt, die in ihrem
   Unterschied von Gott auch wieder an sich mit Gott eins ist. Wie man
   aber auch dieses immanente Verhältniss von Gott und Welt betrachten
   mag, als Selbstoffenbarung Gottes oder als Weltentwicklung, es ist an
   sich ein rein geistiger, im Wesen des Geistes begründeter Process. Der
   Geist stellt in den Aeonen, die er aus sich hervorgehen lässt, sein
   eigenes Wesen aus sich heraus und sich gegenüber; da aber das Wesen des
   Geistes an sich das Denken und Wissen ist, so kann der Process seiner
   Selbstoffenbarung nur darin bestehen, dass er sich dessen bewusst ist,
   was er an sich ist. Die Aeonen des Pleroma sind die höchsten Begriffe
   des geistigen Seins und Lebens, die allgemeinen Denkformen, in welchen
   der Geist das, was er an sich ist, in bestimmter concreter Weise für
   das Bewusstsein ist. Mit dem Wissen des Geistes von sich, dem
   Selbstbewusstsein des sich von sich unterscheidenden Geistes, ist aber
   auch schon nicht blos ein Princip der Differenzirung, sondern, da Gott
   und Welt an sich Eins sind, auch ein Princip der Materialisirung des
   Geistes gesetzt. Je grösser der Abstand der das Bewusstsein des Geistes
   vermittelnden Begriffe von dem absolutes Princip ist, um so mehr ver
   dunkelt sich das geistige Bewusstsein, der Geiste, entäussert sich
   seiner selbst, er ist sich selbst nicht mehr klar und durchsichtig, das
   Pneumatische sinkt zum Prychischen herab, das Psychische verdichtet
   sich zum Materiellen, und mit dem Materiellen verbindet sich in seinem
   Extrem auch der Begriff des Dämonischen und Diabolischen. Da aber auch
   das psychische an sich pneumatischer Natur ist, und Keime des geistigen
   Lebens überall zurückgeblieben sind, so muss das Pneumatische die
   materielle Verdunklung des geistigen Bewusstseins auf der Stufe des
   psychischen Lebens wieder durchbrechen und die Decke abwerfen, die in
   der Welt des Demurg auf dem Bewusstsein des Geistes liegt. Die ganze
   Weltentwicklung ist die Continuität desselben geisigen Processes, es
   muss daher auch einen Wendepunkt geben, in welchem der Geist aus seiner
   Selbstentäuserung zu sich selbst zurückkehrt und wieder zum klaren
   Bewusstsein dessen, was er an sich ist, kommt. Dies ist der gnostische
   Begriff der christlichen Offenbarung. Die Wissenden im Sinne der
   Gnostiker, die Pneumatischen, die als solche auch das wahrhaft
   christliche Bewusstsein in, sich haben, sind ein neues Moment des
   allgemeinen geistigen Lebens, die höchste Stufe der Selbstoffenbarung
   Gottes und der Weltentwicklung. Diese Periode des Weltverlaufs beginnt
   mit der Erscheinung Christi und endet zuletzt damit, dass durch
   Christus und die Sophia alles Geistige in das Pleroma wieder
   aufgenommen wird. Da Christus, wie auf jeder Stufe der Weltentwicklung,
   so auch schon in den höchsten Regionen der Aeonenwelt, in welcher alles
   seinem Ausgangspunkt hat, and von Anfang an auf dieses Reultant des
   Ganzen angelegt ist, als das wiederherstellende, in der Einheit mit dem
   Absolutn erhaltende Princip thätig ist, so hat er in der Waltanschauung
   der Gnostiker durchaus die Bedeutung eines absolutn Weltprincips."

   § 126. The School of Valentinus. Heracleon, Ptolemy, Marcos,
   Bardesanes, Harmonius.

   Of all the forms of Gnosticism, that of Valentinus was the most popular
   and influential, more particularly in Rome. He had a large number of
   followers, who variously modified his system. Tertullian says, his
   heresy "fashioned itself into as many shapes as a courtesan who usually
   changes and adjusts her dress every day."

   The school of Valentinus divided chiefly into two branches, an
   Oriental, [875] 75 and an Italian. The first, in which Hippolytus
   reckons one Axionicos, not otherwise known, and Ardesianes (Ardesianes,
   probably the, same with Bardesanes), held the body of Jesus to be
   pneumatic and heavenly, because the Holy Spirit, i.e. Sophia and the
   demiurgic power of the Highest, came upon Mary. The Italian
   school--embracing Heracleon and Ptolemy --taught that the body of Jesus
   was psychial, and that for this reason the Spirit descended upon him in
   the baptism. Some Valentinians came nearer the orthodox view, than
   their master.

   Heracleon was personally instructed by Valentine, and probably
   flourished between 170 and 180 somewhere in Italy. He has a special
   interest as the earliest known commentator of the Gospel of John.
   Origen, in commenting on the same book, has preserved us about fifty
   fragments, usually contradicting them. They are chiefly taken from the
   first two, the fourth, and the eighth chapters. [876] 76 Heracleon
   fully acknowledges the canonical authority of the fourth Gospel, but
   reads his own system into it. He used the same allegorical method, as
   Origen, who even charges him with adhering too much to the letter, and
   not going deep enough into the spiritual sense. He finds in John the
   favorite Valentinian ideas of logos, life, light, love, conflict with
   darkness, and mysteries in all the numbers, but deprives the facts of
   historical realness. The woman of Samaria, in the fourth chapter,
   represents the redemption of the Sophia; the water of Jacob's well is
   Judaism; her husband is her spiritual bridegroom from the Pleroma; her
   former husbands are the Hyle or kingdom of the devil. The nobleman in
   Capernaum (John 4:47) is the Demiurge, who is not hostile, but
   short-sighted and ignorant, yet ready to implore the Saviour's help for
   his subjects; the nobleman's son represents the psychics, who will be
   healed and redeemed when their ignorance is removed. The fact that
   John's Gospel was held in equal reverence by the Valentinians and the
   orthodox, strongly favors its early existence before their separation,
   and its apostolic origin. [877] 77

   Ptolemy is the author of the Epistle to Flora, a wealthy Christian
   lady, whom he tried to convert to the Valentinian system. [878] 78 He
   deals chiefly with the objection that the creation of the world and the
   Old Testament could not proceed from the highest God. He appeals to an
   apostolic tradition and to the words of Christ, who alone knows the
   Father of all and first revealed him (John 1:18). God is the only good
   (Matt. 19:17), and hence he cannot be the author of a world in which
   there is so much evil. Irenaeus derived much of his information from
   the contemporary followers of Ptolemy.

   Another disciple of Valentine, Marcos, who taught likewise in the
   second half of the second century, probably in Asia Minor, perhaps also
   in Gaul, blended a Pythagorean and Cabbalistic numerical symbolism with
   the ideas of his master, introduced a ritual abounding in ceremonies,
   and sought to attract beautiful and wealthy women by magical arts. His
   followers were called Marcosians. [879] 79

   The name of Colarbasus, which is often connected with Marcos, must be
   stricken from the list of the Gnostics; for it originated in
   confounding the Hebrew Kol-Arba, "the Voice of Four," i.e. the divine
   Tetrad at the head of the Pleroma, with a person. [880] 80

   Finally, in the Valentinian school is counted also Bardesanes or
   Bardaisan (son of Daisan, Bardesanes). [881] 81 He was a distinguished
   Syrian scholar and poet, and lived at the court of the prince of Edessa
   at the close of the second and in the early part of the third century.
   [882] 82 But he can scarcely be numbered among the Gnostics, except in
   a very wide sense. He was at first orthodox, according to Epiphanius,
   but became corrupted by contact with Valentinians. Eusebius, on the
   contrary, makes him begin a heretic and end in orthodoxy. He also
   reports, that Bardesanes wrote against the heresy of Marcion in the
   Syriac language. Probably he accepted the common Christian faith with
   some modifications and exercised freedom on speculative doctrines,
   which were not yet clearly developed in the Syrian church of that
   period. [883] 83 His numerous works are lost, with the exception of a
   "Dialogue on Fate," which has recently been published in full. [884] 84
   It is, however, of uncertain date, and shows no trace of the Gnostic
   mythology and dualism, ascribed to him. He or his son Harmonius (the
   accounts vary) is the father of Syrian hymnology, and composed a book
   of one hundred and fifty (after the Psalter), which were used on
   festivals, till they were superseded by the Orthodox hymns of St.
   Ephraem the Syrian, who retained the same metres and tunes. [885] 85 He
   enjoyed great reputation, and his sect is said to have spread to the
   Southern Euphrates, and even to China.

   His son Harmonius, of Edessa, followed in his steps. He is said to have
   studied philosophy at Athens. He shares with Bardesanes (as already
   remarked) the honor of being the father of Syrian hymnology.

   256-260 (very thorough).

   [882] Eusebius (IV. 30) and Jerome (De Vir. illutstr. 33), misled by
   the common confusion of the earlier and later Antonines, assign him to
   the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161-180), but according to the Chronicle
   of Edessa (Assemani, Bibl. Or. I. 389) He was born July 11, 155, and
   according to Barhebraeus (Chron. Eccl. ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, 1872, p.
   79) he died in 223, aged 68 years. Hilgenfeld, Jacobi and Hortl adopt
   the latter date.

   [883] Dr. Hort (p. 252) thinks that "there is no reason to suppose that
   Bardaisan rejected the. ordinary faith of Christians, as founded on the
   Gospels and the writings of the Apostles, except on isolated points."
   The varying modern constructions of his system on a Gnostic basis are
   all arbitrary.

   [884] Peri heimarmenes.It was formerly known only from a Greek extract
   in Eusebius's Proeparatio, Evang. (VI. 9, 10). The Syriac original was
   discovered among the Nitrian MSS of the British Museum, and published
   by Cureton, in Spicilegium Syriacum. London 1855, with an English
   translation and notes. Merx gives a German translation with notes (p.
   25-55). The treatise is either identical with the Book of the Laws of
   Countries, or an extract from it. Dr. Hort doubts its genuineness.

   [885] Ephraem the Syrian speaks of a book of 150 hymns, by which
   Bardesanes list had beguiled the people, and makes no mention of
   Harmonius; but Sozomen and Theodoret report that Harmonius was the
   first to adapt the Syrian language to metrical formal, and music, and
   that his hymns and times were used till the time of Ephraem. Dr. Hort
   explains this contradiction, which has not received sufficient
   attention, by supposing that the book of hymns was really written by
   Harmonius, perhaps in his father's lifetime, and at his suggestion. But
   it is equally possible that Bardesanes was the author and Harmonius the
   editor, or that both were hymnists. The testimony of Ephraem cannot be
   easily set aside as a pure error. Fragments of hymns of Bardesanes have
   been traced in the Acta Thomae by K. Macke in the article quoted above.
   The Syriac hymns of Ephraem are translated into German by Zingerle
   (1838), and into English by H. Burgess (1853).

   against Marcion, which is lost Irenaeus: I. 28. IV. 33 sqq. and several
   other passages. He likewise contemplated a special treatise against
   Marcion (III. 12) Tertullian: Adv. Marcionem Libri V. Hippol. Philos.

   "Destruction of Heretics" (5^th century), translated by Neumann, in the
   "Zeitschrift für histor. Theologie," Leipzig, vol. IV. 1834. Esnig
   gives Marcionism more of a mystic and speculative character than the
   earlier fathers, but presents nothing which may not be harmonized with
   them.

   II Neander (whose account is too charitable), Baur (I. 213-217), Möller
   (Gesch. der Kosmologie, 374-407), Fessler. (in Wetzer and Welte, VI.
   816-821), Jacobi (in Herzog, V. 231-236), Salmon (in Smith and Wace,
   III. 816-824). Ad. Hilgenfeld: Cerdon und Marcion, in his "Zeitschrift
   für wissenschaftl. Theol." Leipz. 1881, pp. 1-37.

   III. On the critical question of Marcion's canon and the relation of
   his mutilated Gospel of Luke to the genuine Gospel of Luke, see the
   works on the Canon, the critical Introductions, and especially Volkmar:
   Das Evangelium Marcions, Text und Kritik (Leipz. 1852), and Sanday: The
   Gospels in the Second Century (London, 1876). The last two have
   conclusively proved (against the earlier view of Baur, Ritschl, and the
   author of "Supernat. Rel.") the priority of the canonical Luke. Comp.
   vol. I. 668.

   Marcion was the most earnest, the most practical, and the most
   dangerous among the Gnostics, full of energy and zeal for reforming,
   but restless rough and eccentric. He has a remote connection with
   modern questions of biblical criticism and the canon. He anticipated
   the rationalistic opposition to the Old Testament and to the Pastoral
   Epistles, but in a very arbitrary and unscrupulous way. He could see
   only superficial differences in the Bible, not the deeper harmony. He
   rejected the heathen mythology of the other Gnostics, and adhered to
   Christianity as the only true religion; he was less speculative, and
   gave a higher place to faith. But he was utterly destitute of
   historical sense, and put Christianity into a radical conflict with all
   previous revelations of God; as if God had neglected the world for
   thousands of years until he suddenly appeared in Christ. He represents
   an extreme anti-Jewish and pseudo-Pauline tendency, and a magical
   supranaturalism, which, in fanatical zeal for a pure primitive
   Christianity, nullifies all history, and turns the gospel into an
   abrupt, unnatural, phantomlike appearance.

   Marcion was the son of a bishop of Sinope in Pontus, and gave in his
   first fervor his property to the church, but was excommunicated by his
   own father, probably on account of his heretical opinions and contempt
   of authority. [886] 86 He betook himself, about the middle of the
   second century, to Rome (140-155), which originated none of the Gnostic
   systems, but attracted them all. There he joined the Syrian Gnostic,
   Cerdo, who gave him some speculative foundation for his practical
   dualism. He disseminated his doctrine by travels, and made many
   disciples from different nations. He is said to have intended to apply
   at last for restoration to the communion of the Catholic Church, when
   his death intervened. [887] 87 The time and place of his death are
   unknown. He wrote a recension of the Gospel of Luke and the Pauline
   Epistles, and a work on the contradictions between the Old anad New
   Testaments. Justin Martyr regarded him as the most formidable heretic
   of his day. The abhorrence of the Catholics for him is expressed in the
   report of Irenaeus, that Polycarp of Smyrna, meeting with Marcion in
   Rome, and being asked by him: "Dost thou know me?" answered: "I know
   the first-born of Satan." [888] 88

   Marcion supposed two or three primal forces (archai): the good or
   gracious God (theos agathos), whom Christ first made known; the evil
   matter (hule) ruled by the devil, to which heathenism belongs; and the
   righteous world-maker (demiourgos dikaios), who is the finite,
   imperfect, angry Jehovah of the Jews. Some writers reduce his
   principles to two; but he did not identify the demiurge with the hyle.
   He did not go into any further speculative analysis of these
   principles; he rejected the pagan emanation theory, the secret
   tradition, and the allegorical interpretation of the Gnostics; in his
   system he has no Pleroma, no Aeons, no Dynameis, no Syzygies, no
   suffering Sophia; he excludes gradual development and growth;
   everything is unprepared, sudden and abrupt.

   His system was more critical and rationalistic than mystic and
   philosophical. [889] 89 He was chiefly zealous for the consistent
   practical enforcement of the irreconcilable dualism which he
   established between the gospel and the law, Christianity and Judaism,
   goodness and righteousness. [890] 90  He drew out this contrast at
   large in a special work, entitled "Antitheses." The God of the Old
   Testament is harsh, severe and unmerciful as his law; he commands,
   "Love thy neighbor, but hate thine enemy," and returns "an eye for an
   eye, and a tooth for a tooth;" but the God of the New Testament
   commands, "Love thine enemy." The one is only just, the other is good.
   Marcion rejected all the books of the Old Testament, and wrested
   Christ's word in Matt. 5:17 into the very opposite declaration: "I am
   come not to fulfil the law and the prophets, but to destroy them." In
   his view, Christianity has no connection whatever with the past,
   whether of the Jewish or the heathen world, but has fallen abruptly and
   magically, as it were, from heaven. [891] 91 Christ, too, was not born
   at all, but suddenly descended into the city of Capernaum in the
   fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, and appeared as the revealer
   of the good God, who sent him. He has no connection with the Messiah,
   announced by the Demiurge in the Old Testament; though he called
   himself the Messiah by way of accommodation. His body was a mere
   appearance, and his death an illusion, though they had a real meaning.
   [892] 92 He cast the Demiurge into Hades, secured the redemption of the
   soul (not of the body), and called the apostle Paul to preach it. The
   other apostles are Judaizing corrupters of pure Christianity, and their
   writings are to be rejected, together with the catholic tradition. In
   over-straining the difference between Paul and the other apostles, he
   was a crude forerunner of the Tübingen school of critics.

   Marcion formed a canon of his own, which consisted of only eleven
   books, an abridged and mutilated Gospel of Luke, and ten of Paul's
   epistles. He put Galatians first in order, and called Ephesians the
   Epistle to the Laodicaeans. He rejected the pastoral epistles, in which
   the forerunners of Gnosticism are condemned, the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, Matthew, Mark, John, the Acts, the Catholic Epistles, and the
   Apocalypse.

   Notwithstanding his violent antinomianism, Marcion taught and practiced
   the strictest ascetic self-discipline, which revolted not only from all
   pagan festivities, but even from marriage, flesh, and wine. (He allowed
   fish). He could find the true God in nature no more than in history. He
   admitted married persons to baptism only on a vow of abstinence from
   all sexual intercourse. [893] 93 He had a very gloomy, pessimistic view
   of the world and the church, and addressed a disciple as "his partner
   in tribulation, and fellow-sufferer from hatred."

   In worship he excluded wine from the eucharist, but retained the
   sacramental bread, water-baptism, anointing with oil, and the mixture
   of milk and honey given to the newly baptized. [894] 94 Epiphanius
   reports that he permitted females to baptize. The Marcionites practiced
   sometimes vicarious baptism for the dead. [895] 95 Their baptism was
   not recognized by the church.

   The Marcionite sect spread in Italy, Egypt, North Africa, Cyprus, and
   Syria; but it split into many branches. Its wide diffusion is proved by
   the number of antagonists in the different countries.

   The most noteworthy Marcionites are Prepo, Lucanus (an Assyrian), and
   Apelles. They supplied the defects of the master's system by other
   Gnostic speculations, and in some instances softened down its antipathy
   to heathenism and Judaism. Apelles acknowledged only one first
   principle. Ambrosius, a friend of Origen, was a Marcionite before his
   conversion. These heretics were dangerous to the church because of
   their severe morality and the number of their martyrs. They abstained
   from marriage, flesh and wine, and did not escape from persecution,
   like some other Gnostics.

   Constantine forbade the Marcionites freedom of worship public and
   private, and ordered their meeting-houses to be handed over to the
   Catholic Church. [896] 96 The Theodosian code mentions them only once.
   But they existed in the fifth century when Theodoret boasted to have
   converted more than a thousand of these heretics, and the Trullan
   Council of 692 thought it worth while to make provision for the
   reconciliation of Marcionites. Remains of them are found as late as the
   tenth century. [897] 97 Some of their principles revived among the
   Paulicians, who took refuge in Bulgaria, and the Cathari in the West.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [886] Epiphanius and others mention, as a reason, his seduction of a
   consecrated virgin; but this does not agree well with his asceticism,
   and Irenaeus and Tertullian bring no charge of youthful incontinence
   against him.

   [887] So Tertullian: but Irenaeus tells a similar story of Cerdo.
   Tertullian also reports that Marcion was repeatedly (semel et iterim)
   excommunicated.

   [888] Adv. Haer. iil.c. 3, § 4: Epiginosko ton prototokon tou Satana.

   [889] The Armenian bishop, Esnig, however, brings it nearer to the
   other forms of Gnosticism. According to him Marcion assumed three
   heavens; in the highest dwelt the good God, far away from the world, in
   the second the God of the Law, in the lowest his angels; beneath, on
   the earth, lay Hyle, or Matter, which he calls also the power (dunamis)
   or essence (ousia) of the earth. The Hyle is a female principle, and by
   her aid, as his spouse, the Jewish God of the Law made this world,
   after which he retired to his heaven, and each ruled in his own domain,
   he with his angels in heaven, and Hyle with her sons on earth. Möller
   (p. 378) is disposed to accept this account as trustworthy. Salmon
   thinks; it such a system as Marcion may have learned from Cerdo, but he
   must have made little account of the mystic element, else it would be
   mentioned by the earlier writers.

   Marcionis." Tertullian, Adv. Marc I. 19.

   [891] "Subito Christus, subito Joannes. Sic sunt omnia apud Marcionem,
   que suum et plenum habent ordinem apud creatorem." Tert. IV. 11.

   [892] Renan (L'englise chrét., p. 358) says of the shadowy narrative of
   Christ's which Marcion elaborated on the basis of his mutilated Luke:
   "Si Jesus ne nous avait été connu que par des textes de ce genre, on
   aurait pu douter s'il avaitvraiment existé, ous'il n' était pas une
   fiction, A PRIORI, dégagée de tout lien avec le réalité. Dans un pareil
   système, le Christ ne naissait pas (la naissance, pour Marcion, était
   une souillure), ne souffrait pas, ne mourait pas."

   similar opinions in Bosnia and Herzegowina.

   Jacobi in Herzog, new ed., vol. V. 240 sq.

   George Salmon: "Cainites," in Smith and Wace, vol. I. 380-82. Articles
   "Ophites" and "Peratae," will probably appear in vol. IV., not yet
   published.

   The origin of the Ophites, [898] 98 or, in Hebrew, Naasenes, [899] 99
   i.e. Serpent-Brethren, or Serpent-Worshippers, is unknown, and is
   placed by Mosheim and others before the time of Christ. In any case,
   their system is of purely heathen stamp. Lipsius has shown their
   connection with the Syro-Chaldaic mythology. The sect still existed as
   late as the sixth century; for in 530 Justinian passed laws against it.

   The accounts of their worship of the serpent rest, indeed, on uncertain
   data; but their name itself comes from their ascribing special import
   to the serpent as the type of gnosis, with reference to the history of
   the fall (Gen. 3:1), the magic rod of Moses (Ex. 4:2, 3), and the
   healing power of the brazen serpent in the wilderness (Num. 21:9; Comp.
   John 3:14). They made use of the serpent on amulets.

   That mysterious, awe-inspiring reptile, which looks like the embodiment
   of a thunderbolt, or like a fallen angel tortuously creeping in the
   dust, represents in the Bible the evil spirit, and its motto, Eritis
   sicut Deus, is the first lie of the father of lies, which caused the
   ruin of man; but in the false religions it is the symbol of divine
   wisdom and an object of adoration; and the Eritis sicus dii appears as
   a great truth, which opened the path of progress. The serpent, far from
   being the seducer of the race, was its first schoolmaster and civilizer
   by teaching it the difference between good and evil. So the Ophites
   regarded the fall of Adam as the transition from the state of
   unconscious bondage to the state of conscious judgment and freedom;
   therefore the necessary entrance to the good, and a noble advance of
   the human spirit. They identified the serpent with the Logos, or the
   mediator between the Father and the Matter, bringing down the powers of
   the upper world to the lower world, and leading the return from the
   lower to the higher. The serpent represents the whole winding process
   of development and salvation. [900] 00 The Manichaeans also regarded
   the serpent as the direct image of Christ. [901] 01

   With this view is connected their violent opposition to the Old
   Testament. Jaldabaoth, [902] 02 as they termed the God of the Jews and
   the Creator of the world, they represented as a malicious, misanthropic
   being. In other respects, their doctrine strongly resembles the
   Valentinian system, except that it is much more pantheistic,
   unchristian, and immoral, and far less developed.

   The Ophites again branch out in several sects, especially three.

   The Sethites considered the third son of Adam the first pneumatic man
   and the forerunner of Christ. They maintained three principles,
   darkness below, light above, and spirit between.

   The Peratae or Peratics [903] 03 (Transcendentalists) are described by
   Hippolytus as allegorizing astrologers and as mystic tritheists, who
   taught three Gods, three Logoi, three Minds, three Men. Christ had a
   three-fold nature, a three-fold body, and a three-fold power. He
   descended from above, that all things triply divided might be saved.
   [904] 04

   The Cainites boasted of the descent from Cain the fratricide, and made
   him their leader. [905] 05 They regarded the God of the Jews and
   Creator of the world as a positively evil being, whom to resist is
   virtue. Hence they turned the history of salvation upside down, and
   honored all the infamous characters of the Old and New Testaments from
   Cain to Judas as spiritual men and martyrs to truth. Judas Iscariot
   alone among the apostles had the secret of true knowledge, and betrayed
   the psychic Messiah with good intent to destroy the empire of the evil
   God of the Jews. Origen speaks of a branch of the Ophites, who were as
   great enemies of Jesus as the heathen Celsus, and who admitted none
   into their society who had not first cursed his name. But the majority
   seem to have acknowledged the goodness of Jesus and the benefit of his
   crucifixion brought about by the far-sighted wisdom of Judas. A book
   entitled "the Gospel of Judas" was circulated among them.

   No wonder that such blasphemous travesty of the Bible history, and such
   predilection for the serpent and his seed was connected with the most
   unbridled antinomianism, which changed vice into virtue. They thought
   it a necessary part of "perfect knowledge" to have a complete
   experience of all sins, including even unnamable vices.

   Some have identified the Ophites with the false teachers denounced in
   the Epistle of Jude as filthy dreamers, who "defile the flesh, and set
   at naught dominion, and rail at dignities," who "went in the way of
   Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and perished
   in the gainsaying of Korah," as "wandering stars, for whom the
   blackness of darkness has been reserved forever." The resemblance is
   certainly very striking, and those heretics may have been the
   forerunners of the Ophites of the second century.

   Epiphanius are silent about the Peratae. Clement of Alex. mentions
   them.

   [904] The following specimen of Peratic transcendental nonsense is
   reported by Hippolytus (v. 12): "According to them, the universe is the
   Father, Son, [and] Matter; [but] each of these three has endless
   capacities in itself. Intermediate, then, between the Matter and the
   Father sits the Son, the Word, the Serpent, always being in motion

   at one time he is turned towards the Father, and receives the powers
   into his own person; but at another time takes up these powers, and is

   the Serpent. For as he brought down from above the paternal marks, so

   the unsubstantial Being, transferring them hither from thence."

   Contemporary with Basilides under Hadrian, was Saturninus or Satornilos
   [906] in Antioch. He was, like him, a pupil of Menander. His system is
   distinguished for its bold dualism between God and Satan, the two
   antipodes of the universe, and for its ascetic severity. [907] 07 God
   is the unfathomable abyss, absolutely unknown (theos agnostos). From
   him emanates by degrees the spirit-world of light, with angels,
   archangels, powers, and dominions. On the lowest degree, are the seven
   planetary spirits (angeloi kosmokratores) with the Demiurge or God of
   the Jews at the head. Satan, as the ruler of the hyle, is eternally
   opposed to the realm of light. The seven planetary spirits invade the
   realm of Satan, and form out of a part of the hyle the material world
   with man, who is filled by the highest God with a spark of light
   (spinther). Satan creates in opposition a hylic race of men, and
   incessantly pursues the spiritual race with his demons and false
   prophets. The Jewish God, with his prophets, is unable to overcome him.
   Finally the good God sends the aeon Nous in an unreal body, as Soter on
   earth, who teaches the spiritual men by gnosis and strict abstinence
   from marriage and carnal food to emancipate themselves from the
   vexations of Satan, and also from the dominion of the Jewish God and
   his star-spirits, and to rise to the realm of light.

   disputes the dualism of Saturninus, and maintains that Satan and the

   Gnostic systems.

   Iren. I. 25 (24). Hippol. VII. 32 (D. & Schn. p. 398 sqq.). Clem. Alex.
   Strom. III. 511. Epihianius, Haer. XXV.

   Carpocrates also lived under Hadrian, probably at Alexandria, and
   founded a Gnostic sect, called by his own name, which put Christ on a
   level with heathen philosophers, prided itself on its elevation above
   all the popular religions, and sank into unbridled immorality. The
   world is created by angels greatly inferior to the unbegotten Father.
   Jesus was the son of Joseph, and just like other men, except that his
   soul was steadfast and pure, and that he perfectly remembered those
   things which he had witnessed within the sphere of the unbegotten God.
   For this reason a power descended upon him from the Father, that by
   means of it he might escape from the creators of the world. After
   passing through them all, and remaining in all points free, he ascended
   again to the Father. We may rise to an equality with Jesus by despising
   in like manner the creators of the world.

   The Carpocratians, say Irenaeus and Hippolytus, practiced also magical
   arts, incantations, and love-potions, and had recourse to familiar
   spirits, dream-sending demons, and other abominations, declaring that
   they possess power to rule over the princes and framers of this world.
   But they led a licentious life, and abused the name of Christ as a
   means of hiding their wickedness. They were the first known sect that
   used pictures of Christ, and they derived them from a pretended
   original of Pontius Pilate. [908] 08

   Epiphanes, a son of Carpocrates, who died at the age of seventeen, was
   the founder of "monadic "Gnosticism, which in opposition to dualism
   seems to have denied the independent existence of evil, and resolved it
   into a fiction of human laws. He wrote a book on "Justice," and defined
   it to be equality. He taught that God gave his benefits to all men
   alike and in common, and thence derived the community of goods, and
   even of women. He was worshipped by his adherents after his death as a
   god, at Same in Cephalonia, by sacrifices, libations, banquets, and
   singing of hymns. Here we have the worship of genius in league with the
   emancipation of the flesh, which has been revived in modern times. But
   it is not impossible that Clement of Alexandria, who relates this fact,
   may have made a similar mistake as Justin Martyr in the case of Simon
   Magus, and confounded a local heathen festival of the moon known as ta
   Epiphaneia or ho Epiphanes with a festival in honor of Epiphanes. [909]

   [909] This was the conjecture of Mosheim, which has been worked out and
   modified by Volkmar in a monthly periodical of the Wissenschaftl.
   Verein at Zürich. He maintains that the deity worshipped at Same was
   the new appearing moon, ho Epiphanes.

   transl. by Pratten & Dods in the "Ante-Nicene Library," vol. III.

   dia tessaron), was found in an Armenian translation in the Armenian
   Convent at Venice, translated into Latin in 1841 by Aucher, and edited
   by Mösinger (Prof. of Biblical Learning in Salzburg) under the title
   "Evangelii Concordantis Expositio facta a Sancto Ephraemo Doctore
   Syro." Venet. 1876. The Diatessaron itself was found in an Arabic
   translation in 1886, and published by P. Aug. Ciasca: Tatiani

   Tatian, a rhetorician of Syria, was converted to Catholic Christianity
   by Justin Martyr in Rome, but afterwards strayed into Gnosticism and
   died a.d. 172. [910] 10 He resembles Marcion in his anti-Jewish turn
   and dismal austerity. Falsely interpreting 1 Cor. 7:5, he declared
   marriage to be a kind of licentiousness and a service of the devil.
   Irenaeus says, that Tatian, after the martyrdom of Justin, apostatised
   from the church, and elated with the conceit of a teacher, and vainly
   puffed up as if he surpassed all others, invented certain invisible
   aeons similar to those of Valentine, and asserted with Marcion and
   Saturninus that marriage was only corruption and fornication. But his
   extant apologetic treatise against the Gentiles, and his Gospel-Harmony
   (recently recovered), which were written between 153 and 170, show no
   clear traces of Gnosticism, unless it be the omission of the
   genealogies of Jesus in the "Diatessaron." He was not so much
   anti-catholic as hyper-catholic, and hyper-ascetic. We shall return to
   him again in the last chapter.

   His followers, who kept the system alive till the fifth century, were
   called, from their ascetic life, Encratites, or Abstainers, and from
   their use of water for wine in the Lord's Supper, Hydroparastatae or
   Aquarians. [911] 11 They abstained from flesh, wine, and marriage, not
   temporarily (as the ancient catholic ascetics) for purposes of
   devotion, nor (as many modern total abstainers from intoxicating drink)
   for the sake of expediency or setting a good example, but permanently
   and from principle on account of the supposed intrinsic impurity of the
   things renounced. The title "Encratites," however, was applied
   indiscriminately to all ascetic sects of the Gnostics, especially the
   followers of Saturninus, Marcion, and Severus (Severians, of uncertain
   origin). The Manichaeans also sheltered themselves under this name.
   Clement of Alexandria refers to the Indian ascetics as the forerunners
   of the Encratites.

   The practice of using mere water for wine in the eucharist was
   condemned by Clement of Alexandria, Cyprian, and Chrysostom, and
   forbidden by Theodosius in an edict of 382. A certain class of modern
   abstinence men in America, in their abhorrence of all intoxicating
   drinks, have resorted to the same heretical practice, and substituted
   water or milk for the express ordinance of our Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [910] The chronology, is not certain. Zahn and Harnack put his birth at
   a.d. 110, his conversion at 150, his death at 172. Funk puts the birth
   and conversion about 10 years later.

   § 132. Justin the Gnostic.

   Hippolytus: Philos. V. 23-27 (p. 214-233), and X. 15 (p. 516-519).

   Hippolytus makes us acquainted with a Gnostic by the name of Justin, of
   uncertain date and origin. [912] 12 He propagated his doctrine
   secretly, and bound his disciples to silence by solemn oaths. He wrote
   a number of books, one called Baruch, from which Hippolytus gives an
   abstract. His gnosis is mostly based upon a mystical interpretation of
   Genesis, and has a somewhat Judaizing cast. Hippolytus, indeed, classes
   him with the Naassenes, but Justin took an opposite view of the serpent
   as the cause of all evil in history. He made use also of the Greek
   mythology, especially the tradition of the twelve labors of Hercules.
   He assumes three original principles, two male and one female. The
   first is the Good Being; the second Elohim, the Father of the creation;
   the third is called Eden and Israel, and has a double form, a woman
   above the middle and a snake below. Elohim falls in love with Eden, and
   from their intercourse springs the spirit-world of twenty angels, ten
   paternal and ten maternal, and these people the world. The chief of the
   two series of angels are Baruch, who is the author of all good, and is
   represented by the tree of life in Paradise, and Naas, the serpent, who
   is the author of all evil, and is represented by the tree of knowledge.
   The four rivers are symbols of the four divisions of angels. The Naas
   committed adultery with Eve, and a worse crime with Adam; he
   adulterated the laws of Moses and the oracles of the prophets; he
   nailed Jesus to the cross. But by this crucifixion Jesus was
   emancipated from his material body, rose to the good God to whom he
   committed his spirit in death, and thus he came to be the deliverer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [912] Lipsius regards him as one of the earliest, Salmon (in "Smith &
   Wace," III. 587), with greater probability, as one of the latest
   Gnostics. The silence of Irenaeus favors the later date.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 133. Hermogenes.

   Tertullian: Adv. Hermogenem. Written about a.d. 206. One of his two
   tracts against H. is lost. Hippolytus: Philos. VIII. 17 (p. 432). Comp.
   Neander: Antignosticus, p. 448; Kaye: Tertullian, p. 532; Hauck:
   Tertullian, p. 240; Salmond: in "Smith & Wace," III. 1-3.

   Hermogenes was a painter in Carthage at the end of the second and
   beginning of the third century. Tertullian describes him as a
   turbulent, loquacious, and impudent man, who "married more women than
   he painted." [913] 13 He is but remotely connected with Gnosticism by
   his Platonic dualism and denial of the creation out of nothing. He
   derived the world, including the soul of man, from the formless,
   eternal matter, [914] 14 and explained the ugly in the natural world,
   as well as the evil in the spiritual, by the resistance of matter to
   the formative influence of God. In this way only he thought he could
   account for the origin of evil. For if God had made the world out of
   nothing, it must be all good. He taught that Christ on his ascension
   left his body in the sun, and then ascended to the Father. [915] 15
   But otherwise he was orthodox and did not wish to separate from the
   church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [913] This was enough to condemn him in the eyes of a Montanist.

   [914] Hippol. l.c.: ephe ton theon ex hules sunchronou kai agennetou
   panta pepoiekenai.

   [915] This foolish notion be proved from Ps. 19: "He hath placed his
   tabernacle in the sun."
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 134. Other Gnostic Sects.

   The ancient fathers, especially Hippolytus and Epiphanius, mention
   several other Gnostic sects under various designations.

   1. The Docetae or Docetists taught that the body of Christ was not real
   flesh and blood, but merely a deceptive, transient phantom, and
   consequently that he did not really suffer and die and rise again.
   Hippolytus gives an account of the system of this sect. But the name
   applied as well to most Gnostics, especially to Basilides, Saturninus,
   Valentinus, Marcion, and the Manichaeans. Docetism was a characteristic
   feature of the first antichristian errorists whom St. John had in view
   (1 John 4:2; 2 John 7). [916] 16

   2. The name Antitactae or Antitactes, denotes the licentious antinomian
   Gnostics, rather than the followers of any single master, to whom the
   term can be traced. [917] 17

   3. The Prodicians, so named from their supposed founder, Prodicus,
   considered themselves the royal family, [918] 18and, in crazy
   self-conceit, thought themselves above the law, the sabbath, and every
   form of worship, even above prayer itself, which was becoming only to
   the ignorant mass. They resembled the Nicolaitans and Antitactae, and
   were also called Adamites, Barbelitae, Borboriani, Coddiani,
   Phibionitae, and by other unintelligible names. [919] 19

   Almost every form of immorality and lawlessness seems to have been
   practiced under the sanction of religion by the baser schools of
   Gnosticism, and the worst errors and organized vices of modern times
   were anticipated by them. Hence we need not be surprised at the
   uncompromising opposition of the ancient fathers to this radical
   corruption and perversion of Christianity.

   § 135. Mani and the Manichaeans.

   Sources.

   I. Oriental Sources: The most important, though of comparatively late
   date. (a) Mohammedan (Arabic): Kitâb al Fihrist. A history of Arabic
   literature to 987, by an Arab of Bagdad, usually called Ibn Abi Jakub
   An-Nadîm; brought to light by Flügel, and published after his death by
   Rödiger and Müller, in 2 vols. Leipz. 1871-'72. Book IX. section first,
   treats of Manichaeism. Flügel's transl. see below. Kessler calls
   Fihrist a "Fundstätte allerersten Ranges." Next to it comes the
   relation of the Mohamedan philosopher Al-Shahrastanî (d. 1153), in his
   History of Religious Parties and Philosophical Sects, ed. Cureton,
   Lond. 1842, 2 vols. (I. 188-192); German translation by Haarbrücker.
   Halle, 1851. On other Mohammedan sources see Kessler in Herzog2, IX.
   225 sq. (b) Persian sources, relating to the life of Mani; the
   Shâhnâmeh (the Kings' Book) of Firdausî, ed. by Jul. Mohl. Paris, 1866
   (V. 472-475). See Kessler, ibid. 225. c) Christian Sources: In Arabic,
   the Alexandrian Patriarch Eutychius (d. 916), Annales, ed. Pococke.
   Oxon. 1628; Barhebraeus (d. 1286), in his Historia Dynastiarum, ed.
   Pococke. In Syriac: Ephraem Syrus (d. 393), in various writings Esnig
   or Esnik, an Armenian bishop of the 5th century, who wrote against
   Marcion and Mani (German translation from the Armenian by C. Fr.
   Neumann in Illgen's "Zeitschrift für die Hist. Theol." 1834, p. 77-78).

   II. Greek Sources: Eusebius (H. E. VII. 31, a brief account).
   Epiphanius (Haer. 66). Cyril Of Jerusal. (Catech. VI. 20 sqq.). Titus
   of Bostra (pros Manichaious, ed. P. de Lafarde, 1859). Photius: Adv.
   ManichOEos (Cod. 179 Biblioth.). John Of Damascus: De Haeres. and Dial.

   III. Latin Sources: Archelaus (Bishop of Cascar in Mesopotamia, d.
   about 278): Acta Disputationis cum Manete haeresiarcha; first written
   in Syriac, and so far belonging to the Oriental Christian sources
   (Comp. Jerome, De vir. ill. 72), but extant only in a Latin
   translation, which seems to have been made from the Greek, edited by
   Zacagni (Rom. 1698) and Routh (in Reliquiae Sacrae., vol. V. 3-206),
   Engl. transl. in Clark's "Ante-Nicene Library" (vol. XX. 272-419).
   These Acts purport to contain the report of a disputation between
   Archelaus and Mani before a large assembly, which was in full sympathy
   with the orthodox bishop, but (as Beausobre first proved) they are in
   form a fiction from the first quarter of the fourth century (about 320)
   by a Syrian ecclesiastic (probably of Edessa), yet based upon
   Manichaean documents, and containing much information about Manichaean
   doctrines. They consist of various pieces, and were the chief source of
   information to the West. Mani is represented (ch. 12) as appearing in a
   many-colored cloak and trousers, with a sturdy staff of ebony, a
   Babylonian book under his left arm, and with a mien of an old Persian
   master. In his defense he quotes freely from the N. T. At the end he
   makes his escape to Persia (ch. 55). Comp. H. V. Zittwitz: Die Acta
   Archelai et Manetis untersucht, in Kahnis' "Zeitschrift für Hist.

   We come now to the latest, the best organized, the most consistent,
   tenacious and dangerous form of Gnosticism, with which Christianity had
   to wage a long conflict. Manichaeism was not only a school, like the
   older forms of Gnosticism, but a rival religion and a rival church. In
   this respect it resembled Islam which at a later period became a still
   more formidable rival of Christianity; both claimed to be divine
   revelations, both engrafted pseudo-Christian elements on a heathen
   stock, but the starting point was radically different: Manichaeism
   being anti-Jewish and dualistic, Mohammedanism, pseudo-Jewish and
   severely and fanatically monotheistic.

   First the external history.

   The origin of Manichaeism is matter of obscure and confused tradition.
   It is traced to Mani (Manes, Manichaeus), [920] 20 a Persian
   philosopher, astronomer, and painter, [921] 21 of the third century
   (215-277), who came over to Christianity, or rather introduced some
   Christian elements into the Zoroastrian religion, and thus stirred up
   an intellectual and moral revolution among his countrymen. According to
   Arabic Mohammedan sources, he was the son of Fatak (Patekios), a
   high-born Persian of Hamadan (Ecbatana), who emigrated to Ctesiphon in
   Babylonia. Here he received a careful education. He belonged originally
   to the Judaizing Gnostic sect of the Mandaeans or Elkesaites (the
   Mogtasilah, i.e. Baptists); but in his nineteenth and again in his
   twenty-fourth year (238) a new religion was divinely revealed to him.
   In his thirtieth year he began to preach his syncretistic creed,
   undertook long journeys and sent out disciples. He proclaimed himself
   to be the last and highest prophet of God and the Paraclete promised by
   Christ (as Mohammed did six hundred years later). He began his
   "Epistola Fundamenti," in which he propounded his leading doctrines,
   with the words: "Mani, the apostle of Jesus Christ, by the providence
   of God the Father. These are the words of salvation from the eternal
   and living source." He composed many books in the Persian and Syriac
   languages and in an alphabet of his own invention but they are all
   lost. [922] 22

   At first Mani found favor at the court of the Persian king Shapur I.
   (Sapor), but stirred up the hatred of the priestly cast of the Magians.
   He fled to East India and China and became acquainted with Buddhism.
   Indeed, the name of Buddha is interwoven with the legendary history of
   the Manichaean system. His disputations with Archelaus in Mesopotamia
   are a fiction, like the pseudo-Clementine disputations of Simon Magus
   with Peter, but on a better historic foundation and with an orthodox
   aim of the writer [923]

   In the year 270 Mani returned to Persia, and won many followers by his
   symbolic (pictorial) illustrations of the doctrines, which he pretended
   had been revealed to him by God. But in a disputation with the Magians,
   he was convicted of corrupting the old religion, and thereupon was
   crucified, or flayed alive by order of king Behram I. (Veranes) about
   277; his skin was stuffed and hung up for a terror at the gate of the
   city Djondishapur (or Gundeshapur), since called "the gate of Mani."
   [924] 24 His followers were cruelly persecuted by the king.

   Soon after Mani's horrible death his sect spread in Turkistan,
   Mesopotamia, North Africa, Sicily, Italy and Spain. As it moved
   westward it assumed a more Christian character, especially in North
   Africa. It was everywhere persecuted in the Roman empire, first by
   Diocletian (A. D. 287), and afterwards by the Christian emperors.
   Nevertheless it flourished till the sixth century and even later.
   Persecution of heresy always helps heresy unless the heretics are
   exterminated.

   The mysteriousness of its doctrine, its compact organization, the
   apparent solution of the terrible problem of evil, and the show of
   ascetic holiness sometimes were the chief points of attraction. Even
   such a profound and noble spirit as St. Augustin was nine years an
   auditor of the sect before he was converted to the Catholic church. He
   sought there a deeper philosophy of religion and became acquainted with
   the gifted and eloquent Faustus of Numidia, but was disappointed and
   found him a superficial charlatan. Another Manichaean, by the name of
   Felix, he succeeded in converting to the Catholic faith in a public
   disputation of two days at Hippo. His connection with Manichaeism
   enabled him in his polemic writings to refute it and to develop the
   doctrines of the relation of knowledge and faith, of reason and
   revelation, the freedom of will, the origin of evil and its relation to
   the divine government. Thus here, too, error was overruled for the
   promotion of truth.

   Pope Leo I. searched for these heretics in Rome, and with the aid of
   the magistrate brought many to punishment. Valentinian III. punished
   them by banishment, Justinian by death. The violent and persistent
   persecutions at last destroyed their organization. But their system
   extended its influence throughout the middle ages down to the
   thirteenth century, reappearing, under different modifications, with a
   larger infusion of Christian elements, in the Priscillianists,
   Paulieians, Bogomiles, Albigenses, Catharists and other sects, which
   were therefore called "New Manichaeans." Indeed some of the leading
   features of Manichaeism--the dualistic separation of soul and body, the
   ascription of nature to the devil, the pantheistic confusion of the
   moral and physical, the hypocritical symbolism, concealing heathen
   views under Christian phrases, the haughty air of mystery, and the
   aristocratic distinction of esoteric and exoteric--still live in
   various forms even in modern systems of philosophy and sects of
   religion. [925] 25
     __________________________________________________________________

   [920] Manes, Mantos Manichaios,Manes (Gen. Manetis), Manichaeans (the
   last form always used by St. Augustin). The name is either of Persian
   or Semitic origin, but has not yet been satisfactorily explained.
   Kessler identifies it with Mânâ, Manda, i.e. knowledge, gnois, of the
   Mandaeans. According to the Acta Archelai he was originally called
   Cubricus, which Kessler regards as a corruption of the Arabic Shuraik.

   [921] At least, according to Persian accounts; but the Arabs, who hate
   painting, and the church fathers are silent about his skill as a
   painter.

   [922] Among these are mentioned the Book of Mysteries, the Book of
   Giants, the Book of Precepts for Hearers (Capitula orEpistola
   Fundamenti, from which Augustin gives large extracts), Shâhpûrakân
   (i.e. belonging to King Shâhpûr), the Book of Life, the Gospel or the
   Living Gospel. See Kessler, l. c, p. 249 sqq.

   [923] Beausobre (vol. I. Pref. p. viii): "Les Actes de cette Dispute
   sont évidemment une fiction pareille à celle de cet imposteur, qui a
   pris le nom de Clément Romain, et qui a introduit S. Pierre disputant
   contre Simon le Magicien."

   [924] The cruel death of Mani and the maltreatment of his corpse are
   well attested but his being skinned alive is perhaps a later Christian
   tradition. The Disput. Archelai (c. 55) towards the close gives this
   account: "He was apprehended and brought before the king, who, being
   inflamed with the strongest indignation against him, and fired will the
   desire of avenging two deaths upon him--namely, the death of his own
   son, and the death of the keeper of the prison--gave orders that he
   should be flayed alive and hung before the gate of the city and that
   his skin should be dipped in certain medicaments and inflated: his
   flesh, too, he commanded to be given as a prey to the birds." See the
   different accounts in Beausobre, I. 205 sq.

   [925] The Mormons or Latter-Day Saints of Utah present an interesting
   parallel, especially in their hierarchical organization; while in their
   polygamy they as strongly contrast with the ascetic Manichaeans, and
   resemble the Mohammedans.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 136. The Manichaean System.

   Manichaeism is a compound of dualistic, pantheistic, Gnostic, and
   ascetic elements, combined with a fantastic philosophy of nature, which
   gives the whole system a materialistic character, notwithstanding its
   ascetic abhorrence of matter. The metaphysical foundation is a radical
   dualism between good and evil, light and darkness, derived from the
   Persian Zoroastrism (as restored by the school of the Magasaeans under
   the reign of the second Sassanides towards the middle of the second
   century). The prominent ethical feature is a rigid asceticism which
   strongly resembles Buddhism. [926] 26 The Christian element is only a
   superficial varnish (as in Mohammedanism). The Jewish religion is
   excluded altogether (while in Mohammedanism it forms a very important
   feature), and the Old Testament is rejected, as inspired by the devil
   and his false prophets. The chief authorities were apocryphal Gospels
   and the writings of Mani.

   1. The Manichaean theology begins with an irreconcilable antagonism
   between the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness. And this is
   identified with the ethical dualism between good and bad. These two
   kingdoms stood opposed to each other from eternity, remaining
   unmingled. Then Satan who with his demons was born from darkness, began
   to rage and made an assault upon the kingdom of light. From this
   incursion resulted the present world, which exhibits a mixture of the
   two elements detached portions of light imprisoned in darkness. Adam
   was created in the image of Satan, but with a strong spark of light,
   and was provided by Satan with Eve as his companion, who represents
   seductive sensuousness, but also with a spark of light, though smaller
   than that in Adam. Cain and Abel are sons of Satan and Eve, but Seth is
   the offspring of Adam by Eve, and full of light. Thus mankind came into
   existence with different shares of light, the men with more, the women
   with less. Every individual man is at once a son of light and of
   darkness, has a good soul, and a body substantially evil, with an evil
   soul corresponding to it. The redemption of the light from the bonds of
   the darkness is effected by Christ, who is identical with the sun
   spirit, and by the Holy Ghost, who has his seat in the ether. These two
   beings attract the lightforces out of the material world, while the
   prince of darkness, and the spirits imprisoned in the stars, seek to
   keep them back. The sun and moon are the two shining ships (lucidae
   naves) for conducting the imprisoned light into the eternal kingdom of
   light. The full moon represents the ship laden with light; the new
   moon, the vessel emptied of its cargo; and the twelve signs of the
   zodiac also serve as buckets in this pumping operation.

   The Manichaean christology, like the Gnostic, is entirely docetic, and,
   by its perverted view of body and matter, wholly excludes the idea of
   an incarnation of God. The teachings of Christ were compiled and
   falsified by the apostles in the Spirit of Judaism. Mani, the promised
   Paraclete, has restored them. The goal of history is an entire
   separation of the light from the darkness; a tremendous conflagration
   consumes the world, and the kingdom of darkness sinks into impotence.

   Thus Christianity is here resolved into a fantastic dualistic, and yet
   pantheistic philosophy of nature; moral regeneration is identified with
   a process of physical refinement; and the whole mystery of redemption
   is found in light, which was always worshipped in the East as the
   symbol of deity. Unquestionably there pervades the Manichaean system a
   kind of groaning of the creature for redemption, and a deep sympathy
   with nature, that hieroglyphic of spirit; but all is distorted and
   confused. The suffering Jesus on the cross (Jesus patibilis) is here a
   mere illusion, a symbol of the world-soul still enchained in matter,
   and is seen in every plant which works upwards from the dark bosom of
   the earth towards the light, towards bloom and fruit, yearning after
   freedom. Hence the class of the "perfect" would not kill nor wound a
   beast, pluck a flower, nor break a blade of grass. The system, instead
   of being, as it pretends, a liberation of light from darkness, is
   really a turning of light into darkness.

   2. The morality of the Manichaeans was severely ascetic, based on the
   fundamental error of the intrinsic evil of matter and the body; the
   extreme opposite of the Pelagian view of the essential moral purity of
   human nature. [927] 27 The great moral aim is, to become entirely
   unworldly in the Buddhistic sense; to renounce and destroy corporeity;
   to set the good soul free from the fetters of matter. This is
   accomplished by the most rigid and gloomy abstinence from all those
   elements which have their source in the sphere of darkness. It was,
   however, only required of the elect, not of catechumens. A distinction
   was made between a higher and lower morality similar to that in the
   catholic church. The perfection of the elect consisted in a threefold
   seal or preservative (signaculum). [928] 28

   (a) The signaculum oris, that is, purity in words and in diet,
   abstinence from all animal food and strong drink, even in the holy
   supper, and restriction to vegetable diet, which was furnished to the
   perfect by the "bearers," particularly olives, as their oil is the food
   of light.

   (b) The signaculum manuum: renunciation of earthly property, and of
   material and industrial pursuits, even agriculture; with a sacred
   reverence for the divine light-life diffused through all nature.

   (c) The signaculum sinus, or celibacy, and abstinence from any
   gratification of sensual desire. Marriage, or rather procreation, is a
   contamination with corporeity, which is essentially evil.

   This unnatural holiness of the elect at the same time atoned for the
   unavoidable daily sins of the catechumens who paid them the greatest
   reverence. It was accompanied, however, as in the Gnostics, with an
   excessive pride of knowledge, and if we are to believe the catholic
   opponents, its fair show not rarely concealed refined forms of vice.

   3. Organization. Manichaeism differed from all the Gnostic schools in
   having a fixed, and that a strictly hierarchical, organization. This
   accounts in large measure for its tenacity and endurance. At the head
   of the sect stood twelve apostles, or magistri, among whom Mani and his
   successors, like Peter and the pope, held the chief place. Under them
   were seventy-two bishops, answering to the seventy-two (strictly
   seventy) disciples of Jesus; and under these came presbyters, deacons
   and itinerant evangelists. [929] 29 In the congregation there were two
   distinct classes, designed to correspond to the catechumens and the
   faithful in the catholic church: the "hearers;" [930] 30 and the
   "perfect," the esoteric, the priestly caste, [931] 31 which represents
   the last stage in the process of liberation of the spirit and its
   separation from the world, the transition from the kingdom of matter
   into the kingdom of light, or in Buddhistic terms, from the world of
   Sansara into Nirwana.

   4. The worship of the Manichaeans was, on the whole, very simple. They
   had no sacrifices, but four daily prayers, preceded by ablations, and
   accompanied by prostrations, the worshipper turned towards the sun or
   moon as the seat of light. They observed Sunday, in honor of the sun,
   which was with them the same with the redeemer; but, contrary to the
   custom of the catholic Christians, they made it a day of fasting. They
   had weekly, monthly, and yearly fasts. They rejected the church
   festivals, but instead celebrated in March with great pomp the day of
   the martyrdom of their divinely appointed teacher, Mani. [932] 32 The
   sacraments were mysteries of the elect, of which even Augustin could
   learn very little. Hence it has been disputed whether they used baptism
   or not, and whether they baptized by water, or oil. Probably they
   practised water baptism and anointing, and regarded the latter as a
   higher spiritual baptism, or distinguished both as baptism and
   confirmation in the catholic church. [933] 33 They also celebrated a
   kind of holy supper, sometimes even under disguise in catholic
   churches, but without wine (because Christ had no blood), and regarding
   it perhaps, according to their pantheistic symbolism, as the
   commemoration of the light-soul crucified in all nature. Their sign of
   recognition was the extension of the right hand as symbol of common
   deliverance from the kingdom of darkness by the redeeming hand of the
   spirit of the sun.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [926] Kessler (followed by Harnack) derives Manichaeism exclusively
   from Chaldaean sources, but must admit the strong affinity with
   Zoroastric and Buddhist ideas and customs. The Fihrist says that Mani
   derived his doctrine from Parsism and Christianity. On the Buddhistic
   element, see Baur, p. 433-44,).

   [927] Schleiermacher correctly represents Manichaeism and Pelagianism
   as the two fundamental heresies in anthropology and soteriology the one
   makes man essentially evil (in body), and thus denies the possibility
   of redemption; the other makes man essentially good, and thus denies
   the necessity of redemption.

   [928] The meaning of signaculum is not criterion (as Baur explains, l.
   c. p. 248), but seal (as is clear from the corresponding Arabic hatâm
   in the Fihrist). See Kessler.

   [929] The organization of the Mormons is similar.

   celebrate the martyrdom of their founder, Joseph Smith who was killed
   by the mob at Carthage, Illinois (June 27, 1844).

   [933] Gieseler and Neander are disposed to deny the use of
   water-baptism by the Manichaeans, Beausobre, Thilo, Baur, and Kessler
   assert it. The passages in Augustin are obscure and conflicting. See
   Baur, l.c. p. 273-281. The older Gnostic sects (the Marcionites and the
   Valentinians), and the New Manichaeans practised a baptismal rite by
   water. Some new light is thrown on this disputed question by the
   complete Greek text of the Gnostic Acts of Thomas, recently published
   by Max Bonnet of Montpellier (Acta Thomae, Lips. 1883). Here both
   baptism and anointing are repeatedly mentioned, p. 19 (in a
   thanksgiving to Christ: katharisas autous to so loutro kai aleipsas
   autous to so eleio apo tes periechouses autous planes), 20, 35, 68,
   (where, however, the pouring of oil is mentioned before water-baptism),
   73, 32 (aleipsas ... kai ebaptisen autous ... anelthonton de auton ek
   ton hudaton labon arton kai poterion eulogesen eipon...). Comp. The
   discussion of Lipsius in Die Apokryphen Apostelgeschichten und
   Apostellegenden (Braunschweig, 1883), p. 331, where he asserts: "Die
   Wassertaufe stand bei den Manichaeern ebenso wie bei den meisten
   älteren gnostichen Secten un Uebung."

   The special literature see below. Comp. also the Lit. in Ch. XIII.

   By the wide-spread errors described in the preceding chapter, the
   church was challenged to a mighty intellectual combat, from which she
   came forth victorious, according to the promise of her Lord, that the
   Holy Spirit should guide her into the whole truth. To the subjective,
   baseless, and ever-changing speculations, dreams, and fictions of the
   heretics, she opposed the substantial, solid realities of the divine
   revelation. Christian theology grew, indeed, as by inward necessity,
   from the demand of faith for knowledge. But heresy, Gnosticism in
   particular, gave it a powerful impulse from without, and came as a
   fertilizing thunder-storm upon the field. The church possessed the
   truth from the beginning, in the experience of faith, and in the Holy
   Scriptures, which she handed down with scrupulous fidelity from
   generation to generation. But now came the task of developing the
   substance of the Christian truth in theoretical form [934] 34fortifying
   it on all sides, and presenting it in clear light before the
   understanding. Thus the Christian polemic and dogmatic theology, or the
   church's logical apprehension of the doctrines of salvation, unfolded
   itself in this conflict with heresy; as the apologetic literature and
   martyrdom had arisen through Jewish and heathen persecution.

   From this time forth the distinction between catholic and heretical,
   orthodoxy and heterodoxy, the faith of the church and dissenting
   private opinion, became steadily more prominent. Every doctrine which
   agreed with the holy scriptures and the faith of the church, was
   received as catholic; that is, universal, and exclusive. [935] 35
   Whatever deviated materially from this standard, every arbitrary
   notion, framed by this or that individual, every distortion or
   corruption of the revealed doctrines of Christianity, every departure
   from the public sentiment of the church, was considered heresy. [936]
   36

   Almost all the church fathers came out against the contemporary
   heresies, with arguments from scripture, with the tradition of the
   church, and with rational demonstration, proving them inwardly
   inconsistent and absurd.

   But in doing this, while they are one in spirit and purpose, they
   pursue two very different courses, determined by the differences
   between the Greek and Roman nationality, and by peculiarities of mental
   organization and the appointment of Providence. The Greek theology,
   above all the Alexandrian, represented by Clement and Origen, is
   predominantly idealistic and speculative, dealing with the objective
   doctrines of God, the incarnation, the trinity, and christology;
   endeavoring to supplant the false gnosis by a true knowledge, an
   orthodox philosophy, resting on the Christian pistis. It was strongly
   influenced by Platonic speculation in the Logos doctrine. The Latin
   theology, particularly the North African, whose most distinguished
   representatives are Tertullian and Cyprian, is more realistic and
   practical, concerned with the doctrines of human nature and of
   salvation, and more directly hostile to Gnosticism and philosophy. With
   this is connected the fact, that the Greek fathers were first
   philosophers; the Latin were mostly lawyers and statesmen; the former
   reached the Christian faith in the way of speculation, the latter in
   the spirit of practical morality. Characteristically, too, the Greek
   church built mainly upon the apostle John, pre-eminently the
   contemplative "divine;" the Latin upon Peter, the practical leader of
   the church. While Clement of Alexandria and Origen often wander away
   into cloudy, almost Gnostic speculation, and threaten to resolve the
   real substance of the Christian ideas into thin spiritualism,
   Tertullian sets himself implacably against Gnosticism and the heathen
   philosophy upon which it rests. "What fellowship," he asks, "is there
   between Athens and Jerusalem, the academy and the church, heretics and
   Christians?" But this difference was only relative. With all their
   spiritualism, the Alexandrians still committed themselves to a striking
   literalism; while, in spite of his aversion to philosophy, Tertullian
   labored with profound speculative ideas which came to their full birth
   in Augustin.

   Irenaeus, who sprang from the Eastern church, and used the Greek
   language, but labored in the West, holds a kind of mediating position
   between the two branches of the church, and may be taken as, on the
   whole, the most moderate and sound representative of ecclesiastical
   orthodoxy in the ante-Nicene period. He is as decided against
   Gnosticism as Tertullian, without overlooking the speculative want
   betrayed in that system. His refutation of the Gnosis, [937] 37written
   between 177 and 192, is the leading polemic work of the second century.
   In the first book of this work Irenaeus gives a full account of the
   Valentinian system of Gnosis; in the second book be begins his
   refutation in philosophical and logical style; in the third, he brings
   against the system the catholic tradition and the holy scriptures, and
   vindicates the orthodox doctrine of the unity of God, the creation of
   the world, the incarnation of the Logos, against the docetic denial of
   the true humanity of Christ and the Ebionitic denial of his true
   divinity; in the fourth book he further fortifies the same doctrines,
   and, against the antinomianism of the school of Marcion, demonstrates
   the unity of the Old and New Testaments; in the fifth and last book he
   presents his views on eschatology, particularly on the resurrection of
   the body--so offensive to the Gnostic spiritualism--and at the close
   treats of Antichrist, the end of the world, the intermediate state, and
   the millennium.

   His disciple Hippolytus gives us, in the "Philosophumena," a still
   fuller account, in many respects, of the early heresies, and traces
   them up to, their sources in the heathen systems of philosophy, but
   does not go so deep into the exposition of the catholic doctrines of
   the church.

   The leading effort in this polemic literature was, of course, to
   develop and establish positively the Christian truth; which is, at the
   same time, to refute most effectually the opposite error. The object
   was, particularly, to settle the doctrines of the rule of faith, the
   incarnation of God, and the true divinity and true humanity of Christ.
   In this effort the mind of the church, under the constant guidance of
   the divine word and the apostolic tradition, steered with unerring
   instinct between the threatening cliffs. Yet no little indefiniteness
   and obscurity still prevailed in the scientific apprehension and
   statement of these points. In this stormy time, too, there were as yet
   no general councils to, settle doctrinal controversy by the voice of
   the whole church. The dogmas of the trinity and the person of Christ,
   did not reach maturity and final symbolical definition until the
   following period, or the Nicene age.

   Notes on Heresy.

   The term heresy is derived from hairesiswhich means originally either
   capture (from haireo), or election, choice (from haireomai), and
   assumed the additional idea of arbitrary opposition to public opinion
   and authority. In the N. Test. it designates a chosen way of life, a
   school or sect or party, not necessarily in a bad sense, and is applied
   to the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and even the Christians as a Jewish
   sect (Acts 5:17; 15:5; 24:5, 14; 26:5; 28:22); then it signifies
   discord, arising from difference of opinion (Gal. 5:20; 1 Cor. 11:19);
   and lastly error (2 Pet. 2:1, haireseis apoleiasdestructive heresies,
   or sects of perdition). This passage comes nearest to the
   ecclesiastical definition. The term heretic (hairetikos anthropos)
   occurs only once, Tit 3:10, and means a factious man, a sectary, a
   partisan, rather than an errorist.

   Constantine the Great still speaks of the Christian church as a sect,
   he hairesis he katholike, he hagiotate hairesis(in a letter to
   Chrestus, bishop of Syracuse, in Euseb, H. E. X. c. 5, § 21 and 22, in
   Heinichen's ed. I, 491). But after him church and sect became
   opposites, the former term being confined to the one ruling body, the
   latter to dissenting minorities.

   The fathers commonly use heresy of false teaching, in opposition to
   Catholic doctrine, and schism of a breach of discipline, in opposition
   to Catholic government. The ancient heresiologists--mostly uncritical,
   credulous, and bigoted, though honest and pious, zealots for a narrow
   orthodoxy--unreasonably multiplied the heresies by extending them
   beyond the limits of Christianity, and counting all modifications and
   variations separately. Philastrius or Philastrus, bishop. of Brescia or
   Brixia (d. 387), in his Liber de Haeresibus, numbered 28 Jewish and 128
   Christian heresies; Epiphanius of Cyprus (d. 403), in his Panarion. 80
   heresies in all, 20 before and 60 after Christ; Augustin (d. 430), 88
   Christian heresies, including Pelagianism; Proedestinatus, 90,
   including Pelagianism and Nestorianism. (Pope Pius IX. condemned 80
   modern heresies, in his Syllabus of Errors, 1864.) Augustin says that
   it is "altogether impossible, or at any rate most difficult" to define
   heresy, and wisely adds that the spirit in which error is held, rather
   than error itself, constitutes heresy. There are innocent as well as
   guilty errors. Moreover, a great many people are better than their
   creed or no-creed, and a great many are worse than their creed, however
   orthodox it may be. The severest words of our Lord were directed
   against the hypocritical orthodoxy of the Pharisees. In the course of
   time heresy was defined to be a religious error held in wilful and
   persistent opposition to the truth after it has been defined and
   declared by the church in an authoritative manner, or "pertinax
   defensio dogmatis ecclesiae universalis judicio condemnati."
   Speculations on open questions of theology are no heresies Origen was
   no heretic in his age, but was condemned long after his death.

   In the present divided state of Christendom there are different kinds
   of orthodoxy and heresy. Orthodoxy is conformity to a recognized creed
   or standard of public doctrine; heresy is a wilful departure from it.
   The Greek church rejects the Roman dogmas of the papacy, of the double
   procession of the Holy Ghost, the immaculate conception of the Virgin
   Mary, and the infallibility of the Pope, as heretical, because contrary
   to the teaching of the first seven oecumenical councils. The Roman
   church anathematized, in the Council of Trent, all the distinctive
   doctrines of the Protestant Reformation. Evangelical Protestants on the
   other hand regard the unscriptural traditions of the Greek and Roman
   churches as heretical. Among Protestant churches again there are minor
   doctrinal differences, which are held with various degrees of
   exclusiveness or liberality according to the degree of departure from
   the Roman Catholic church. Luther, for instance, would not tolerate
   Zwingli's view on the Lord's Supper, while Zwingli was willing to
   fraternize with him notwithstanding this difference. The Lutheran
   Formula of Concord, and the Calvinistic Synod of Dort rejected and
   condemned doctrines which are now held with impunity in orthodox
   evangelical churches. The danger of orthodoxy lies in the direction of
   exclusive and uncharitable bigotry, which contracts the truth; the
   danger of liberalism lies in the direction of laxity and
   indifferentism, which obliterates the eternal distinction between truth
   and error.

   The apostles, guided by more than human wisdom, and endowed with more
   than ecclesiastical authority, judged severely of every essential
   departure from the revealed truth of salvation. Paul pronounced the
   anathema on the Judaizing teachers, who made circumcision a term of
   true church membership (Gal. 1:8), and calls them sarcastically "dogs"
   of the "concision" (Phil. 3:2, blepete tous kunas ... tes katatomes).
   He warned the elders of Ephesus against "grievous wolves" (lukoi
   bareis) who would after his departure enter among them (Acts 20:29);
   and he characterizes the speculations of the rising gnosis falsely so
   called (pseudonumos gnosis) as "doctrines of demons" (didaskaliai
   daimonion, 1 Tim. 4:1; Comp. 6:3-20; 2 Tim. 3:1 sqq.; 4:3 sqq.). John
   warns with equal earnestness and severity against all false teachers
   who deny the fact of the incarnation, and calls them antichrists (1
   John 4:3; 2 John 7); and the second Epistle of Peter and the Epistle of
   Jude describe the heretics in the darkest colors.

   We need not wonder, then, that the ante-Nicene fathers held the gnostic
   heretics of their days in the greatest abhorrence, and called them
   servants of Satan, beasts in human shape, dealers in deadly poison,
   robbers, and pirates. Polycarp (Ad Phil.c. 7), Ignatius (Ad Smyrn. c.
   4), Justin M. (Apol. I. c. 26), Irenaeus (Adv. Haer. III. 3, 4),
   Hippolytus, Tertullian, even Clement of Alexandria, and Origen occupy
   essentially the same position of uncompromising hostility towards
   heresy is the fathers of the Nicene and post-Nicene ages. They regard
   it as the tares sown by the devil in the Lord's field (Matt. 13:3-6
   sqq). Hence Tertullian infers, "That which was first delivered is of
   the Lord and is true; whilst that is strange and false which was
   afterwards introduced" (Praescr. c. 31: "Ex ipso ordine manifestatur,
   id esse dominicum et verum quod sit prius traditum, id autem extraneum
   et falsum quod sit posterius inmissum"). There is indeed a necessity
   for heresies and sects (1 Cor. 11:19), but "woe to that man through
   whom the offence cometh" (Matt. 18:7). "It was necessary," says
   Tertullian (ib. 30), "that the Lord should be betrayed; but woe to the
   traitor."

   Another characteristic feature of patristic polemics is to trace
   heresy, to mean motives, such as pride, disappointed ambition, sensual
   lust, and avarice. No allowance is made for different mental
   constitutions, educational influences, and other causes. There are,
   however, a few noble exceptions. Origen and Augustin admit the honesty
   and earnestness at least of some teachers of error.

   We must notice two important points of difference between the
   ante-Nicene and later heresies, and the mode of punishing heresy.

   1. The chief ante-Nicene heresies were undoubtedly radical perversions
   of Christian truth and admitted of no kind of compromise. Ebionism,
   Gnosticism, and Manichaeism were essentially anti-Christian. The church
   could not tolerate that medley of pagan sense and nonsense without
   endangering its very existence. But Montanists, Novatians, Donatists,
   Quartodecimanians, and other sects who differed on minor points of
   doctrine or discipline, were judged more mildly, and their baptism was
   acknowledged.

   2. The punishment of heresy in the ante-Nicene church was purely
   ecclesiastical, and consisted in reproof, deposition, and
   excommunication. It had no effect on the civil status.

   But as soon as church and state began to be united, temporal
   punishments, such as confiscation of property, exile, and death, were
   added by the civil magistrate with the approval of the church, in
   imitation of the Mosaic code, but in violation of the spirit and
   example of Christ and the apostles. Constantine opened the way in some
   edicts against the Donatists, a.d. 316. Valentinian I. forbade the
   public worship of Manichaeans (371). After the defeat of the Arians by
   the second OEcumenical Council, Theodosius the Great enforced
   uniformity of belief by legal penalties in fifteen edicts between 381
   and 394. Honorius (408), Arcadius, the younger Theodosius, and
   Justinian (529) followed in the same path. By these imperial enactments
   heretics, i.e. open dissenters from the imperial state-religion, were
   deprived of all public offices, of the right of public worship, of
   receiving or bequeathing properly, of making binding contracts; they
   were subjected to fines, banishment, corporeal punishment, and even
   death. See the Theos. Code, Book XVI. tit. V. De Haereticis. The first
   sentence of death by the sword for heresy was executed on Priscillian
   and six of his followers who held Manichaean opinions (385). The better
   feeling of Ambrose of Milan and Martin of Tours protested against this
   act, but in vain. Even the great and good St. Augustin, although he had
   himself been a heretic for nine years, defended the principle of
   religious persecution, on a false exegesis of Cogite eos intrare, Luke
   14:23 (Ep. 93 ad Vinc.; Ep. 185 ad Bonif., Retract. II. 5.). Had he
   foreseen the crusade against the Albigenses and the horrors of the
   Spanish Inquisition, he would have retracted his dangerous opinion. A
   theocratic or Erastian state-church theory--whether Greek Catholic or
   Roman Catholic or Protestant--makes all offences against the church
   offences against the state, and requires their punishment with more or
   less severity according to the prevailing degree of zeal for orthodoxy
   and hatred of heresy. But in the overruling Providence of God which
   brings good out of every evil, the bloody persecution of heretics--one
   of the darkest chapters in church history--has produced the sweet fruit
   of religious liberty. See vol. III. 138-146.

   § 138. The Holy Scriptures and the Canon.

   The works on the Canon by Reuss, Westcott, (6th ed., 1889), Zahn,
   (1888). Holtzmann: Kanon u. Tradition, 1859. Schaff: Companion to the
   Greek Testament and the English Version. N. York and London, 1883;
   third ed. 1888. Gregory: Prolegomena to Tischendorf's 8th ed. of the
   Greek Test. Lips., 1884. A. Harnack: Das N. Test. um das jahr 200.
   Leipz., 1889.

   The question of the source and rule of Christian knowledge lies at the
   foundation of all theology. We therefore notice it here before passing
   to the several doctrines of faith.

   1. This source and this rule of knowledge are the holy scriptures of
   the Old and New Covenants. [938] 38 Here at once arises the inquiry as
   to the number and arrangement of the sacred writings, or the canon, in
   distinction both from the productions of enlightened but not inspired
   church teachers, and from the very numerous and in some cases still
   extant apocryphal works (Gospels, Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypses),
   which were composed in the first four centuries, in the interest of
   heresies or for the satisfaction of idle curiosity, and sent forth
   under the name of an apostle or other eminent person. These apocrypha,
   however, did not all originate with Ebionites and Gnostics; some were
   merely designed either to fill chasms in the history of Jesus and the
   apostles by fictitious stories, or to glorify Christianity by vaticinia
   post eventum, in the way of pious fraud at that time freely allowed.

   The canon of the Old Testament descended to the church from the Jews,
   with the sanction of Christ and the apostles. The Jewish Apocrypha were
   included in the Septuagint and passed from it into Christian versions.
   The, New Testament canon was gradually formed, on the model of the Old,
   in the course of the first four centuries, under the guidance of the
   same Spirit, through whose suggestion the several apostolic books had
   been prepared. The first trace of it appears in 2 Peter 3:15, where a
   collection of Paul's epistles [939] 39 is presumed to exist, and is
   placed by the side of "the other scriptures." [940] 40 The apostolic
   fathers and the earlier apologists commonly appeal, indeed, for the
   divinity of Christianity to the Old Testament, to the oral preaching of
   the apostles, to the living faith of the Christian churches, the
   triumphant death of the martyrs, and the continued miracles. Yet their
   works contain quotations, generally without the name of the author,
   from the most important writings of the apostles, or at least allusions
   to those writings, enough to place their high antiquity and
   ecclesiastical authority beyond all reasonable doubt. [941] 41 The
   heretical canon of the Gnostic Marcion, of the middle of the second
   century, consisting of a mutilated Gospel of Luke and ten of Paul's
   epistles, certainly implies the existence of an orthodox canon at that
   time, as heresy always presupposes truth, of which it is a caricature.

   The principal books of the New Testament, the four Gospels, the Acts,
   the thirteen Epistles of Paul, the first Epistle of Peter, and the
   first of John, which are designated by Eusebius as "Homologumena," were
   in general use in the church after the middle of the second century,
   and acknowledged to be apostolic, inspired by the Spirit of Christ, and
   therefore authoritative and canonical. This is established by the
   testimonies of Justin Martyr, Tatian, Theophilus of Antioch, Irenaeus,
   Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen, of the Syriac Peshito
   (which omits only Jude, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and the Revelation), the
   old Latin Versions (which include all books but 2 Peter, Hebrews, and
   perhaps James and the Fragment of Muratori; [942] 42 also by the
   heretics, and the heathen opponent Celsus--persons and documents which
   represent in this matter the churches in Asia Minor, Italy, Gaul, North
   Africa, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria. We may therefore call these books
   the original canon.

   Concerning the other seven books, the "Antilegomena" of Eusebius, viz.
   the Epistle to the Hebrews, [943] 43 the Apocalypse, [944] 44 the
   second Epistle of Peter, the second and third Epistles of John, the
   Epistle of James, and the Epistle of Jude,--the tradition of the church
   in the time of Eusebius, the beginning of the fourth century, still
   wavered between acceptance and rejection. But of the two oldest
   manuscripts of the Greek Testament which date from the age of Eusebius
   and Constantine, one--the Sinaitic--contains all the twenty-seven
   books, and the other--the Vatican--was probably likewise complete,
   although the last chapters of Hebrews (from Heb.11:14), the Pastoral
   Epistles, Philemon, and Revelation are lost. There was a second class
   of Antilegomena, called by Eusebius "spurious" (notha), consisting of
   several post-apostolic writings, viz. the catholic Epistle of Barnabas,
   the first Epistle of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians, the Epistle of
   Polycarp to the Philippians, the Shepherd of Hermas, the lost
   Apocalypse of Peter, and the Gospel of the Hebrews; which were read at
   least in some churches but were afterwards generally separated from the
   canon. Some of them are even incorporated in the oldest manuscripts of
   the Bible, as the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of
   Hermas (both in the original Greek) in the Codex Sinaiticus, and the
   first Epistle of Clement of Rome in the Codex Alexandrinus.

   The first express definition of the New Testament canon, in the form in
   which it has since been universally retained, comes from two African
   synods, held in 393 at Hippo, and 397 at Carthage, in the presence of
   Augustin, who exerted a commanding influence on all the theological
   questions of his age. By that time, at least, the whole church must
   have already become nearly unanimous as to the number of the canonical
   books; so that there seemed to be no need even of the sanction of a
   general council. The Eastern church, at all events, was entirely
   independent of the North African in the matter. The Council of Laodicea
   (363) gives a list of the books of our New Testament with the exception
   of the Apocalypse. The last canon which contains this list, is probably
   a later addition, yet the long-established ecclesiastical use of all
   the books, with some doubts as to the Apocalypse, is confirmed by the
   scattered testimonies of all the great Nicene and post Nicene fathers,
   as Athanasius (d. 373), Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386), Gregory of
   Nazianzum (d. 389), Epiphanius of Salamis (d. 403), Chrysostom (d.
   407), etc. [945] 45 The name Novum Testamentum, [946] 46 also Novum
   Instrumentum (a juridical term conveying the idea of legal validity),
   occurs first in Tertullian, and came into general use instead of the
   more correct term New Covenant. The books were currently divided into
   two parts, "the Gospel" [947] 47 and "the Apostle," and the Epistles,
   in the second part, into Catholic or General, and Pauline. The Catholic
   canon thus settled remained untouched till the time of the Reformation
   when the question of the Apocrypha and of the Antilegomena was reopened
   and the science of biblical criticism was born. But the most thorough
   investigations of modern times have not been able to unsettle the faith
   of the church in the New Testament, nor ever will.

   2. As to the origin and character of the apostolic writings, the church
   fathers adopted for the New Testament the somewhat mechanical and
   magical theory of inspiration applied by the Jews to the Old; regarding
   the several books as composed with such extraordinary aid from the Holy
   Spirit as secured their freedom from errors (according to Origen, even
   from faults of memory). Yet this was not regarded as excluding the
   writer's own activity and individuality. Irenaeus, for example, sees in
   Paul a peculiar style, which he attributes to the mighty flow of
   thought in his ardent mind. The Alexandrians, however, enlarged the
   idea of inspiration to a doubtful breadth. Clement of Alexandria calls
   the works of Plato inspired, because they contain truth; and he
   considers all that is beautiful and good in history, a breath of the
   infinite, a tone, which the divine Logos draws forth from the lyre of
   the human soul.

   As a production of the inspired organs, of divine revelation, the
   sacred scriptures, without critical distinction between the Old and New
   Covenants, were acknowledged and employed against heretics as an
   infallible source of knowledge and an unerring rule of Christian faith
   and practice. Irenaeus calls the Gospel a pillar and ground of the
   truth. Tertullian demands scripture proof for every doctrine, and
   declares, that heretics cannot stand on pure scriptural ground. In
   Origen's view nothing deserves credit which cannot be confirmed by the
   testimony of scripture.

   3. The exposition of the Bible was at first purely practical, and
   designed for direct edification. The controversy with the Gnostics
   called for a more scientific method. Both the orthodox and heretics,
   after the fashion of the rabbinical and Alexandrian Judaism, made large
   use of allegorical and mystical interpretation, and not rarely lost
   themselves amid the merest fancies and wildest vagaries. The fathers
   generally, with a few exceptions, (Chrysostom and Jerome) had scarcely
   an idea of grammatical and historical exegesis.

   Origen was the first to lay down, in connection with the allegorical
   method of the Jewish Platonist, Philo, a formal theory of
   interpretation, which he carried out in a long series of exegetical
   works remarkable for industry and ingenuity, but meagre in solid
   results. He considered the Bible a living organism, consisting of three
   elements which answer to the body, soul, and spirit of man, after the
   Platonic psychology. Accordingly, he attributed to the scriptures a
   threefold sense; (1) a somatic, literal, or historical sense, furnished
   immediately by the meaning of the words, but only serving as a veil for
   a higher idea; (2) a psychic or moral sense, animating the first, and
   serving for general edification; (3) a pneumatic or mystic, and ideal
   sense, for those who stand on the high ground of philosophical
   knowledge. In the application of this theory he shows the same tendency
   as Philo, to spiritualize away the letter of scripture, especially
   where the plain historical sense seems unworthy, as in the history of
   David's crimes; and instead of simply bringing out the sense of the
   Bible, be puts into it all sorts of foreign ideas and irrelevant
   fancies. But this allegorizing suited the taste of the age, and, with
   his fertile mind and imposing learning, Origen was the exegetical
   oracle of the early church, till his orthodoxy fell into disrepute. He
   is the pioneer, also, in the criticism of the sacred text, and his
   "Hexapla" was the first attempt at a Polyglot Bible.

   In spite of the numberless exegetical vagaries and differences in
   detail, which confute the Tridentine fiction of a "unanimis consensus
   patrum," there is still a certain unanimity among the fathers in their
   way of drawing the most important articles of faith from the
   Scriptures. In their expositions they all follow one dogmatical
   principle, a kind of analogia fidei. This brings us to tradition.

   Notes on the Canon.

   I. The Statements of Eusebius,

   The accounts of Eusebius (d. 340) on the apostolic writings in several
   passages of his Church History (especially III. 25; comp. II. 22, 23;
   III. 3, 24; V. 8; VI. 14, 25) are somewhat vague and inconsistent, yet
   upon the whole they give us the best idea of the state of the canon in
   the first quarter of the fourth century just before the Council of
   Nicaea (325).

   He distinguishes four classes of sacred books of the Christians (H. E.
   III. 25, in Heinichen's ed. vol. I. 130 sqq.; comp. his note in vol.
   III. 87 sqq.).

   1. Homologumena, i.e. such as were universally acknowledged
   (homologoumena): 22 Books of the 27 of the N. T., viz.: 4 Gospels,
   Acts, 14 Pauline Epistles (including Hebrews), 1 Peter, 1 John,
   Revelation. He says: "Having arrived at this point, it is proper that
   we should give a summary catalogue of the afore-mentioned (III. 24)
   writings of the N. T. (Anakephalaiosasthai tas delotheisas tes kaines
   diathekes graphas). First, then, we must place the sacred quaternion
   (or quartette, tetraktun) of the Gospels, which are followed by the
   book of the Acts of the Apostles (he ton praxeon ton apostolon graphe).
   After this we must reckon the Epistles of Paul, and next to them we
   must maintain as genuine (kuroteon, the verb. adj. from kuroo, to
   ratify), the Epistle circulated as the former of John (ten pheromenen
   Ioannou proteran), and in like manner that of Peter (kai homoios ten
   Petrou epistolen). In addition to these books, if it seem proper (eige
   phaneie), we must place the Revelation of John (ten apokalupsin
   Ioannou), concerning which we shall set forth the different opinions in
   due course. And these are reckoned among those which are generally
   received (en homologoumenois)."

   In bk. III. ch. 3, Eusebius speaks of "fourteen Epp." of Paul (tou de
   Paulou prodeloi kai sapheis hai dekatessares,) as commonly received,
   but adds that "some have rejected the Ep. to the Hebrews, saying that
   it was disputed as not being one of Paul's epistles."

   On the Apocalypse, Eusebius vacillates according as he gives the public
   belief of the church or his private opinion. He first counts it among
   the Homologumena, and then, in the same passage (III. 25), among the
   spurious books, but in each case with a qualifying statement (ei
   phaneie), leaving the matter to the judgment of the reader. He rarely
   quotes the book, and usually as the "Apocalypse of John," but in one
   place (III. 39) he intimates that it was probably written by "the
   second John," which must mean the "Presbyter John," so called, as
   distinct from the Apostle--an opinion which has found much favor in the
   Schleiermacher school of critics. Owing to its mysterious character,
   the Apocalypse is, even to this day, the most popular book of the N. T.
   with a few, and the most unpopular with the many. It is as well
   attested as any other book, and the most radical modern critics (Baur,
   Renan) admit its apostolic authorship and composition before the
   destruction of Jerusalem.

   2. Antilegomena, or controverted books, yet "familiar to most people of
   the church" (antilegomena, gnorima d' homos tois pollois, III. 25).
   These are five (or seven), viz., one Epistle of James, one of Jude, 2
   Peter, 2 and 3 John ("whether they really belong to the Evangelist or
   to another John").

   To these we may add (although Eusebius does not do it expressly) the
   Hebrews and the Apocalypse, the former as not being generally
   acknowledged as Pauline, the latter on account of its supposed
   chiliasm, which was offensive to Eusebius and the Alexandrian school.

   3. Spurious Books (notha), such as the Acts of Paul, the Revelation of
   Peter, the Shepherd (Hermas), the Ep. of Barnabas, the so-called
   "Doctrines of the Apostles, " and the Gospel according to the Hebrews."
   in which those Hebrews who have accepted Christ take special delight."

   To these he adds inconsistently, as already remarked, the Apocalypse of
   John." which some, as I said, reject (hen tines athetousin), while
   others reckon it among the books generally received (tois
   homologoumenois)." He ought to have numbered it with the Antilegomena.

   These notha, we may say, correspond to the Apocrypha of the O. T.,
   pious and useful, but not canonical.

   4. Heretical Books. These, Eusebius says, are worse than spurious
   books, and must be "set aside as altogether worthless and impious."
   Among these be mentions the Gospels of Peter, and Thomas, and Matthias,
   the Acts of Andrew, and John, and of the other Apostles.

   II. Ecclesiastical Definitions of the Canon.

   Soon after the middle of the fourth century, when the church became
   firmly settled in the Empire, all doubts as to the Apocrypha of the Old
   Testament and the Antilegomena of the New ceased, and the acceptance of
   the Canon in its Catholic shape, which includes both, became an article
   of faith. The first OEcumenical Council of Nicaea did not settle the
   canon, as one might expect, but the scriptures were regarded without
   controversy as the sure and immovable foundation of the orthodox faith.
   In the last (20th or 21st) Canon of the Synod of Gangra, in Asia Minor
   (about the middle of the fourth century), it is said: "To speak
   briefly, we desire that what has been handed down to us by the divine
   scriptures and the Apostolic traditions should be observed in the
   church." Comp. Hefele, Conciliengesch. I. 789.

   The first Council which expressly legislated on the number of canonical
   books is that of Laodicea in Phrygia, in Asia Minor (held between a.d.
   343 and 381, probably about 363). In its last canon (60 or 59), it
   enumerates the canonical books of the Old Testament, and then all of
   the New, with the exception of the Apocalypse, in the following order:

   "And these are the Books of the New Testament: Four Gospels, according
   to Matthew, according to Mark, according to Luke, according to John;
   Acts of the Apostles; Seven Catholic Epistles, One of James, Two of
   Peter, Three of John, One of Jude; Fourteen Epistles of Paul, One to
   the Romans, Two to the Corinthians, One to the Galatians, One to the
   Ephesians, One to the Philippians, One to the Colossians, Two to the
   Thessalonians, One to the Hebrews, Two to Timothy, One to Titus, and
   One to Philemon."

   This catalogue is omitted in several manuscripts and versions, and
   probably is a later insertion from the writings of Cyril of Jerusalem.
   Spittler, Herbst, and Westcott deny, Schrökh and Hefele defend, the
   Laodicean origin of this catalogue. It resembles that of the 85th of
   the Apostolical Canons which likewise omits the Apocalypse, but inserts
   two Epistles of Clement and the pseudo-Apostolical Constitutions.

   On the Laodicean Council and its uncertain date see Hefele,
   Conciliengeschichte, revised ed. vol. I. p. 746 sqq., and Westcott, on
   the Canon of the N. T., second ed., p. 382 sqq.

   In the Western church, the third provincial Council of Carthage (held
   a.d. 397) gave a full list of the canonical books of both Testaments,
   which should be read as divine Scriptures to the exclusion of all
   others in the churches. The N. T. books are enumerated in the following
   order: "Four Books of the Gospels, One Book of the Acts of the
   Apostles, Thirteen Epp. of the Apostle Paul, One Ep. of the same
   [Apostle] to the Hebrews, Two Epistles of the Apostle Peter, Three of
   John, One of James, One of Jude, One Book of the Apocalypse of John."
   This canon bad been previously adopted by the African Synod of Hippo
   regius, a.d. 393, at which Augustin, then presbyter, delivered his
   discourse De Fide et Symbolo. The acts of that Council are lost, but
   they were readopted by the third council of Carthage, which consisted
   only of forty-three African bishops, and can claim no general
   authority. (See Westcott, p. 391, Charteris, p. 20, and Hefele, II. 53
   and 68, revised ed.)

   Augustin, (who was present at both Councils), and Jerome (who
   translated the Latin Bible at the request of Pope Damasus of Rome)
   exerted a decisive influence in settling the Canon for the Latin
   church.

   The Council of Trent (1546) confirmed the traditional view with an
   anathema on those who dissent. "This fatal decree," says Dr. Westcott
   (p. 426 sq.), "was ratified by fifty-three prelates, among whom was not
   one German, not one scholar distinguished for historical learning, not
   one who was fitted by special study for the examination of a subject in
   which the truth could only be determined by the voice of antiquity."

   For the Greek and Roman churches the question of the Canon is closed,
   although no strictly oecumenical council representing the entire church
   has pronounced on it. But Protestantism claims the liberty of the
   ante-Nicene age and the right of renewed investigation into the origin
   and history of every book of the Bible. Without this liberty there can
   be no real progress in exegetical theology.

   Besides appealing to the Scriptures, the fathers, particularly Irenaeus
   and Tertullian, refer with equal confidence to the "rule of faith;"
   [948] 48 that is, the common faith of the church, as orally handed down
   in the unbroken succession of bishops from Christ and his apostles to
   their day, and above all as still living in the original apostolic
   churches, like those of Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, and Rome.
   Tradition is thus intimately connected with the primitive episcopate.
   The latter was the vehicle of the former, and both were looked upon as
   bulwarks against heresy.

   Irenaeus confronts the secret tradition of the Gnostics with the open
   and unadulterated tradition of the catholic church, and points to all
   churches, but particularly to Rome, as the visible centre of the unity
   of doctrine. All who would know the truth, says he, can see in the
   whole church the tradition of the apostles; and we can count the
   bishops ordained by the apostles, and their successors down to our
   time, who neither taught nor knew any such heresies. Then, by way of
   example, he cites the first twelve bishops of the Roman church from
   Linus to Eleutherus, as witnesses of the pure apostolic doctrine. He
   might conceive of a Christianity without scripture, but he could not
   imagine a Christianity without living tradition; and for this opinion
   he refers to barbarian tribes, who have the gospel, "sine charta et
   atramento," written in their hearts.

   Tertullian finds a universal antidote for all heresy in his celebrated
   prescription argument, which cuts off heretics, at the outset, from
   every right of appeal to the holy scriptures, on the ground, that the
   holy scriptures arose in the church of Christ, were given to her, and
   only in her and by her can be rightly understood. He calls attention
   also here to the tangible succession, which distinguishes the catholic
   church from the arbitrary and ever-changing sects of heretics, and
   which in all the principal congregations, especially in the original
   sects of the apostles, reaches back without a break from bishop to
   bishop, to the apostles themselves, from the apostles to Christ, and
   from Christ to God. "Come, now," says he, in his tract on Prescription,
   "if you would practise inquiry to more advantage in the matter of your
   salvation, go through the apostolic churches, in which the very chairs
   of the apostles still preside, in which their own authentic letters are
   publicly read, uttering the voice and representing the face of every
   one. If Achaia is nearest, you have Corinth. If you are not far from
   Macedonia, you have Philippi, you have Thessalonica. If you can go to
   Asia, you have Ephesus. But if you live near Italy, you have Rome,
   whence also we [of the African church] derive our origin. How happy is
   the church, to which the apostles poured out their whole doctrine with
   their blood," etc.

   To estimate the weight of this argument, we must remember that these
   fathers still stood comparatively very near the apostolic age, and that
   the succession of bishops in the oldest churches could be demonstrated
   by the living memory of two or three generations. Irenaeus in fact, had
   been acquainted in his youth with Polycarp, a disciple of St. John. But
   for this very reason we must guard against overrating this testimony,
   and employing it in behalf of traditions of later origin, not grounded
   in the scriptures.

   Nor can we suppose that those fathers ever thought of a blind and
   slavish subjection of private judgment to ecclesiastical authority, and
   to the decision of the bishops of the apostolic mother churches. The
   same Irenaeus frankly opposed the Roman bishop Victor. Tertullian,
   though he continued essentially orthodox, contested various points with
   the catholic church from his later Montanistic position, and laid down,
   though at first only in respect to a conventional custom--the veiling
   of virgins--the genuine Protestant principle, that the thing to be
   regarded, especially in matters of religion, is not custom but truth.
   [949] 49 His pupil, Cyprian, with whom biblical and catholic were
   almost interchangeable terms, protested earnestly against the Roman
   theory of the validity of heretical baptism, and in this controversy
   declared, in exact accordance with Tertullian, that custom without
   truth was only time-honored error. [950] 50 The Alexandrians freely
   fostered all sorts of peculiar views, which were afterwards rejected as
   heretical; and though the paradosis apostolike plays a prominent part
   with them, yet this and similar expressions have in their language a
   different sense, sometimes meaning simply the holy scriptures. So, for
   example, in the well-known passage of Clement: "As if one should be
   changed from a man to a beast after the manner of one charmed by Circe;
   so a man ceases to be God's and to continue faithful to the Lord, when
   he sets himself up against the church tradition, and flies off to
   positions of human caprice."

   In the substance of its doctrine this apostolic tradition agrees with
   the holy scriptures, and though derived, as to its form, from the oral
   preaching of the apostles, is really, as to its contents, one and the
   same with thsoe apostolic writings. In this view the apparent
   contradictions of the earlier fathers, in ascribing the highest
   authority to both scripture and tradition in matters of faith, resolve
   themselves. It is one and the same gospel which the apostles preached
   with their lips, and then laid down in their writings, and which the
   church faithfully hands down by word and writing from one generation to
   another.. [951] 51

   Pharisees. Comp. Matt. 15:2, 6; Mark 7:3, 5, 9, 13; Gal. 1:14; Col.
   2:8. The Reformers attached the same censure to the mediaeval tradition
   of the Roman church, which obscured and virtually set aside the written
   word of God.

   In the narrower sense, by apostolic tradition or the rule of faith
   (kanon tes pisteos, regula fidei) was understood a doctrinal summary of
   Christianity, or a compend of the faith of the church. Such a summary
   grew out of the necessity of catechetical instruction and a public
   confession of candidates for baptism. It became equivalent to a
   symbolum, that is, a sign of recognition among catholic Christians in
   distinction from unbelievers and heretics. The confession of Peter
   (Matt. 16:16 gave the key-note, and the baptismal formula (Matt. 28:19)
   furnished the trinitarian frame-work of the earliest creeds or
   baptismal confessions of Christendom.

   There was at first no prescribed formula of faith binding upon all
   believers. Each of the leading churches framed its creed (in a sort of
   independent congregational way), according to its wants, though on the
   same basis of the baptismal formula, and possibly after the model of a
   brief archetype which may have come down from apostolic days. Hence we
   have a variety of such rules of faith, or rather fragmentary accounts
   of them, longer or shorter, declarative or interrogative, in the
   ante-Nicene writers, as Irenaeus of Lyons (180), Tertullian of Carthage
   (200), Cyprian of Carthage (250), Novatian of Rome (250), Origen of
   Alexandria (250), Gregory Thaumaturgus (270), Lucian of Antioch (300),
   Eusebius of Caesarea (325), Marcellus of Ancyra (340), Cyril of
   Jerusalem (350), Epiphanius of Cyprus (374), Rufinus of Aquileja (390),
   and in the Apostolic Constitutions). [952] 52 Yet with all the
   differences in form and extent there is a substantial agreement, so
   that Tertullian could say that the regula fidei was "una omnino, sola
   immobilis et irreformabilis." They are variations of the same theme. We
   may refer for illustration of the variety and unity to the numerous
   orthodox and congregational creeds of the Puritan churches in New
   England, which are based upon the Westminster standards.

   The Oriental forms are generally longer, more variable and
   metaphysical, than the Western, and include a number of dogmatic terms
   against heretical doctrines which abounded in the East. They were all
   replaced at last by the Nicene Creed (325, 381, and 451), which was
   clothed with the authority of oecumenical councils and remains to this
   day the fundamental Creed of the Greek Church. Strictly speaking it is
   the only oecumenical Creed of Christendom, having been adopted also in
   the West, though with a clause (Filioque) which has become a wall of
   division. We shall return to it in the next volume.

   The Western forms--North African, Gallican, Italian--are shorter and
   simpler, have less variety, and show a more uniform type. They were all
   merged into the Roman Symbol, which became and remains to this day the
   fundamental creed of the Latin Church and her daughters.

   This Roman symbol is known more particularly under the honored name of
   the Apostles' Creed. For a long time it was believed (and is still
   believed by many in the Roman church) to be the product of the Apostles
   who prepared it as a summary of their teaching before parting from
   Jerusalem (each contributing one of the twelve articles by higher
   inspiration). [953] 53 This tradition which took its rise in the fourth
   century, [954] 54is set aside by the variations of the ante-Nicene
   creeds and of the Apostles' Creed itself. Had the Apostles composed
   such a document, it would have been scrupulously handed down without
   alteration. The creed which bears this name is undoubtedly a gradual
   growth. We have it in two forms.

   The earlier form as found in old manuscripts, [955] 55is much shorter
   and may possibly go back to the third or even the second century. It
   was probably imported from the East, or grew in Rome, and is
   substantially identical with the Greek creed of Marcellus of Ancyra
   (about 340), inserted in his letter to Pope Julius I. to prove his
   orthodoxy, [956] 56and with that contained in the Psalter of King
   Aethelstan.. [957] 57 Greek was the ruling language of the Roman Church
   and literature down to the third century.. [958] 58

   The longer form of the Roman symbol, or the present received text, does
   not appear before the sixth or seventh century. It has several
   important clauses which were wanting in the former, as "he descended
   into hades," [959] 59 the predicate "catholic" after ecclesiam, [960]
   60 "the communion of saints," [961] 61 and "the life everlasting."
   [962] 62 These additions were gathered from the provincial versions
   (Gallican and North African) and incorporated into the older form.

   The Apostles' Creed then, in its present shape, is post-apostolic; but,
   in its contents and spirit, truly apostolic. It embodies the faith of
   the ante-Nicene church, and is the product of a secondary inspiration,
   like the Gloria in Excelsis and the Te deum, which embody the devotions
   of the same age, and which likewise cannot be traced to an individual
   author or authors. It follows the historical order of revelation of the
   triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, beginning with the creation
   and ending with the resurrection and life eternal. It clusters around
   Christ as the central article of our faith. It sets forth living facts,
   not abstract dogmas and speaks in the language of the people, not of
   the theological school. It confines itself to the fundamental truths,
   is simple, brief, and yet comprehensive, and admirably adapted for
   catechetical and liturgical use. It still forms a living bond of union
   between the different ages and branches of orthodox Christendom,
   however widely they differ from each other, and can never be superseded
   by longer and fuller creeds, however necessary these are in their
   place. It has the authority of antiquity and the dew of perennial
   youth, beyond any other document of post-apostolic times. It is the
   only strictly OEcumenical Creed of the West, as the Nicene Creed is the
   only OEcumenical Creed of the East. [963] 63 It is the Creed of creeds,
   as the Lord's Prayer is the Prayer of prayers.

   Note.

   The legendary formulas of the Apostles' Creed which appear after the
   sixth century, distribute the articles to the several apostles
   arbitrarily and with some variations. The following is from one of the
   pseudo-Augustinian sermons (see Hahn, p. 47 sq.):

   "Decimo die post ascensionem discipulis prae timore Judaeorum
   congregatis Dominus promissum Paracletum misit: quo veniente ut candens
   ferrum inflammati omniumque linguarum peritia repleti Symbolum
   composuerunt.

   Petrus dixit: Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem--creatorem coeli et
   terrae.

   Andreas dixit: Et in Jesum Christum, Filium ejus--unicum Dominum
   nostrum.

   Jacobus dixit: Qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto--natus ex Maria
   Virgine.

   Joannes dixit: Passus sub Pontio Pilato--crucifixus, mortuus et
   sepultus.

   Thomas dixit: Descendit ad inferna--tertia die resurrexit a mortuis.

   Jacobus dixit: Adscendit ad coelos--sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris
   omnipotentis.

   Philippus dixit: Inde venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos.

   Bartholomaeus dixit: Credo in Spiritum Sanctum.

   Matthaeus dixit: Sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam--Sanctorum communionem.

   Simon dixit: Remissionem peccatorum.

   Thaddeus dixit: Carnis resurrectionem.

   Matthias dixit: Vitam aeternam."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [952] See a collection of these ante-Nicene rules of faith in Hahn,
   Denzinger, Heurtley, Caspari, and Schaff (II.11-41).

   [953] This obsolete opinion, first mentioned by Ambrose and Rufinus is
   still defended by Pet. Meyers, l.c. and by Abbé Martigny in his French
   Dictionary of Christ. Antiquities (sub Symbole des apôtres. Longfellow,
   in his Divine Tragedy (1871) makes poetic use of it, and arranges the
   Creed in twelve articles, with the names of the supposed apostolic
   authors. The apostolic origin was first called in question by
   Laurentius Valla, Erasmus, and Calvin. See particulars in Schaff's
   Creeds I. 22-23.

   [954] Rufinus speaks of it as an ancestral tradition (tradunt majores
   nostri) and supports it by a false explanation of symbolum, as
   "collatio, hoc est quod plures in unum conferunt." See Migne, XXI. fol.
   337.

   [955] In the Graeco-Latin Codex Laudianus (Cod. E of the Acts) in the
   Bodleian Library at Oxford, from the sixth century, and known to the
   Venerable Bede (731). The Creed is attached at the end, is written in
   uncial letters, and was first made known by Archbishop Ussher. Heurtley
   (p. 61 sq.) gives a facsimile. It is reprinted in Caspari, Hahn (second
   ed. p. 16), and Schaff (II. 47). Another copy is found in a MS. of the
   eighth century in the British Museum, published by Swainson, The Nic.
   and Ap. Creeds, p. 161, and by Hahn in a Nachtrag to the Preface, p.
   xvi. This document, however, inserts catholicam after ecclesiam. Comp.
   also the form in the Explanatio Symboli ad initiandos, by Ambrose in
   Caspari, II. 48 and 128, and Schaff, II. 50. The Creed of Aquileja, as
   given by Rufinus, has a few additions, but marks them as such so that
   we can infer from it the words of the Roman Creed. With these Latin
   documents agree the Greek in the Psalterium of King Aethelstan, and of
   Marcellus (see next note).

   [956] In Epiphanius, Haer. LXXII. it is assigned to a.d. 341, by others
   to 337. It is printed in Schaff (II. 47), Hahn, and in the first table
   below. It contains, according to Caspari, the original form of the
   Roman creed as current at the time in the Greek portion of the Roman
   congregation. It differs from the oldest Latin form only by the
   omission of patera, and the addition of zoen aionion

   [957] The Psalterium Aethelstani, in the Cotton Library of the British
   Museum, written in Anglo-Saxon letters, first published by Ussher, then
   by Heurtley, Caspari, and Hahn (p. 15). It differs from the text of
   Marcellus by the insertion of patera and the omission of zoen aionion,
   in both points agreeing with the Latin text.

   [958] On the Greek original of the Roman symbol Caspari's researches
   (III. 267-466) are conclusive. Harnack (in Herzog 2, vol. I. 567)
   agrees: "Der griechische Text ist als das Original zu betrachten;
   griechisch wurde das Symbol zu Rom eine lange Zeit hindurch
   ausschliesslich tradirt. Dann trat der lateinisch übersetzte Text als
   Parallelform hinzu." Both are disposed to trace the symbol to Johannean
   circles in Asia Minor on account of the term "only begotten,
   (monogenes), which is used of Christ only by John.

   [959] Descendit ad inferna, first found in Arian Creeds (eis hadou or
   eis haden) about a.d. 360; then in the Creed of Aquileja, about a.d.
   390; then in the Creed of Venantius Fortunatus, 590, in the
   Sacramentarium Gallicanum, 650, and in the ultimate text of the
   Apostles' Creed in Pirminius, 750. See the table in Schaff's Creeds,
   II. 54, and critical note on p. 46. Rufinus says expressly that this
   clause was not contained in the Roman creed and explains it wrongly as
   being identical with "buried." Com. c. 18 (in Migne, f. 356): "Sciendum
   sane est, quod in Ecclesiae Romanae Symbolo non habetur additum,
   'descendit ad inferna:' sed neque in Orientis Ecclesiis habetur hic
   sermo: via tamen verbi eadem videtur esse in eo, quod 'sepultis
   dicitur.'" The article of the descent is based upon Peter's teaching,
   Acts 2: 31 ("he was not left in Hades," eis hadou, consequently he was
   there); 1 Pet. 3:19; 4:6; and the promise of Christ to the, dying
   robber, Luke 23:34 (" to day thou shalt be with Me in paradise," en to
   paradeiso), and undoubtedly means a self exhibition of Christ to the
   spirits of the departed. The translation " descended into hell" is
   unfortunate and misleading. We do not know whether Christ was in hell;
   but we do know from his own lips that he was in paradise between his
   death and resurrection. The term Hades is much more comprehensive than
   Hell (Gehenna), which is confined to the state and place of the lost.

   [960] It is found first in the Sacramentarium Gallicanum, 650. The
   older creeds of Cyprian, Rufinus, Augustin, read simply sanctam
   ecclesiam, Marcellus agian ekklesian

   [961] Sanctorum communionem. After 650.

   [962] Contained in Marcellus and Augustin, but wanting in Rufinus and
   in the Psalter of Aethelstan. See on all these additions and their
   probable date the tables in my Creeds of Christendom, II. 54 and 55.

   [963] We usually speak of three OEcumenical creeds; but the Greek
   church has never adopted the Apostles' Creed and the Athanasian Creed,
   although she holds the doctrines therein contained. The Nicene Creed
   was adopted in the West, and so far is universal, but the insertion of
   the formula Filioque created and perpetuates the split between the
   Greek and Latin churches.

   § 142. God and the Creation.

   E. Wilh. Möller: Geschichte der Kosmologie in der griechischen Kirche
   bis auf Origenes. Halle, 1860. p. 112-188; 474-560. The greater part of
   this learned work is devoted to the cosmological theories of the
   Gnostics.

   In exhibiting the several doctrines of the church, we must ever bear in
   mind that Christianity entered the world, not as a logical system but
   as a divine-hurnan fact; and that the New Testament is not only a
   theological text-book for scholars but first and last a book of life
   for all believers. The doctrines of salvation, of course, lie in these
   facts of salvation, but in a concrete, living, ever fresh, and popular
   form. The logical, scientific development of those doctrines from the
   word of God and Christian experience is left to the theologians. Hence
   we must not be surprised to find in the period before us, even in the
   most eminent teachers, a very indefinite and defective knowledge, as
   yet, of important articles of faith, whose practical force those
   teachers felt in their own hearts and impressed on others, as earnestly
   as their most orthodox successors. The centre of Christianity is the
   divine-human person and the divine-human work of Christ. From that
   centre a change passed through the whole circle of existing religious
   ideas, in its first principles and its last results, confirming what
   was true in the earlier religion, and rejecting the false.

   Almost all the creeds of the first centuries, especially the Apostles'
   and the Nicene, begin with confession of faith in God, the Father
   Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, of the visible and the invisible.
   With the defence of this fundamental doctrine laid down in the very
   first chapter of the Bible, Irenaeus opens his refutation of the
   Gnostic heresies. He would not have believed the Lord himself, if he
   had announced any other God than the Creator. He repudiates everything
   like an a priori construction of the idea of God, and bases his
   knowledge wholly on revelation and Christian experience.

   We begin with the general idea of God, which lies at the bottom of all
   religion. This is refined, spiritualized, and invigorated by the
   manifestation in Christ. We perceive the advance particularly in
   Tertullian's view of the irresistible leaning of the human soul towards
   God, and towards the only true God. "God will never be hidden", says
   he, "God will never fail mankind; he will always be recognized, always
   perceived, and seen, when man wishes. God has made all that we are, and
   all in which we are, a witness of himself. Thus he proves himself God,
   and the one God, by his being known to all; since another must first be
   proved. The sense of God is the original dowry of the soul; the same,
   and no other, in Egypt, in Syria, and in Pontus; for the God of the
   Jews all souls call their God." But nature also testifies of God. It is
   the work of his hand, and in itself good; not as the Gnostics taught, a
   product of matter, or of the devil, and intrinsically bad. Except as he
   reveals himself, God is, according to Irenaeus, absolutely hidden and
   incomprehensible. But in creation and redemption he has communicated
   himself, and can, therefore, not remain entirely concealed from any
   man.

   Of the various arguments for the existence of God, we find in this
   period the beginnings of the cosmological and physico-theological
   methods. In the mode of conceiving the divine nature we observe this
   difference; while the Alexandrians try to avoid all anthropomorphic and
   anthropopathic notions, and insist on the immateriality and
   spirituality of God almost to abstraction, Tertullian ascribes to him
   even corporeality; though probably, as he considers the non-existent
   alone absolutely incorporeal, he intends by corporeality only to denote
   the substantiality and concrete personality of the Supreme Being..
   [966] 66

   The doctrine of the unity of God, as the eternal, almighty,
   omnipresent, just, and holy creator and upholder of all things, the
   Christian church inherited from Judaism, and vindicated against the
   absurd polytheism of the pagans, and particularly against the dualism
   of tile Gnostics, which supposed matter co-eternal with God, and
   attributed the creation of the world to the intermediate Demiurge. This
   dualism was only another form of polytheism, which excludes
   absoluteness, and with it all proper idea of God.

   As to creation: Irenaeus and Tertullian most firmly rejected the
   hylozoic and demiurgic views of paganism and Gnosticism, and taught,
   according to the book of Genesis, that God made the world, including
   matter, not, of course, out of any material, but out of nothing or, to
   express it positively, out of his free, almighty will, by his word.
   [967] 67 This free will of God, a will of love, is the supreme,
   absolutely unconditioned, and all-conditioning cause and final reason
   of all existence, precluding every idea of physical force or of
   emanation. Every creature, since it proceeds from the good and holy
   God, is in itself, as to its essence, good.. [968] 68 Evil, therefore,
   is not an original and substantial entity, but a corruption of nature,
   and hence can be destroyed by the power of redemption. Without a
   correct doctrine of creation there can be no true doctrine of
   redemption, as all the Gnostic systems show.

   Origen's view of an eternal creation is peculiar. His thought is not so
   much that of all endless succession of new worlds, as that of ever new
   metamorphoses of the original world, revealing from the beginning the
   almighty power, wisdom and goodness of God. With this is connected his
   Platonic view of the pre-existence of the soul. He starts from the idea
   of an intimate relationship between God and the world and represents
   the latter as a necessary revelation of the former. It would be impious
   and absurd to maintain that there was a time when God did not show
   forth his essential attributes which make up his very being. He was
   never idle or quiescent. God's being is identical with his goodness and
   love, and his will is identical with his nature. He must create
   according to his nature, and he will create. Hence what is a necessity
   is at the same time a free act. Each world has a beginning, and an end
   which are comprehended in the divine Providence. But what was before
   the first world? Origen connects the idea of time with that of the
   world, but cannot get beyond the idea of an endless succession of time.
   God's eternity is above time, and yet fills all time. Origen mediates
   the transition from God to the world by the eternal generation of the
   Logos who is the express image of the Father and through whom God
   creates first the spiritual and then the material world. And his
   generation is itself a continued process; God always (aei) begets his
   Son, and never was without his Son as little as the Son is without the
   Father. [969] 69

   § 143. Man and the Fall.

   It was the universal faith of the church that man was made in the image
   of God, pure and holy, and fell by his own guilt and the temptation of
   Satan who himself fell from his original state. But the extent of sin
   and the consequences of the fall were not fully discussed before the
   Pelagian controversy in the fifth century. The same is true of the
   metaphysical problem concerning the origin of the human soul. Yet three
   theories appear already in germ.

   Tertullian is the author of traducianism, [970] 70 which derives soul
   and body from the parents through the process of generation.. [971] 71
   It assumes that God's creation de nihilo was finished on the sixth day,
   and that Adam's soul was endowed with the power of reproducing itself
   in individual souls, just as the first created seed in the vegetable
   world has the power of reproduction in its own kind. Most Western
   divines followed Tertullian in this theory because it most easily
   explains the propagation of original sin by generation, [972] 72 but it
   materializes sin which originates in the mind. Adam had fallen inwardly
   by doubt and disobedience before he ate of the forbidden fruit.

   The Aristotelian theory of creationism traces the origin of each
   individual soul to a direct agency of God and assumes a subsequent
   corruption of the soul by its contact with the body, but destroys the
   organic unity of soul and body, and derives sin from the material part.
   It was advocated by Eastern divines, and by Jerome in the West.
   Augustin wavered between the two theories, and the church has never
   decided the question.

   The third theory, that of pre-existence, was taught by Origen, as
   before by Plato and Philo. It assumes the pre-historic existence and
   fall of every human being, and thus accounts for original sin and
   individual guilt; but as it has no support in scripture or human
   consciousness--except in an ideal sense--it was condemned under
   Justinian, as one of the Origenistic heresies. Nevertheless it has been
   revived from time to time as an isolated speculative opinion. [973] 73

   The cause of the Christian faith demanded the assertion both of man's
   need of redemption, against Epicurean levity and Stoical
   self-sufficiency, and man's capacity for redemption, against the
   Gnostic and Manichaean idea of the intrinsic evil of nature, and
   against every form of fatalism.

   The Greek fathers, especially the Alexandrian, are very strenuous for
   the freedom of the will, as the ground of the accountability and the
   whole moral nature of man, and as indispensable to the distinction of
   virtue and vice. It was impaired and weakened by the fall, but not
   destroyed. In the case of Origen freedom of choice is the main pillar
   of his theological system. Irenaeus and Hippolytus cannot conceive of
   man without the two inseparable predicates of intelligence and freedom.
   And Tertullian asserts expressly, against Marcion and Hermogenes, free
   will as one of the innate properties of the soul, [974] 74 like its
   derivation from God, immortality, instinct of dominion, and power of
   divination. [975] 75 On the other side, however, Irenaeus, by his
   Pauline doctrine of the casual connection of the original sin of Adam
   with the sinfulness of the whole race, and especially Tertullian, by
   his view of hereditary sin and its propagation by generation, looked
   towards the Augustinian system which the greatest of the Latin fathers
   developed in his controversy with the Pelagian heresy, and which
   exerted such a powerful influence upon the Reformers, but had no effect
   whatever on the Oriental church and was practically disowned in part by
   the church of Rome. [976] 76

   two substances can be alone regarded as the cause of the sex (ita

   pp. 357 sqq, , Comp. pp. 73, 147, 397). He assumes that man in a
   transcendental, pre-temporal or extratemporal existence, by an act of
   free self-decision, fixed his moral character and fate for his present
   life. This conclusion, he thinks, reconciles the fact of the
   universalness of sin with that of individual guilt, and accords with
   the unfathomable depth of our consciousness of guilt and the mystery of
   that inextinguishable melancholy and sadness which is most profound in
   the noblest natures. But Müller found no response, and was opposed by
   Rothe, Dorner, and others. In America, the theory of pre-existence was
   independently advocated by Dr. Edward Beecher in his book: The Conflict
   of Ages. Boston, 1853.

   The Messiahship and Divine Sonship of Jesus of Nazareth, first
   confessed by Peter in the name of all the apostles and the
   eye-witnesses of the divine glory of his person and his work, as the
   most sacred and precious fact of their experience, and after the
   resurrection adoringly acknowledged by the sceptical Thomas in that
   exclamation, "My Lord and my God!"--is the foundation stone of the
   Christian church; [977] 77 and the denial of the mystery of the
   incarnation is the mark of antichristian heresy. [978] 78

   The whole theological energy of the ante-Nicene period concentrated
   itself, therefore, upon the doctrine of Christ as the God-man and
   Redeemer of the world. This doctrine was the kernel of all the
   baptismal creeds, and was stamped upon the entire life, constitution
   and worship of the early church. It was not only expressly asserted by
   the fathers against heretics, but also professed in the daily and
   weekly worship, in the celebration of baptism, the eucharist and the
   annual festivals, especially Easter. It was embodied in prayers,
   doxologies and hymns of praise. From the earliest record Christ was the
   object not of admiration which is given to finite persons and things,
   and presupposes equality, but of prayer, praise and adoration which is
   due only to an infinite, uncreated, divine being. This is evident from
   several passages of the New Testament, [979] 79 from the favorite
   symbol of the early Christians, the Ichthys, [980] 80 from the
   Tersanctus, the Gloria in Excelsis, the hymn of Clement of Alexandria
   in praise of the Logos, [981] 81 from the testimony of Origen, who
   says: "We sing hymns to the Most High alone, and His Only Begotten, who
   is the Word and God; and we praise God and His Only Begotten;" [982] 82
   and from the heathen testimony of the younger Pliny who reports to the
   Emperor Trajan that the Christians in Asia were in the habit of singing
   "hymns to Christ as their God." [983] 83  Eusebius, quoting from an
   earlier writer (probably Hippolytus) against the heresy of Artemon,
   refers to the testimonies of Justin, Miltiades, Tatian, Clement, and
   "many others" for the divinity of Christ, and asks: "Who knows not the
   works of Irenaeus and Melito, and the rest, in which Christ is
   announced as God and man? Whatever psalms and hymns of the brethren
   were written by the faithful from the beginning, celebrate Christ as
   the Word of God, by asserting his divinity." [984] 84 The same faith
   was sealed by the sufferings and death of "the noble army" of
   confessors and martyrs, who confessed Christ to be God, and died for
   Christ as God. [985] 85

   Life and worship anticipated theology, and Christian experience
   contained more than divines could in clear words express. So a child
   may worship the Saviour and pray to Him long before he can give a
   rational account of his faith. The instinct of the Christian people was
   always in the right direction, and it is unfair to make them
   responsible for the speculative crudities, the experimental and
   tentative statements of some of the ante-Nicene teachers. The divinity
   of Christ then, and with this the divinity of the Holy Spirit, were
   from the first immovably fixed in the mind and heart of the Christian
   Church as a central article of faith.

   But the logical definition of this divinity, and of its relation to the
   Old Testament fundamental doctrine of the unity of the divine essence
   in a word, the church dogma of the trinity was the work of three
   centuries, and was fairly accomplished only in the Nicene age. In the
   first efforts of reason to grapple with these unfathomable mysteries,
   we must expect mistakes, crudities, and inaccuracies of every kind.

   In the Apostolic Fathers we find for the most part only the simple
   biblical statements of the deity and humanity of Christ, in the
   practical form needed for general edification. Of those fathers
   Ignatius is most deeply imbued with the conviction, that the crucified
   Jesus is God incarnate, and indeed frequently calls him, without
   qualification, God. [986] 86

   The scientific development of Christology begins with Justin and
   culminates in Origen. From Origen then proceed two opposite modes of
   conception, the Athanasian and the Arian; the former at last triumphs
   in the council of Nicaea a.d. 325, and confirms its victory in the
   council of Constantinople, 381. In the Arian controversy the
   ante-Nicene conflicts on this vital doctrine came to a head and final
   settlement.

   The doctrine of the Incarnation involves three elements: the divine
   nature of Christ; his human nature; and the relation of the two to his
   undivided personality.

   § 145. The Divinity of Christ.

   The dogma of the Divinity of Christ is the centre of interest. It comes
   into the foreground, not only against rationalistic Monarchianism and
   Ebionism, which degrade Christ to a second Moses, but also against
   Gnosticism, which, though it holds him to be superhuman, still puts him
   on a level with other aeons of the ideal world, and thus, by endlessly
   multiplying sons of God, after the manner of the heathen mythology,
   pantheistically dilutes and destroys all idea of a specific sonship.
   The development of this dogma started from the Old Testament idea of
   the word and the wisdom of God; from the Jewish Platonism of
   Alexandria; above all, from the Christology of Paul, and from the
   Logos-doctrine of John. This view of John gave a mighty impulse to
   Christian speculation, and furnished it ever fresh material. It was the
   form under which all the Greek fathers conceived the divine nature and
   divine dignity of Christ before his incarnation. The term Logos was
   peculiarly serviceable here, from its well-known double meaning of
   "reason" and "word," ratio and oratio; though in John it is evidently
   used in the latter sense alone. [987] 87

   Justin Martyr developed the first Christology, though not as a novelty,
   but in the consciousness of its being generally held by Christians.
   [988] 88 Following the suggestion of the double meaning of Logos and
   the precedent of a similar distinction by Philo, be distinguishes in
   the Logos, that is, the divine being of Christ, two elements: the
   immanent, or that which determines the revelation of God to himself
   within himself; [989] 89 and the transitive, in virtue of which God
   reveals himself outwardly. [990] 90 The act of the procession of the
   Logos from God [991] 91 he illustrates by the figure of generation,
   [992] 92 without division or diminution of the divine substance; and in
   this view the Logos is the only and absolute Son of God, the
   only-begotten. The generation, however, is not with him an eternal act,
   grounded in metaphysical necessity, as with Athanasius in the later
   church doctrine. It took place before the creation of the world, and
   proceeded from the free will of God. [993] 93 This begotten
   ante-mundane (though it would seem not strictly eternal) Logos he
   conceives as a hypostatical being, a person numerically distinct from
   the Father; and to the agency of this person before his incarnation
   [994] 94 Justin attributes the creation and support of the universe all
   the theophanies (Christophanies) of the Old Testament, and all that is
   true and rational in the world. Christ is the Reason of reasons, the
   incarnation of the absolute and eternal reason. He is a true object of
   worship. In his efforts to reconcile this view with monotheism, he at
   one time asserts the moral unity of the two divine persons, and at
   another decidedly subordinates the Son to the Father. Justin thus
   combines hypostasianism, or the theory of the independent, personal
   (hypostatical) divinity of Christ, with subordinationism; he is,
   therefore, neither Arian nor Athanasian; but his whole theological
   tendency, in opposition to the heresies, was evidently towards the
   orthodox system, and had he lived later, he would have subscribed the
   Nicene creed. [995] 95 The same may be said of Tertullian and of
   Origen.

   In this connection we must also mention Justin's remarkable doctrine of
   the "Logos spermatikos," or the Divine Word disseminated among men. He
   recognized in every rational soul something Christian, a germ (sperma)
   of the Logos, or a spark of the absolute reason. He therefore traced
   all the elements of truth and beauty which are scattered like seeds not
   only among the Jews but also among the heathen to the influence of
   Christ before his incarnation. He regarded the heathen sages, Socrates,
   (whom he compares to Abraham), Plato, the Stoics, and some of the poets
   and historians as unconscious disciples of the Logos, as Christians
   before Christ. [996] 96

   Justin derived this idea no doubt from the Gospel of John 1:4, 5, 9,
   10, though he only quotes one passage from it (3:3-5). His pupil Tatian
   used it in his Diatessaron. [997] 97

   The further development of the doctrine of the Logos we find in the
   other apologists, in Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus of Antioch, and
   especially in the Alexandrian school.

   Clement of Alexandria speaks in the very highest terms of the Logos,
   but leaves his independent personality obscure. He makes the Logos the
   ultimate principle of all existence, without beginning, and timeless;
   the revealer of the Father, the sum of all intelligence and wisdom, the
   personal truth, the speaking as well as the spoken word of creative
   power, the proper author of the world, the source of light and life,
   the great educator of the human race, at last becoming man, to draw us
   into fellowship with him and make us partakers of his divine nature.

   Origen felt the whole weight of the Christological and trinitarian
   problem and manfully grappled with it, but obscured it by foreign
   speculations. He wavered between the homo-ousian, or orthodox, and the
   homoi-ousian or subordinatian theories, which afterwards came into
   sharp conflict with each other in the Arian controversy. [998] 98 On
   the one hand he brings the Son as near as possible to the essence of
   the Father; not only making him the absolute personal wisdom, truth,
   righteousness, reason, [999] 99 but also expressly predicating eternity
   of him, and propounding the church dogma of the eternal generation of
   the Son. This generation he usually represents as proceeding from the
   will of the Father; but he also conceives it as proceeding from his
   essence and hence, at least in one passage, he already applies the term
   homo-ousios to the Son, thus declaring him coëqual in essence or nature
   with the Father. [1000] 000 This idea of eternal generation, however,
   has a peculiar form with him, from its close connection with his
   doctrine of an eternal creation. He can no more think of the Father
   without the Son, than of an almighty God without creation, or of light
   without radiance. [1001] 001 Hence he describes this generation not as
   a single, instantaneous act, but, like creation, ever going on. [1002]
   002 But on the other hand he distinguishes the essence of the Son from
   that of the Father; speaks of a difference of substance; [1003] 003 and
   makes the Son decidedly inferior to the Father, calling him, with
   reference to John 1:1, merely theos without the article, that is, God
   in a relative or secondary sense (Deus de Deo) also deuteros theos-i,
   -ibut the Father God in the absolute sense, ho theos (Deus per se), or
   autotheos , also the fountain and root of the divinity. [1004] 004
   Hence, he also taught, that the Son should not be directly addressed in
   prayer, but the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit. [1005] 005
   This must be limited, no doubt, to absolute worship, for he elsewhere
   recognizes prayer to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. [1006] 006 Yet
   this subordination of the Son formed a stepping-stone to Arianism, and
   some disciples of Origen, particularly Dionysius of Alexandria,
   decidedly approached that heresy. Against this, however, the deeper
   Christian sentiment, even before the Arian controversy, put forth firm
   protest, especially in the person of the Roman Dionysius, to whom his
   Alexandrian namesake and colleague magnanimously yielded.

   In a simpler way the western fathers, including here Irenaeus and
   Hippolytus, who labored in the West, though they were of Greek
   training, reached the position, that Christ must be one with the
   Father, yet personally distinct from him. It is commonly supposed that
   they came nearer the homo-ousion than the Greeks. This can be said of
   Irenaeus, but not of Tertullian. And as to Cyprian, whose sphere was
   exclusively that of church government and discipline, he had nothing
   peculiar in his speculative doctrines.

   Irenaeus after Polycarp, the most faithful representative of the
   Johannean school, keeps more within the limits of the simple biblical
   statements, and ventures no such bold speculations as the Alexandrians,
   but is more sound and much nearer the Nicene standard. He likewise uses
   the terms "Logos"and "Son of God" interchangeably, and concedes the
   distinction, made also by the Valentinians, between the inward and the
   uttered word, [1007] 007 in reference to man, but contests the
   application of it to God, who is above all antitheses, absolutely
   simple and unchangeable, and in whom before and after, thinking and
   speaking, coincide. He repudiates also every speculative or a priori
   attempt to explain the derivation of the Son from the Father; this be
   holds to be an incomprehensible mystery. [1008] 008 He is content to
   define the actual distinction between Father and Son, by saying that
   the former is God revealing himself, the latter, God revealed; the one
   is the ground of revelation, the other is the actual, appearing
   revelation itself. Hence he calls the Father the invisible of the Son,
   and the Son the visible of the Father. He discriminates most rigidly
   the conceptions of generation and of creation. The Son, though begotten
   of the Father, is still like him, distinguished from the created world,
   as increate, without beginning, and eternal. All this plainly shows
   that Irenaeus is much nearer the Nicene dogma of the substantial
   identity of the Son with the Father, than Justin and the Alexandrians.
   If, as he does in several passages, he still subordinates the Son to
   the Father, he is certainly inconsistent; and that for want of an
   accurate distinction between the eternal Logos and the actual Christ.
   [1009] 009 Expressions like "my Father is greater than I," which apply
   only to the Christ of history, he refers also, like Justin and Origen,
   to the eternal Word. On the other hand, he has been charged with
   leaning in the opposite direction towards the Sabellian and
   Patripassian views, but unjustly. [1010] 010 Apart from his frequent
   want of precision in expression, he steers in general, with sure
   biblical and churchly tact, equally clear of both extremes, and asserts
   alike the essential unity and the eternal personal distinction of the
   Father and the Son.

   The incarnation of the Logos Irenaeus represents both as a restoration
   and redemption from sin and death, and as the completion of the
   revelation of God and of the creation of man. In the latter view, as
   finisher, Christ is the perfect Son of Man, in whom the likeness of man
   to God, the similitudo Dei, regarded as moral duty, in distinction from
   the imago Dei, as an essential property, becomes for the first time
   fully real. According to this the incarnation would be grounded in the
   original plan of God for the education of mankind, and independent of
   the fall; it would have taken place even without the fall, though in
   some other form. Yet Irenaeus does not expressly say this; speculation
   on abstract possibilities was foreign to his realistic cast of mind.

   Tertullian cannot escape the charge of subordinationism. He bluntly
   calls the Father the whole divine substance, and the Son a part of it;
   [1011] 011 illustrating their relation by the figures of the fountain
   and the stream, the sun and the beam. He would not have two suns, he
   says, but he might call Christ God, as Paul does in Rom 9:5. The
   sunbeam, too, in itself considered, may be called sun, but not the sun
   a beam. Sun and beam are two distinct things (species) in one essence
   (substantia), as God and the Word, as the Father and the Son. But we
   should not take figurative language too strictly, and must remember
   that Tertullian was specially interested to distinguish the Son from
   the Father in opposition to the Patripassian Praxeas. In other respects
   he did the church Christology material service. He propounds a
   threefold hypostatical existence of the Son (filiatio): (1) The
   pre-existent, eternal immanence of the Son in the Father; they being as
   inseparable as reason and word in man, who was created in the image of
   God, and hence in a measure reflects his being; [1012] 012 (2) the
   coming forth of the Son with the Father for the purpose of the
   creation; (3) the manifestation of the Son in the world by the
   incarnation. [1013] 013

   With equal energy Hippolytus combated Patripassianism, and insisted on
   the recognition of different hypostases with equal claim to divine
   worship. Yet he, too, is somewhat trammelled with the subordination
   view. [1014] 014

   On the other hand, according to his representation in the
   Philosophumena, the Roman bishops Zephyrinus and especially Callistus
   favored Patripassianism. The later popes, however, were firm defenders
   of hypostasianism. One of them, Dionysius, a.d. 262, as we shall see
   more fully when speaking of the trinity, maintained at once the
   homo-ousion and eternal generation against Dionysius of Alexandria, and
   the hypostatical distinction against Sabellianism, and sketched in bold
   and clear outlines the Nicene standard view.

   Musonius, and others, who for this reason were hated and put to death.

   [997] On the relation of Justin to John's Gospel, see especially the
   very careful examination of Ezra Abbot, The Authorship of the Fourth
   Gospel (Boston, 1880), pp. 29-56. He says (p. 41) While Justin's
   conceptions in regard to the Logos were undoubtedly greatly affected by
   Philo and the Alexandrian philosophy, the doctrine of the incarnation
   of the Logos was utterly foreign to that philosophy, and could only
   have been derived, it would seem, from the Gospel of John. He
   accordingly speaks very often in language similar to that of John
   (1:14) of the Logos as ' made flesh,' or as 'having become man.'That in
   the last phrase he should prefer the term 'man' to the Hebraistic
   'flesh' can excite no surprise. With reference to the deity of the
   Logos and his instrumental agency in creation, compare also especially
   Apol. II. 6, 'through him God created all things' (di' autou panta
   ektise) Dial. c. 56, and Apol. I. 63, with John 1:1-3. Since the
   Fathers who immediately followed Justin, as Theophilus, Irenaeus
   Clement, Tertullian, unquestionably founded their doctrine of the
   incarnation of the Logos on the Gospel of John, the presumption is that
   Justin did the same. He professes to hold his view, in which he owns
   that some Christians do not agree with him 'because we have been
   comminded by Christ himself not to follow the doctrines of men, but
   those which were proclaimed by the blessed prophets and taught by
   Him.'(Dial. c. 48). Now, as Canon Westcott observes, 'the Synoptists do
   not anywhere declare Christ's pre-existence.' And where could Justin
   suppose himself to have found this doctrine taught by Christ except in
   the Fourth Gospel? Compare Apol. I. 46: 'That Christ is the first-born
   of God, being the Logos [the divine Reason] of which every race of men
   have been partakers [Comp. John 1:4, 5, 9], we have been taught and
   have declared before. And those who have lived according to Reason are
   Christians, even though they were deemed atheists; as for example,
   Socrates and Heraclitus and those like them among the Greeks.''

   § 146. The Humanity of Christ.

   Passing now to the doctrine of the Saviour's Humanity, we find this
   asserted by IGNATIUS as clearly and forcibly as his divinity. Of the
   Gnostic Docetists of his day, who made Christ a spectre, he says, they
   are bodiless spectres themselves, whom we should fear as wild beasts in
   human shape, because they tear away the foundation of our hope. [1015]
   015 He attaches great importance to the flesh, that is, the full
   reality of the human nature of Christ, his true birth from the virgin,
   and his crucifixion under Pontius Pilate; he calls him God incarnate;
   [1016] 016 therefore is his death the fountain of life.

   Irenaeus refutes Docetism at length. Christ, he contends against the
   Gnostics, must be a man, like us, if he would redeem us from corruption
   and make us perfect. As sin and death came into the world by a man, so
   they could be blotted out legitimately and to our advantage only by a
   man; though of course not by one who should be a mere descendant of
   Adam, and thus himself in need of redemption, but by a second Adam,
   supernaturally begotten, a new progenitor of our race, as divine as he
   is human. A new birth unto life must take the place of the old birth
   unto death. As the completer, also, Christ must enter into fellowship
   with us, to be our teacher and pattern. He made himself equal with man,
   that man, by his likeness to the Son, might become precious in the
   Father's sight. Irenaeus conceived the humanity of Christ not as a mere
   corporeality, though he often contends for this alone against the
   Gnostics, but as true humanity, embracing body, soul, and spirit. He
   places Christ in the same relation to the regenerate race, which Adam
   bears to the natural, and regards him as the absolute, universal man,
   the prototype and summing up [1017] 017 of the whole race. Connected
   with this is his beautiful thought, found also in Hippolytus in the
   tenth book of the Philosophumena, that Christ made the circuit of all
   the stages of human life, to redeem and sanctify all. To apply this to
   advanced age, he singularly extended the life of Jesus to fifty years,
   and endeavored to prove this view from the Gospels, against the
   Valentinians. [1018] 018 The full communion of Christ with men involved
   his participation in all their evils and sufferings, his death, and his
   descent into the abode of the dead.

   Tertullian advocates the entire yet sinless humanity of Christ against
   both the Docetistic Gnostics [1019] 019 and the Patripassians. [1020]
   020 He accuses the former of making Christ who is all truth, a half
   lie, and by the denial of his flesh resolving all his work in the
   flesh, his sufferings and his death, into an empty show, and subverting
   the whole scheme of redemption. Against the Patripassians be argues,
   that God the Father is incapable of suffering, and is beyond the sphere
   of finiteness and change. In the humanity, he expressly includes the
   soul; and this, in his view, comprises the reason also; for he adopts
   not the trichotomic, but the dychotomic division. The body of Christ,
   before the exaltation, he conceived to have been even homely, on a
   misapprehension of Isa. 53:2, where the suffering Messiah is
   figuratively said to have "no form nor comeliness." This unnatural view
   agreed with his aversion to art and earthly splendor, but was not
   commonly held by the Christian people if we are to judge from the
   oldest representations of Christ under the figure of a beautiful
   Shepherd carrying the lamb in his arms or on his shoulders.

   Clement of Alexandria likewise adopted the notion of the uncomely
   personal appearance of Jesus, but compensated it with the thought of
   the moral beauty of his soul. In his effort, however, to idealize the
   body of the Lord, and raise it above all sensual desires and wants, he
   almost reaches Gnostic Docetism.

   The Christology of Origen is more fully developed in this part, as well
   as in the article of the divine nature, and peculiarly modified by his
   Platonizing view of the pre-existence and pre-Adamic fall of souls and
   their confinement in the prison of corporeity; but he is likewise too
   idealistic, and inclined to substitute the superhuman for the purely
   human. He conceives the incarnation as a gradual process, and
   distinguishes two stages in it--the assumption of the soul, and the
   assumption of the body. The Logos, before the creation of the world,
   nay, from the beginning, took to himself a human soul, which had no
   part in the ante-mundane apostasy, but clave to the Logos in perfect
   love, and was warmed through by him, as iron by fire. Then this fair
   soul, married to the Logos, took from the Virgin Mary a true body, yet
   without sin; not by way of punishment, like the fallen souls, but from
   love to men, to effect their redemption. Again, Origen distinguishes
   various forms of the manifestation of this human nature, in which the
   Lord became all things to all men, to gain all. To the great mass he
   appeared in the form of a servant; to his confidential disciples and
   persons of culture, in a radiance of the highest beauty and glory, such
   as, even before the resurrection, broke forth from his miracles and in
   the transfiguration on the Mount. In connection with this comes
   Origen's view of a gradual spiritualization and deification of the body
   of Christ, even to the ubiquity which he ascribes to it in its exalted
   state. [1021] 021

   On this insufficient ground his opponents charged him with teaching a
   double Christ (answering to the lower Jesus and the higher Soter of the
   Gnostics), and a merely temporary validity in the corporeity of the
   Redeemer.

   Origen is the first to apply to Christ the term God-man, [1022] 022
   which leads to the true view of the relation of the two natures.

   § 147. The Relation of the Divine and the Human in Christ.

   The doctrine of the Mutual Relation of the divine and the human in
   Christ did not come into special discussion nor reach a definite
   settlement until the Christological (Nestorian and Eutychian)
   controversies of the fifth century.

   Yet Irenaeus, in several passages, throws out important hints. He
   teaches unequivocally a true and indissoluble union of divinity and
   humanity in Christ, and repels the Gnostic idea of a mere external and
   transient connection of the divine Soter with the human Jesus. The
   foundation for that union he perceives in the creation of the world by
   the Logos, and in man's original likeness to God and destination for
   permanent fellowship with Him. In the act of union, that is, in the
   supernatural generation and birth, the divine is the active principle,
   and the seat of personality; the human, the passive or receptive; as,
   in general, man is absolutely dependent on God, and is the vessel to
   receive the revelations of his wisdom and love. The medium and bond of
   the union is the Holy Spirit, who took the place of the masculine agent
   in the generation, and overshadowed the virgin womb of Mary with the
   power of the highest. In this connection he calls Mary the counterpart
   of Eve the "mother of all living" in a higher sense; who, by her
   believing obedience, became the cause of salvation both to herself and
   the whole human race, [1023] 023 as Eve by her disobedience induced the
   apostasy and death of mankind;--a fruitful but questionable parallel,
   suggested but not warranted by Paul's parallel between Adam and Christ,
   afterwards frequently pushed too far, and turned, no doubt, contrary to
   its original sense, to favor the idolatrous worship of the blessed
   Virgin. Irenaeus seems [1024] 024 to conceive the incarnation as
   progressive, the two factors reaching absolute communion (but neither
   absorbing the other) in the ascension; though before this, at every
   stage of life, Christ was a perfect man, presenting the model of every
   age.

   Origen, the author of the term "God-man," was also the first to employ
   the figure, since become so classical, of an iron warmed through by
   fire, to illustrate the pervasion of the human nature (primarily the
   soul) by the divine in the presence of Christ.

   the Holy Ghost. Oxf. 1831 (Works, vol. II).

   149-356. Incomplete).

   Neander: Dogmengeschichte, ed. by Jacobi, I. 181-186.

   The doctrine of Justin Mart. is treated with exhaustive thoroughness by
   Semisch in his monograph (Breslau, 1840), II. 305-332. Comp. also Al.
   v. Engelhardt: Das Christenthum Justins (Erlangen, 1878), P. 143-147.

   The doctrine of the Holy Spirit was far less developed, and until the
   middle of the fourth century was never a subject of special
   controversy. So in the Apostles; Creed, only one article [1025] 025 is
   devoted to the third person of the holy Trinity, while the confession
   of the Son of God, in six or seven articles, forms the body of the
   symbol. Even the original Nicene Creed breaks off abruptly with the
   words: "And in the Holy Spirit;" the other clauses being later
   additions. Logical knowledge appears to be here still further removed
   than in Christology from the living substance of faith. This period was
   still in immediate contact with the fresh spiritual life of the
   apostolic, still witnessed the lingering operations of the
   extraordinary gifts, and experienced in full measure the regenerating,
   sanctifying, and comforting influences of the divine Spirit in life,
   suffering, and death; but, as to the theological definition of the
   nature and work of the Spirit, it remained in many respects confused
   and wavering down to the Nicene age.

   Yet rationalistic historians go quite too far when, among other
   accusations, they charge the early church with making the Holy Spirit
   identical with the Logos. To confound the functions, as in attributing
   the inspiration of the prophets, for example, now to the Holy Spirit,
   now to the Logos, is by no means to confound the persons. On the
   contrary, the thorough investigations of recent times show plainly that
   the ante-Nicene fathers, with the exception of the Monarchians and
   perhaps Lactantius, agreed in the two fundamental points, that the Holy
   Spirit, the sole agent in the application of redemption, is a
   supernatural divine being, and that he is an independent person; thus
   closely allied to the Father and the Son yet hypostatically different
   from them both. This was the practical conception, as demanded even by
   the formula of baptism. But instead of making the Holy Spirit strictly
   coordinate with the other divine persons, as the Nicene doctrine does,
   it commonly left him subordinate to the Father and the Son.

   So in Justin, the pioneer of scientific discovery in Pneumatology as
   well as in Christology. He refutes the heathen charge of atheism with
   the explanation, that the Christians worship the Creator of the
   universe, in the second place the Son, [1026] 026 in the third rank
   [1027] 027 the prophetic Spirit; placing the three divine hypostases in
   a descending gradation as objects of worship. In another passage, quite
   similar, he interposes the host of good angels between the Son and the
   Spirit, and thus favors the inference that he regarded the Holy Ghost
   himself as akin to the angels and therefore a created being. [1028] 028
   But aside from the obscurity and ambiguity of the words relating to the
   angelic host, the coordination of the Holy Ghost with the angels is
   utterly precluded by many other expressions of Justin, in which he
   exalts the Spirit far above the sphere of all created being, and
   challenges for the members of the divine trinity a worship forbidden to
   angels. The leading function of the Holy Spirit, with him, as with
   other apologists, is the inspiration of the Old Testament prophets.
   [1029] 029 In general the Spirit conducted the Jewish theocracy, and
   qualified the theocratic officers. All his gifts concentrated
   themselves finally in Christ; and thence they pass to the faithful in
   the church. It is a striking fact, however, that Justin in only two
   passages refers the new moral life of the Christian to the Spirit, he
   commonly represents the Logos as its fountain. He lacks all insight
   into the distinction of the Old Testament Spirit and the New, and urges
   their identity in opposition to the Gnostics.

   In Clement of Alexandria we find very little progress beyond this
   point. Yet he calls the Holy Spirit the third member of the sacred
   triad, and requires thanksgiving to be addressed to him as to the Son
   and the Father. [1030] 030

   Origen vacillates in his Pneumatology still more than in his
   Christology between orthodox and heterodox views. He ascribes to the
   Holy Spirit eternal existence, exalts him, as he does the Son, far
   above all creatures and considers him the source of all charisms,
   [1031] 031 especially as the principle of all the illumination and
   holiness of believers under the Old Covenant and the New. But he places
   the Spirit in essence, dignity, and efficiency below the Son, as far as
   he places the Son below the Father; and though he grants in one passage
   [1032] 032 that the Bible nowhere calls the Holy Spirit a creature,
   yet, according to another somewhat obscure sentence, he himself
   inclines towards the view, which, however he does not avow that the
   Holy Spirit had a beginning (though, according to his system, not in
   time but from eternity), and is the first and most excellent of all the
   beings produced by the Logos. [1033] 033 In the same connection he
   adduces three opinions concerning the Holy Spirit; one regarding him as
   not having an origin; another, ascribing to him no separate
   personality; and a third, making him a being originated by the Logos.
   The first of these opinions he rejects because the Father alone is
   without origin (agennetos); the second he rejects because in Matt.
   12:32 the Spirit is plainly distinguished from the Father and the Son;
   the third he takes for the true and scriptural view, because everything
   was made by the Logos. [1034] 034 Indeed, according to Matt. 12:32, the
   Holy Spirit would seem to stand above the Son; but the sin against the
   Holy Ghost is more heinous than that against the Son of Man, only
   because he who has received the Holy Spirit stands higher than he who
   has merely the reason from the Logos.

   Here again Irenaeus comes nearer than the Alexandrians to the dogma of
   the perfect substantial identity of the Spirit with the Father and the
   Son; though his repeated figurative (but for this reason not so
   definite) designation of the Son and Spirit as the "hands" of the
   Father, by which he made all things, implies a certain subordination.
   He differs from most of the Fathers in referring the Wisdom of the book
   of Proverbs not to the Logos but to the Spirit; and hence must regard
   him as eternal. Yet he was far from conceiving the Spirit a mere power
   or attribute; he considered him an independent personality, like the
   Logos. "With God" says he, [1035] 035 "are ever the Word and the
   Wisdom, the Son and the Spirit, through whom and in whom he freely made
   all things, to whom he said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our
   likeness.' " But he speaks more of the operations than of the nature of
   the Holy Ghost. The Spirit predicted in the prophets the coming of
   Christ; has been near to man in all divine ordinances; communicates the
   knowledge of the Father and the Son; gives believers the consciousness
   of sonship; is fellowship with Christ, the pledge of imperishable life,
   and the ladder on which we ascend to God.

   In the Montanistic system the Paraclete occupies a peculiarly important
   place. He appears there as the principle of the highest stage of
   revelation, or of the church of the consummation. Tertullian made the
   Holy Spirit the proper essence of the church, but subordinated him to
   the Son, as he did the Son to the Father, though elsewhere he asserts
   the "unitas substantiae." In his view the Spirit proceeds "a Patre per
   Filium," as the fruit from the root through the stem. The view of the
   Trinity presented by Sabellius contributed to the suppression of these
   subordinatian ideas.

   exomoioumenon agathon angelon straton, Pneuma te to prophetikon
   sebometha kai proskunoumen. This passage has been variously explained.
   The questions arise, whether angelos here is not to be taken in the
   wider sense, in which Justin often uses it, and even applies it to
   Christ; whether stratondepends on sebometha, and not rather on
   didaxanta, so as to be co-ordinate with hemas, or with tauta, and not
   with Pshion and Pneuma. Still others suspect that straton is a false
   reading for strategon, which would characterize Christ as the leader of
   the angelic host. It is impossible to co-ordinate the host of angels
   with the Father, Son, and Spirit, as objects of worship, without
   involving Justin in gross self-contradiction (Apol I. 17: theon monon
   proskunoumen, etc.). We must either join straton with hemas , in the
   sense that Christ is the teacher, not of men only, but also of the host
   of angels; or with tauta in the sense that the Son of God taught us
   (didaxanta hemas) about these things (tauta, i.e. evil spirits, compare
   the preceding chapter I. 5), but also concerning the good angels--ton
   angelon straton being in this case elliptically put for ta peri tou...
   angelon stratou. The former is more natural, although a more careful
   writer than Justin would in this case have said tauta hemas instead of
   hemas tauta. For a summary of the different interpretations see Otto's

   § 149. The Holy Trinity.

   Comp. the works quoted in §144, especially Petravius, Bull, Baur, and
   Dorner.

   Here now we have the elements of the dogma of the Trinity, that is, the
   doctrine of the living, only true God, Father, Son, and Spirit, of
   whom, through whom, and to whom are all things. This dogma has a
   peculiar, comprehensive, and definitive import in the Christian system,
   as a brief summary of all the truths and blessings of revealed
   religion. Hence the baptismal formula (Matt. 28:19), which forms the
   basis of all the ancient creeds, is trinitarian; as is the apostolic
   benediction also (2 Cor. 13:14). This doctrine meets us in the
   Scriptures, however, not so much in direct statements and single
   expressions, of which the two just mentioned are the clearest, as in
   great living facts; in the history of a threefold revelation of the
   living God in the creation and government, the reconciliation and
   redemption, and the sanctification and consummation of the world--a
   history continued in the experience of Christendom. In the article of
   the Trinity the Christian conception of God completely defines itself,
   in distinction alike from the abstract monotheism of the Jewish
   religion, and from the polytheism and dualism of the heathen. It has
   accordingly been looked upon in all ages as the sacred symbol and the
   fundamental doctrine of the Christian church, with the denial of which
   the divinity of Christ and the Holy Spirit, and the divine character of
   the work of redemption and sanctification, fall to the ground.

   On this scriptural basis and the Christian consciousness of a threefold
   relation we sustain to God as our Maker, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, the
   church dogma of the Trinity arose; and it directly or indirectly ruled
   even the ante-Nicene theology though it did not attain its fixed
   definition till in the Nicene age. It is primarily of a practical
   religious nature, and speculative only in a secondary sense. It arose
   not from the field of metaphysics, but from that of experience and
   worship; and not as an abstract, isolated dogma, but in inseparable
   connection with the study of Christ and of the Holy Spirit; especially
   in connection with Christology, since all theology proceeds from "God
   in Christ reconciling the world unto himself." Under the condition of
   monotheism, this doctrine followed of necessity from the doctrine of
   the divinity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit. The unity of God was
   already immovably fixed by the Old Testament as a fundamental article
   of revealed religion in opposition to all forms of idolatry. But the
   New Testament and the Christian consciousness as firmly demanded faith
   in the divinity of the Son, who effected redemption, and of the Holy
   Spirit, who founded the church and dwells in believers; and these
   apparently contradictory interests could be reconciled only in the form
   of the Trinity; [1036] 036 that is, by distinguishing in the one and
   indivisible essence of God [1037] 037 three hypostases or persons;
   [1038] 038 at the same time allowing for the insufficiency of all human
   conceptions and words to describe such an unfathomable mystery.

   The Socinian and rationalistic opinion, that the church doctrine of the
   Trinity sprang from Platonism [1039] 039 and Neo-Platonism [1040] 040
   is therefore radically false. The Indian Trimurti, altogether
   pantheistic in spirit, is still further from the Christian Trinity.
   Only thus much is true, that the Hellenic philosophy operated from
   without, as a stimulating force, upon the form of the whole patristic
   theology, the doctrines of the Logos and the Trinity among the rest;
   and that the deeper minds of heathen antiquity showed a presentiment of
   a threefold distinction in the divine essence: but only a remote and
   vague presentiment which, like all the deeper instincts of the heathen
   mind, serves to strengthen the Christian truth. Far clearer and more
   fruitful suggestions presented themselves in the Old Testament,
   particularly in the doctrines of the Messiah, of the Spirit, of the
   Word, and of the Wisdom of God, and even in the system of symbolical
   numbers, which rests on the sacredness of the numbers three (God), four
   (the world), seven and twelve (the union of God and the world, hence
   the covenant numbers. But the mystery of the Trinity could be fully
   revealed only in the New Testament after the completion of the work of
   redemption and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The historical
   manifestation of the Trinity is the condition of the knowledge of the
   Trinity.

   Again, it was primarily the OEconomic or transitive trinity, which the
   church had in mind; that is, the trinity of the revelation of God in
   the threefold work of creation, redemption, and sanctification; the
   trinity presented in the apostolic writings as a living fact. But from
   this, in agreement with both reason and Scripture, the immanent or
   ontologic trinity was inferred; that is, an eternal distinction in the
   essence of God itself, which reflects itself in his revelation, and can
   be understood only so far as it manifests itself in his works and
   words. The divine nature thus came to be conceived, not as an abstract,
   blank unity, but as an infinite fulness of life; and the Christian idea
   of God (as John of Damascus has remarked) in this respect combined
   Jewish monotheism with the truth which lay at the bottom of even the
   heathen polytheism, though distorted and defaced there beyond
   recognition.

   Then for the more definite illustration of this trinity of essence,
   speculative church teachers of subsequent times appealed to all sorts
   of analogies in nature, particularly in the sphere of the finite mind,
   which was made after the image of the divine, and thus to a certain
   extent authorizes such a parallel. They found a sort of triad in the
   universal law of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis; in the elements of
   the syllogism; in the three persons of grammar; in the combination of
   body, soul, and spirit in man; in the three leading faculties of the
   soul; in the nature of intelligence and knowledge as involving a union
   of the thinking subject and the thought object; and in the nature of
   love, as likewise a union between the loving and the loved. [1041] 041
   These speculations began with Origen and Tertullian; they were pursued
   by Athanasius and Augustin; by the scholastics and mystics of the
   Middle Ages; by Melanchthon, and the speculative Protestant divines
   down to Schleiermacher, Rothe and Dorner, as well as by philosophers
   from Böhme to Hegel; and they are not yet exhausted, nor will be till
   we reach the beatific vision. For the holy Trinity, though the most
   evident, is yet the deepest of mysteries, and can be adequately
   explained by no analogies from finite and earthly things.

   As the doctrines of the divinity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit were
   but imperfectly developed in logical precision in the ante-Nicene
   period, the doctrine of the Trinity, founded on them, cannot be
   expected to be more clear. We find it first in the most simple biblical
   and practical shape in all the creeds of the first three centuries:
   which, like the Apostles' and the Nicene, are based on the baptismal
   formula, and hence arranged in trinitarian order. Then it appears in
   the trinitarian doxologies used in the church from the first; such as
   occur even in the epistle of the church at Smyrna on the martyrdom of
   Polycarp. [1042] 042 Clement of Rome calls "God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
   and the Holy Spirit" the object of "the faith and hope of the elect."
   [1043] 043 The sentiment, that we rise through the Holy Spirit to the
   Son, through the Son to the Father, belongs likewise to the age of the
   immediate disciples of the apostles. [1044] 044

   Justin Martyr repeatedly places Father, Son, and Spirit together as
   objects of divine worship among the Christians (though not as being
   altogether equal in dignity), and imputes to Plato a presentiment of
   the doctrine of the Trinity. Athenagoras confesses his faith in Father,
   Son, and Spirit, who are one as to power (kata dunamin), but whom he
   distinguishes as to order or dignity (taxis) in subordinatian style.
   Theophilus of Antioch (180) is the first to denote the relation of the
   three divine persons [1045] 045 by the term Triad.

   Origen conceives the Trinity as three concentric circles, of which each
   succeeding one circumscribes a smaller area. God the Father acts upon
   all created being; the Logos only upon the rational creation; the Holy
   Ghost only upon the saints in the church. But the sanctifying work of
   the Spirit leads back to the Son, and the Son to the Father, who is
   consequently the ground and end of all being, and stands highest in
   dignity as the compass of his operation is the largest.

   Irenaeus goes no further than the baptismal formula and the trinity of
   revelation; proceeding on the hypothesis of three successive stages in
   the development of the kingdom of God on earth, and of a progressive
   communication of God to the world. He also represents the relation of
   the persons according to Eph. 4:6; the Father as above all, and the
   head of Christ; the Son as through all, and the head of the church; the
   Spirit as in all, and the fountain of the water of life. [1046] 046 Of
   a supramundane trinity of essence he betrays but faint indications.

   Tertullian advances a step. He supposes a distinction in God himself;
   and on the principle that the created image affords a key to the
   uncreated original, he illustrates the distinction in the divine nature
   by the analogy of human thought; the necessity of a self-projection, or
   of making one's self objective in word, for which he borrows from the
   Valentinians the term probole, or prolatio rei alterius ex altera,
   [1047] 047 but without connecting with it the sensuous emanation theory
   of the Gnostics. Otherwise he stands, as already observed, on
   subordinatian ground, if his comparisons of the trinitarian relation to
   that of root, stem, and fruit; or fountain, flow, and brook; or sun,
   ray, and raypoint, be dogmatically pressed. [1048] 048 Yet he directly
   asserts also the essential unity of the three persons.. [1049] 049

   Tertullian was followed by the schismatic but orthodox Novatian, the
   author of a special treatise De Trinitate, drawn from the Creed, and
   fortified with Scripture proofs against the two classes of Monarchians.

   The Roman bishop Dionysius (A. D. 262), a Greek by birth, [1050] 050
   stood nearest the Nicene doctrine. He maintained distinctly, in the
   controversy with Dionysius of Alexandria, at once the unity of essence
   and the real personal distinction of the three members of the divine
   triad, and avoided tritheism, Sabellianism, and subordinatianism with
   the instinct of orthodoxy, and also with the art of anathematizing
   already familiar to the popes. His view has come down to us in a
   fragment in Athanasius, where it is said: "Then I must declare against
   those who annihilate the most sacred doctrine of the church by dividing
   and dissolving the unity of God into three powers, separate hypostases,
   and three deities. This notion [some tritheistic view, not further
   known to us] is just the opposite of the opinion of Sabellius. For
   while the latter would introduce the impious doctrine, that the Son is
   the same as the Father, and the converse, the former teach in some
   sense three Gods, by dividing the sacred unity into three fully
   separate hypostases. But the divine Logos must be inseparably united
   with the God of all, and in God also the Holy Ghost must dwell so that
   the divine triad must be comprehended in one, viz. the all-ruling God,
   as in a head." [1051] 051 Then Dionysius condemns the doctrine, that
   the Son is a creature, as "the height of blasphemy," and concludes:
   "The divine adorable unity must not be thus cut up into three deities;
   no more may the transcendant dignity and greatness of the Lord be
   lowered by saying, the Son is created; but we must believe in God the
   almighty Father, and in Jesus Christ his Son, and in the Holy Ghost,
   and must consider the Logos inseparably united with the God of all; for
   he says, 'I and my Father are one'; and 'I am in the Father and the
   Father in me.' In this way are both the divine triad and the sacred
   doctrine of the unity of the Godhead preserved inviolate."

   That this goal was at last happily reached, was in great part due again
   to those controversies with the opponents of the church doctrine of the
   Trinity, which filled the whole third century. These Antitrinitarians
   are commonly called Monarchians from (monarchia) [1052] 052 or
   Unitarians, on account of the stress they laid upon the numerical.
   personal unity of the Godhead.

   But we must carefully distinguish among them two opposite classes: the
   rationalistic or dynamic Monarchians, who denied the divinity of
   Christ, or explained it as a mere "power" (dunamis) and the
   patripassian or modalistic Monarchians, who identified the Son with the
   Father, and admitted at most only a modal trinity, that is a threefold
   mode of revelation, but not a tripersonality.

   The first form of this heresy, involved in the abstract Jewish
   monotheism, deistically sundered the divine and the human, and rose
   little above Ebionism. After being defeated in the church this heresy
   arose outside of it on a grander scale, as a pretended revelation, and
   with marvellous success, in Mohammedanism which may be called the
   pseudo-Jewish and pseudo-Christian Unitarianism of the East.

   The second form proceeded from the highest conception of the deity of
   Christ, but in part also from pantheistic notions which approached the
   ground of Gnostic docetism.

   The one prejudiced the dignity of the Son, the other the dignity of the
   Father; yet the latter was by far the more profound and Christian, and
   accordingly met with the greater acceptance.

   The Monarchians of the first class saw in Christ a mere man, filled
   with divine power; but conceived this divine power as operative in him,
   not from the baptism only, according to the Ebionite view, but from the
   beginning; and admitted his supernatural generation by the Holy Spirit.
   To this class belong:

   1. The Alogians or Alogi, [1053] 053 a heretical sect in Asia Minor
   about a.d. 170, of which very little is known. Epiphanius gave them
   this name because they rejected the Logos doctrine and the Logos
   Gospel, together with the Apocalypse. "What good," they said, "is the
   Apocalypse to me, with its seven angels and seven seals? What have I to
   do with the four angels at Euphrates, whom another angel must loose,
   and the host of horsemen with breastplates of fire and brimstone?" They
   seem to have been jejune rationalists opposed to chiliasm and all
   mysterious doctrines. They absurdly attributed the writings of John to
   the Gnostic, Cerinthus, whom the aged apostle opposed. [1054] 054 This
   is the first specimen of negative biblical criticism, next to Marcion's
   mutilation of the canon. [1055] 0552. The Theodotians; so called from
   their founder, the tanner Theodotus. He sprang from Byzantium; denied
   Christ in a persecution, with the apology that he denied only a man;
   but still held him to be the supernaturally begotten Messiah. He gained
   followers in Rome, but was excommunicated by the bishop Victor
   (192-202). After his death his sect chose the confessor Natalis bishop,
   who is said to have afterwards penitently returned into the bosom of
   the Catholic church. A younger Theodotus, the "money-changer," put
   Melchizedek as mediator between God and the angels, above Christ, the
   mediator between God and men; and his followers were called
   Melchizedekians. [1056] 056

   3. The Artemonites, or adherents of Artemon or Artemos, who came out
   somewhat later at Rome with a similar opinion, declared the doctrine of
   the divinity of Christ an innovation and a relapse to heathen
   polytheism; and was excommunicated by Zephyrinus (202-217) or
   afterwards. The Artemonites were charged with placing Euclid and
   Aristotle above Christ, and esteeming mathematics and dialectics higher
   than the gospel. This indicates a critical intellectual turn, averse to
   mystery, and shows that Aristotle was employed by some against the
   divinity of Christ, as Plato was engaged for it.

   Their assertion, that the true doctrine was obscured in the Roman
   church only from the time of Zephyrinus, [1057] 057 is explained by the
   fact brought to light recently through the Philosophumena of
   Hippolytus, that Zephyrinus (and perhaps his predecessor Victor),
   against the vehement opposition of a portion of the Roman church,
   favored Patripassianism, and probably in behalf of this doctrine
   condemned the Artemonites. [1058] 058

   4. Paul Of Samosata, from 260 bishop of Antioch, and at the same time a
   high civil officer, [1059] 059 is the most famous of these
   rationalistic Unitarians, and contaminated one of the first apostolic
   churches with his heresy. He denied the personality of the Logos and of
   the Holy Spirit, and considered them merely powers of God, like reason
   and mind in man; but granted that the Logos dwelt in Christ in larger
   measure than in any former messenger of God, and taught, like the
   Socinians in later times, a gradual elevation of Christ, determined by
   his own moral development, to divine dignity. [1060] 060 He admitted
   that Christ remained free from sin, conquered the sin of our
   forefathers, and then became the Saviour of the race. To introduce his
   Christology into the mind of the people, he undertook to alter the
   church hymns, but was shrewd enough to accommodate himself to the
   orthodox formulas, calling Christ, for example, "God from the Virgin,"
   [1061] 061 and ascribing to him even homo-ousia with the Father, but of
   course in his own sense. [1062] 062

   The bishops under him in Syria accused him not only of heresy but also
   of extreme vanity, arrogance, pompousness, avarice, and undue concern
   with secular business; and at a third synod held in Antioch a.d. 269 or
   268, they pronounced his deposition. The number of bishops present is
   variously reported (70, 80, 180). Dominus was appointed successor. The
   result was communicated to the bishops of Rome, Alexandria, and to all
   the churches. But as Paul was favored by the queen Zenobia of Palmyra,
   the deposition could not be executed till after her subjection by the
   emperor Aurelian in 272, and after consultation with the Italian
   bishops. [1063] 063

   His overthrow decided the fall of the Monarchians; though they still
   appear at the end of the fourth century as condemned heretics, under
   the name of Samosatians, Paulianists, and Sabellians.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1052] The designation Monarchiani as a sectarian name is first used by
   Tertullian, Adv. Prox. c. 10 ("vanissimi isti Monarchiani"); but the
   Monarchians themselves used monarchia in the good sense (Adv. Prax.
   3."Monarchiam, inquiunt, tenemus"), in which it was employed by the
   orthodox fathers in opposition to dualism and polytheism. Irenaeus
   wrote (according to Jerome) a book "De Monarchia, sive quod Deus non
   sit auctor malorum." In a somewhat different sense, the Greek fathers
   in opposition to the Latin Filioque insist on the monarchiaof the
   Father, i.e. the sovereign dignity of the first Person of the Trinity,
   as the root and fountain of the Deity.

   [1053] From a privative and logos, which may mean both irrational, and
   opponents of the Logos doctrine. The designation occurs first in
   Epiphanius, who invented the term (Haer. 51, c. 3) to characterize
   sarcastically their unreasonable rejection of the Divine Reason
   preached by John.

   § 151. Second Class of Antitrinitarians: Praxeas, Noëtus, Callistus,
   Berryllus.

   The second class of Monarchians, called by Tertullian "Patripassians"
   (as afterwards a branch of the Monophysites was called
   "Theopaschites"), [1064] 064 together with their unitarian zeal felt
   the deeper Christian impulse to hold fast the divinity of Christ; but
   they sacrificed to it his independent personality, which they merged in
   the essence of the Father. They taught that the one supreme God by his
   own free will, and by an act of self-limitation became man, so that the
   Son is the Father veiled in the flesh. They knew no other God but the
   one manifested in Christ, and charged their opponents with ditheism.
   They were more dangerous than the rationalistic Unitarians, and for a
   number of years had even the sympathy and support of the papal chair.
   They had a succession of teachers in Rome, and were numerous there even
   at the time of Epiphanius towards the close of the fourth century.

   1. The first prominent advocate of the Patripassian heresy was Praxeas
   of Asia Minor. He came to Rome under Marcus Aurelius with the renown of
   a confessor; procured there the condemnation of Montanism; and
   propounded his Patripassianism, to which he gained even the bishop
   Victor. [1065] 065 But Tertullian met him in vindication at once of
   Montanism and of hypostasianism with crushing logic, and sarcastically
   charged him with having executed at Rome two commissions of the devil:
   having driven away the Holy Ghost, and having crucified the Father.
   Praxeas, constantly appealing to Is. 45:5; John. 10:30 ("I and my
   Father are one"), and 14:9 ("He that hath seen me hath seen the Father
   "), as if the whole Bible consisted of these three passages, taught
   that the Father himself became man, hungered, thirsted, suffered, and
   died in Christ. True, he would not be understood as speaking directly
   of a suffering (pati) of the Father, but only of a sympathy (copati) of
   the Father with the Son; but in any case he lost the independent
   personality of the Son. He conceived the relation of the Father to the
   Son as like that of the spirit to the flesh. The same subject, as
   spirit, is the Father; as flesh, the Son. He thought the Catholic
   doctrine tritheistic. [1066] 066

   2. Noëtus of Smyrna published the same view about a.d. 200, appealing
   also to Rom. 9:5, where Christ is called "the one God over all." When
   censured by a council he argued in vindication of himself, that his
   doctrine enhanced the glory of Christ. [1067] 067 The author of the
   Philosophumena places him in connection with the pantheistic philosophy
   of Heraclitus, who, as we here for the first time learn, viewed nature
   as the harmony of all antitheses, and called the universe at once
   dissoluble and indissoluble, originated and unoriginated, mortal and
   immortal; and thus Noëtus supposed that the same divine subject must be
   able to combine opposite attributes in itself. [1068] 068

   Two of his disciples, Epigonus and Cleomenes, [1069] 069 propagated
   this doctrine in Rome under favor of Pope Zephyrinus.

   3. Callistus (pope Calixtus I.) adopted and advocated the doctrine of
   Noëtus. He declared the Son merely the manifestation of the Father in
   human form; the Father animating the Son, as the spirit animates the
   body, [1070] 070 and suffering with him on the cross. "The Father,"
   said he, "who was in the Son, took flesh and made it God, uniting it
   with himself and made it one. Father and Son were therefore the name of
   the one God, and this one person [1071] 071 cannot be two; thus the
   Father suffered with the Son." He considered his opponents "ditheists,"
   [1072] 072 and they in return called his followers "Callistians."

   These and other disclosures respecting the church at Rome during the
   first quarter of the third century, we owe, as already observed, to the
   ninth book of the Philosophumena of Hippolytus, who was, however, it
   must be remembered, the leading opponent and rival of Callistus, and in
   his own doctrine of the Trinity inclined to the opposite subordinatian
   extreme. He calls Callistus, evidently with passion, an "unreasonable
   and treacherous man, who brought together blasphemies from above and
   below only to speak against the truth, and was not ashamed to fall now
   into the error of Sabellius, now into that of Theodotius" (of which
   latter, however, he shows no trace, but the very opposite). [1073] 073
   Callistus differed from the ditheistic separation of the Logos from
   God, but also from the Sabellian confusion of the Father and the Son,
   and insisted on the mutual indwelling (perichoresis) of the divine
   Persons; in other words, he sought the way from modalistic unitarianism
   to the Nicene trinitarianism; but he was not explicit and consistent in
   his statements. He excommunicated both Sabellius and Hippolytus; the
   Roman church sided with him, and made his name one of the most
   prominent among the ancient popes. [1074] 074

   After the death of Callistus, who occupied the papal chair between 218
   and 223 or 224, Patripassianism disappeared from the Roman church.

   4. Beryllus of Bostra (now Bosra and Bosseret), in Arabia Petraea. From
   him we have only a somewhat obscure and very variously interpreted
   passage preserved in Eusebius. [1075] 075 He denied the personal
   pre-existence [1076] 076 and in general the independent divinity [1077]
   077 of Christ, but at the same time asserted the indwelling of the
   divinity of the Father [1078] 078 in him during his earthly life. He
   forms, in some sense, the stepping-stone from simple Patripassianism to
   Sabellian modalism. At an Arabian synod in 244, where the presbyter
   Origen, then himself accused of heresy, was called into consultation,
   Beryllus was convinced of his error by that great teacher, and was
   persuaded particularly of the existence of a human soul in Christ, in
   place of which he had probably put his patrike theotos, as Apollinaris
   in a later period put the logos. He is said to have thanked Origen
   afterwards for his instruction. Here we have one of the very few
   theological disputations which have resulted in unity instead of
   greater division. [1079] 079
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1064] The Orientals usually call them "Sabellians" from their most
   prominent representative.

   [1065] Pseudo-Tert.: "Praxeas hoeresim introduxit quam Victorinus
   [probably=Victor] corroborare curavit." It is certain from Hippolytus,
   that Victor's successors, Zephyrinus and Callistus sympathized with
   Patripassianism.

   [1066] The chief source: Tertullian, Adv. Praxean (39 chs., written
   about 210). Comp. Pseudo-Tertull. 20. Hippolytus strangely never
   mentions Praxeas. Hence some have conjectured that he was identical
   with Noëtus, who came likewise from Asia Minor; others identify him
   with Epigonus, or with Callistus, and regard Praxeas as a nickname. The
   proper view is that Praxeas appeared in Rome before Epigonus, probably
   under Eleutherus, and remained but a short time. On the other hand
   Tertullian nowhere mentions the names of Noëtus, Epigonus, Cleomenes,
   and Callistus.

   the last chapter of his lost work against the 32 heresies). Epiphanius,
   Haer. 57, used both these books, but falsely put Noëtus back from the
   close of the second century to about 130.

   transl. p. 183 sqq., especially p. 215), and other works on Hippolytus;
   also Langen, Gesch. der röm. Kirche, p. 192-216. Döllinger charges
   Hippolytus with misrepresenting the views of Callistus; while Bishop
   Wordsworth (St. Hippolytus and the Church of Rome, ch. XIV. p. 214
   sqq.), charges Callistus with the Sabellian heresy, and defends the
   orthodoxy of Hippolytus by such easy reasoning as this (p. 254):
   "Callistus is asserted by Hippolytus to have been a heretic. No church
   historian affirms Callistus to have been orthodox. All church history
   that has spoken of Hippolytus,--and his name is one of the most
   celebrated in its annals,--has concurred in bearing witness to the
   soundness of his faith." Harnack (in Herzog X. 202) considers the
   formula of Callistus as the bridge from the original monarchianism of
   the Roman church to the hypostasis-christology (Die Bücke, auf welcher
   di ursprünglich monarchianisch gesinnten römischen Crhisten, dem Zuge
   der Zeit und der kirchtichen,WIssenschaft folgend, zur Anerkennung der

   223-225.

   5. Sabellius is by far the most original, profound, and ingenious of
   the ante-Nicene Unitarians, and his system the most plausible rival of
   orthodox trinitarianism. It revives from time to time in various
   modifications. [1080] 080 We know very little of his life. He was
   probably a Lybian from the Pentapolis. He spent some time in Rome in
   the beginning of the third century, and was first gained by Callistus
   to Patripassianism, but when the latter became bishop be was
   excommunicated. [1081] 081 The former fact is doubtful. His doctrine
   spread in Rome, and especially also in the Pentapolis in Egypt.
   Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, excommunicated him in 260 or 261
   [1082] 082 at a council in that city, and, in vehement opposition to
   him declared in almost Arian terms for the hypostatical independence
   and subordination of the Son in relation to the Father. This led the
   Sabellians to complain of that bishop to Dionysius of Rome, who held a
   council in 262, and in a special treatise controverted Sabellianism, as
   well as subordinatianism and tritheism, with nice orthodox tact. [1083]
   083 The bishop of Alexandria very cheerfully yielded, and retracted his
   assertion of the creaturely inferiority of the Son in favor of the
   orthodox homo-ousios. Thus the strife was for a while allayed, to be
   renewed with still greater violence by Arius half a century later.

   The system of Sabellius is known to us only from a few fragments, and
   some of these not altogether consistent, in Athanasius and other
   fathers.

   While the other Monarchians confine their inquiry to the relation of
   Father and Son, Sabellius embraces the Holy Spirit in his speculation,
   and reaches a trinity, not a simultaneous trinity of essence, however,
   but only a successive trinity of revelation. He starts from a
   distinction of the monad and the triad in the divine nature. His
   fundamental thought is, that the unity of God, without distinction in
   itself, unfolds or extends itself [1084] 084 in the course of the
   world's development in three different forms and periods of revelation
   [1085] 085 and, after the completion of redemption, returns into unity.
   The Father reveals himself in the giving of the law or the Old
   Testament economy (not in the creation also, which in his view precedes
   the trinitarian revelation); the Son, in the incarnation; the Holy
   Ghost, in inspiration. The revelation of the Son ends with the
   ascension; the revelation of the Spirit goes on in regeneration and
   sanctification. He illustrates the trinitarian relation by comparing
   the Father to the disc of the sun, the Son to its enlightening power,
   the Spirit to its warming influence. He is said also to have likened
   the Father to the body, the Son to the soul, the Holy Ghost to the
   spirit of man; but this is unworthy of his evident speculative
   discrimination. His view of the Logos, [1086] 086 too, is peculiar.
   The, Logos is not identical with the Son, but is the monad itself in
   its transition to triad; that is, God conceived as vital motion and
   creating principle, the speaking God, [1087] 087 in distinction from
   the silent God. [1088] 088 Each prosopon is another dialegesthai and
   the three prosopa together are only successive evolutions of the Logos
   or the worldward aspect of the divine nature. As the Logos proceeded
   from God, so he returns at last into him, and the process of
   trinitarian development [1089] 089 closes.

   Athanasius traced the doctrine of Sabellius to the Stoic philosophy.
   The common element is the pantheistic leading view of an expansion and
   contraction [1090] 090 of the divine nature immanent in the world. In
   the Pythagorean system also, in the Gospel of the Egyptians, and in the
   pseudo-Clementine Homilies, there are kindred ideas. But the
   originality of Sabellius cannot be brought into question by these. His
   theory broke the way for the Nicene church doctrine, by its full
   coordination of the three persons. He differs from the orthodox
   standard mainly in denying the trinity of essence and the permanence of
   the trinity of manifestation; making Father, Son, and Holy Ghost only
   temporary phenomena, which fulfil their mission and return into the
   abstract monad.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1080] We will only mention Marcellus of Ancyra., Schleiermacher, and
   Bushnell. Schleiermacher's doctrine of the trinity is a very ingenious
   improvement of Sabellianism.

   [1081] This we learn from Hippolytus, who introduces him rather
   incidentally (in his account of Callistus) as a man well known at his
   time in the Roman church.

   belonged originally to the Tübingen school, but pursues now an
   independent path, and lays greater stress on the ethical forces in
   history.

   The work of the triune God, in his self-revelation, is the salvation,
   or redemption and reconciliation of the world: negatively, the
   emancipation of humanity from the guilt and power of sin and death;
   positively, the communication of the righteousness and life of
   fellowship with God. First, the discord between the Creator and the
   creature must be adjusted; and then man can be carried onward to his
   destined perfection. Reconciliation with God is the ultimate aim of
   every religion. In heathenism it was only darkly guessed and felt
   after, or anticipated in perverted, fleshly forms. In Judaism it was
   divinely promised, typically foreshadowed, and historically prepared.
   In Christianity it is revealed in objective reality, according to the
   eternal counsel of the love and wisdom of God, through the life, death,
   and resurrection of Christ, and is being continually applied
   subjectively to individuals in the church by the Holy Spirit, through
   the means of grace, on condition of repentance and faith. Christ is,
   exclusively and absolutely, the Saviour of the world, and the Mediator
   between God and man.

   The apostolic scriptures, in the fulness of their inspiration,
   everywhere bear witness of this salvation wrought through Christ, as a
   living fact of experience. But it required time for the profound ideas
   of a Paul and a John to come up clearly to the view of the church;
   indeed, to this day they remain unfathomed. Here again experience
   anticipated theology. The church lived from the first on the atoning
   sacrifice of Christ. The cross ruled all Christian thought and conduct,
   and fed the spirit of martyrdom. But the primitive church teachers
   lived more in the thankful enjoyment of redemption than in logical
   reflection upon it. We perceive in their exhibitions of this blessed
   mystery the language rather of enthusiastic feeling than of careful
   definition and acute analysis. Moreover, this doctrine was never, like
   Christology and the doctrine of the Trinity, a subject of special
   controversy within the ancient church. The oecumenical symbols touch it
   only in general terms. The Apostles' Creed presents it in the article
   on the forgiveness of sins on the ground of the divine-human life,
   death, and resurrection of Christ. The Nicene Creed says, a little more
   definitely, that Christ became man for our salvation, [1091] 091 and
   died for us, and rose again.

   Nevertheless, all the essential elements of the later church doctrine
   of redemption may be found, either expressed or implied, before the
   close of the second century. The negative part of the doctrine, the
   subjection of the devil, the prince of the kingdom of sin and death,
   was naturally most dwelt on in the patristic period, on account of the
   existing conflict of Christianity with heathenism, which was regarded
   as wholly ruled by Satan and demons. Even in the New Testament,
   particularly in Col. 2:15, Heb. 2:14, and 1 John 3:8, the victory over
   the devil is made an integral part of the work of Christ. But this view
   was carried out in the early church in a very peculiar and, to some
   extent, mythical way; and in this form continued current, until the
   satisfaction theory of Anselm gave a new turn to the development of the
   dogma. Satan is supposed to have acquired, by the disobedience of our
   first parents, a legal claim (whether just or unjust) upon mankind, and
   held them bound in the chains of sin and death (Comp. Hebr. 2:14, 15).
   Christ came to our release. The victory over Satan was conceived now as
   a legal ransom by the payment of a stipulated price, to wit, the death
   of Christ; now as a cheat upon him, [1092] 092 either intentional and
   deserved, or due to his own infatuation. [1093] 093

   The theological development of the doctrine of the work of Christ began
   with the struggle against Jewish and heathen influences, and at the
   same time with the development of the doctrine of the person of Christ,
   which is inseparable from that of his work, and indeed fundamental to
   it. Ebionism, with its deistic and legal spirit, could not raise its
   view above the prophetic office of Christ to the priestly and the
   kingly, but saw in him only a new teacher and legislator. Gnosticism,
   from the naturalistic and pantheistic position of heathendom, looked
   upon redemption as a physical and intellectual process, liberating the
   spirit from the bonds of matter, the supposed principle of evil;
   reduced the human life and passion of Christ to a vain show; and could
   ascribe at best only a symbolical virtue to his death. For this reason
   even Ignatius, Irenaeus, and Tertullian, in their opposition to
   docetism, insist most earnestly on the reality of the humanity and
   death of Jesus, as the source of our reconciliation with God. [1094]
   094

   In Justin Martyr appear traces of the doctrine of satisfaction, though
   in very indefinite terms. He often refers to the Messianic fifty-third
   chapter of Isaiah.. [1095] 095

   The anonymous author of the Epistle to an unknown heathen, Diognetus,
   which has sometimes been ascribed to Justin, but is probably of much
   earlier date, has a beautiful and forcible passage on the mystery of
   redemption, which shows that the root of the matter was apprehended by
   faith long before a logical analysis was attempted. "When our
   wickedness" he says, [1096] 096 "had reached its height, and it had
   been clearly shown that its reward--punishment and death--was impending
   over us .... God himself took on Him the burden of our iniquities. He
   gave His own Son as a ransom for us, the holy One for transgressors,
   the blameless One for the wicked, the righteous One for the
   unrighteous, the incorruptible One for the corruptible, the immortal
   One for them that are mortal. For what other thing was capable of
   covering our sins than His righteousness? By what other one was it
   possible that we, the wicked and ungodly, could be justified, than by
   the only Son of God? O sweet exchange! O unsearchable operation! O
   benefits surpassing all expectation! that the wickedness of many should
   be hid in a single righteous One, and that the righteousness of One
   should justify many transgressors!"

   Irenaeus is the first of all the church teachers to give a careful
   analysis of the work of redemption, and his view is by far the deepest
   and soundest we find in the first three centuries. Christ, he teaches,
   as the second Adam, repeated in himself the entire life of man, from
   childhood to manhood, from birth to death and hades, and as it were
   summed up that life and brought it under one head, [1097] 097 with the
   double purpose of restoring humanity from its fall and carrying it to
   perfection. Redemption comprises the taking away of sin by the perfect
   obedience of Christ; the destruction of death by victory over the
   devil; and the communication of a new divine life to man. To accomplish
   this work, the Redeemer must unite in himself the divine and human
   natures; for only as God could he do what man could not, and only as
   man could he do in a legitimate way, what man should. By the voluntary
   disobedience of Adam the devil gained a power over man, but in an
   unfair way, by fraud. [1098] 098 By the voluntary obedience of Christ
   that power was wrested from him by lawful means. [1099] 099 This took
   place first in the temptation, in which Christ renewed or recapitulated
   the struggle of Adam with Satan, but defeated the seducer, and thereby
   liberated man from his thraldom. But then the whole life of Christ was
   a continuous victorious conflict with Satan, and a constant obedience
   to God. This obedience completed itself in the suffering and death on
   the tree of the cross, and thus blotted out the disobedience which the
   first Adam had committed on the tree of knowledge. This, however, is
   only the negative side. To this is added, as already remarked, the
   communication of a new divine principle of life, and the perfecting of
   the idea of humanity first effected by Christ.

   Origen differs from Irenaeus in considering man, in consequence of sin,
   the lawful property of Satan, and in representing the victory over
   Satan as an outwitting of the enemy, who had no claim to the sinless
   soul of Jesus, and therefore could not keep it in death. The ransom was
   paid, not to God, but to Satan, who thereby lost his right to man. Here
   Origen touches on mythical Gnosticism. He contemplates the death of
   Christ, however, from other points of view also, as an atoning
   sacrifice of love offered to God for the sins of the world; as the
   highest proof of perfect obedience to God; and as an example of
   patience. He singularly extends the virtue of this redemption to the
   whole spirit world, to fallen angels as well as men, in connection with
   his hypothesis of a final restoration. The only one of the fathers who
   accompanies him in this is Gregory of Nyssa.

   Athanasius, in his early youth, at the beginning of the next period,
   wrote the first systematic treatise on redemption and answer to the
   question "Cur Deus homo?" [1100] 100 But it was left for the Latin
   church, after the epoch-making treatise of Anselm, to develop this
   important doctrine in its various aspects.

   § 154. Other Doctrines.

   The doctrine of the subjective appropriation of salvation, including
   faith, justification, and sanctification, was as yet far less perfectly
   formed than the objective dogmas; and in the nature of the case, must
   follow the latter. If any one expects to find in this period, or in any
   of the church fathers, Augustin himself not excepted, the Protestant
   doctrine of justification by faith alone, as the "articulus stantis aut
   cadentis ecclesiae" be will be greatly disappointed. The incarnation of
   the Logos, his true divinity and true humanity, stand almost
   unmistakably in the foreground, as the fundamental truths. Paul's
   doctrine of justification, except perhaps in Clement of Rome, who joins
   it with the doctrine of James, is left very much out of view, and
   awaits the age of the Reformation to be more thoroughly established and
   understood. The fathers lay chief stress on sanctification and good
   works, and show the already existing germs of the Roman Catholic
   doctrine of the meritoriousness and even the supererogatory
   meritoriousness of Christian virtue. It was left to modern evangelical
   theology to develop more fully the doctrines of soteriology and
   subjective Christianity.

   The doctrine of the church, as the communion of grace , we have already
   considered in the chapter on the constitution of the church, [1101] 101
   and the doctrine of the sacraments, as the objective means of
   appropriating grace, in the chapter on worship. [1102] 102

   Christianity--and human life itself, with its countless problems and
   mysteries--has no meaning without the certainty of a future world of
   rewards and punishments, for which the present life serves as a
   preparatory school. Christ represents himself as "the Resurrection and
   the Life," and promises "eternal life" to all who believe in Him. On
   his resurrection the church is built, and without it the church could
   never have come into existence. The resurrection of the body and the
   life everlasting are among the fundamental articles of the early
   baptismal creeds. The doctrine of the future life, though last in the
   logical order of systematic theology, was among the first in the
   consciousness of the Christians, and an unfailing source of comfort and
   strength in times of trial and persecution. It stood in close
   connection with the expectation of the Lord's glorious reappearance. It
   is the subject of Paul's first Epistles, those to the Thessalonians,
   and is prominently discussed in the fifteenth chapter of First
   Corinthians. He declares the Christians "the most pitiable," because
   the most deluded and uselessly self-sacrificing, "of all men," if their
   hope in Christ were confined to this life.

   The ante-Nicene church was a stranger in the midst of a hostile world,
   and longed for the unfading crown which awaited the faithful confessor
   and martyr beyond the grave. Such a mighty revolution as the conversion
   of the heathen emperor was not dreamed of even as a remote possibility,
   except perhaps by the far-sighted Origen. Among the five causes to
   which Gibbon traces the rapid progress of the Christian religion he
   assigns the second place to the doctrine of the immortality of the
   soul. We know nothing whatever of a future world which lies beyond the
   boundaries of our observation and experience, except what God has
   chosen to reveal to us. Left to the instincts and aspirations of
   nature, which strongly crave after immortality and glory, we can reach
   at best only probabilities; while the gospel gives us absolute
   certainty, sealed by the resurrection of Christ.

   1. The heathen notions of the future life were vague and confused. The
   Hindoos, Babylonians, and Egyptians had a lively sense of immortality,
   but mixed with the idea of endless migrations and transformations. The
   Buddhists, starting from the idea that existence is want, and want is
   suffering, make it the chief end of man to escape such migrations, and
   by various mortifications to prepare for final absorption in Nirwana.
   The popular belief among the ancient Greeks and Romans was that man
   passes after death into the Underworld, the Greek Hades, the Roman
   Orcus. According to Homer, Hades is a dark abode in the interior of the
   earth, with an entrance at the Western extremity of the Ocean, where
   the rays of the sun do not penetrate. Charon carries the dead over the
   stream Acheron, and the three-headed dog Cerberus watches the entrance
   and allows none to pass out. There the spirits exist in a disembodied
   state and lead a shadowy dream-life. A vague distinction was made
   between two regions in Hades, an Elysium (also "the Islands of the
   Blessed") for the good, and Tartarus for the bad. "Poets and painters,"
   says Gibbon, peopled the infernal regions with so many phantoms and
   monsters, who dispensed their rewards and punishments with so little
   equity, that a solemn truth, the most congenial to the human heart, was
   oppressed and disgraced by the absurd mixture of the wildest fictions.
   The eleventh book of the Odyssey gives a very dreary and incoherent
   account of the infernal shades. Pindar and Virgil have embellished the
   picture; but even those poets, though more correct than their great
   model, are guilty of very strange inconsistencies." [1103] 103

   Socrates, Plato, Cicero, Seneca, and Plutarch rose highest among the
   ancient philosophers in their views of the future life, but they
   reached only to belief in its probability--not in its certainty.
   Socrates, after be was condemned to death, said to his judges: "Death
   is either an eternal sleep, or the transition to a new life; but in
   neither case is it an evil;" [1104] 104 and he drank with playful irony
   the fatal hemlock. Plato, viewing the human soul as a portion of the
   eternal, infinite, all-pervading deity, believed in its pre-existence
   before this present life, and thus had a strong ground of hope for its
   continuance after death. All the souls (according to his Phaedon and
   Gorgias, pass into the spirit-world, the righteous into the abodes of
   bliss, where they live forever in a disembodied state, the wicked into
   Tartarus for punishment and purification (which notion prepared the way
   for purgatory). Plutarch, the purest and noblest among the Platonists,
   thought that immortality was inseparably connected with belief in an
   all-ruling Providence, and looked with Plato to the life beyond as
   promising a higher knowledge of, and closer conformity to God, but only
   for those few who are here purified by virtue and piety. In such rare
   cases, departure might be called an ascent to the stars, to heaven, to
   the gods, rather than a descent to Hades. He also, at the death of his
   daughter, expresses his faith in the blissful state of infants who die
   in infancy. Cicero, in his Tusculan Questions and treatise De
   Senectute, reflects in classical language "the ignorance, the errors,
   and the uncertainty of the ancient philosophers with regard to the
   immortality of the soul." Though strongly leaning to a positive view,
   he yet found it no superfluous task to quiet the fear of death in case
   the soul should perish with the body. The Stoics believed only in a
   limited immortality, or denied it altogether, and justified suicide
   when life became unendurable. The great men of Greece and Rome were not
   influenced by the idea of a future world as a motive of action. During
   the debate on the punishment of Catiline and his fellow-conspirators,
   Julius Caesar openly declared in the Roman Senate that death dissolves
   all the ills of mortality, and is the boundary of existence beyond
   which there is no more care nor joy, no more punishment for sin, nor
   any reward for virtue. The younger Cato, the model Stoic, agreed with
   Caesar; yet before he made an end to his life at Utica, he read Plato's
   Phaedon. Seneca once dreamed of immortality, and almost approached the
   Christian hope of the birth-day of eternity, if we are to trust his
   rhetoric, but afterwards he awoke from the beautiful dream and
   committed suicide. The elder Pliny, who found a tragic death under the
   lava of Vesuvius, speaks of the future life as an invention of man's
   vanity and selfishness, and thinks that body and soul have no more
   sensation after death than before birth; death becomes doubly painful
   if it is only the beginning of another indefinite existence. Tacitus
   speaks but once of immortality, and then conditionally; and he believed
   only in the immortality of fame. Marcus Aurelius, in sad resignation,
   bids nature, "Give what thou wilt, and take back again what and when
   thou wilt."

   These were noble and earnest, Romans. What can be expected from the
   crown of frivolous men of the world who moved within the limits of
   matter and sense and made present pleasure and enjoyment the chief end
   of life? The surviving wife of an Epicurean philosopher erected a
   monument to him, with the inscription "to the eternal sleep." [1105]
   105 Not a few heathen epitaphs openly profess the doctrine that death
   ends all; while, in striking contrast with them, the humble Christian
   inscriptions in the catacombs express the confident hope of future
   bliss and glory in the uninterrupted communion of the believer with
   Christ and God.

   Yet the scepticism of the educated and half-educated could not
   extinguish the popular belief in the imperial age. The number of
   cheerless and hopeless materialistic epitaphs is, after all, very small
   as compared with the many thousands which reveal no such doubt, or
   express a belief in some kind of existence beyond the grave. [1106] 106

   Of a resurrection of the body the Greeks and Romans had no conception,
   except in the form of shades and spectral outlines, which were supposed
   to surround the disembodied spirits, and to make them to some degree
   recognizable. Heathen philosophers, like Celsus, ridiculed the
   resurrection of the body as useless, absurd, and impossible.

   2. The Jewish doctrine is far in advance of heathen notions and
   conjectures, but presents different phases of development.

   (a) The Mosaic writings are remarkably silent about the future life,
   and emphasize the present rather than future consequences of the
   observance or non-observance of the law (because it had a civil or
   political as well as spiritual import); and hence the Sadducees
   accepted them, although they denied the resurrection (perhaps also the
   immortality of the soul). The Pentateuch contains, however, some remote
   and significant hints of immortality, as in the tree of life with its
   symbolic import; [1107] 107 in the mysterious translation of Enoch as a
   reward for his piety; [1108] 108 in the prohibition of necromancy;
   [1109] 109 in the patriarchal phrase for dying: "to be gathered to his
   fathers," or "to his people;" [1110] 110 and last, though not least, in
   the self-designation of Jehovah as "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob," which implies their immortality, since "God is not the God of
   the dead, but of the living." [1111] 111 What has an eternal meaning
   for God must itself be eternal.

   (b) In the later writings of the Old Testament, especially during and
   after the exile, the doctrine of immortality and resurrection comes out
   plainly. [1112] 112 Daniel's vision reaches out even to the final
   resurrection of "many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth to
   everlasting life," and of "some to shame and everlasting contempt," and
   prophesies that "they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of
   the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
   forever and ever." [1113] 113

   But before Christ, who first revealed true life, the Hebrew Sheol, the
   general receptacle of departing souls, remained, like the Greek Hades,
   a dark and dreary abode, and is so described in the Old Testament.
   [1114] 114 Cases like Enoch's translation and Elijah's ascent are
   altogether unique and exceptional, and imply the meaning that death is
   contrary to man's original destination, and may be overcome by the
   power of holiness.

   (c) The Jewish Apocrypha (the Book of Wisdom, and the Second Book of
   Maccabees), and later Jewish writings (the Book of Enoch, the
   Apocalypse of Ezra) show some progress: they distinguish between two
   regions in Sheol--Paradise or Abraham's Bosom for the righteous, and
   Gehinnom or Gehenna for the wicked; they emphasize the resurrection of
   the body, and the future rewards and punishments.

   (d) The Talmud adds various fanciful embellishments. It puts Paradise
   and Gehenna in close proximity, measures their extent, and
   distinguishes different departments in both corresponding to the
   degrees of merit and guilt. Paradise is sixty times as large as the
   world, and Hell sixty times as large as Paradise, for the bad
   preponderate here and hereafter. According to other rabbinical
   testimonies, both are well nigh boundless. The Talmudic descriptions of
   Paradise (as those of the Koran) mix sensual and spiritual delights.
   The righteous enjoy the vision of the Shechina and feast with the
   patriarchs, and with Moses and David of the flesh of leviathan, and
   drink wine from the cup of salvation. Each inhabitant has a house
   according to his merit. Among the punishments of hell the chief place
   is assigned to fire, which is renewed every week after the Sabbath. The
   wicked are boiled like the flesh in the pot, but the bad Israelites are
   not touched by fire, and are otherwise tormented. The severest
   punishment is reserved for idolaters, hypocrites, traitors, and
   apostates. As to the duration of future punishment the school of
   Shammai held that it was everlasting; while the school of Hillel
   inclined to the milder view of a possible redemption after repentance
   and purification. Some Rabbis taught that hell will cease, and that the
   sun will burn up and annihilate the wicked. [1115] 115

   3. The Christian doctrine of the future life differs from the heathen,
   and to a less extent also from the Jewish, in the following important
   points:

   (a) It gives to the belief in a future state the absolute certainty of
   divine revelation, sealed by the fact of Christ's resurrection, and
   thereby imparts to the present life an immeasurable importance,
   involving endless issues.

   (b) It connects the resurrection of the body with the immortality of
   the soul, and thus gives concrete completion to the latter, and saves
   the whole individuality of man from destruction.

   (c) It views death as the punishment of sin, and therefore as something
   terrible, from which nature shrinks. But its terror has been broken,
   and its sting extracted by Christ.

   (d) It qualifies the idea of a future state by the doctrine of sin and
   redemption, and thus makes it to the believer a state of absolute
   holiness and happiness, to the impenitent sinner a state of absolute
   misery. Death and immortality are a blessing to the one, but a terror
   to the other; the former can hail them with joy; the latter has reason
   to tremble.

   (e) It gives great prominence to the general judgment, after the
   resurrection, which determines the ultimate fate of all men according
   to their works done in this earthly life.

   But we must distinguish, in this mysterious article, what is of faith,
   and what is private opinion and speculation.

   The return of Christ to judgment with its eternal rewards and
   punishment is the centre of the eschatological faith of the church. The
   judgment is preceded by the general resurrection, and followed by life
   everlasting.

   This faith is expressed in the oecumenical creeds.

   The Apostles' Creed:

   "He shall come to judge the quick and the dead," and "I believe in the
   resurrection of the body and life everlasting."

   The Nicene Creed:

   "He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead;
   whose kingdom shall have no end." "And we look for the resurrection of
   the dead, and the life of the world to come."

   The Athanasian Creed, so called, adds to these simple statements a
   damnatory clause at the beginning, middle, and end, and makes salvation
   depend on belief in the orthodox catholic doctrine of the Trinity and
   the Incarnation, as therein stated. But that document is of much later
   origin, and cannot be traced beyond the sixth century.

   The liturgies which claim apostolic or post-apostolic origin, give
   devotional expression to the same essential points in the eucharistic
   sacrifice.

   The Clementine liturgy:

   "Being mindful, therefore, of His passion and death, and resurrection
   from the dead, and return into the heavens, and His future second
   appearing, wherein He is to come with glory and power to judge the
   quick and the dead, and to recompense to every one according to his
   works."

   The liturgy of James:

   "His second glorious and awful appearing, when He shall come with glory
   to judge the quick and the dead, and render to every one according to
   his works."

   The liturgy of Mark:

   "His second terrible and dreadful coming, in which He will come to
   judge righteously the quick and the dead, and to render to each man
   according to his works."

   All that is beyond these revealed and generally received articles must
   be left free. The time of the Second Advent, the preceding revelation
   of Antichrist, the millennium before or after the general judgment, the
   nature of the disembodied state between death and resurrection, the
   mode and degree of future punishment, the proportion of the saved and
   lost, the fate of the heathen and all who die ignorant of Christianity,
   the locality of heaven and hell, are open questions in eschatology
   about which wise and good men in the church have always differed, and
   will differ to the end. The Bible speaks indeed of ascending to heaven
   and descending to hell, but this is simply the unavoidable popular
   language, as when it speaks of the rising and setting sun. We do the
   same, although we know that in the universe of God there is neither
   above nor below, and that the sun does not move around the earth. The
   supernatural world may be very far from us, beyond the stars and beyond
   the boundaries of the visible created world (if it has any boundaries),
   or very near and round about us. At all events there is an abundance of
   room for all God's children. "In my Father's house are many mansions. I
   go to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2). This suffices for faith.

   ed. 1881. Defends prayers for the dead.

   Among the darkest points in eschatology is the middle state, or the
   condition of the soul between death and resurrection. It is difficult
   to conceive of a disembodied state of happiness or woe without physical
   organs for enjoyment and suffering. Justin Martyr held that the souls
   retain their sensibility after death, otherwise the bad would have the
   advantage over the good. Origen seems to have assumed some refined,
   spiritual corporeity which accompanies the soul on its lonely journey,
   and is the germ of the resurrection body; but the speculative opinions
   of that profound thinker were looked upon with suspicion, and some of
   them were ultimately condemned. The idea of the sleep of the soul
   (psychopannychia) had some advocates, but was expressly rejected by
   Tertullian. [1116] 116 Others held that the soul died with the body,
   and was created anew at the resurrection. [1117] 117 The prevailing
   view was that the soul continued in a conscious, though disembodied
   state, by virtue either of inherent or of communicated immortality. The
   nature of that state depends upon the moral character formed in this
   life either for weal or woe, without the possibility of a change except
   in the same direction.

   The catholic doctrine of the status intermedius was chiefly derived
   from the Jewish tradition of the Sheol, from the parable of Dives and
   Lazarus (Luke 16:19 sqq.), and from the passages of Christ's descent
   into Hades. [1118] 118 The utterances of the ante-Nicene fathers are
   somewhat vague and confused, but receive light from the more mature
   statements of the Nicene and post-Nicene fathers, and may be reduced to
   the following points: [1119] 119

   1. The pious who died before Christ from Abel or Adam down to John the
   Baptist (with rare exceptions, as Enoch, Moses, and Elijah) were
   detained in a part of Sheol, [1120] 120 waiting for the first Advent,
   and were released by Christ after the crucifixion and transferred to
   Paradise. This was the chief aim and result of the descensus ad
   inferos, as understood in the church long before it became an article
   of the Apostles' Creed, first in Aquileja (where, however, Rufinus
   explained it wrongly, as being equivalent to burial), and then in Rome.
   Hermas of Rome and Clement of Alexandria supposed that the patriarchs
   and Old Testament saints, before their translation, were baptized by
   Christ and the apostles. Irenaeus repeatedly refers to the descent of
   Christ to the spirit-world as the only means by which the benefits of
   the redemption could be made known and applied to the pious dead of
   former ages. [1121] 121

   2. Christian martyrs and confessors, to whom were afterwards added
   other eminent saints, pass immediately after death into heaven to the
   blessed vision of God. [1122] 122

   3. The majority of Christian believers, being imperfect, enter for an
   indefinite period into a preparatory state of rest and happiness,
   usually called Paradise (comp. Luke 23:41) or Abraham's Bosom (Luke
   16:23). There they are gradually purged of remaining infirmities until
   they are ripe for heaven, into which nothing is admitted but absolute
   purity. Origen assumed a constant progression to higher and higher
   regions of knowledge and bliss. (After the fifth or sixth century,
   certainly since Pope Gregory I., Purgatory was substituted for
   Paradise).

   4. The locality of Paradise is uncertain: some imagined it to be a
   higher region of Hades beneath the earth, yet "afar off" from Gehenna,
   and separated from it by "a great gulf" (comp. Luke 16:23, 26); [1123]
   123 others transferred it to the lower regions of heaven above the
   earth, yet clearly distinct from the final home of the blessed. [1124]
   124

   5. Impenitent Christians and unbelievers go down to the lower regions
   of Hades (Gehenna, Tartarus, Hell) into a preparatory state of misery
   and dreadful expectation of the final judgment. From the fourth century
   Hades came to be identified with Hell, and this confusion passed into
   many versions of the Bible, including that of King James.

   6. The future fate of the heathen and of unbaptized children was left
   in hopeless darkness, except by Justin and the Alexandrian fathers, who
   extended the operations of divine grace beyond the limits of the
   visible church. Justin Martyr must have believed, from his premises, in
   the salvation of all those heathen who had in this life followed the
   light of the Divine Logos and died in a state of unconscious
   Christianity, or preparedness for Christianity. For, he says, "those
   who lived with the Logos were Christians, although they were esteemed
   atheists, as Socrates and Heraclitus, and others like them." [1125] 125

   7. There are, in the other world, different degrees of happiness and
   misery according to the degrees of merit and guilt. This is reasonable
   in itself, and supported by scripture.

   8. With the idea of the imperfection of the middle state and the
   possibility of progressive amelioration, is connected the commemoration
   of the departed, and prayer in their behalf. No trace of the custom is
   found in the New Testament nor in the canonical books of the Old, but
   an isolated example, which seems to imply habit, occurs in the age of
   the Maccabees, when Judas Maccabaeus and his company offered prayer and
   sacrifice for those slain in battle," that they might be delivered from
   sin." [1126] 126 In old Jewish service-books there are prayers for the
   blessedness of the dead. [1127] 127 The strong sense of the communion
   of saints unbroken by death easily accounts for the rise of a similar
   custom among the early Christians. Tertullian bears clear testimony to
   its existence at his time. "We offer," he says "oblations for the dead
   on the anniversary of their birth," i.e. their celestial birthday.
   [1128] 128 He gives it as a mark of a Christian widow, that she prays
   for the soul of her husband, and requests for him refreshment and
   fellowship in the first resurrection; and that she offers sacrifice on
   the anniversaries of his falling asleep. [1129] 129 Eusebius narrates
   that at the tomb of Constantine a vast crowd of people, in company with
   the priests of God, with tears and great lamentation offered their
   prayers to God for the emperor's soul. [1130] 130 Augustin calls prayer
   for the pious dead in the eucharistic sacrifice an observance of the
   universal church, handed down from the fathers. [1131] 131 He himself
   remembered in prayer his godly mother at her dying request.

   This is confirmed by the ancient liturgies, which express in substance
   the devotions of the ante-Nicene age, although they were not committed
   to writing before the fourth century. The commemoration of the pious
   dead is an important part in the eucharistic prayers. Take the
   following from the Liturgy of St. James: "Remember, O Lord God, the
   spirits of whom we have made mention, and of whom we have not made
   mention, who are of the true faith, [1132] 132 from righteous Abel unto
   this day; do Thou Thyself give them rest there in the land of the
   living, in Thy kingdom, in the delight of Paradise, [1133] 133in the
   Bosom of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, our holy fathers; whence
   pain and grief and lamentation have fled away: there the light of Thy
   countenance looks upon them, and gives them light for evermore." The
   Clementine Liturgy in the eighth book of the "Apostolical
   Constitutions" has likewise a prayer "for those who rest in faith," in
   these words: "We make an offering to Thee for all Thy saints who have
   pleased Thee from the beginning of the world, patriarchs, prophets,
   just men, apostles, martyrs, confessors, bishops, elders, deacons,
   subdeacons, singers, virgins, widows, laymen, and all whose names Thou
   Thyself knowest."

   9. These views of the middle state in connection with prayers for the
   dead show a strong tendency to the Roman Catholic doctrine of
   Purgatory, which afterwards came to prevail in the West through the
   great weight of St. Augustin and Pope Gregory I. But there is, after
   all, a considerable difference. The ante-Nicene idea of the middle
   state of the pious excludes, or at all events ignores, the idea of
   penal suffering, which is an essential part of the Catholic conception
   of purgatory. It represents the condition of the pious as one of
   comparative happiness, inferior only to the perfect happiness after the
   resurrection. Whatever and wherever Paradise may be, it belongs to the
   heavenly world; while purgatory is supposed to be a middle region
   between heaven and hell, and to border rather on the latter. The
   sepulchral inscriptions in the catacombs have a prevailingly cheerful
   tone, and represent the departed souls as being "in peace" and "living
   in Christ," or "in God." [1134] 134 The same view is substantially
   preserved in the Oriental church, which holds that the souls of the
   departed believers may be aided by the prayers of the living, but are
   nevertheless "in light and rest, with a foretaste of eternal
   happiness." [1135] 135

   Yet alongside with this prevailing belief, there are traces of the
   purgatorial idea of suffering the temporal consequences of sin, and a
   painful struggle after holiness. Origen, following in the path of
   Plato, used the term "purgatorial fire," [1136] 136 by which the
   remaining stains of the soul shall be burned away; but he understood it
   figuratively, and connected it with the consuming fire at the final
   judgment, while Augustin and Gregory I. transferred it to the middle
   state. The common people and most of the fathers understood it of a
   material fire; but this is not a matter of faith, and there are Roman
   divines [1137] 137 who confine the purgatorial sufferings to the mind
   and the conscience. A material fire would be very harmless without a
   material body. A still nearer approach to the Roman purgatory was made
   by Tertullian and Cyprian, who taught that a special satisfaction and
   penance was required for sins committed after baptism, and that the
   last farthing must be paid (Matt. 5:20) before the soul can be released
   from prison and enter into heaven.

   [1120] The mediaeval scholastics called that part of Sheol the Limbus
   Patrum, and assumed that it was emptied by Christ at his descent, and
   replaced by Purgatory, which in turn will be emptied it the second
   Advent, so that after the judgment there will be only heaven and hell.
   The evangelical confessions agree with the Roman Catholic in the
   twofold state after the judgment, but deny the preceding state of
   Purgatory between heaven and hell. They allow, however, different
   degrees of holiness and happiness as well as guilt and punishment
   before and after the judgment.

   [1121] Adv. Haer. IV. 27, § 2: "It was for this reason that the Lord
   descended into the regions beneath the earth, preaching His advent to
   them also, and [declaring] the remission of sins to those who believe
   in Him. Now all those believed in Him who had hope towards him, that
   is, those who proclaimed His advent, and submitted to His
   dispensations, the righteous men, the prophets, and the patriarchs, to
   whom He remitted sins in the same way, as He did to us, which sins we
   should not lay to their charge, if we would not despise the grace of
   God." This passage exists only in the Latin version

   [1122] The Gnostics taught that all souls return immediately to God,
   but this was rejected as heretical. Justin, Dial. 80.

   [1123] So apparently Tertullian, who calls Gehenna "a reservoir of
   secret fire under the earth," and Paradise "the place of divine bliss
   appointed to receive the spirits of the saints, separated from the
   knowledge of this world by that fiery zone [i.e. the river
   Pyriphlegeton as by a sort of enclosure." ] Apol. c. 47.

   [1124] So Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. V. 5, § 1: "Wherefore also the elders
   who were disciples of the apostles tell us that those who were
   translated were transferred to that place (for paradise has been
   prepared for righteous men, such as have the Spirit; in which place
   also Paul the apostle, when he was caught up, heard words which are
   unspeakable as regards us in our present condition), and that there
   shall they who have been translated remain until the consummation [of
   all things], as a prelude to immortality."

   say anywhere expressly that the nobler heathen are saved; but it
   follows from his view of the Logos spermaticos (see p. 550). It was
   renewed in the sixteenth century by Zwingli, and may be consistently
   held by all who make salvation depend on eternal election rather than
   on water-baptism. God is not bound by his own ordinances, and may save
   whom and when and how he pleases.

   [1126] 2 Macc. 12:39 sqq. Roman Catholic divines use this passage
   (besides Matt. 5:26; 12:32 and 1 Cor. 1:13-15) as an argument for the
   doctrine of purgatory. But it would prove too much for them; for the
   sin here spoken of was not venial, but the deadly sin of idolatry,
   which is excluded from purgatory and from the reach of efficacious;
   intercession.

   § 157. After Judgment. Future Punishment.

   The doctrine of the Fathers on future punishment is discussed by Dr.
   Edward Beecher, l.c., and in the controversial works called forth by
   Canon Farrar's Eternal Hope (Five Sermons preached in Westminster
   Abbey, Nov. 1877. Lond., 1879.) See especially

   Dr. Pusey: "What is of Faith as to Everlasting Punishment?" A Reply to
   Dr. Farrar's Challenge. Oxf. and Lond., second ed. 1880 (284 pages).

   Canon F. W. Farrar: Mercy and Judgment: A few last words on Christian
   Eschatology with reference to Dr. Pusey's "What is of Faith?" London
   and N. York, 1881 (485 pages). See chs. II., III., IX.-XII. Farrar
   opposes with much fervor "the current opinions about Hell," and reduces
   it to the smallest possible dimensions of time and space, but expressly
   rejects Universalism. He accepts with Pusey the Romanizing view of
   "future purification" (instead of "probation"), and thus increases the
   number of the saved by withdrawing vast multitudes of imperfect
   Christians from the awful doom.

   After the general judgment we have nothing revealed but the boundless
   prospect of aeonian life and aeonian death. This is the ultimate
   boundary of our knowledge.

   There never was in the Christian church any difference of opinion
   concerning the righteous, who shall inherit eternal life and enjoy the
   blessed communion of God forever and ever. But the final fate of the
   impenitent who reject the offer of salvation admits of three answers to
   the reasoning mind: everlasting punishment, annihilation, restoration
   (after remedial punishment and repentance).

   I. Everlasting Punishment of the wicked always was, and always will be
   the orthodox theory. It was held by the Jews at the time of Christ,
   with the exception of the Sadducces, who denied the resurrection.
   [1138] 138 It is endorsed by the highest authority of the most merciful
   Being, who sacrificed his own life for the salvation of sinners. [1139]
   139

   Consequently the majority of the fathers who speak plainly on this
   terrible subject, favor this view.

   Ignatius speaks of "the unquenchable fire;" [1140] 140 Hermas, of some
   "who will not be saved," but "shall utterly perish," because they will
   not repent. [1141] 141

   Justin Martyr teaches that the wicked or hopelessly impenitent will be
   raised at the judgment to receive eternal punishment. He speaks of it
   in twelve passages. "Briefly," he says, "what we look for, and have
   learned from Christ, and what we teach, is as follows. Plato said to
   the same effect, that Rhadamanthus and Minos would punish the wicked
   when they came to them; we say that the same thing will take place; but
   that the judge will be Christ, and that their souls will be united to
   the same bodies, and will undergo an eternal punishment (aionian
   kolasin) and not, as Plato said, a period of only a thousand years
   (chiliontaete periodon)" [1142] 142 In another place: "We believe that
   all who live wickedly and do not repent, will be punished in eternal
   fire" (en aionio puri). [1143] 143 Such language is inconsistent with
   the annihilation theory for which Justin M. has been claimed. [1144]
   144 He does, indeed, reject with several other ante-Nicene writers, the
   Platonic idea that the soul is in itself and independently immortal
   [1145] 145 and hints at the possibility of the final destruction of the
   wicked, [1146] 146 but he puts that possibility countless ages beyond
   the final judgment, certainly beyond the Platonic millennium of
   punishment, so that it loses all practical significance and ceases to
   give relief.

   Irenaeus has been represented as holding inconsistently all three
   theories, or at least as hesitating between the orthodox view and the
   annihilation scheme. He denies, like Justin Martyr, the necessary and
   intrinsic immortality of the soul, and makes it dependent on God for
   the continuance in life as well as for life itself. [1147] 147 But in
   paraphrasing the apostolic rule of faith he mentions eternal
   punishment, and in another place he accepts as certain truth that
   "eternal fire is prepared for sinners," because "the Lord openly
   affirms, and the other Scriptures prove" it. [1148] 148 Hippolytus
   approves the eschatology of the Pharisees as regards the resurrection,
   the immortality of the soul, the judgment and conflagration,
   everlasting life and "everlasting punishment;" and in another place be
   speaks of "the rayless scenery of gloomy Tartarus, where never shines a
   beam from the radiating voice of the Word." [1149] 149 According to
   Tertullian the future punishment "will continue, not for a long time,
   but forever." [1150] 150 It does credit to his feelings when he says
   that no innocent man can rejoice in the punishment of the guilty,
   however just, but will grieve rather. Cyprian thinks that the fear of
   hell is the only ground of the fear of death to any one, and that we
   should have before our eyes the fear of God and eternal punishment much
   more than the fear of men and brief suffering. [1151] 151 The
   generality of this belief among Christians is testified by Celsus, who
   tells them that the heathen priests threaten the same "eternal
   punishment" as they, and that the only question was which was right,
   since both claimed the truth with equal confidence. [1152] 152

   II. The final Annihilation of the wicked removes all discord from the
   universe of God at the expense of the natural immortality of the soul,
   and on the ground that sin will ultimately destroy the sinner, and thus
   destroy itself.

   This theory is attributed to Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and others, who
   believed only in a conditional immortality which may be forfeited; but,
   as we have just seen, their utterances in favor of eternal punishment
   are too clear and strong to justify the inference which they might have
   drawn from their psychology.

   Arnobius, however, seems to have believed in actual annihilation; for
   he speaks of certain souls that "are engulfed and burned up," or
   "hurled down and having been reduced to nothing, vanish in the
   frustration of a perpetual destruction." [1153] 153

   III. The Apokatastasis or final restoration of all rational beings to
   holiness and happiness. This seems to be the most satisfactory
   speculative solution of the problem of sin, and secures perfect harmony
   in the creation, but does violence to freedom with its power to
   perpetuate resistance, and Ignores the hardening nature of sin and the
   ever increasing difficulty of repentance. If conversion and salvation
   are an ultimate necessity, they lose their moral character, and moral
   aim.

   Origen was the first Christian Universalist. He taught a final
   restoration, but with modesty as a speculation rather than a dogma, in
   his youthful work De Principiis (written before 231), which was made
   known in the West by the loose version of Rufinus (398). [1154] 154 In
   his later writings there are only faint traces of it; he seems at least
   to have modified it, and exempted Satan from final repentance and
   salvation, but this defeats the end of the theory. [1155] 155 He also
   obscured it by his other theory of the necessary mutability of free
   will, and the constant succession of fall and redemption. [1156] 156

   Universal salvation (including Satan) was clearly taught by Gregory of
   Nyssa, a profound thinker of the school of Origen (d. 395), and, from
   an exegetical standpoint, by the eminent Antiochian divines Diodorus of
   Tarsus (d. 394) and Theodore of Mopsuestia (d. 429), and many Nestorian
   bishops. [1157] 157 In the West also at the time of Augustin (d. 430)
   there were, as he says, "multitudes who did not believe in eternal
   punishment." But the view of Origen was rejected by Epiphanius, Jerome,
   and Augustin, and at last condemned as one of the Origenistic errors
   under the Emperor Justinian (543). [1158] 158

   Since that time universalism was regarded as a heresy, but is tolerated
   in Protestant churches as a private speculative opinion or charitable
   hope. [1159] 159
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1138] The point is disputed, but the 4th Maccabees, the 4th Esdras,
   the Book of Enoch, the Apocalypse of Baruch, and the Psalms of Solomon,
   contain very strong passages, which Dr. Pusey has collected, l.c.
   48-100, and are not invalidated by the reply of Farrar, ch. VIII.
   180-221. Josephus (whose testimony Farrar arbitrarily sets aside as
   worthless) attests the belief of the Pharisees and Essenes in eternal
   punishment, Ant. XVIII. 1, 3; Bell. Jud. II. 8, 11, Rabbi Akiba (about
   120) limited the punishment of Gehenna to twelve months; but only for
   the Jews. The Talmud assigns certain classes to everlasting punishment,
   especially apostates and those who despise the wisdom of the Rabbis.
   The chief passage is Rosh Hoshanah, f. 16 and 17: "There will be three
   divisions on the day of judgment, the perfectly righteous, the
   perfectly wicked, and the intermediate class. The first will be at once
   inscribed and sealed to life eternal; the second at once to Gehenna
   (Dan. 12:2); the third will descend into Gehenna and keep rising and
   sinking" (Zech. 12:10). This opinion was endorsed by the two great
   schools of Shammai and Hillel, but Hillel inclined to a liberal and
   charitable construction (see p. 596). Farrar maintains that Gehenna
   does not necessarily and usually mean hell in our sense, but 1) for
   Jews, or the majority of Jews, a short punishment, followed by
   forgiveness and escape; 2) for worse offenders a long but still
   terminable punishment; 3) for the worst offenders, especially
   Gentiles--punishment followed by annihilation. He quotes several modern
   Jewish authorities of the rationalistic type, eg. Dr. Deutsch, who
   says: "There is not a word in the Talmud that lends any support to the
   damnable dogma of endless torment." But Dr. Ferd. Weber who is as good
   authority, says, that some passages in the Talmud teach total
   annihilation of the wicked, others teach everlasting punishment, e.g.
   Pesachim 54a: "The fire of Gehenna is never extinguished." Syst. der
   altsynag. Poläst. Theologie, p. 375. The Mohammedans share the Jewish
   belief, but change the inhabitants: the Koran assigns Paradise to the
   orthodox Moslems, and Hell to all unbelievers (Jews, Gentiles, and
   Christians), and to apostates from Islam.

   [1139] Matt. 12:32 (the unpardonable sin); 26:24 (Judas had better
   never been born); 25:46 ("eternal punishment" contrasted with "eternal
   life"); Mark 9:48 ("Gehenna, where their worm dieth not, and the fire
   is not quenched"). In the light of these solemn declarations we must
   interpret the passages of Paul (Rom. 5:12 sqq.; 14:9; 1 Cor. 15:22,
   28), which look towards universal restoration. The exegetical
   discussion lies outside of our scope, but is the meaning of aionioshas
   been drawn into the patristic discussion, it is necessary to remark
   that the argumentative force lies not in the etymological and
   independent meaning of the word, which is limited to aeon, but in its
   connection with future punishment as contrasted with future reward,
   which no man doubts to be everlasting (Matt. 25:46). On the exegetical
   question see M. Stuart, l.c., and especially the excursus of Taylor
   Lewis on Olamic and Aeonian words in Scripture, in Lange's Com. on
   Ecclesiastes (Am. ed. p. 44-51).

   against the Platonists) Adv. Graec. c. 13) "The soul is not immortal in
   itself, O Greeks, but mortal (ouk estin athanatos he psuche kath'
   heauten, thnete de). Yet it is possible for it not to die."Irenaeus,
   Theophilus of Antioch, Arnobius, and Lactantius held the same view. See
   Nitzsch, I. 35l-353.

   [1146] In Dial.c. 5, he puts into the mouth of the aged man by whom he
   was converted, the sentence: "Such as are worthy to see God die no
   more, but others shall undergo punishment as long as it shall please
   Him that they shall exist and be punished." But just before he had
   said: "I do not say that all souls die: for that would be a godsend to
   the wicked. What then? the souls of the pious remain in a better place,
   while those of the unjust and wicked are in a worse, waiting for the
   time of judgment." Comp. the note of Otto on the passage, Op. II. 26.

   [1147] Adv. Haer. 11. 34, § 3: "omnia quae facta sunt ... perseverant
   quoadusque ea Deus et esse et perseverare voluerit." Irenaeus reasons
   that whatever is created had a beginning, and therefore may have an
   end. Whether it will continue or not, depends upon man's gratitude or
   ingratitude. He who preserves the gift of life and is grateful to the
   Giver, shall receive length of days forever and ever )accipiet et in
   saeculum saeculi longitudinem dierum); but he who casts it away and
   becomes ungrateful to his Maker, "deprives himself of perseverance
   forever "(ipse se privat in saeculum saeculi perseverantia). From this
   passage, which exists only in the imperfect Latin version, Dodwell,
   Beecher (p. 260), and Farrar (241) infer that Irenaeus taught
   annihilation, and interpret perseverantia to mean continued existence;
   while Massuet (see his note in Stieren 1. 415), and Pusey (p. 183)
   explain perseverantia of continuance in real life in God, or eternal
   happiness. The passage, it must be admitted, is not clear, for
   longitudo dierum and perseverantia are not identical, nor is
   perseverantia equivalent to existentia or vita. In Bk. IV. 20, 7,
   Irenaeus says that Christ "became the dispenser of the paternal grace
   for the benefit of man ... lest man, failing away from God altogether,
   should cease to exist " (cessaret esse); but he adds, "the life of man
   consists in beholding God " (vita autem hominus visio Dei). In the
   fourth Pfaffian Fragment ascribed to him (Stieren I. 889), he says that
   Christ "will come at the end of time to destroy all evil (eis to
   katargesai pan to kakon) and to reconcile all things (eis to
   apokatallaxai to panta, from Col. 1:20) that there may be an end of all
   impurity." This passage, like 1 Cor. 15:28 and Col. 1:20, looks towards
   universal restoration rather than annihilation, but admits, like the
   Pauline passages, of an interpretation consistent with eternal
   punishment. See the long note in Stieren.

   has become a moral impossibility. See his posthumous Dogmatik, ed. by

   [1155] It is usually asserted from Augustin down to Nitzsch (I. 402),
   that Origen included Satan in the apokatastasis ton panton, but In Ep.
   ad Rom. l. VIII. 9 (Opera IV. 634) he says that Satan will not be
   converted, not even at the end of the world, and in a letter Ad quosdam
   amicos Alex. (Opera I. 5, quoted by Pusey, p. 125) " Although they say
   that the father of malice and of the perdition of those who shall be
   cast out of the kingdom of God, can be saved which no one can say, even
   if bereft of reason."

   [1156] After the apokatastasis has been completed in certain aeons, he
   speaks of palin alle arche. See the judicious remarks of Neander, I.
   656 (Am. ed.)

   [1157] Nitzsch (I. 403 sq.) includes also Gregory Nazianzen, and
   possibly Chrysostom among universalists. So does Farrar more
   confidently (249 sqq., 271 sqq.). But the passages on the other side
   are stronger, see Pusey, 209 sqq., 244 sqq., and cannot be explained
   from mere "accommodation to the popular view." It is true, however,
   that Chrysostom honored the memory of Origen, and eulogized his teacher
   Diodorus, of Tarsus, and his comments on 1 Cor. 15:28 look towards an
   apokatatasIs. Pusey speaks too disparagingly of Diodor and Theodore of
   Mopsuestia, as the fathers of Nestorianism, and unjustly asserts that
   they denied the incarnation (223-226). They and Chrysostom were the
   fathers of a sound grammatical exegesis against the allegorizing
   extravagances of the Origenistic school.

   [1158] Posey contends (125-137), that Origen was condemned by the fifth
   OEcumenical Council, 553, but Hefele conclusively proves that the
   fifteen anathematisms against Origen were passed by a local Synod of
   Constantinople in 543 under Mennas. See his Conciliengesch., second
   ed., II. 859 sqq. The same view was before advocated by Dupin, Walch,
   and Döllinger.

   [1159] At least in the Lutheran church of Germany and in the church of
   England. Bengel very cautiously intimates the apokatastasis, and the
   Pietists in Würtemberg generally hold it. Among recent divines
   Schleiermacher, the Origen of Germany, is the most distinguished
   Universalist. He started not, like Origen, from freedom, but from the
   opposite Calvinistic theory of a particular election of individuals and
   nations, which necessarily involves a particular reprobation or
   praetermission rather, but only for time, until the election shall
   reach at last the fulness of the Gentiles and the whole of Israel.
   Satan was no obstacle with him, as he denied his personal existence. A
   denomination of recent American origin, the Universalists, have a creed
   of three articles called the Winchester Confession (1803), and one
   article teaches the ultimate restoration of "the whole family of
   mankind to holiness and happiness."

   Volck, Luthardt. 2) On the anti-millennial side--(a) English and
   American: Bishop Hall, R. Baxter, David Brown (Christ's Second Advent),
   Fairbairn, Urwick, G. Bush, Mos. Stuart (on Revel.), Cowles (on Dan.
   ind Revel.), Briggs, etc. (b) German: Gerhard, Maresius, Hengstenberg,
   Keil, Kliefoth, Philippi, and many others. See the articles
   "Millennarianism" by Semisch, and "Pre-Millennarianism" by Kellog, in
   Schaff-Herzog, vols. II. and III., and the literature there given.

   The most striking point in the eschatology of the ante-Nicene age is
   the prominent chiliasm, or millennarianism, that is the belief of a
   visible reign of Christ in glory on earth with the risen saints for a
   thousand years, before the general resurrection and judgment. [1160]
   160 It was indeed not the doctrine of the church embodied in any creed
   or form of devotion, but a widely current opinion of distinguished
   teachers, such as Barnabas, Papias, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus,
   Tertullian, Methodius, and Lactantius; while Caius, Origen, Dionysius
   the Great, Eusebius (as afterwards Jerome and Augustin) opposed it.

   The Jewish chiliasm rested on a carnal misapprehension of the Messianic
   kingdom, a literal interpretation of prophetic figures, and an
   overestimate of the importance of the Jewish people and the holy city
   as the centre of that kingdom. It was developed shortly before and
   after Christ in the apocalyptic literature, as the Book of Enoch, the
   Apocalypse of Baruch, 4th Esdras, the Testaments of the Twelve
   Patriarchs, and the Sibylline Books. It was adopted by the heretical
   sect of the Ebionites, and the Gnostic Cerinthus. [1161] 161

   The Christian chiliasm is the Jewish chiliasm spiritualized and fixed
   upon the second, instead of the first, coming of Christ. It
   distinguishes, moreover, two resurrections, one before and another
   after the millennium, and makes the millennial reign of Christ only a
   prelude to his eternal reign in heaven, from which it is separated by a
   short interregnum of Satan. The millennium is expected to come not as
   the legitimate result of a historical process but as a sudden
   supernatural revelation.

   The advocates of this theory appeal to the certain promises of the
   Lord, [1162] 162 but particularly to the hieroglyphic passage of the
   Apocalypse, which teaches a millennial reign of Christ upon this earth
   after the first resurrection and before the creation of the new heavens
   and the new earth. [1163] 163

   In connection with this the general expectation prevailed that the
   return of the Lord was near, though uncertain and unascertainable as to
   its day and hour, so that believers may be always ready for it. [1164]
   164 This hope, through the whole age of persecution, was a copious
   fountain of encouragement and comfort under the pains of that martyrdom
   which sowed in blood the seed of a bountiful harvest for the church.

   Among the Apostolic Fathers Barnabas is the first and the only one who
   expressly teaches a pre-millennial reign of Christ on earth. He
   considers the Mosaic history of the creation a type of six ages of
   labor for the world, each lasting a thousand years, and of a millennium
   of rest; since with God "one day is as a thousand years." The
   millennial Sabbath on earth will be followed by an eighth and eternal
   day in a new world, of which the Lord's Day (called by Barnabas "the
   eighth day") is the type. [1165] 165

   Papias of Hierapolis, a pious but credulous contemporary of Polycarp,
   entertained quaint and extravagant notions of the happiness of the
   millennial reign, for which he appealed to apostolic tradition. He put
   into the mouth of Christ himself a highly figurative description of the
   more than tropical fertility of that period, which is preserved and
   approved by Irenaeus, but sounds very apocryphal. [1166] 166

   Justin Martyr represents the transition from the Jewish Christian to
   the Gentile Christian chiliasm. He speaks repeatedly of the second
   parousia of Christ in the clouds of heaven, surrounded by the holy
   angels. It will be preceded by the near manifestation of the man of sin
   (anthropos tes anomias) who speaks blasphemies against the most high
   God, and will rule three and a half years. He is preceded by heresies
   and false prophets. [1167] 167 Christ will then raise the patriarchs,
   prophets, and pious Jews, establish the millennium, restore Jerusalem,
   and reign there in the midst of his saints; after which the second and
   general resurrection and judgment of the world will take place. He
   regarded this expectation of the earthly perfection of Christ's kingdom
   as the key-stone of pure doctrine, but adds that many pure and devout
   Christians of his day did not share this opinion. [1168] 168 After the
   millennium the world will be annihilated, or transformed. [1169] 169 In
   his two Apologies, Justin teaches the usual view of the general
   resurrection and judgment, and makes no mention of the millennium, but
   does not exclude it. [1170] 170 The other Greek Apologists are silent
   on the subject, and cannot be quoted either for or against chiliasm.

   Irenaeus, on the strength of tradition from St. John and his disciples,
   taught that after the destruction of the Roman empire, and the brief
   raging of antichrist (lasting three and a half years or 1260 days),
   Christ will visibly appear, will bind Satan, will reign at the rebuilt
   city of Jerusalem with the little band of faithful confessors and the
   host of risen martyrs over the nations of the earth, and will celebrate
   the millennial sabbath of preparation for the eternal glory of heaven;
   then, after a temporary liberation of Satan, follows the final victory,
   the general resurrection, the judgment of the world, and the
   consummation in the new heavens and the new earth. [1171] 171

   Tertullian was an enthusiastic Chiliast, and pointed not only to the
   Apocalypse, but also to the predictions of the Montanist prophets.
   [1172] 172 But the Montanists substituted Pepuza in Phrygia for
   Jerusalem, as the centre of Christ's reign, and ran into fanatical
   excesses, which brought chiliasm into discredit, and resulted in its
   condemnation by several synods in Asia Minor. [1173] 173

   After Tertullian, and independently of Montanism, chiliasm was taught
   by Commodian towards the close of the third century, [1174] 174
   Lactantius, [1175] 175 and Victorinus of Petau, [1176] 176 at the
   beginning of the fourth. Its last distinguished advocates in the East
   were Methodius (d., a martyr, 311), the opponent of Origen, [1177] 177
   and Apollinaris of Laodicea in Syria.

   We now turn to the anti-Chiliasts. The opposition began during the
   Montanist movement in Asia Minor. Caius of Rome attacked both Chiliasm
   and Montanism, and traced the former to the hated heretic Cerinthus.
   [1178] 178 The Roman church seems never to have sympathized with
   either, and prepared itself for a comfortable settlement and normal
   development in this world. In Alexandria, Origen opposed chiliasm as a
   Jewish dream, and spiritualized the symbolical language of the
   prophets. [1179] 179 His distinguished pupil, Dionysius the Great (d.
   about 264), checked the chiliastic movement when it was revived by
   Nepos in Egypt, and wrote an elaborate work against it, which is lost.
   He denied the Apocalypse to the apostle John, and ascribed it to a
   presbyter of that name. [1180] 180 Eusebius inclined to the same view.

   But the crushing blow came from the great change in the social
   condition and prospects of the church in the Nicene age. After
   Christianity, contrary to all expectation, triumphed in the Roman
   empire, and was embraced by the Caesars themselves, the millennial
   reign, instead of being anxiously waited and prayed for, began to be
   dated either from the first appearance of Christ, or from the
   conversion of Constantine and the downfall of paganism, and to be
   regarded as realized in the glory of the dominant imperial
   state-church. Augustin, who himself had formerly entertained chiliastic
   hopes, framed the new theory which reflected the social change, and was
   generally accepted. The apocalyptic millennium he understood to be the
   present reign of Christ in the Catholic church, and the first
   resurrection, the translation of the martyrs and saints to heaven,
   where they participate in Christ's reign. [1181] 181 It was consistent
   with this theory that towards the close of the first millennium of the
   Christian era there was a wide-spread expectation in Western Europe
   that the final judgment was at hand.

   From the time of Constantine and Augustin chiliasm took its place among
   the heresies, and was rejected subsequently even by the Protestant
   reformers as a Jewish dream. [1182] 182 But it was revived from time to
   time as an article of faith and hope by pious individuals and whole
   sects, often in connection with historic pessimism, with distrust in
   mission work, as carried on by human agencies, with literal
   interpretations of prophecy, and with peculiar notions about
   Antichrist, the conversion and restoration of the Jews, their return to
   the Holy Land, and also with abortive attempts to calculate "the times
   and seasons" of the Second Advent, which "the Father hath put in his
   own power" (Acts 1:7), and did not choose to reveal to his own Son in
   the days of his flesh. In a free spiritual sense, however,
   millennarianism will always survive as the hope of a golden age of the
   church on earth, and of a great sabbath of history after its many
   centuries of labor and strife. The church militant ever longs after the
   church triumphant, and looks "for new heavens and a new earth, wherein
   dwelleth righteousness" (2 Pet. 3:13). "There remaineth a sabbath rest
   for the people of God." (Heb. 4:9).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1160] Chiliasm (from chilia ete, a thousand years, Rev. 20:2, 3) is
   the Greek, millennarianism or millennialism (from mille anni), the
   Latin term for the same theory. The adherents are called Chiliasts, or
   Millennarians, also Pre-millennarians, or Pre-millennialists (to
   indicate the belief that Christ will appear again before the
   millennium), but among them many are counted who simply believe in a
   golden age of Christianity which is yet to come. Post-millennarians or
   Anti-millennarians are those who put the Second Advent after the
   millennium.

   [1161] See Euseb. H. E. III. 27 and 28.

   [1162] Matt. 5:4; 19:28; Luke 14:12 sqq.

   [1163] Rev. 20:1-6. This is the only strictly millennarian passage in
   the whole Bible. Commentators are still divided as to the literal or
   symbolical meaning of the millennium, and as to its beginning in the
   past or in the future. But a number of other passages are drawn into
   the service of the millennarian theory, as affording indirect support,
   especially Isa. 11:4-9; Acts 3:21; Rom. 11:15. Modern Pre-millennarians
   also appeal to what they call the unfulfilled prophecies of the Old
   Testament regarding the restoration of the Jews in the holy land. But
   the ancient Chiliasts applied those prophecies to the Christian church
   as the true Israel.

   [1164] Comp. Matt. 24:33, 36; Mark 13:32; Acts 1:7; 1 Thess. 5:1, 2; 2
   Pet. 3:10; Rev. 1:3; 3:3.

   [1165] Barn. Epist. ch. 15. He seems to have drawn his views from Ps.
   90:4, 2 Pet. 3:8, but chiefly from Jewish tradition. He does not quote
   the Apocalypse. See Otto in Hilgenfeld's "Zeitschrift für
   wissenschaftliche Theologie." 1877, p. 525-529, and Funk's note in
   Patr. Apost. I. 46.

   [1166] Adv. Haer. V. 33, § 3 (ed. Stieren I. 809), quoted from the
   fourth book of The Oracles of the Lord:" " The days will come when
   vines shall grow, each having ten thousand branches, and in each branch
   ten thousand twigs, and in each true twig ten thousand shoots, and in
   every one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the
   clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will give
   five-and-twenty measures of wine. And when any one of the saints shall
   lay hold of a cluster, another shall cry out, 'I am a better cluster,
   take me; bless the Lord through me.' In like manner [He said], 'that a
   grain of wheat shall produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear
   shall have ten thousand grains, and every grain shall yield ten pounds
   of pure, fine flour; and that apples, and seeds, and grass shall
   produce in similar proportions; and that all animals, feeding on the
   productions of the earth, shall then live in peace and harmony, and be
   in perfect subjection to man."' These words were communicated to Papias
   by " the presbyters, who saw John the disciple of the Lord." and who
   remembered having beard them from John as coming from the Lord. There
   is a similar description of the Messianic times in the twenty-ninth
   chapter of the Apocalypse of Baruch, from the close of the first or
   beginning of the second century, as follows: " The earth shall yield
   its fruits, one producing ten thousand, and in one vine shall be a
   thousand bunches, and one bunch shall produce one thousand grapes, and
   one grape shall produce one thousand berries, and one berry shall yield
   a measure of wine. And those who have been hungry shall rejoice, and
   they shall again see prodigies every day. For spirits shall go forth
   from my sight to bring every morning the fragrance of spices, and at
   the end of the day clouds dropping the dew of health. And it shall come
   to pass, at that time, that the treasure of manna shall again descend
   from above, and they shall eat of it in these years." See the Latin in
   Fritzsche's ed. of the Libri Apoc. V. T., p. 666.

   [1167] Dial.c. Tryph. c. 32, 51, 110. Comp. Dan. 7:25 and 2 Thess. 2:8.

   [1168] Dial.c. 80 and 81. He appeals to the prophecies of Isaiah (65:17
   sqq.), Ezekiel, Ps. 90:4, and the Apocalypse of "a man named John, one
   of the apostles of Christ." In another passage, Dial. c. 113, Justin
   says that as Joshua led Israel into the holy land and distributed it
   among the tribes, so Christ will convert the diaspora and distribute
   the goodly land, yet not as an earthly possession, but give us (hemin)
   an eternal inheritance. He will shine in Jerusalem as the eternal
   light, for he is the King of Salem after the order of Melchisedek, and
   the eternal priest of the Most High. But be makes no mention of the
   loosing of Satan after the millennium. Comp. the discussion of Justin's
   eschatology by M. von Engelhardt, Das Christenthum Justins des Märt.
   )1878), p. 302-307, and by Donaldson, Crit. Hist. of Christ. Lit. II
   316-322.

   [1169] This point is disputed. Semisch contends for annihilation,
   Weizsäcker for transformation. von Engelhardt (p. 309) leaves the
   matter undecided. In the Dial. c. 113 Justin says that God through
   Christ will renew (kainourgein ) the heaven and the earth; in the
   Apologies, that the world will be burnt up.

   [1170] Apol. I. 50, 51, 52. For this reason Donaldson (11. 263), and
   Dr. Briggs (l.c. p. 21) suspect that the chiliastic passages in the
   Dialogue (at least ch. 81) are an interpolation, or corrupted, but
   without any warrant. The omission of Justin in Jerome's lists of
   Chiliasts can prove nothing against the testimony of all the
   manuscripts.

   [1171] Adv. Haer. V. 23-36. On the eschatology of Irenaeus see Ziegler,
   Iren.der B. v. Lyon (Berl. 1871), 298-320; and Kirchner, Die Eschatol.
   d. Iren. in the "Studien und Kritiken" for 1863, p. 315-358.

   [1172] De Res. Carn. 25; Adv. Marc. III. 24; IV. 29, etc. He discussed
   the subject in a special work, De Spe Fidelium, which is lost.

   [1173] See § 111, p. 424 sq.

   [1174] Instruct. adv. Gentium Deos, 43, 44, with the Jewish notion of
   fruitful millennial marriages.

   [1175] Instit. VII. 24; Epit. 71, 72. He quotes from the Sibylline
   books, and expects the speedy end of the world, but not while the city
   of Rome remains.

   [1176] In his Commentary on Revelation, and the fragment De Fabrica
   Mundi (part of a Com. on Genesis). Jerome classes him among the
   Chiliasts.

   [1177] In his Banquet of the Ten Virgins, I X. 5, and Discourse on
   Resurrection

   [1178] Euseb. H. E. II. 25 (against the Montanist Proclus), and III. 28
   (against chiliasm).

   [1179] De Princ. II. 11. He had, however, in view a very sensuous idea
   of the millennium with marriages and luxuriant feasts.

   [1180] Euseb. VII. 24, 25.

   [1181] De Civit. Dei, XX. 6-10.

   [1182] The Augsburg Confession, Art. XVII., condemns the Anabaptists
   and others "who now scatter Jewish opinions that, before the
   resurrection of the dead, the godly shall occupy the kingdom of the
   world, the wicked being everywhere suppressed." The 41st of the
   Anglican Articles, drawn up by Cranmer (1553), but omitted afterwards
   in the revision under Elizabeth (1563), describes the millennium as "a
   fable of Jewish dotage."

CHAPTER XIII:

   ECCLESIASTICAL LITERATURE OF THE ANTE-NICENE AGE, AND BIOGRAPHICAL
   SKETCHES OF THE CHURCH-FATHERS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 159. Literature.

   I. General Patristic Collections.

   The Benedictine editions, repeatedly published in Paris, Venice, etc.,
   are the best as far as they go, but do not satisfy the present state of
   criticism. Jesuits (Petavius, Sirmond, Harduin), and Dominicans
   (Combefis, Le Quien) have also published several fathers. These and
   more recent editions are mentioned in the respective sections. Of
   patristic collections the principal ones are:

   Maxima Bibliotheca veteru Patrum, etc. Lugd. 1677, 27 tom. fol.
   Contains the less voluminous writers, and only in the Latin
   translation.

   A. Gallandi (Andreas Gallandius, Oratorian, d. 1779): Bibliotheca
   Graeco-Latina veterum Patrum, etc. Ven. 1765-88, 14 tom. fol. Contains
   in all 380 ecclesiastical writers (180 more than the Bibl Max.) in
   Greek and Latin, with valuable dissertations and notes.

   Abbé Migne (Jacques Paul, b. 1800, founder of the Ultramontane
   L'Univers religeux and the Cath. printing establishment at Montrouge,
   consumed by fire 1868): Patrologiae cursus completus sive Bibliotheca
   universalis, integra, uniformis, commoda, oeconomica, omnium SS.
   Patrum, Doctorum, Scriptorumque ecelesiasticorum. Petit Montrouge (near
   Paris), 1844-1866 (Garnier Frères). The cheapest and most complete
   patristic library, but carelessly edited, and often inaccurate,
   reaching down to the thirteenth century, the Latin in 222, the Greek in
   167 vols., reprinted from the Bened. and other good editions, with
   Prolegomena, Vitae, Dissertations, Supplements, etc. Some of the plates
   were consumed by fire in 1868. but have been replaced. To be used with
   great caution.

   Abbé Horoy: Bibliotheca Patristica ab anno MCCXVI. usque ad Concilii
   Tridentini Tempora. Paris, 1879 sqq. A continuation of Migne. Belongs
   to mediaeval history.

   A new and critical edition of the Latin Fathers has been undertaken by
   the Imperial Academy of Vienna in 1866, under the title: Corpus
   scriptorum ecclesiasticorum Latinorum. The first volume contains the
   works of Sulpicius Severus, ed. by C. Halm, 1866; the second Minucius
   Felix and Jul. Firmicus Maternus, by the same, 1867; Cyprian by Hartel,
   1876; Arnobius by Reifferscheid; Commodianus by Dombart; Salvianus by
   Pauly; Cassianus by Petscheig; Priscillian by Schepss, etc. So far 18
   vols. from 1866 to 1889.

   A new and critical edition of the Greek fathers is still more needed.

   Handy editions of the older fathers by Oberthur, Richter, Gersdorf,
   etc.

   Special collections of patristic fragments by Grabe (Spicilegium
   Patrum), Routh (Reliquiae Sacrae), Angelo Mai (Scriptorum vet. nova
   Collectio, Rom. 1825-'38, 10 t.; Spicilegium roman. 1839-'44, 10 t.;
   Nova Patrum Bibliotheca, 1852 sqq. 7 t.); Card. Pitra (Spicilegium
   Solesmense, 1852 sqq. 5 t.), Liverani (Spiciles Liberianum, 1865), and
   others.

   II. Separate Collections of the ante-Nicene Fathers.

   Patres Apostolici, best critical editions, one Protestant by Oscar Von
   Gebhardt, Harnack, and Zahn (ed. II. Lips. 1876-'78, in 3 parts);
   another by Hilgenfeld (ed. II. Lips. 1876 sqq. in several parts); one
   by Bp. Lightfoot (Lond. 1869 sqq.); and one, R. Catholic, by Bp.
   Hefele, fifth ed. by Prof Funk, Tübingen (1878 and '81, 2 vols.). See §
   161.

   Corpus Apologetarum Christianorum Seculi II., Ed. Otto. Jenae,
   1847-'50; Ed. III. 1876 sqq. A new critical ed. by O. v. Gebhardt and
   E. Schwartz. Lips. 1888 sqq.

   III. Biographical, critical, doctrinal. Patristics and Patrology.

   St. Jerome (d. 419): De Viris illustrious. Comprises, in 135 numbers,
   brief notices of the biblical and ecclesiastical authors, down to a.d.
   393. Continuations by Gennadius (490), Isidor (636), Ildefons (667),
   and others.

   1824, 2 t. fol., and in Migne, Phot. Opera, t. III. and IV. Extracts of
   280 Greek authors, heathen and Christian, whose works are partly lost.
   See a full account in Hergenröther's, Photius, III. 13-31.

   than Dupin; extends to the middle of the thirteenth century.

   Will. Cave (Anglican, d. 1713): Scriptorum ecelesiasticorum Historia a
   Christo nato usque ad saecul. XIV. Lond. 1688-98, 2 vols.; Geneva,
   1720; Colon. 1722; best edition superintended by Waterland, Oxf.
   1740-43, reprinted at Basle 1741-'45. This work is arranged in the
   centurial style (saeculum Apostolicum, s. Gnosticuni, s. Novatianum, s.
   Arianum, s. Nestorianum, s. Eutychianum, s. Monotheleticum, etc.) W.

   § 160. A General Estimate of the Fathers.

   As Christianity is primarily a religion of divine facts, and a new
   moral creation, the literary and scientific element in its history
   held, at first, a secondary and subordinate place. Of the apostles,
   Paul alone received a learned education, and even he made his
   rabbinical culture and great natural talents subservient to the higher
   spiritual knowledge imparted to him by revelation. But for the very
   reason that it is a new life, Christianity must produce also a new
   science and literature; partly from the inherent impulse of faith
   towards deeper and clearer knowledge of its object for its own
   satisfaction; partly from the demands of self-preservation against
   assaults from without; partly from the practical want of instruction
   and direction for the people. The church also gradually appropriated
   the classical culture, and made it tributary to her theology.
   Throughout the middle ages she was almost the sole vehicle and guardian
   of literature and art, and she is the mother of the best elements of
   the modern European and American civilization. We have already treated
   of the mighty intellectual labor of our period on the field of
   apologetic, polemic, and dogmatic theology. In this section we have to
   do with patrology, or the biographical and bibliographical matter of
   the ancient theology and literature.

   The ecclesiastical learning of the first six centuries was cast almost
   entirely in the mould of the Graeco-Roman culture. The earliest church
   fathers, even Clement of Rome, Hermas, and Hippolytus, who lived and
   labored in and about Rome, used the Greek language, after the example
   of the apostles, with such modifications as the Christian ideas
   required. Not till the end of the second century, and then not in
   Italy, but in North Africa, did the Latin language also become, through
   Tertullian, a medium of Christian science and literature. The Latin
   church, however, continued for a long time dependent on the learning of
   the Greek. The Greek church was more excitable, speculative, and
   dialectic; the Latin more steady, practical, and devoted to outward
   organization; though we have on both sides striking exceptions to this
   rule, in the Greek Chrysostom, who was the greatest pulpit orator, and
   the Latin Augustin, who was the profoundest speculative theologian
   among the fathers.

   The patristic literature in general falls considerably below the
   classical in elegance of form, but far surpasses it in the sterling
   quality of its matter. It wears the servant form of its master, during
   the days of his flesh, not the splendid, princely garb of this world.
   Confidence in the power of the Christian truth made men less careful of
   the form in which they presented it. Besides, many of the oldest
   Christian writers lacked early education, and had a certain aversion to
   art, from its manifold perversion in those days to the service of
   idolatry and immorality. But some of them, even in the second and third
   centuries, particularly Clement and Origen, stood at the head of their
   age in learning and philosophical culture; and in the fourth and fifth
   centuries, the literary productions of an Athanasius, a Gregory, a
   Chrysostom, an Augustin, and a Jerome, excelled the contemporaneous
   heathen literature in every respect. Many fathers, like the two
   Clements, Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Tertullian, Cyprian,
   and among the later ones, even Jerome and Augustin, embraced
   Christianity after attaining adult years; and it is interesting to
   notice with what enthusiasm, energy, and thankfulness they laid hold
   upon it.

   The term "church-father" originated in the primitive custom of
   transferring the idea of father to spiritual relationships, especially
   to those of teacher, priest, and bishop. In the case before us the idea
   necessarily includes that of antiquity, involving a certain degree of
   general authority for all subsequent periods and single branches of the
   church. Hence this title of honor is justly limited to the more
   distinguished teachers of the first five or six centuries, excepting,
   of course, the apostles, who stand far above them all as the inspired
   organs of Christ. It applies, therefore, to the period of the
   oecumenical formation of doctrines, before the separation of Eastern
   and Western Christendom. The line of the Latin fathers is generally
   closed with Pope Gregory I. (d. 604), the line of the Greek with John
   of Damascus (d. about 754).

   Besides antiquity, or direct connection with the formative age of the
   whole church, learning, holiness, orthodoxy, and the approbation of the
   church, or general recognition, are the qualifications for a church
   father. These qualifications, however, are only relative. At least we
   cannot apply the scale of fully developed orthodoxy, whether Greek,
   Roman, or Evangelical, to the ante-Nicene fathers. Their dogmatic
   conceptions were often very indefinite and uncertain. In fact the Roman
   church excludes a Tertullian for his Montanism, an Origen for his
   Platonic and idealistic views, an Eusebius for his semi-Arianism, also
   Clement of Alexandria, Lactantius, Theodoret, and other distinguished
   divines, from the list of "fathers" (Patres), and designates them
   merely "ecclesiastical writers" (Scriptores Ecclastici).

   In strictness, not a single one of the ante-Nicene fathers fairly
   agrees with the Roman standard of doctrine in all points. Even Irenaeus
   and Cyprian differed from the Roman bishop, the former in reference to
   Chiliasm and Montanism, the latter on the validity of heretical
   baptism. Jerome is a strong witness against the canonical value of the
   Apocrypha. Augustin, the greatest authority of Catholic theology among
   the fathers, is yet decidedly evangelical in his views on sin and
   grace, which were enthusiastically revived by Luther and Calvin, and
   virtually condemned by the Council of Trent. Pope Gregory the Great
   repudiated the title "ecumenical bishop" as an antichristian
   assumption, and yet it is comparatively harmless as compared with the
   official titles of his successors, who claim to be the Vicars of
   Christ, the viceregents of God Almighty on earth, and the infallible
   organs of the Holy Ghost in all matters of faith and discipline. None
   of the ancient fathers and doctors knew anything of the modern Roman
   dogmas of the immaculate conception (1854) and papal infallibility
   (1870). The "unanimous consent of the fathers" is a mere illusion,
   except on the most fundamental articles of general Christianity. We
   must resort here to a liberal conception of orthodoxy, and duly
   consider the necessary stages of progress in the development of
   Christian doctrine in the, church.

   On the other hand the theology of the fathers still less accords with
   the Protestant standard of orthodoxy. We seek in vain among them for
   the evangelical doctrines of the exclusive authority of the Scriptures,
   justification by faith alone, the universal priesthood of the laity;
   and we find instead as early as the second century a high estimate of
   ecclesiastical traditions, meritorious and even over-meritorious works,
   and strong sacerdotal, sacramentarian, ritualistic, and ascetic
   tendencies, which gradually matured in the Greek and Roman types of
   catholicity. The Church of England always had more sympathy with the
   fathers than the Lutheran and Calvinistic Churches, and professes to be
   in full harmony with the creed, the episcopal polity, and liturgical
   worship of antiquity before the separation of the east and the west;
   but the difference is only one of degree; the Thirty-Nine Articles are
   as thoroughly evangelical as the Augsburg Confession or the Westminster
   standards; and even the modern Anglo-Catholic school, the most churchly
   and churchy of all, ignores many tenets and usages which were
   considered of vital importance in the first centuries, and holds others
   which were unknown before the sixteenth century. The reformers were as
   great and good men as the fathers, but both must bow before the
   apostles. There is a steady progress of Christianity, an ever-deepening
   understanding and an ever-widening application of its principles and
   powers, and there are yet many hidden treasures in the Bible which will
   be brought to light in future ages.

   In general the excellences of the church fathers are very various.
   Polycarp is distinguished, not for genius or learning, but for
   patriarchal simplicity and dignity; Clement of Rome, for the gift of
   administration; Ignatius, for impetuous devotion to episcopacy, church
   unity, and Christian martyrdom; Justin, for apologetic zeal and
   extensive reading; Irenaeus, for sound doctrine and moderation; Clement
   of Alexandria, for stimulating fertility of thought; Origen, for
   brilliant learning and bold speculation; Tertullian, for freshness and
   vigor of intellect, and sturdiness of character; Cyprian, for energetic
   churchliness; Eusebius, for literary industry in compilation;
   Lactantius, for elegance of style. Each had also his weakness. Not one
   compares for a moment in depth and spiritual fulness with a St. Paul or
   St. John; and the whole patristic literature, with all its incalculable
   value, must ever remain very far below the New Testament. The single
   epistle to the Romans or the Gospel of John is worth more than all
   commentaries, doctrinal, polemic, and ascetic treatises of the Greek
   and Latin fathers, schoolmen, and reformers.

   The ante-Nicene fathers may be divided into five or six classes:

   (1.) The apostolic fathers, or personal disciples of the apostles. Of
   these, Polycarp, Clement, and Ignatius are the most eminent.

   (2.) The apologists for Christianity against Judaism and heathenism:
   Justin Martyr and his successors to the end of the second century.

   (3.) The controversialists against heresies within the church:
   Irenaeus, and Hippolytus, at the close of the second century and
   beginning of the third.

   (4.) The Alexandrian school of philosophical theology: Clement and
   Origen, in the first half of the third century.

   (5.) The contemporary but more practical North African school of
   Tertullian and Cyprian.

   (6.) Then there were also the germs of the Antiochian school, and some
   less prominent writers, who can be assigned to no particular class.

   Together with the genuine writings of the church fathers there appeared
   in the first centuries, in behalf both of heresy and of orthodoxy, a
   multitude of apocryphal Gospels, Acts, and Apocalypses, under the names
   of apostles and of later celebrities; also Jewish and heathen
   prophecies of Christianity, such as the Testaments of the Twelve
   Patriarchs, the Books of Hydaspes, Of Hermas Trismegistos, and of the
   Sibyls. The frequent use made of such fabrications of an idle
   imagination even by eminent church teachers, particularly by the
   apologists, evinces not only great credulity and total want of literary
   criticism, but also a very imperfect development of the sense of truth,
   which had not yet learned utterly to discard the pia fraus as immoral
   falsehood.

   Notes.

   The Roman church extends the line of the Patres, among whom she further
   distinguishes a small number of Doctores ecclesiae emphatically
   so-called, down late into the middle ages, and reckons in it Anselm,
   Bernard of Clairvaux, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura, and the divines of
   the Council of Trent, resting on her claim to exclusive catholicity,
   which is recognized neither by the Greek nor the Evangelical church.
   The marks of a Doctor Ecclesiae are: 1) eminens eruditio; 2) doctrina
   orthodoxa; 3) sanctitas vitae; 4) expressa ecclesiae declaratio. The
   Roman Church recognizes as Doctores Ecclesiae the following Greek
   fathers: Athanasius, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzen, Chrysostom,
   Cyril of Alexandria, and John of Damascus, and the following Latin
   fathers: Ambrose, Jerome, Augustin, Hilarius of Poitiers, Leo I. and
   Gregory I., together with the mediaeval divines Anselm, Thomas Aquinas,
   Bonaventura and Bernard of Clairvaux. The distinction between doctores
   ecclesiae and patres eccelesiae was formally recognized by Pope
   Boniface VIII. in a decree of 1298, in which Ambrose, Augustin, Jerome,
   and Gregory the Great are designated as magni doctores ecclesiae, who
   deserve a higher degree of veneration. Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura, and
   St. Bernard were added to the list by papal decree in 1830, Hilary in
   1852, Alfonso Maria da Liguori in 1871. Anselm of Canterbury and a few
   others are called doctores in the liturgical service, without special
   decree. The long line of popes has only furnished two fathers, Leo I.
   and Gregory I. The Council of Trent first speaks of the "unanimis
   consensus patrum," which is used in the same sense as "doctrina
   ecclesia."

   The "apostolic," or rather post-apostolic "fathers" [1183] 183 were the
   first church teachers after the apostles, who had enjoyed in part
   personal intercourse with them, and thus form the connecting link
   between them and the apologists of the second century. This class
   consists of Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp, and, in a
   broader sense, Hermas, Papias, and the unknown authors of the Epistle
   to Diognetus, and of the Didache.

   Of the outward life of these men, their extraction, education, and
   occupation before conversion, hardly anything is known. The distressed
   condition of that age was very unfavorable to authorship; and more than
   this, the spirit of the primitive church regarded the new life in
   Christ as the only true life, the only one worthy of being recorded.
   Even of the lives of the apostles themselves before their call we have
   only a few hints. But the pious story of the martyrdom of several of
   these fathers, as their entrance into perfect life, has been copiously
   written. They were good men rather than great men, and excelled more in
   zeal and devotion to Christ than in literary attainments. They were
   faithful practical workers, and hence of more use to the church in
   those days than profound thinkers or great scholars could have been.
   "While the works of Tacitus, Sueton, Juvenal, Martial, and other
   contemporary heathen authors are filled with the sickening details of
   human folly, vice, and crime, these humble Christian pastors are ever
   burning with the love of God and men, exhort to a life of purity and
   holiness in imitation of the example of Christ, and find abundant
   strength and comfort amid trial and persecution in their faith, and the
   hope of a glorious immortality in heaven." [1184] 184

   The extant works of the apostolic fathers are of small compass, a
   handful of letters on holy living and dying, making in all a volume of
   about twice the size of the New Testament. Half of these (several
   Epistles of Ignatius, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the Pastor of
   Hermas) are of doubtful genuineness; but they belong at all events to
   that, obscure and mysterious transition period between the end of the
   first century and the middle of the second. They all originated, not in
   scientific study, but in practical religious feeling, and contain not
   analyses of doctrine so much as simple direct assertions of faith and
   exhortations to holy life; all, excepting Hermas and the Didache, in
   the form of epistles after the model of Paul's. [1185] 185 Yet they
   show the germs of the apologetic, polemic, dogmatic, and ethic
   theology, as well as the outlines of the organization and the cultus of
   the ancient Catholic church. Critical research has to assign to them
   their due place in the external and internal development of the church;
   in doing this it needs very great caution to avoid arbitrary
   construction.

   If we compare these documents with the canonical Scriptures of the New
   Testament, it is evident at once that they fall far below in original
   force, depth, and fulness of spirit, and afford in this a strong
   indirect proof of the inspiration of the apostles. Yet they still shine
   with the evening red of the apostolic day, and breathe an enthusiasm of
   simple faith and fervent love and fidelity to the Lord, which proved
   its power in suffering and martyrdom. They move in the element of
   living tradition, and make reference oftener to the oral preaching of
   the apostles than to their writings; for these were not yet so
   generally circulated but they bear a testimony none the less valuable
   to the genuineness of the apostolic writings, by occasional citations
   or allusions, and by the coincidence of their reminiscences with the
   facts of the gospel history and the fundamental doctrines of the New
   Testament. The epistles of Barnabas, Clement, and Polycarp, and the
   Shepherd of Hernias, were in many churches read in public worship.
   [1186] 186 Some were even incorporated in important manuscripts of the
   Bible. [1187] 187 This shows that the sense of the church, as to the
   extent of the canon, had not yet become everywhere clear. Their
   authority, however, was always but sectional and subordinate to that of
   the Gospels and the apostolic Epistles. It was a sound instinct of the
   church, that the writings of the disciples of the apostles, excepting
   those of Mark and Luke, who were peculiarly associated with Peter and
   Paul, were kept out of the canon of the New Testament. For by the wise
   ordering of the Ruler of history, there is an impassable gulf between
   the inspiration of the apostles and the illumination of the succeeding
   age, between the standard authority of holy Scripture and the derived
   validity of the teaching of the church. "The Bible"--to adopt an
   illustration of a distinguished writer [1188] 188 --"is not like a city
   of modern Europe, which subsides through suburban gardens and groves
   and mansions into the open country around, but like an Eastern city in
   the desert, from which the traveler passes by a single step into a
   barren waste." The very poverty of these post-apostolic writings
   renders homage to the inexhaustible richness of the apostolic books
   which, like the person of Christ, are divine as well as human in their
   origin, character, and effect. [1189] 189
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1183] The usual name is probably derived from Tertullian, who calls
   the followers of the apostles, Apostolici,) De Carne, 2; Proescr, Haer.
   30). Westcott calls them sub-apostolic, Donaldson, ep-apostolic.

   [1184] "The most striking feature of these writings," says Donaldson
   (p. 105),"is the deep living piety which pervades them. It consists in
   the warmest love to God, the deepest interest in man, and it exhibits
   itself in a healthy, vigorous, manly morality."

   [1185] Like the N. T. Epistles, the writings of the Apostolic fathers
   generally open with an inscription and Christian salutation, and
   conclude with a benediction and doxology. The Ep. of Clement to the
   Corinthians beginning thus (ch. 1.): "The church of God, which
   sojournes in Rome to the church of God which sojournes in Corinth, to
   them that are called and sanctified by the will of God, through our
   Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace from Almighty God, through Jesus
   Christ, be multiplied unto You." (Comp. 1 Cor. 1:2, 3; 2 Pet. 1:2.) It
   concludes (ch. 65, formerly ch. 59): "The grace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ be with you, and with all men everywhere who are called of God
   through Him, through whom be glory, honor, power, majesty, and eternal
   dominion unto Him from the ages past to the ages of ages. Amen."--The
   Ep. of Polycarp begins: " Polycarp, and the presbyters that are with
   him, to the church of God sojourning in Philippi: Mercy unto you and
   peace from God Almighty and from the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour, be
   multiplied;" and it concludes."Grace be with you all. Amen." The Ep. of
   Barnabas opens and closes in a very general way, omitting the names of
   the writer and readers. The inscriptions and salutations of the
   Ignatian Epistles are longer and overloaded, even in the Syriac
   recension.

   [1186] Comp. Euseb. H. E. III. 16; IV. 23, as regards the epistle of
   Clement, which continued to be read in the church of Corinth down to
   the time of Dionysius, a.d. 160, and even to the time of Eusebius and
   Jerome, in the fourth century. The Pastor Hermae is quoted by Irenaeus
   IV. 3, as "scriptura." and is treated by Clement of Alex. and Origen
   (Ad Rom. Comment. X. c. 31) as " scriptura valde utilis et divinitus
   inspirata."

   [1187] The Codex Alexandrinus (A) of the fifth century contains, after
   the Apocalypse, the Epistle of Clemens Romanus to the Corinthians, with
   a fragment of a homily; and the Codex Sinaiticus of the fourth century
   gives, at the close, the Epistle of Barnabas complete in Greek, and
   also a part of the Greek Pastor Hermae.

   [1188] Ascribed to Archbishop Whately.

   [1189] Baur, Schwegler, and the other Tübingen critics show great want
   of spiritual discernment in assigning so many N. T. writings, even the
   Gospel of John to the borrowed moonlight of the post-apostolic age.
   They form the opposite extreme to the Roman overestimate of patristic
   teaching as being of equal authority with the Bible.

   The first rank among the works of the post-Apostolic age belongs to the
   "Teaching of the Apostles," discovered in 1883. [1190] 190 Next follow
   the letters of Clement, Ignatius, and Polycarp.

   I. Clement, a name of great celebrity in antiquity, was a disciple of
   Paul and Peter, to whom he refers as the chief examples for imitation.
   He may have been the same person who is mentioned by Paul as one of his
   faithful fellow-workers in Philippi (Phil. 4:3); or probably a Roman
   who was in some way connected with the distinguished Flavian family,
   and through it with the imperial household, where Christianity found an
   early lodgment. [1191] 191 His Epistle betrays a man of classical
   culture, executive wisdom, and thorough familiarity with the Septuagint
   Bible. The last seems to indicate that he was of Jewish parentage.
   [1192] 192 What we know with certainty is only this, that he stood at
   the head of the Roman congregation at the close of the first century.
   Yet tradition is divided against itself as to the time of his
   administration; now making him the first successor of Peter, now, with
   more probability, the third. According to Eusebius he was bishop from
   the twelfth year of Domitian to the third of Trajan (A. D. 92 to 101).
   Considering that the official distinction between bishops and
   presbyters was not yet clearly defined in his time, he may have been
   co-presbyter with Linus and Anacletus, who are represented by some as
   his predecessors, by others as his successors. [1193] 193

   Later legends have decked out his life in romance, both in the interest
   of the Catholic church and in that of heresy. They picture him as a
   noble and highly educated Roman who, dissatisfied with the, wisdom and
   art of heathenism, journeyed to Palestine, became acquainted there with
   the apostle Peter, and was converted by him; accompanied him on his
   missionary tours; composed many books in his name; was appointed by him
   his successor as bishop of Rome, with a sort of supervision over the
   whole church; and at last, being banished under Trajan to the Taurian
   Chersonesus, died the glorious death of a martyr in the waves of the
   sea. But the oldest witnesses, down to Eusebius and Jerome, know
   nothing of his martyrdom. The Acta Martyrii Clementis (by Simon
   Metaphrastes) make their appearance first in the ninth century. They
   are purely fictitious, and ascribe incredible miracles to their hero.

   It is very remarkable that a person of such vast influence in truth and
   fiction, whose words were law, who preached the duty of obedience and
   submission to an independent and distracted church, whose vision
   reached even to unknown lands beyond the Western sea, should
   inaugurate, at the threshold of the second century, that long line of
   pontiffs who have outlasted every dynasty in Europe, and now claim an
   infallible authority over the consciences of two hundred millions of
   Christians. [1194] 194

   II. From this Clement we have a Greek epistle to the Corinthians. It is
   often cited by the church fathers, then disappeared, but was found
   again, together with the fragments of the second epistle, in the
   Alexandrian codex of the Bible (now in the British Museum), and
   published by Patricius Junius (Patrick Young) at Oxford in 1633. [1195]
   195 A second, less ancient, but more perfect manuscript from the
   eleventh century, containing the missing chapters of the first (with
   the oldest written prayer) and the whole of the second Epistle
   (together with other valuable documents), was discovered by Philotheos
   Bryennios, [1196] 196 in the convent library of the patriarch of
   Jerusalem in Constantinople, and published in 1875. [1197] 197 Soon
   afterwards a Syriac translation was found in the library of Jules Mohl,
   of Paris (d. 1876). [1198] 198 We have thus three independent texts (A,
   C, S), derived, it would seem, from a common parent of the second
   century. The newly discovered portions shed new light on the history of
   papal authority and liturgical worship, as we have pointed out in
   previous chapters. [1199] 199

   This first (and in fact the only) Epistle to the Corinthians was sent
   by the Church of God in Rome, at its own impulse, and unasked, to the
   Church of God in Corinth, through three aged and faithful Christians:
   Claudius Ephebus, Valerius Biton, and Fortunatus. [1200] 200 It does
   not bear the name of Clement, and is written in the name of the Roman
   congregation, but was universally regarded as his production. [1201]
   201 It stood in the highest esteem in ancient times, and continued in
   public use in the Corinthian church and in several other churches down
   to the beginning of the fourth century. [1202] 202 This accounts for
   its incorporation in the Alexandrian Bible Codex, but it is properly
   put after the Apocalypse and separated from the apostolic epistles.

   And this indicates its value. It is not apostolical, not inspired--far
   from it--but the oldest and best among the sub-apostolic writings both
   in form and contents. It was occasioned by party differences and
   quarrels in the church of Corinth, where the sectarian spirit, so
   earnestly rebuked by Paul in his first Epistle, had broken out afresh
   and succeeded in deposing the regular officers (the presbyter-bishops).
   The writer exhorts the readers to harmony and love, humility, and
   holiness, after the pattern of Christ and his apostles, especially
   Peter and Paul, who had but recently sealed their testimony with their
   blood. He speaks in the highest terms of Paul who, "after instructing
   the whole [Roman] world in righteousness, and after having reached the
   end of the West, and borne witness before the rulers, departed into the
   holy place, leaving the greatest example of patient endurance." [1203]
   203 He evinces the calm dignity and executive wisdom of the Roman
   church in her original simplicity, without hierarchical arrogance; and
   it is remarkable how soon that church recovered after the terrible
   ordeal of the Neronian persecution, which must have been almost an
   annihilation. He appeals to the word of God as the final authority, but
   quotes as freely from the Apocrypha as from the canonical Scriptures
   (the Septuagint). He abounds in free reminiscences of the teaching of
   Christ and the Apostles. [1204] 204 He refers to Paul's (First) Epistle
   to the Corinthians, and shows great familiarity with his letters, with
   James, First Peter, and especially the Epistle to the Hebrews, from
   which he borrows several expressions. Hence he is mentioned--with Paul,
   Barnabas, and Luke--as one of the supposed authors of that anonymous
   epistle. Origen conjectured that Clement or Luke composed the Hebrews
   under the inspiration or dictation of Paul.

   Clement bears clear testimony to the doctrines of the Trinity ("God,
   the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, who are the faith and the
   hope of the elect"), of the Divine dignity and glory of Christ,
   salvation only by his blood, the necessity of repentance and living
   faith, justification by grace, sanctification by the Holy Spirit, the
   unity of the church, and the Christian graces of humility, charity,
   forbearance, patience, and perseverance. In striking contrast with the
   bloody cruelties practiced by Domitian, he exhorts to prayer for the
   civil rulers, that God "may give them health, peace, concord, and
   stability for the administration of the government be has given them."
   [1205] 205 We have here the echo of Paul's exhortation to the Romans
   (Rom. 13) under the tyrant Nero. Altogether the Epistle of Clement is
   worthy of a disciple of the apostles, although falling far short of
   their writings in original simplicity, terseness, and force.

   III. In regard to its theology, this epistle belongs plainly to the
   school of Paul and strongly resembles the Epistle to the Hebrews, while
   at the same time it betrays the influence of Peter also; both these
   apostles having, in fact, personally labored in the church of Rome, in
   whose name the letter is written, and having left the stamp of their
   mind upon it. There is no trace in it of an antagonism between
   Paulinism and Petrinism. [1206] 206 Clement is the only one of the
   apostolic fathers, except perhaps Polycarp, who shows some conception
   of the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith. "All (the saints of
   the Old Testament)," says he, [1207] 207 "became great and glorious,
   not through themselves, nor by their works, nor by their righteousness,
   but by the will of God. Thus we also, who are called by the will of God
   in Christ Jesus, are righteous not of ourselves, neither through our
   wisdom, nor through our understanding, nor through our piety, nor
   through our works, which we have wrought in purity of heart, but by
   faith, by which the almighty God justified all these from the
   beginning; to whom be glory to all eternity." And then Clement,
   precisely like Paul in Romans 6, derives sanctification from
   justification, and continues: "What, then, should we do, beloved
   brethren? Should we be slothful in good works and neglect love? By no
   means! But with zeal and courage we will hasten to fulfil every good
   work. For the Creator and Lord of all things himself rejoices in his
   works." Among the good works he especially extols love, and describes
   it in a strain which reminds one of Paul's 1 Corinthians 13: "He who
   has love in Christ obeys the commands of Christ. Who can declare the
   bond of the love of God, and tell the greatness of its beauty? The
   height to which it leads is unspeakable. Love unites us with God;
   covers a multitude of sins; beareth all things, endureth all things.
   There is nothing mean in love, nothing haughty. It knows no division;
   it is not refractory; it does everything in harmony. In love have all
   the elect of God become perfect. Without love nothing is pleasing to
   God. In love has the Lord received us; for the love which he cherished
   towards us, Jesus Christ our Lord gave his blood for us according to
   the will of God, and his flesh for our flesh, and his soul for our
   soul." [1208] 208 Hence all his zeal for the unity of the church.
   "Wherefore are dispute, anger, discord, division, and war among you? Or
   have we not one God and one Christ and one Spirit, who is poured out
   upon us, and one calling in Christ? Wherefore do we tear and sunder the
   members of Christ, and bring the body into tumult against itself, and
   go so far in delusion, that we forget that we are members one of
   another?" [1209] 209

   Very beautifully also he draws from the harmony of the universe an
   incitement to concord, and incidentally expresses here the remarkable
   sentiment, perhaps suggested by the old legends of the Atlantis, the
   orbis alter, the ultima Thule, etc., that there are other worlds beyond
   the impenetrable ocean, which are ruled by the same laws of the Lord.
   [1210] 210

   But notwithstanding its prevailing Pauline character, this epistle
   lowers somewhat the free evangelical tone of the Gentile apostle's
   theology, softens its anti-Judaistic sternness, and blends it with the
   Jewish-Christian counterpart of St. James, showing that the conflict
   between the Pauline and Petrine views was substantially settled at the
   end of the first century in the Roman church, and also in that of
   Corinth.

   Clement knows nothing of an episcopate above the presbyterate; and his
   epistle itself is written, not in his own name, but in that of the
   church at Rome. But he represents the Levitical priesthood as a type of
   the Christian teaching office, and insists with the greatest decision
   on outward unity, fixed order, and obedience to church rulers. He
   speaks in a tone of authority to a sister church of apostolic
   foundation, and thus reveals the easy and as yet innocent beginning of
   the papacy. [1211] 211 A hundred years after his death his successors
   ventured, in their own name, not only to exhort, but to excommunicate
   whole churches for trifling differences.

   The interval between Clement and Paul, and the transition from the
   apostolic to the apocryphal, from faith to superstition, appears in the
   indiscriminate use of the Jewish Apocrypha, and in the difference
   between Paul's treatment of scepticism in regard to the resurrection,
   and his disciple's treatment of the same subject. [1212] 212 Clement
   points not only to the types in nature, the changes of the seasons and
   of day and night, but also in full earnest to the heathen myth of the
   miraculous bird, the phoenix in Arabia, which regenerates itself every
   five hundred years. When the phoenix--so runs the fable--approaches
   death, it makes itself a nest of frankincense, myrrh, and other spices;
   from its decaying flesh a winged worm arises, which, when it becomes
   strong, carries the reproductive nest from Arabia to Heliopolis in
   Egypt, and there flying down by day, in the sight of all, it lays it,
   with the bones of its predecessors, upon the altar of the sun. And this
   takes place, according to the reckoning of the priests, every five
   hundred years. After Clement other fathers also used the phoenix as a
   symbol of the resurrection. [1213] 213

   IV. As to the time of its composition, this epistle falls certainly
   after the death of Peter and Paul, for it celebrates their martyrdom;
   and probably after the death of John (about 98); for one would suppose,
   that if he had been living, Clement would have alluded to him, in
   deference to superior authority, and that the Corinthian Christians
   would have applied to an apostle for counsel, rather than to a disciple
   of the apostles in distant Rome. The persecution alluded to in the
   beginning of the epistle refers to the Domitian as well as the
   Neronian; for he speaks of "sudden and repeated calamities and reverses
   which have befallen us." [1214] 214 He prudently abstains from naming
   the imperial persecutors, and intercedes at the close for the civil
   rulers. Moreover, he calls the church at Corinth at that time "firmly
   established and ancient." [1215] 215 With this date the report of
   Eusebius agrees, that Clement did not take the bishop's chair in Rome
   till 92 or 93. [1216] 216
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1190] See above p. 184 sq., and my monograph, third revised edition,
   1889.

   [1191] There are six different conjectures. 1) Clement was the
   Philippian Clement mentioned by Paul. So Origen, Eusebius, Jerome. He
   may have been a Greek or a Roman laboring for a time in Philippi and
   afterwards in Rome. 2) A distant relative of the emperor Tiberius. So
   the pseudoClementine romances which are historically confused and
   worthless. 3) The Consul Flavius Clemens, Domitian's cousin, who was
   put to death by him for "atheism" i.e. the Christian faith, a.d. 95,
   while his wife Domitilla (who founded the oldest Christian cemetery in
   Rome) was banished to an island. So Hilgenfeld, and, less confidently,
   Harnack. But our Clement died a natural death, and if he had been so
   closely related to the emperor, the fact would have been widely, spread
   in the church. 4) A nephew of Flavius Clemens. So the martyr acts of
   Nereus and Achilles, and Cav. de Rossi. 5) A son of Flavius Clemens. So
   Ewald. But the sons of the Consul, whom Domitian appointed his
   successors on the throne, were mere boys when Clement was bishop of
   Rome. 6) A Jewish freedman or son of a freedman belonging to the
   household of Flavius Clemens. Plausibly advocated by Lightfoot (p.
   265). The imperial household seems to have been the centre of the Roman
   church from the time of Paul's imprisonment (Phil. 4:22). Slaves and
   freedmen were often very intelligent and cultivated. Hermas )Vis. I. 1)
   and Pope Callistus )Philos. IX. 12) were formerly slaves. Funk
   concludes: res non liquet. So also Uhlhorn in Herzog.

   [1192] Renan (p. 313) thinks that he was a Roman Jew. So also
   Lightfoot. But Justin Martyr had the same familiarity with the Old
   Testament, though he was a Gentile by birth and education.

   [1193] § 52, p. 166. Bryennios discusses this question at length in his
   Prolegomena, and comes to the conclusion that Clement was the third
   bishop of Rome, and the author of both Epistles to the Corinthians. He
   identifies him with the Clement in Phil. 4:3.

   [1194] "Clément Romain." says the sceptical Renan, once a student of
   Roman Catholic theology in St. Sulpice."ne fut pas seulement un
   personnage réel, ce fut un personnage de premier ordre, un vrai chef
   d'Église, un évêque, avant que l'épiscopat fût nettement constitué j'
   oserais presque dire un pape, si ce mot ne faisait ici un trop fort
   anachronisme. Son autorité passa pour la plus grande de toutes en
   Italie, en Grèce, en Macédonie, durant les dix dernières années du
   Iersiècle. A la limite de l' âge apostolique, il fut comme unapôtre, un
   épigone de la grande génération des disciples de Jésus, une des
   colonnes de cette Eglise de Rome, qui, depuis la destruction de
   Jérusalem, devenait de plus en plus le centre du christianisme."

   [1195] The Alexandrian Bible codex dates from the fifth century, and
   was presented by Cyril Lucar, of Constantinople, to King Charles 1. in
   1628. Since 1633 the Ep. of Cl. has been edited about thirty times from
   this single MS. It lacks the concluding chapters (57-66) in whole or in
   part, and is greatly blurred and defaced. It was carefully reexamined
   and best edited by Tischendorf (1867 and 1873), Lightfoot (1869 and
   1877), Laurent (1870), and Gebhardt (in his first ed. 1875). Their
   conjectures have been sustained in great part by the discovery of the
   Constantinopolitan MS. See the critical Addenda in the Append. of
   Lightfoot, p. 396 sqq.

   [1196] At that time metropolitan of Serrae (metropolites Serron)-an
   ancient see Heraclea), in Macedonia--afterwards of Nicomedia. This
   Eastern prelate was most cordially welcomed by the scholars of the
   West, Catholic and Protestant, to an honored place in the republic of
   Christian learning. His discovery is of inestimable value. In his
   prolegomena and notes--all in Greek--he shows considerable knowledge of
   the previous editions of Clement (except that of Lightfoot, 1869) and
   of modern German literature. It is amusing to find familiar names
   turned into Greek, as Neander (ho Neandros), Gieseler (ho Giselerios),
   Hefele (ho Hephelos), Dressel (ho Dresselios), Hilgenfeld (ho
   Hilgempheldos), Jacobson (ho Iakobsonios), Tischendorf (Konstan'tinos
   ho Tisendorphios), Thiersch (ho theirsios), Schroeckh (ho Sroikchios),
   Schwegler, (ho Souegleros), Schliemann (ho Slimannos), Reithmayr (ho
   Reithmauros), Uhlhorn (ho Oulchornios en te Real Encykl. von Herzog en
   lex. Clemens von ROM tom. B '. sel 721; p. xz '), etc. He complains,
   however, of " the higher" or " lofty criticism" (hupsele kritike) and
   the " episcophobia" (episkophobia) of certain Germans, and his own
   criticism is checked by his reverence for tradition, which leads him to
   accept the Second Epistle of Clement as genuine, contrary to the
   judgment of the best scholars.

   [1197] The Constantinopolitan codex belongs to the library of the
   Convent of the Holy Sepulchre (tou Panagiou Taphou)in the Fanar or
   Phanar, the Greek district of Constantinople, whose inhabitants, the
   Fanariotes, were originally employed as secretaries and transcribers of
   documents. It is a small 8vo parchment of 120 leaves, dates from a.d.
   1056, is clearly and carefully written in cursive characters, with
   accents, spiritus, punctuation (but without jota subscriptum), and
   contains in addition the second Epistle of Clement in full, the Greek
   Ep. of Barnabas, the larger Greek recension of the 12 Ignatian
   Epistles, the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" (didache ton dodeka
   apostolon), and a work of Chrysostom (a Synopsis of the Old and New
   Testments). The value of this text consists chiefly in the new matter
   of the first Ep. (about one-tenth of the whole, from the close of ch.
   57 to the end), and the remainder of the second. It presents nearly
   four hundred variations. The Constantinopolitan codex is preferred by
   Hilgenfeld, the Alexandrian by Lightfoot, Gebhardt and Harnack. The
   Didache is far more important, but was not published till 1883.

   [1198] This MS. which escaped the attention of French scholars, is now
   in Cambridge. It was written in the year 1170, in the Convent of Mar
   Saliba, at Edessa. It contains, with the exception of the Apocalypse,
   the entire New Testament in the Harclean recension (616) of the
   Philoxenian version (508), and the two Epistles of Clement between the
   Catholic and Pauline Epistles (instead of at the close, as in the
   Alexandrian Cod.), as if they were equal in authority to the canonical
   books. Bishop Lightfoot (Appendix to S. Clemens p. 238) says, that this
   Syriac version is conscientious and faithful, but with a tendency to
   run into paraphrase, and that it follows the Alex. rather than the
   Constantinopolitan text, but presents also some independent readings.

   [1199] See § 50, p. 157, and § 66, p. 226, 228.

   [1200] Mentioned at the close in ch. 65 (which in the Alex. text is ch.
   59). Claudius and Valerius may have been connected with the imperial
   household as freedmen (Comp. Phil. 4:22). Fortunatus has been
   identified by some with the one mentioned 1 Cor. 16:17, as a younger
   member of the household of Stephanas in Corinth.

   [1201] By the author of the Catalogue of contents prefixed to the
   Alexandrian codex, generally called Cod. A: by Dionysius of Corinth, in
   his letter to Soter of Rome (Euseb. IV, 23); Irenaeus (Adv. Haer. I. 3,
   § 3); Clement of Alexandria, who often quotes from it; Origen (Comm. in
   Joan. VI. § 36 and other places); Eusebius )H. E. III. 16; IV. 23; V.
   6); Jerome )De Virisillustr. c. 15). Polycarp already used it, as
   appears from the similarity of several passages. All modern critics
   (with the exception of Baur, Schwegler, Volkmar, and Cotterill) admit
   the Clementine origin, which is supported by the internal evidence of
   style and doctrine. Cotterill's Peregrinus Proteus (1879), which puts
   the Clementine Epistles in their present shape among the Stephanic
   fabrications, is an ingenious literary curiosity, but no serious
   argument. Renan says (p. 319): "Peu d' écrits sontaussi authentiques."

   [1202] Dionysius of Corinth (A. D. 170) first mentions the liturgical
   use of the Epistle in his church. Eusebius (III. 16) testifies from his
   own knowledge that it was read in very many churches (en pleistais
   ekklesiais) both in former times and in his own day. Comp. Jerome, De
   Vir. ill. c. 15.

   [1203] 1 Ch. 5. The terma tes duseos must be Spain, whither Paul
   intended to go, Rom. 15:24, 28. To a Roman writing in Rome, Spain or
   Britain was the Western terminus of the earth. Comp. Strabo II.c. 1, 4;
   III. 2. The hegoumenoi are the Roman magistrates; others refer the word
   specifically to Tigellinus and Nymphidius, the prefects of the
   praetorium in 67, or to Helium and Polycletus, who ruled in Rome during
   the absence of Nero in Greece in 67.

   [1204] Funk gives a list of quotations and parallel passages, Patr.
   Apost. I. 566-570. From this it appears that 157 are from the O. T.,
   including the Apocrypha and (apparently) the Assumption of Moses, 158
   from the N. T., but only three of the latter are strict quotations (ch.
   46 from Matt. 26:24, and Luke 17:2; ch. 2 and 61 from Tit. 3:1).
   Clement mentions by name only one book of the N. T., epistole tou
   makariou Paulou, with evident reference to I Cor. 1;10 sqq. Comp. also
   the lists of Scripture quotations in the ed. of Bryennios (p. 159-165),
   and G. and H. p. 144-155.

   [1205] "When we remember," says Lightfoot, p. 268 sq., "that this
   prayer issued from the fiery furnace of persecution after experience of
   a cruel and capricious tyrant like Domitian, it will appear truly
   sublime--sublime in its utterances and still more sublime in its
   silence. Who would have grudged the Church, of Rome her primacy, if she
   had always spoken thus?" Ropes (l. c, p. 343): The sublimity of this
   prayer gains a peculiar sIgnificance when we remember that it was
   Domitian in whose behalf it was offered."

   [1206] Renan (p. 314) call, .; his epistle "un beau morceau neutre,
   dont les disciples de Pierre et ceux de Paul durent se contenter
   également. Ilest probale qu'il fut un des agents les plus énergetiques
   de la grande OEuvre qué etait en train de s' accomplir, je veux dire,
   de la réconciliation posthume de Pierre et de Paul de la fusior des
   deux partis, sans l'union desquels l'OEuvre du Christ ne pouvait que
   périr."

   [1207] Ch. 32. An echo of Paul's teaching is found in Polycarp, Ad
   Phil. c.1, where he refers to "the firm root of their faith, preached
   to them from olden times, which remains to this day, and bears fruit in
   our Lord Jesus Christ."

   [1208] Ch. 49.

   [1209] Ch. 46. Comp. Eph. 4:3 sqq.

   [1210] 3 Ch. 20: Okeanos anthropois aperantos kai hoi met' auton kosmoi
   tais autais tagais tou despotou dieuthunontai. Lightfoot (p. 84)
   remarks on this passage: "Clement may possibly be referring to some
   known, but hardly accessible land, lying without the pillars of
   Hercules. But more probably he contemplated some unknown land in the
   far west beyond the ocean, like the fabled Atlantis of Plato, or the
   real America of modern discovery." Lightfoot goes on to say that this
   passage was thus understood by Irenaeus (II. 28, 2), Clement of
   Alexandria (Strom. V. 12), and Origen ) De Princ. II.6; In Ezech. VIII.
   3), but that, at a later date, this opinion was condemned by Tertullian
   (De Pall. 2 Hermog. 25), Lactantius (Inst. II. 24), and Augustin )De
   Civit. Dei XVI. 9). For centuries the idea of Cosmas Indicopleustes
   that the earth was a plain surface and a parallelogram, prevailed in
   Christian literature.

   [1211] See especially chs. 56, 58, 59, 63, of the Constantinopolitan
   and Syrian text.

   [1212] Clement, Ad Cor. c. 25. Contrast with this account the fifteenth
   chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.

   [1213] Tertullian )De Resurrect. 13), Origen (C. Cels. IV. 72), Ambrose
   (Hexaëm. V. 23, 79), Epiphanius, Rufinus, and other patristic writers.
   The Phoenix was a favorite symbol of renovation and resurrection, and
   even of Christ himself, among the early Christians, and appears
   frequently on coins, medals, rings, cups, and tombstones. But in this
   point they were no more superstitious than the most intelligent heathen
   contemporaries. Herodotus heard the marvelous story of the burial of
   the parent bird by the offspring from Egyptian priests, II. 73. Ovid
   and other Latin poets refer to it, and Claudian devotes a poem to it.
   Tacitus (Ann. VI. 28), Pliny ) H. Nat. X. 2), and Dion Cassius LVIII.
   27) record that the Phoenix actually reappeared in Egypt, a.d. 34,
   after In interval of 250 years. According to Pliny the bird was also
   brought to Rome by a decree of Claudius, and exhibited in the comitium,
   in the year of the city 800 (A. D. 47). This, of course, was a fraud,
   but many, and among them probably Clement, who may have seen the
   wonderful bird from Egypt at the time, took it for genuine. But an
   inspired writer like Paul would never have made use of such a heathen
   fable as an argument for a Christian truth. "It is now known," says
   Lightfoot."that the story owes its origin to the symbolic and pictorial
   representations of astronomy. The appearance of the phoenix is the
   recurrence of a period marked by the heliacal rising of some prominent
   star or constellation." See on the whole subject Henrichsen, De
   Phoenicis Fabula (Havn. 1825), Cowper, Gebhardt and Harnack, Funk, and
   Lightfoot on ch. 25 of the Clementine Ep., Piper, Mythologie und
   Symbolik der christl. Kunst (1847) I. 446 sqq., and Lepsius,
   Chronologie der Aegypter (1849) 180 sq.

   [1214] Ch. 1. The usual reading is: genomenas, which refers to past
   calamities. So Cod. C. The Alex. MS. is here defective, probably
   [genom]enas .Lightfoot reads with the Syrian version ginomenas, " which
   are befalling us" (267 and 399), and refers the passage to the
   continued perils of the church under Domitian.

   [1215] bebaiotaten kai archaian, c. 47.

   [1216] The later date (93-97) is assIgned to the Epistle by Cotelier,
   Tillemont, Lardner, Möhler, Schliemann, Bunsen, Ritschl, Lipsius,
   Hilgenfeld, Donaldson, Bryennios, Harnack, Uhlhorn, Lightfoot (who puts
   the letter soon after the martyrdom of Flavius Clement, a.d. 95), Funk
   (who puts it after the death of Domitian, 96). But other writers,
   including Hugo Grotius, Grabe, Hefele, Wieseler, B. H. Cowper, assIgn
   the Epistle to an earlier date, and infer from ch. 41 that it must have
   been written before 70, when the temple service in Jerusalem was still
   celebrated. "Not everywhere, brethren," says Clement, "are the daily
   sacrifices offered (prospherontai thusiai), or the vows, or the
   sin-offerings, or the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only; and
   even there they are not offered prospheretai) in every place, but only
   at the altar before the sanctuary, after the victim to be offered has
   been examined by the high-priest and the ministers already mentioned."
   This argument is very plausible, but not conclusive, since Josephus
   wrote a.d. 93 in a similar way of the sacrifices of the temple, using
   the praesens historicum, as if it still existed, Ant. III. 10. In ch. 6
   Clement seems to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem when he says
   that "jealousy and strife have overthrown great cities and uprooted
   great nations." Cowper (l.c. p. 16) mentions the absence of any
   allusion to the Gospel of John as another argument. But the Synoptic
   Gospels are not named either, although the influence of all the Gospels
   and nearly all the Epistles can be clearly traced in Clement.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 163. The Pseudo-Clementine Works.

   The most complete collection of the genuine and spurious works of
   Clement in Migne's Patrol. Graeca, Tom. I. and II.

   The name of Clement has been forged upon several later writings, both
   orthodox and heretical, to give them the more currency by the weight of
   his name and position. These pseudo-Clementine works supplanted in the
   church of Rome the one genuine work of Clement, which passed into
   oblivion with the knowledge of the Greek language. They are as follows:

   1. A Second Epistle to the Corinthians, falsely so called, formerly
   known only in part (12 chapters), since 1875 in full (20 chapters).
   [1217] 217 It is greatly inferior to the First Epistle in contents and
   style, and of a later date, between 120 and 140, probably written in
   Corinth; hence its connection with it in MSS. [1218] 218 It is no
   epistle at all, but a homily addressed to "brothers and sisters." It is
   the oldest known specimen of a post-apostolic sermon, and herein alone
   lies its importance and value. [1219] 219 It is an earnest, though
   somewhat feeble exhortation to active Christianity and to fidelity in
   persecution, meantime contending with the Gnostic denial of the
   resurrection. It is orthodox in sentiment, calls Christ "God and the
   Judge of the living and the dead," and speaks of the great moral
   revolution wrought by him in these words (2 Cor. 1): "We were deficient
   in understanding, worshipping stocks and stones, gold and silver and
   brass, the works of men; and our whole life was nothing else but
   death.... Through Jesus Christ we have received sight, putting off by
   his will the cloud wherein we were wrapped. He mercifully saved us....
   He called us when we were not, and willed that out of nothing we should
   attain a real existence."

   2. Two Encyclical Letters on Virginity. They were first discovered by
   J. J. Wetstein in the library of the Remonstrants at Amsterdam, in a
   Syriac Version written a.d. 1470, and published as an appendix to his
   famous Greek Testament, 1752. [1220] 220 They commend the unmarried
   life, and contain exhortations and rules to ascetics of both sexes.
   They show the early development of an asceticism which is foreign to
   the apostolic teaching and practice. While some Roman Catholic divines
   still defend the Clementine origin, [1221] 221 others with stronger
   arguments assign it to the middle or close of the second century.

   5. Five Decretal Letters, which pseudo-Isidore has placed at the head
   of his collection. Two of them are addressed to James, the Lord's
   Brother, are older than the pseudo-Isidore, and date from the second or
   third century; the three others were fabricated by him. They form the
   basis for the most gigantic and audacious literary forgery of the
   middle ages--the Isidorian Decretals--which subserved the purposes of
   the papal hierarchy. [1225] 225 The first Epistle to James gives an
   account of the appointment of Clement by Peter as his successor in the
   see of Rome, with directions concerning the functions of the
   church-officers and the general administration of the church. The
   second Epistle to James refers to the administration of the eucharist,
   church furniture, and other ritualistic matters. They are attached to
   the pseudo-Clementine Homilies and Recognitions. But it is remarkable
   that in the Homilies James of Jerusalem appears as the superior of
   Peter of Rome, who must give an account of his doings, and entrust to
   him his sermons for safe keeping.

   Corinthians (Euseb. H. E. IV. 23). Bryennios, the discoverer of the
   complete copy, still vindicates the Clementine authorship of the
   homily, and so does Sprinzl (p. 28), but all other modern scholars give
   it up. Wocher (1830) assIgned it to Dionysius of Corinth, Hilgenfeld
   first to Soter of Rome, afterwards (Clem. Ep. ed. II. 1876, p. XLIX) to
   Clement of Alex. in his youth during his sojourn in Corinth, Harnack
   (1877) to a third Clement who lived in Rome between the Roman and the
   Alexandrian Clement, Lightfoot (App. p. 307) and Funk (Prol. xxxix) to
   an unknown Corinthian before a.d. 140, on account of the allusion to
   the Isthmian games (c. 7) and the connection with the Ep. of Clement.

   statements, and the various versions conflict with each other. Hence
   recent Protestant critics reject them; and even the latest Roman

   I. Life of Ignatius.

   Ignatius, surnamed Theophorus, [1226] 226 stood at the head of the
   Church of Antioch at the close of the first century and the beginning
   of the second, and was thus contemporaneous with Clement of Rome and
   Simeon of Jerusalem. The church of Antioch was the mother-church of
   Gentile Christianity; and the city was the second city of the Roman
   empire. Great numbers of Christians and a host of heretical tendencies
   were collected there, and pushed the development of doctrine and
   organization with great rapidity.

   As in the case of Rome, tradition differs concerning the first
   episcopal succession of Antioch, making Ignatius either the second or
   the first bishop of this church after Peter, and calling him now a
   disciple of Peter, now of Paul, now of John. The Apostolic
   Constitutions intimate that Evodius and Ignatius presided
   contemporaneously over that church, the first being ordained by Peter,
   the second by Paul. [1227] 227 Baronius and others suppose the one to
   have been the bishop of the Jewish, the other of the Gentile converts.
   Thiersch endeavors to reconcile the conflicting statements by the
   hypothesis, that Peter appointed Evodius presbyter, Paul Ignatius, and
   John subsequently ordained Ignatius bishop. But Ignatius himself and
   Eusebius say nothing of his apostolic discipleship; while the testimony
   of Jerome and the Martyrium Colbertinum that he and Polycarp were
   fellow-disciples of St. John, is contradicted by the Epistle of
   Ignatius to Polycarp, according to which he did not know Polycarp till
   he came to Smyrna on his way to Rome. [1228] 228 According to later
   story, Ignatius was the first patron of sacred music, and introduced
   the antiphony in Antioch.

   But his peculiar glory, in the eyes of the ancient church, was his
   martyrdom. The minute account of it, in the various versions of the
   Martyrium S. Ignatii, contains many embellishments of pious fraud and
   fancy; but the fact itself is confirmed by general tradition. Ignatius
   himself says, in his Epistle to the Romans, according to the Syriac
   version: "From Syria to Rome I fight with wild beasts, on water and on
   land, by day and by night, chained to ten leopards [soldiers], [1229]
   229 made worse by signs of kindness. Yet their wickednesses do me good
   as a disciple; but not on this account am I justified. Would that I
   might be glad of the beasts made ready for me. And I pray that they may
   be found ready for me. Nay, I will fawn upon them, that they may devour
   me quickly, and not, as they have done with some, refuse to touch me
   from fear. Yea, and if they will not voluntarily do it, I will bring
   them to it by force."

   The Acts of his martyrdom relate more minutely, that Ignatius was
   brought before the Emperor Trajan at Antioch in the ninth year of his
   reign (107-108), was condemned to death as a Christian, was transported
   in chains to Rome, was there thrown to lions in the Coliseum for the
   amusement of the people, and that his remains were carried back to
   Antioch as an invaluable treasure. [1230] 230 The transportation may be
   accounted for as designed to cool the zeal of the bishop, to terrify
   other Christians on the way, and to prevent an outbreak of fanaticism
   in the church of Antioch. [1231] 231 But the chronological part of the
   statement makes difficulty. So far as we know, from coins and other
   ancient documents, Trajan did not come to Antioch on his Parthian
   expedition till the year 114 or 115. We must therefore either place the
   martyrdom later, [1232] 232 or suppose, what is much more probable,
   that Ignatius did not appear before the emperor himself at all, but
   before his governor. [1233] 233 Eusebius, Chrysostom, and other ancient
   witnesses say nothing of an imperial judgment, and the Epistle to the
   Romans rather implies that Ignatius was not condemned by the emperor at
   all; for otherwise it would have been useless for him to forbid them to
   intercede in his behalf. An appeal was possible from a lower tribunal,
   but not from the emperor's.

   II. His Letters.

   On his journey to Rome, Bishop Ignatius, as a prisoner of Jesus Christ,
   wrote seven epistles to various churches, mostly in Asia Minor.
   Eusebius and Jerome put them in the following order: (1) To the
   Ephesians; (2) to the Magnesians; (3) to the Trallians; (4) to the
   Romans; (5) to the Philadelphians; (6) to the Smyrneans; (7) to
   Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna. The first four were composed in Smyrna; the
   other three later in Troas. These seven epistles, in connection with a
   number of other decidedly spurious epistles of Ignatius, have come down
   to us in two Greek versions, a longer and a shorter. The shorter is
   unquestionably to be preferred to the longer, which abounds with later
   interpolations. Besides these, to increase the confusion of
   controversy, a Syriac translation has been made known in 1845, which
   contains only three of the former epistles--those to Polycarp, to the
   Ephesians, and to the Romans--and these in a much shorter form. This
   version is regarded by some as an exact transfer of the original; by
   others, with greater probability, as a mere extract from it for
   practical and ascetic purposes.

   The question therefore lies between the shorter Greek copy and the
   Syriac version. The preponderance of testimony is for the former, in
   which the letters are no loose patch-work, but were produced each under
   its own impulse, were known to Eusebius (probably even to Polycarp),
   [1234] 234 and agree also with the Armenian version of the fifth
   century, as compared by Petermann. The three Syriac epistles, however,
   though they lack some of the strongest passages on episcopacy and on
   the divinity of Christ, contain the outlines of the same life-picture,
   and especially the same fervid enthusiasm for martyrdom, as the seven
   Greek epistles.

   III. His Character and Position in history.

   Ignatius stands out in history as the ideal of a catholic martyr, and
   as the earliest advocate of the hierarchical principle in both its good
   and its evil points. As a writer, he is remarkable for originality,
   freshness and force of ideas, and for terse, sparkling and sententious
   style; but in apostolic simplicity and soundness, he is inferior to
   Clement and Polycarp, and presents a stronger contrast to the epistles
   of the New Testament. Clement shows the calmness, dignity and
   governmental wisdom of the Roman character. Ignatius glows with the
   fire and impetuosity of the Greek and Syrian temper which carries him
   beyond the bounds of sobriety. He was a very uncommon man, and made a
   powerful impression upon his age. He is the incarnation, as it were, of
   the three closely connected ideas: the glory of martyrdom, the
   omnipotence of episcopacy, and the hatred of heresy and schism.
   Hierarchical pride and humility, Christian charity and churchly
   exclusiveness are typically represented in Ignatius.

   As he appears personally in his epistles, his most beautiful and
   venerable trait is his glowing love for Christ as God incarnate, and
   his enthusiasm for martyrdom. If great patriots thought it sweet to die
   for their country, he thought it sweeter and more honorable to die for
   Christ, and by his blood to fertilize the soil for the growth of His
   Church. "I would rather die for Christ," says he, "than rule the whole
   earth." "It is glorious to go down in the world, in order to go up into
   God." He beseeches the Romans: "Leave me to the beasts, that I may by
   them be made partaker of God. I am a grain of the wheat of God, and I
   would be ground by the teeth of wild beasts, that I may be found pure
   bread of God. Rather fawn upon the beasts, that they may be to me a
   grave, and leave nothing of my body, that, when I sleep, I may not be
   burdensome to any one. Then will I truly be a disciple of Christ, when
   the world can no longer even see my body. Pray the Lord for me, that
   through these instruments I may be found a sacrifice to God." [1235]
   235 And further on: "Fire, and cross, and exposure to beasts,
   scattering of the bones, hewing of the limbs, crushing of the whole
   body, wicked torments of the devil, may come upon me, if they only make
   me partaker of Jesus Christ.... My love is crucified, and there is no
   fire in me, which loves earthly stuff.... I rejoice not in the food of
   perishableness, nor in the pleasures of this life. The bread of God
   would I have, which is the flesh of Christ; and for drink I wish his
   blood, which is imperishable love." [1236] 236

   From these and similar passages, however, we perceive also that his
   martyr-spirit exceeds the limits of the genuine apostolic soberness and
   resignation, which is equally willing to depart or to remain according
   to the Lord's good pleasure. [1237] 237 It degenerates into boisterous
   impatience and morbid fanaticism. It resembles the lurid torch rather
   than the clear calm light. There mingles also in all his extravagant
   professions of humility and entire unworthiness a refined spiritual
   pride and self-commendation. And, finally, there is something offensive
   in the tone of his epistle to Polycarp, in which he addresses that
   venerable bishop and apostolic disciple, who at that time must have
   already entered upon the years of ripe manhood, not as a colleague and
   brother, but rather as a pupil, with exhortations and warnings, such
   as: "Strive after more knowledge than thou hast." "Be wise as the
   serpents." "Be more zealous than thou art." "Flee the arts of the
   devil." [1238] 238 This last injunction goes even beyond that of Paul
   to Timothy: "Flee youthful lusts," [1239] 239 and can hardly be
   justified by it. Thus, not only in force and depth of teaching, but
   also in life and suffering, there is a significant difference between
   an apostolic and a post-apostolic martyr.

   The doctrinal and churchly views of the Ignatian epistles are framed on
   a peculiar combination and somewhat materialistic apprehension of
   John's doctrine of the incarnation, and Paul's idea of the church as
   the body of Jesus Christ. In the "catholic church"--an expression
   introduced by him--that is, the episcopal orthodox organization of his
   day, the author sees, as it were, the continuation of the mystery of
   the incarnation, on the reality of which he laid great emphasis against
   the Docetists; and in every bishop, a visible representative of Christ,
   and a personal centre of ecclesiastical unity, which he presses home
   upon his readers with the greatest solicitude and almost passionate
   zeal. He thus applies those ideas of the apostles directly to the
   outward organization, and makes them subservient to the principle and
   institution of the growing hierarchy. Here lies the chief importance of
   these epistles; and the cause of their high repute with catholics and
   prelatists, [1240] 240 and their unpopularity with anti-episcopalians,
   and modern critics of the more radical school. [1241] 241

   It is remarkable that the idea of the episcopal hierarchy which we have
   developed in another chapter, should be first clearly and boldly
   brought out, not by the contemporary Roman bishop Clement, [1242] 242
   but by a bishop of the Eastern church; though it was transplanted by
   him to the soil of Rome, and there sealed with his martyr blood.
   Equally noticeable is the circumstance, that these oldest documents of
   the hierarchy soon became so interpolated, curtailed, and mutilated by
   pious fraud, that it is today almost impossible to discover with
   certainty the genuine Ignatius of history under the hyper- and
   pseudo-Ignatius of tradition.

   [1226] theophoros-i,-i" bearer of God."The titles of the Epistles call
   him Ignatios ho kai theophoros, adding simply the Greek to the Latin
   name. The Martyrium Ignatii, c. 2, makes him explain the term, in
   answer to a question of Trajan, as meaning " one who has Christ in his
   breast."The still later legend (in Symeon Metaphrastes and the Menaea
   Graeca), by changing the accent. (theophoros, Theophorus), gives the
   name the passive meaning, "one carried by God," because Ignatius was
   the child whom Christ took up in his arms and set before his disciples
   as a pattern of humility (Matt. 18:2). So the Acta Sanctorum, 1 Febr.

   Christians in Syria and Asia Minor. The coincidence is so striking that
   Zahn and Renan agree in the inference that Lucian knew the story of
   Ignatius, and intended to mimic him in the person of Peregrinus
   Proteus, as he mimicked the martyrdom of Polycarp. See Renan, Les

   hemin hup' autou kai allas... epempsamen humin). Zahn and Funk maintain
   that this sylloge Polycarpiana consisted of six epistles, and excluded
   that to the Romans. (Ussher excluded the Ep. to Polycarp). Irenaeus
   quotes a passage from the Epistle to the Romans, Adv. Haer. V. 28, § 4.
   Origen speaks of several letters of Ignatius, and quotes a passage from
   Romans and another from Ephesians, Prol. in Cant. Cantic. and Hom. VI.
   in Luc. (III. 30 and 938, Delarue). Zahn (p. 513) finds also traces of
   Ignatius in Clement of Alexandria and Lucian's book De Morte Peregrini,
   which was written soon after the martyrdom of Polycarp.

   [1235] Ad Rom. c. 2, according to the Syriac text; c. 4, in the Greek.

   [1236] Ch. 4 (Syr.), or 5-7 (Gr.).

   [1237] Comp. Phil. 1:23, 24, and Matt. 26:39.

   [1238] Tas kakotechnias pheuge, according to all the MSS., even the
   Syriac. Bunsen proposes to read kakotechnous, in the sense of seductive
   women, coquettes, instead of kakotechnias . But this, besides being a
   mere conjecture, would not materially soften the warning.

   [1239] 2 Tim. ii. 22.

   [1240] Such Roman Catholic writers as Nirschl and Sprinzl find the
   whole theology and church polity of Rome in Ignatius. Episcopalians
   admire him for his advocacy of episcopacy; but he proves too little and
   too much for them; too little because Ignatius knows nothing of a
   diocesan, but only of a congregational episcopacy; too much because he
   requires absolute obedience to the bishop as the representative of
   Christ himself, while the Presbyters represent the apostles. Moreover
   the Ignatian episcopacy is free from the sacerdotal idea which came in
   later with Cyprian, but is intimated in Clement of Rome.

   [1241] Calvin, who, however, knew only the spurious and worthless
   longer recension, calls the Ignatian Epistles abominable trash (Inst.
   I. 1, c. 13, § 29); Dr. W. D. Killen, who ought to know better, from
   strong anti-prelatic feeling, speaks of Ignatius, even according to the
   shorter Syriac recension, as an "anti-evangelical formalist, a puerile
   boaster, a mystic dreamer and crazy fanatic." (Ancient Church, 1859, p.
   414). Neander is far more moderate, yet cannot conceive that a martyr
   so near the apostolic age should have nothing more important to say
   than "such things about obedience to the bishops ") Ch. H. I.192, note,
   Bost, ed.). Baur and the Tübingen critics reject the entire Ignatian
   literature as a forgery. Rothe on the other hand is favorably impressed
   with the martyr-enthusiasm of the Epistles, and Zahn (an orthodox
   Lutheran) thinks the Ignatian epistles in the shorter (Greek recension
   worthy of a comparison with the epistles of St. Paul (p. 400).

   [1242] Still less by the apostle Peter, the alleged first Pope of Rome;
   on the contrary, he enters a solemn protest against hierarchical
   tendencies for all time to come, 1 Pet. 5:14.

   § 165. The Ignatian Controversy.

   Of all the writings of the apostolic fathers none have been so much
   discussed, especially in modern times, as the Ignatian Epistles. This
   arises partly from the importance of their contents to the episcopal
   question, partly from the existence of so many different versions. The
   latter fact seems to argue as strongly for the hypothesis of a genuine
   basis for all, as against the supposition of the full integrity of any
   one of the extant texts. Renan describes the Ignatian problem as the
   most difficult in early Christian literature, next to that of the
   Gospel of John (Les Évang. p. x).

   The Ignatian controversy has passed through three periods, the first
   from the publication of the spurious Ignatius to the publication of the
   shorter Greek recension (A. D. 1495 to 1644); the second from the
   discovery and publication of the shorter Greek recension to the
   discovery and publication of the Syrian version (A. D. 1644 to 1845),
   which resulted in the rejection of the larger Greek recension; the
   third from the discovery of the Syrian extract to the present time
   (1845-1883), which is favorable to the shorter Greek recension.

   1. The Larger Greek Recension of Seven Epistles with eight additional
   ones. Four of them were published in Latin at Paris, 1495, as an
   appendix to another book; eleven more by Faber Stapulensis, also in
   Latin, at Paris, 1498; then all fifteen in Greek by Valentine Hartung
   (called Paceus or Irenaeus) at Dillingen, 1557; and twelve by Andreas
   Gesner at Zurich, 1560. The Catholics at first accepted them all as
   genuine works of Ignatius; and Hartung, Baronius, Bellarmin defended at
   least twelve; but Calvin and the Magdeburg Centuriators rejected them
   all, and later Catholics surrendered at least eight as utterly
   untenable. These are two Latin letters of Ignatius to St. John and one
   to the Virgin Mary with an answer of the Virgin; and five Greek letters
   of Ignatius to Maria Castabolita, with an answer, to the Tarsenses, to
   the Antiochians, to Hero, a deacon of Antioch, and to the Philippians.
   These letters swarm with offences against history and chronology. They
   were entirely unknown to Eusebius and Jerome. They are worthless
   forgeries, clothed with the name and authority of Ignatius. It is a
   humiliating fact that the spurious Ignatius and his letters to St. John
   and the Virgin Mary should in a wretched Latin version have so long
   transplanted and obscured the historical Ignatius down to the sixteenth
   century. No wonder that Calvin spoke of this fabrication with such
   contempt. But in like manner the Mary of history gave way to a Mary of
   fiction, the real Peter to a pseudo-Peter, and the real Clement to a
   pseudo-Clement. Here, if anywhere, we see the necessity and use of
   historical criticism for the defense of truth and honesty.

   2. The Shorter Greek Recension of the seven Epistles known to Eusebius
   was discovered in a Latin version and edited by Archbishop Ussher at
   Oxford, 1644 (Polycarpi et Ignatii Epistolae), and in Greek by Isaac
   Vossius, from a Medicean Codex in 1646, again by Th. Ruinart from the
   Codex Colbertinus (together with the Martyrium) in 1689. We have also
   fragments of a Syrian version (in Cureton), and of an Armenian version
   apparently from the Syrian (printed in Constantinople in 1783, and
   compared by Petermann). Henceforth the longer Greek recension found
   very few defenders (the eccentric Whiston, 1711, and more recently Fr.
   C. Meier, 1836), and their arguments were conclusively refuted by R.
   Rothe in his Anfänge, 1837, and by K. Fr. L. Arndt in the "Studien und
   Kritiken," 1839). It is generally given up even by Roman Catholic
   scholars (as Petavius, Cotelier, Dupin, Hefele, Funk). But as regards
   the genuineness of the shorter Greek text there are three views among
   which scholars are divided.

   (a) Its genuineness and integrity are advocated by Pearson (Vindiciae
   Ignatianae, 1672, against the doubts of the acute Dallaeus), latterly
   by Gieseler, Möhler (R.C.), Rothe (1837), Huther (1841), Düsterdieck
   (1843), Dorner (1845), and (since the publication of the shorter Syriac
   version) by Jacobson, Hefele (R.C., 1847 and 1855), Denzinger (R.C.,
   1849), Petermann (1849), Wordsworth, Churton (1852), and most
   thoroughly by Ulhhorn, (1851 and '56), and Zahn (1873, Ign. v. Ant.
   495-541). The same view is adopted by Wieseler (1878), Funk (in Patr.
   Apost. 1878, Prol LX. sqq., and his monograph, 1883), Canon Travers
   Smith, (in Smith and Wace, 1882), and Lightfoot (1885).

   (b) The friends of the three Syriac epistles (see below under No. 3)
   let only so many of the seven epistles stand as agree with those. Also
   Lardner (1743), Mosheim (1755), Neander (1826), Thiersch (1852),
   Lechler (1857), Robertson and Donaldson (1867), are inclined to suppose
   at least interpolation.

   (c) The shorter recension, though older than the longer, is likewise
   spurious. The letters were forged in the later half of the second
   century for the purpose of promoting episcopacy and the worship of
   martyrs. This view is ably advocated by two very different classes of
   divines: first by Calvinists in the interest of Presbyterianism or
   anti-prelacy, Claudius Salmasius (1645), David Blondel (1646), Dallaeus
   (1666), Samuel Basnage, and by Dr. Killen of Belfast (1859 and 1883);
   next by the Tübingen school of critics in a purely historical interest,
   Dr. Baur (1835, then against Rothe, 1838, and against Bunsen, 1848 and
   1853), Schwegler (1846), and more thoroughly by Hilgenfeld (1853). The
   Tübingen critics reject the whole Ignatian literature as unhistorical
   tendency writings, partly because the entire historical situation
   implied in it and the circuitous journey to Rome are in themselves
   improbable, partly because it advocates a form of church government and
   combats Gnostic heresies, which could not have existed in the age of
   Ignatius. This extreme scepticism is closely connected with the whole
   view of the Tübingen school in regard to the history of primitive
   Christianity, and offers no explanation of the stubborn fact that
   Ignatius was a historical character of a strongly marked individuality
   and wrote a number of letters widely known and appreciated in the early
   church. Renan admits the genuineness of the Ep. to the Romans, but
   rejects the six others as fabrications of a zealous partizan of
   orthodoxy and episcopacy about a.d. 170. He misses in them le génie, le
   caractère individuel, but speaks highly of the Ep. to the Romans, in
   which the enthusiasm of the martyr has found "son expressio la plus
   exaltée"(p. 489).

   (d) We grant that the integrity of these epistles, even in the shorter
   copy, is not beyond all reasonable doubt. As the manuscripts of them
   contain, at the same time, decidedly spurious epistles (even the
   Armenian translation has thirteen epistles), the suspicion arises, that
   the seven genuine also have not wholly escaped the hand of the forger.
   Yet there are, in any case, very strong arguments for their genuineness
   and substantial integrity; viz. (1) The testimony of the fathers,
   especially of Eusebius. Even Polycarp alludes to epistles of Ignatius.
   (2) The raciness and freshness of their contents, which a forger could
   not well imitate. (3) The small number of citations from the New
   Testament, indicating the period of the immediate disciples of the
   apostles. (4) Their way of combating the Judaists and Docetists
   (probably Judaizing Gnostics of the school of Cerinthus), showing us
   Gnosticism as yet in the first stage of its development. (5) Their
   dogmatical indefiniteness, particularly in regard to the Trinity and
   Christology, notwithstanding very strong expressions in favor of the
   divinity of Christ. (6) Their urgent recommendation of episcopacy as an
   institution still new and fresh, and as a centre of congregational
   unity in distinction from the diocesan episcopacy of Irenaeus and
   Tertullian. (7) Their entire silence respecting a Roman primacy, even
   in the epistle to the Romans, where we should most expect it. The Roman
   church is highly recommended indeed, but the Roman bishop is not even
   mentioned. In any case these epistles must have been written before the
   middle of the second century, and reflect the spirit of their age in
   its strong current towards a hierarchical organization and churchly
   orthodoxy on the basis of the glory of martyrdom.

   3. The Syriac Version contains only three epistles (to Polycarp, to the
   Ephesians, and to the Romans), and even these in a much reduced form,
   less than half of the corresponding Greek Epistles. It has the
   subscription: "Here end the three epistles of the bishop and martyr
   Ignatius," on which, however, Bunsen lays too great stress; for, even
   if it comes from the translator himself, and not from a mere
   transcriber, it does not necessarily exclude the existence of other
   epistles (comp. Petermann, l.c. p. xxi.). It was discovered in 1839 and
   '43 by the Rev. Henry Tattam in a monastery of the Libyan desert,
   together with 365 other Syriac manuscripts, now in the British Museum;
   published first by Cureton in 1845, and again in 1849, with the help of
   a third MS. discovered in 1847; and advocated as genuine by him, as
   also by Lee (1846), Bunsen (1847), Ritschl (1851 and 1857), Weiss
   (1852), and most fully by Lipsius (1856), also by E. de Pressené
   (1862), Böhringer (1873), and at first by Lightfoot.

   Now, it is true, that all the considerations we have adduced in favor
   of the shorter Greek text, except the first, are equally good, and some
   of them even better, for the genuineness of the Syrian Ignatius, which
   has the additional advantage of lacking many of the most offensive
   passages (though not in the epistle to Polycarp).

   But against the Syriac text is, in the first place, the external
   testimony of antiquity, especially that of Eusebius, who confessedly
   knew of and used seven epistles, whereas the oldest of the three
   manuscripts of this version, according to Cureton, belongs at the
   earliest to the sixth century, a period, when the longer copy also had
   become circulated through all the East, and that too in a Syriac
   translation, as the fragments given by Cureton show. Secondly, the
   internal testimony of the fact, that the Syriac text, on close
   examination, by the want of a proper sequence of thoughts and sentences
   betrays the character of a fragmentary extract from the Greek; as Baur
   (1848), Hilgenfeld (1853), and especially Uhlhorn (185l), and Zahn
   (1873, p. 167-241), by an accurate comparison of the two, have proved
   in a manner hitherto unrefuted and irrefutable. The short Syriac
   Ignatius has vanished like a dream. Even Lipsius and Lightfoot have
   given up or modified their former view. The great work of Lightfoot on
   Ignatius and Polycarp (1885) which goes into all the details and gives
   all the documents, may be regarded as a full and final settlement of
   the Ignatian problem in favor of the shorter Greek recension.

   The only genuine Ignatius, as the question now stands, is the Ignatius
   of the shorter seven Greek epistles.

   Lightfoot: S. Ign. and S. Polycarp, (1885), vol. I. 417-704.

   Polycarp, born about a.d. 69 or earlier, a disciple of the apostle
   John, a younger friend of Ignatius, and the teacher of Irenaeus
   (between 130 and 140), presided as presbyter-bishop over the church of
   Smyrna in Asia Minor in the first half of the second century; made a
   journey to Rome about the year 154, to adjust the Easter dispute; and
   died at the stake in the persecution under Antoninus Pius a.d. 155, at
   a great age, having served the Lord six and eighty years. [1243] 243 He
   was not so original and intellectually active as Clement or Ignatius,
   but a man of truly venerable character, and simple, patriarchal piety.
   His disciple Irenaeus of Lyons (who wrote under Eleutherus, 177-190),
   in a letter to his fellow-pupil Florinus, who had fallen into the error
   of Gnosticism) has given us most valuable reminiscences of this
   "blessed and apostolic presbyter," which show how faithfully he held
   fast the apostolic tradition, and how he deprecated all departure from
   it. He remembered vividly his mode of life and personal appearance, his
   discourses to the people, and his communications respecting the
   teaching and miracles of the Lord, as he had received them from the
   mouth of John and other eye-witnesses, in agreement with the Holy
   Scriptures. [1244] 244 In another place, Irenaeus says of Polycarp,
   that he had all the time taught what he had learned from the apostles,
   and what the church handed down; and relates, that he once called the
   Gnostic Marcion in Rome, "the first-born of Satan." [1245] 245 This is
   by no means incredible in a disciple of John, who, with all his
   mildness, forbids his people to salute the deniers of the true divinity
   and humanity of the Lord; [1246] 246 and it is confirmed by a passage
   in the epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians, [1247] 247 where he
   says: "Whoever doth not confess, that Jesus Christ is come in the
   flesh, is antichrist, [1248] 248 and whoever doth not confess the
   mystery of the cross, is of the devil; and he, who wrests the words of
   the Lord according to his own pleasure, and saith, there is no
   resurrection and judgment, is the first-born of Satan. Therefore would
   we forsake the empty babbling of this crowd and their false teachings,
   and turn to the word which hath been given us from the beginning,
   watching in prayer, [1249] 249 continuing in fasting, and most humbly
   praying God, that he lead us not into temptation, [1250] 250 as the
   Lord hath said: 'The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.' "
   [1251] 251

   This epistle to the Philippians consists of fourteen short chapters,
   and has been published in full since 1633. It is the only, document
   that remains to us from this last witness of the Johannean age, who
   wrote several letters to neighboring congregations. It is mentioned
   first by his pupil Irenaeus; [1252] 252 it was still in public use in
   the churches of Asia Minor in the time of Jerome as he reports; and its
   contents correspond with the known life and character of Polycarp; its
   genuineness there is no just reason to doubt. [1253] 253 It has little
   merit as a literary production, but is simple and earnest, and breathes
   a noble Christian spirit, It was written after the death of Ignatius
   (whose epistles are mentioned, c. 13) in the name of Polycarp and his
   presbyters; commends the Philippians for the love they showed Ignatius
   in bonds and his companions, and for their adherence to the ancient
   faith; and proceeds with simple, earnest exhortation to love, harmony,
   contentment, patience, and perseverance, to prayer even for enemies and
   persecutors; also giving special directions for deacons, presbyters,
   youths, wives, widows, and virgins; with strokes against Gnostic
   Docetic errors. Of Christ it speaks in high terms, as the Lord, who
   sits at the right hand of God to whom everything in heaven and earth is
   subject; whom every living being serves; who is coming to judge the
   quick and the dead; whose blood God will require of all, who believe
   not on him. [1254] 254 Polycarp guards with sound feeling against being
   considered equal with the apostles: "I write these things, brethren,
   not in arrogance, but because ye have requested me. For neither I, nor
   any other like me, can attain the wisdom of the blessed and glorious
   Paul, who was among you, and in the presence of the then living
   accurately and firmly taught the word of truth, who also in his absence
   wrote you an epistle, [1255] 255 from which ye may edify yourselves in
   the faith given to you, which is the mother of us all, [1256] 256 hope
   following after, and love to God and to Christ, and to neighbors
   leading further. [1257] 257 For when any one is full of these virtues,
   he fulfills the command of righteousness; for he, who has love, is far
   from all sin." [1258] 258 This does not agree altogether with the
   system of St. Paul. But it should be remembered that Polycarp, in the
   very first chapter, represents faith and the whole salvation as the
   gift of free grace. [1259] 259

   The epistle is interwoven with many reminiscences of the Synoptical
   Gospels and the epistles of Paul, John and First Peter, which give to
   it considerable importance in the history of the canon. [1260] 260

   The Martyrium S. Polycarpi (22 chs.), in the form of a circular letter
   of the church of Smyrna to the church of Philomelium in Phrygia, and
   all "parishes of the Catholic church," appears, from ch. 18, to have
   been composed before the first annual celebration of his martyrdom.
   Eusebius has incorporated in his church history the greater part of
   this beautiful memorial, and Ussher first published it complete in the
   Greek original, 1647. It contains an edifying description of the trial
   and martyrdom of Polycarp, though embellished with some marvellous
   additions of legendary poesy. When, for example, the pile was kindled,
   the flames surrounded the body of Polycarp, like the full sail of a
   ship, without touching it; on the contrary it shone, unhurt, with a
   gorgeous color, like white baken bread, or like gold and silver in a
   crucible, and gave forth a lovely fragrance as of precious spices. Then
   one of the executioners pierced the body of the saint with a spear, and
   forthwith there flowed such a stream of blood that the fire was
   extinguished by it. The narrative mentions also a dove which flew up
   from the burning pile; but the reading is corrupt, and Eusebius,
   Rufinus, and Nicephorus make no reference to it. [1261] 261 The sign of
   a dove (which is frequently found on ancient monuments) was probably
   first marked on the margin, as a symbol of the pure soul of the martyr,
   or of the power of the Holy Spirit which pervaded him; but the
   insertion of the word dove in the text suggests an intended contrast to
   the eagle, which flew up from the ashes of the Roman emperors, and
   proclaimed their apotheosis, and may thus be connected with the rising
   worship of martyrs and saints.

   Throughout its later chapters this narrative considerably exceeds the
   sober limits of the Acts of the Apostles in the description of the
   martyrdom of Stephen and the elder James, and serves to illustrate, in
   this respect also, the undeniable difference, notwithstanding all the
   affinity, between the apostolic and the old catholic literature. [1262]

   Notes.

   I. Of all the writings of the Apostolic Fathers the Epistle of Polycarp
   is the least original, but nearest in tone to the Pastoral Epistles of
   Paul, and fullest of reminiscences from the New Testament. We give the
   first four chapters as specimens.

   I. "Polycarp and the presbyters with him to the congregation of god
   which sojourns at philippi. Mercy and peace be multiplied upon you,
   from god almighty, and from Jesus Christ our Saviour.

   1. "I have greatly rejoiced with you in the joy you have had in our
   Lord Jesus Christ, in receiving those examples of true charity, and
   having accompanied, as it well became you, those who were bound with
   holy chains [Ignatius and his fellow-prisoners, Zosimus and Rufus;
   comp. ch. 9]; who are the diadems of the truly elect of God and our
   Lord; and that the strong root of your faith, spoken of in the earliest
   times, endureth until now, and bringeth forth fruit unto our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who suffered for our sins, but whom God raised from the dead,
   having loosed the pains of Hades [Acts 2:24]; in whom though ye see Him
   not, ye believe, and believing rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
   glory [I Pet. 1:8]; into which joy many desire to enter; knowing that
   by grace ye are saved, not by works [Eph. 2:8, 9], but by the will of
   God through Jesus Christ.

   2. "Wherefore, girding up your loins, serve the Lord in fear [1 Pet.
   1:13] and truth, as those who have forsaken the vain, empty talk and
   error of the multitude, and believed in Him who raised up our Lord
   Jesus Christ from the dead, and gave him glory [1Pet. 1:21], and a
   throne at His right hand [comp. Heb. 1:3; 8:1; 12:2]; to whom all
   things in heaven and on earth are subject. Him every spirit serves. His
   blood will God require of those who do not believe in Him. But He who
   raised Him up from the dead will raise up us also, if we do His will,
   and walk in His commandments, and love what He loved, keeping ourselves
   from all unrighteousness, covetousness, love of money, evil-speaking
   false-witness; not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling [1
   Pet. 3:9]; or blow for blow, or cursing for cursing, remembering the
   words of the Lord Jesus [comp. Acts 20:35] in His teaching: Judge not,
   that ye be not judged; forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you; be
   merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; with what measure ye mete, it shall
   be measured to you again [Matt. 7:1, 2; Luke 6:36-38], and once more,
   Blessed are the poor, and those that are persecuted for righteousness'
   sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God [Luke 6:20; Matt. 5:3, 10].

   3. "These things, brethren, I write to you concerning righteousness,
   not because I take anything on myself, but because ye have invited me
   thereto. For neither I, nor any such as I, can come up to the wisdom of
   the blessed and glorified Paul. He, when among you, accurately and
   steadfastly taught the word of truth in the presence of those who were
   then alive; and when absent from you, he wrote you a letter, which, if
   you carefully study, you will find to be the means of building you up
   in that faith which has been given you, and which, being followed by
   hope and preceded by love towards God, and Christ, and our neighbor, is
   the mother of us all [Gal. 4:26]. For if any one be inwardly possessed
   of these graces, be has fulfilled the command of righteousness, since
   he that has love is far from all sin.

   4. "But the love of money is a beginning [archeinstead of root, rize]
   of all kinds of evil, [1 Tim. 6:10]. Knowing, therefore, that as we
   brought nothing into the world, so we can carry nothing out, [1 Tim.
   6:7], let us arm ourselves with the armor of righteousness; and let us
   teach, first of all, ourselves to walk in the commandments of the Lord.
   Next teach your wives to walk in the faith given to them, and in love
   and purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all truth, and loving
   all equally in all chastity; and to train up their children in the
   knowledge and fear of God [comp. Eph. 6:11, 13, 14]. Let us teach the
   widows to be discreet as respects the faith of the Lord, praying
   continually for all, being far from all slandering, evil-speaking,
   false-witnessing, love of money, and every kind of evil; knowing that
   they are the altar of God, that He clearly perceives all things, and
   that nothing is hid from Him, neither reasonings, nor reflections, nor
   any one of the secret things of the heart."

   II. From the Martyrium Polycarpi. When the Proconsul demanded that
   Polycarp should swear by the genius of Caesar and renounce Christ, he
   gave the memorable answer:

   "Eighty and six years have I served Christ, nor has He ever done me any
   harm. How, then, could I blaspheme my King who saved me" (ton basilea
   mou ton sosanta me)? Ch. 9.

   Standing at the stake with his hands tied to the back, as the fagots
   were kindled, Polycarp lifted up his voice and uttered this sublime
   prayer as reported by disciples who heard it (ch. 14):

   "Lord God Almighty, Father of Thy beloved and blessed Son, Jesus
   Christ, through whom we have received the grace of knowing Thee; God of
   angels and powers, and the whole creation, and of the whole race of the
   righteous who live in Thy presence; I bless Thee for deigning me worthy
   of this day and this hour that I may be among Thy martyrs and drink of
   the cup of my Lord Jesus Christ, unto the resurrection of eternal life
   of soul and body in the incorruption of the Holy Spirit. Receive me
   this day into Thy presence together with them, as a fair and acceptable
   sacrifice prepared for Thyself in fulfillment of Thy promise, O true
   and faithful God. Wherefore I praise Thee for all Thy mercies; I bless
   Thee, I glorify Thee, through the eternal High-Priest, Jesus Christ,
   Thy beloved Son, with whom to Thyself and the Holy Spirit, be glory
   both now and forever. Amen."

   For a good popular description of Polycarp, including his letter and
   martyrdom, see The Pupils of St. John the Divine, by the Author of the
   Heir of Redcliffe, in Macmillan's "Sunday Library." London 1863.

   The Catholic Epistle of Barnabas, so called, is anonymous, and omits
   all allusion to the name or residence of the readers. He addresses them
   not as their teacher, but as one among them. [1263] 263 He commences in
   a very general way: "All hail, ye sons and daughters, in the name of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, who loved us, in peace;" and concludes:
   "Farewell, ye children of love and peace, The Lord of glory and all
   grace be with your spirit. Amen." [1264] 264 For this reason, probably,
   Origen called it a "Catholic" Epistle, which must be understood,
   however, with limitation. Though not addressed to any particular
   congregation, it is intended for a particular class of Christians who
   were in danger of relapsing into Judaizing errors.

   1. Contents. The epistle is chiefly doctrinal (ch. 1-17), and winds up
   with some practical exhortations to walk "in the way of light," and to
   avoid "the way of darkness" (ch. 18-21). [1265] 265 It has essentially
   the same object as the Epistle to the Hebrews, though far below it in
   depth, originality and unction. It shows that Christianity is the
   all-sufficient, divine institution for salvation, and an abrogation of
   Judaism, with all its laws and ceremonies. Old things have passed away;
   all things are made new. Christ has indeed given us a law; but it is a
   new law, without the yoke of constraint. [1266] 266 The tables of Moses
   are broken that the love of Christ may be sealed in our hearts. [1267]
   267 It is therefore sin and folly to assert that the old covenant is
   still binding. Christians should strive after higher knowledge and
   understand the difference.

   By Judaism, however, the author understands not the Mosaic and
   prophetic writings in their true spiritual sense, but the carnal
   misapprehension of them. The Old Testament is, with him, rather a
   veiled Christianity, which he puts into it by a mystical allegorical
   interpretation, as Philo, by the same method, smuggled into it the
   Platonic philosophy. In this allegorical conception he goes so far,
   that he actually seems to deny the literal historical sense. He
   asserts, for example, that God never willed the sacrifice and fasting,
   the Sabbath observance and temple-worship of the Jews, but a purely
   spiritual worship; and that the laws of food did not relate at all to
   the eating of clean and unclean animals, but only to intercourse with
   different classes of men, and to certain virtues and vices. His
   chiliasm likewise rests on an allegorical exegesis, and is no proof of
   a Judaizing tendency any more than in Justin, Irenaeus, and Tertullian.
   He sees in the six days of creation a type of six historical millennia
   of work to be followed first by the seventh millennium of rest, and
   then by the eighth millennium of eternity, the latter being
   foreshadowed by the weekly Lord's Day. The carnal Jewish interpretation
   of the Old Testament is a diabolical perversion. The Christians, and
   not the Jews, are the true Israel of God and the righteous owners of
   the Old Testament Scriptures.

   Barnabas proclaims thus an absolute separation of Christianity from
   Judaism. In this respect he goes further than any post-apostolic
   writer. He has been on that ground charged with unsound ultra-Paulinism
   bordering on antinomianism and heretical Gnosticism. But this is
   unjust. He breathes the spirit of Paul, and only lacks his depth,
   wisdom, and discrimination. Paul, in Galatians and Colossians, likewise
   takes an uncompromising attitude against Jewish circumcision,
   sabbatarianism, and ceremonialism, if made a ground of justification
   and a binding yoke of conscience; but nevertheless he vindicated the
   Mosaic law as a preparatory school for Christianity. Barnabas ignores
   this, and looks only at the negative side. Yet he, too, acknowledges
   the new law of Christ. He has some profound glances and inklings of a
   Christian philosophy. He may be called an orthodox Gnostic. He stands
   midway between St. Paul and Justin Martyr, as Justin Martyr stands
   between Barnabas and the Alexandrian school. Clement and Origen, while
   averse to his chiliasm, liked his zeal for higher Christian knowledge
   and his allegorizing exegesis which obscures every proper historical
   understanding of the Old Testament.

   The Epistle of Barnabas has considerable historical, doctrinal, and
   apologetic value. He confirms the principal facts and doctrines of the
   gospel. He testifies to the general observance of Sunday on "the eighth
   day," as the joyful commemoration of Christ's resurrection, in strict
   distinction from the Jewish Sabbath on the seventh. He furnishes the
   first clear argument for the canonical authority of the Gospel of
   Matthew (without naming it) by quoting the passage: "Many are called,
   but few are chosen," with the solemn formula of Scripture quotation:
   "as it is written." [1268] 268 He introduces also (ch. 5) the words of
   Christ, that he did not come "to call just men, but sinners," which are
   recorded by Matthew 9:13. He furnishes parallels to a number of
   passages in the Gospels, Pauline Epistles, First Peter, and the
   Apocalypse. His direct quotations from the Old Testament, especially
   the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and Isaiah, are numerous; but he quotes
   also IV. Esdras and the Book of Enoch. [1269] 269

   2. Authorship. The Epistle was first cited by Clement of Alexandria,
   and Origen, as a work of the apostolic Barnabas, who plays so prominent
   a part in the early history of the church. [1270] 270 Origen seems to
   rank it almost with the inspired Scriptures. In the Sinaitic Bible, of
   the fourth century, it follows as the "Epistle of Barnabas,"
   immediately after the Apocalypse (even on the same page 135, second
   column), as if it were a regular part of the New Testament. From this
   we may, infer that it was read in some churches as a secondary
   ecclesiastical book, like the Epistle of Clement, the Epistle of
   Polycarp, and the Pastor of Hermas. Eusebius and Jerome likewise
   ascribe it to Barnabas but number it among the "spurious," or
   "apocryphal" writings. [1271] 271 They seem to have doubted the
   authority, but not the authenticity of the epistle. The historical
   testimony therefore is strong and unanimous in favor of Barnabas, and
   is accepted by all the older editors and several of the later critics.
   [1272] 272

   But the internal evidence points with greater force to a post-apostolic
   writer. [1273] 273 The Epistle does not come up to the position and
   reputation of Barnabas, the senior companion of Paul, unless we assume
   that he was a man of inferior ability and gradually vanished before the
   rising star of his friend from Tarsus. It takes extreme ground against
   the Mosaic law, such as we can hardly expect from one who stood as a
   mediator between the Apostle of the Gentiles and the Jewish Apostles,
   and who in the collision at Antioch sided with Peter and Mark against
   the bold champion of freedom; yet we should remember that this was only
   a temporary inconsistency, and that no doubt a reaction afterwards took
   place in his mind. The author in order to glorify the grace of the
   Saviour, speaks of the apostles of Christ before their conversion as
   over-sinful, [1274] 274 and indulges in artificial and absurd
   allegorical fancies. [1275] 275 He also wrote after the destruction of
   Jerusalem when Barnabas in all probability was no more among the
   living, though the date of his death is unknown, and the inference from
   Col. 4:10 and 1 Pet. 5:13 is uncertain.

   These arguments are not conclusive, it is true, but it is quite certain
   that if Barnabas wrote this epistle, he cannot be the author of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews, and vice versa. The difference between the two
   is too great for the unity of the authorship. The ancient church showed
   sound tact in excluding that book from the canon; while a genuine
   product of the apostolic Barnabas [1276] 276 had a claim to be admitted
   into it as well as the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews or the writings
   of Mark and Luke.

   The author was probably a converted Jew from Alexandria (perhaps by the
   name Barnabas, which would easily explain the confusion), to judge from
   his familiarity with Jewish literature, and, apparently, with Philo and
   his allegorical method in handling the Old Testament. In Egypt his
   Epistle was first known and most esteemed; and the Sinaitic Bible which
   contains it was probably written in Alexandria or Caesarea in
   Palestine. The readers were chiefly Jewish Christians in Egypt and the
   East, who overestimated the Mosaic traditions and ceremonies. [1277]
   277

   3. Time of composition. The work was written after the destruction of
   Jerusalem and the temple, which is alluded to as an accomplished fact;
   [1278] 278 yet probably before the close of the first century,
   certainly before the reconstruction of Jerusalem under Hadrian (120).

   [1268] Cap. 4 at the close: prosechomen mepote, hos gegraptai, polloi
   kletoi, oligoi de eklektoi heurethomen. From Matt. 22:14. As long as
   the fourth chapter of this epistle existed only in Latin, the words:
   "sicut scriptum est" were suspected by Dr. Credner and other critics as
   an interpolation, Hilgenfeld (1853) suggested that the original had
   simply kathos phesin, and Dressel, in his first edition of the
   Apostolic Fathers (1857), remarked in loc: "Voces 'sicut scriptum est'
   glossam olent." But the discovery of the Greek original in the Sinaitic
   MS. of the Bible has settled this point, and the Constantinopolitan MS.
   confirms it. The attempt of Strauss and other sceptics to refer the
   quotation to the apocryphal fourth Book of Esdras, which was probably
   written by a Jewish Christian after the destruction of Jerusalem, and
   contains the passage: 'Many are born, but few will be saved."is only
   worth mentioning as an instance of the stubbornness of preconceived
   prejudice.

   [1269] Funk (I. 364-366) gives nine quotations from Genesis, thirteen
   from Exodus, six from Deuteronomy, fourteen from the Psalms, twenty-six
   from Isaiah, etc., also one from IV. Esdras, four from Enoch. Comp. the
   list in Anger's Synopsis Evang. (1852), Gebh. and Harn., 217-230.

   [1270] See Acts 1:23; 4:37; 9:26 sq.; 11:22, 30; 14:4, 14; 15:2, etc.
   Clement of Alex. quotes the Epistle seven times (four times under the
   name of Barnabas), in his Stromtata, Origen, his pupil, three or four
   times (Contra Cels. I. 63; De Princ. III. 2; Ad Rom. I. 24). Tertullian
   does not mention the epistle, but seems to have known it (Comp. Adv,
   Marc. III. 7; Adv. Jud. 14); he, however, ascribes the Ep, to the
   Hebrews to Barnabas )De Pudic. c. 20). Hefele and Funk find probable
   allusions to it in Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Ignatius, and Hermas; but
   these are uncertain. On the life and labors of Barnabas see especially
   Hefele and Braunsberger (p. 1-135).

   [1271] In H. E. III. 25, Eusebius counts it among the "spurious" books
   (en tois nothois ... he pheromene Barnaba epistole), but immediately
   afterwards and in VI. 14, among the "doubtful" (antilegomena), and
   Jerome (De Vir. ill. c. 6), "inter apocryphas scripturas."

   [1272] Voss, Dupin, Gallandi, Cave, Pearson, Lardner, Henke, Rördam,
   Schneckenburger, Franke, Gieseler, Credner, Bleek (formerly), De Wette,
   Möhler, Alzog, Sprinzl ("genuine, but not inspired "), Sharpe. The
   interpolation hypothesis of Schenkel (1837) and Heydeke (1874) is
   untenable; the book must stand or fall as a whole.

   [1273] So Ussher, Daillé, Cotelier, Tillemont, Mosheim, Neander,
   Ullmann, Baur, Hilgenfeld, Hefele, Döllinger, Kayser, Donaldson,
   Westcott, Müller, Wieseler, Weizsäcker, Braunsberger, Harnack, Funk.
   Hefele urges eight arguments against the genuineness; but five of them
   are entirely inconclusive. See Milligan, l. c., who examines them
   carefully and concludes that the authenticity of the Epistle is more
   probable than is now commonly supposed.

   [1274] Or "sinners above all sin," huper pasan hamartian
   anomoterous,homines omni peccato iniquiores, c. 5. Paul might call
   himself in genuine humility " the chief of sinners" (1 Tim. 1:15), with
   reference to his former conduct as a persecutor; but he certainly would
   not have used such a term of all the apostles nor would it be true of
   any of them but Judas.

   [1275] He is also charged with several blunders concerning Jewish
   history and worship which can hardly be expected from Barnabas the
   Levite. Comp. chs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 15. But this is disproved by
   Braunsberger (p. 253 sqq.), who shows that the epistle gives us
   interesting archaeological information in those chapters although he
   denies the genuineness.

   [1276] He is twice called an apostle, Acts 14:4, 14, being included
   with Paul in apostoloi.

   [1277] So Neander, Möhler, Hefele (1840), Funk, GüdemAnn. On the other
   hand, Lardner, Donaldson, Hilgenfeld, Kayser, Riggenbach, Hefele
   (1868), Braunsberger, Harnack contend that Barnabas and his readers
   were Gentile Christians, because he distinguishes himself and his
   readers (hemeis) from the Jews chs. 2, 3, 4, 8. 10, 14, 16. But the
   same distinction is uniformly made by John in the Gospel, and was quite
   natural after the final separation between the church and the
   synagogue. The mistakes in Jewish history are doubtful and less
   numerous than the proofs of the writer's familiarity with it. The
   strongest passage is ch. 16: " Before we became believers in God, the
   house of our heart was ... full of idolatry and the house of demons,
   because we did what was contrary to God's will."But even this, though
   more applicable to heathen, is not inapplicable to Jews; nor need we
   suppose that there were no Gentiles among the readers. Towards the
   close of the second century there were probably very few unmixed
   congregations. Lipsius and Volkmar seek the readers in Rome, Müller in
   Asia Minor, Schenkel, Hilgenfeld, Harnack, and Funk in Alexandria or
   Egypt. There is a similar difference of opinion concerning the readers
   of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

   [1278] Ch. 16 compared with the explanation of Daniel's prophecy of the
   little horn in ch. 4.

   [1279] Hefele, Kayser, Baur, Müller, Lipsius, put the composition
   between 107 and 120 (before the building of Aelia Capitolina under
   Hadrian), and Braunsberger between 110 and 137; but Hilgenfeld, Reuss
   )Gesch. d. N. T, 4th ed., 1864, p. 233), Ewald )Gesch. d. Volkes
   Israel, VII. 136), Weizsäcker (" in Jahrb. für Deutsch. Theol.," 1865,
   p. 391, and 1871, p. 569), Wieseler (Ibid. 1870, p. 603-614), and Funk
   (Prol. p. VI.), at the close of the first century, or even before 79.
   Wieseler argues from the author's interpretation of Daniel's prophecy
   concerning the ten kingdoms and the little horn (ch. 4 and 16), that
   the Ep. was written under Domitian, the eleventh Rom. emperor, and "the
   little horn" of Daniel. Weiszäcker and Cunningham refer the little hero
   to Vespasian (79-79), Hilgenfeld to Nerva; but even in the last case
   the Ep. would have been written before a.d. 98, when Nerva died.
   Milligan concludes that it was written very soon after the destruction
   of Jerusalem. But in fresh view of that terrible judgment, we can
   scarcely account for the danger of apostasy to Judaism. The author's
   aim seems to presuppose a revival of Judaism and of Jewish tendencies
   within the Christian Church.

   Editions.

   The older editions give only the imperfect Latin Version, first
   published by Faber Stapulensis (Par. 1513). Other Latin MSS. were
   discovered since. The Greek text (brought from Mt. Athos by Constantine
   Simonides, and called Cod. Lipsiensis) was first published by R. Anger,
   with a preface by G. Dindorf (Lips. 1856); then by Tischendorf, in
   Dressel's Patres Apost., Lips 1857 (p. 572-637); again in the second
   ed. 1863, where Tischenderf, (sic) in consequence of the intervening
   discovery of the Cod. Sinaiticus retracted his former objections to the
   originality of the Greek Hermas from Mt. Athos, which he had pronounced
   a mediaeval retranslation from the Latin (see the Proleg., Appendix and
   Preface to the second ed.). The Poimen horasis is also printed in the
   fourth vol. of the large edition of the Codex Sinaiticus, at the close
   (pp. 142-148), Peters b. 1862. The texts from Mt. Athos and Mt. Sinai
   substantially agree. An Ethiopic translation appeared in Leipz. 1860,

   I. The Shepherd of Hermas [1280] 280 has its title from the
   circumstance that the author calls himself Hermas and is instructed by
   the angel of repentance in the costume of a shepherd. It is
   distinguished from all the productions of the apostolic fathers by its
   literary form. It is the oldest Christian allegory, an apocalyptic
   book, a sort of didactic religious romance. This accounts in part for
   its great popularity in the ancient church. It has often been compared
   with Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and Dante's Divina Commedia, though
   far inferior in literary merit and widely different in theology from
   either. For a long time it was only known in an old, inaccurate Latin
   translation, which was first published by Faber Stapulensis in 1513;
   but since 1856 and 1862, we have it also in the original Greek, in two
   texts, one hailing from Mount Athos re-discovered and compared by
   Lambros, and another (incomplete) from Mount Sinai.

   II. Character and Contents. The Pastor Hermae is a sort of system of
   Christian morality in an allegorical dress, and a call to repentance
   and to renovation of the already somewhat slumbering and secularized
   church in view of the speedily approaching day of judgment. It falls
   into three books: [1281] 281

   (1) Visions; four visions and revelations, which were given to the
   author, and in which the church appears to him first in the form of a
   venerable matron in shining garments with a book, then as a tower, and
   lastly as a virgin. All the visions have for their object to call
   Hermas and through him the church to repentance, which is now possible,
   but will close when the church tower is completed.

   It is difficult to decide whether the writer actually had or imagined
   himself to have had those visions, or invented them as a pleasing and
   effective mode of instruction, like Dante's vision and Bunyan's dream.

   (2) Mandats, or twelve commandments, prescribed by a guardian angel in
   the garb of a shepherd.

   (3) Similitudes, or ten parables, in which the church again appears,
   but now in the form of a building, and the different virtues are
   represented under the figures of stones and trees. The similitudes were
   no doubt suggested by the parables of the gospel, but bear no
   comparison with them for beauty and significance.

   The scene is laid in Rome and the neighborhood. The Tiber is named, but
   no allusion is made to the palaces, the court, the people and society
   of Rome, or to any classical work. An old lady, virgins, and angels
   appear, but the only persons mentioned by name are Hermas, Maximus,
   Clement and Grapte.

   The literary merit of the Shepherd is insignificant. It differs widely
   from apostolic simplicity and has now only an antiquarian interest,
   like the pictures and sculptures of the catacombs. It is prosy, frigid,
   monotonous, repetitious, overloaded with uninteresting details, but
   animated by a pure love of nature and an ardent zeal for doing good.
   The author was a self-made man of the people, ignorant of the classics
   and ignored by them, but endowed with the imaginative faculty and a
   talent for popular religious instruction. He derives lessons of wisdom
   and piety from shepherd and sheep, vineyards and pastures, towers and
   villas, and the language and events of every-day life.

   The first Vision is a fair specimen of the book, which opens like a
   love story, but soon takes a serious turn. The following is a faithful
   translation:

   1. "He who had brought me up, sold me to a certain Rhoda at Rome.
   [1282] 282 Many years after, I met her again and began to love her as a
   sister. Some time after this, I saw her bathing in the river Tiber, and
   I gave her my hand and led her out of the river. And when I beheld her
   beauty, I thought in my heart, saying: 'Happy should I be, if I had a
   wife of such beauty and goodness.' This was my only thought, and
   nothing more.

   "After some time, as I went into the villages and glorified the
   creatures of God, for their greatness, and beauty, and power, I fell
   asleep while walking. And the Spirit seized me and carried me through a
   certain wilderness through which no man could travel, for the ground
   was rocky and impassable, on account of the water.

   "And when I had crossed the river, I came to a plain; and falling upon
   my knees, I began to pray unto the Lord and to confess my sins. And
   while I was praying, the heaven opened, and I beheld the woman that I
   loved saluting me from heaven, and saying: 'Hail, Hermas!' And when I
   beheld her, I said unto her: 'Lady, what doest thou here?' But she
   answered and said: 'I was taken up, in order that I might bring to
   light thy sins before the Lord.' And I said unto her: 'Hast thou become
   my accuser?' 'No,' said she; 'but hear the words that I shall say unto
   thee. God who dwells in heaven, and who made the things that are out of
   that which is not, and multiplied and increased them on account of his
   holy church, is angry with thee because thou hast sinned against me.' I
   answered and said unto her: 'Have I sinned against thee? In what way?
   Did I ever say unto thee an unseemly word? Did I not always consider
   thee as a lady? Did I not always respect thee as a sister? Why doest
   thou utter against me, O Lady, these wicked and foul lies?' But she
   smiled and said unto me: 'The desire of wickedness has entered into thy
   heart. Does it not seem to thee an evil thing for a just man, if an
   evil desire enters into his heart? Yea, it is a sin, and a great one
   (said she). For the just man devises just things, and by devising just
   things is his glory established in the heavens, and he finds the Lord
   merciful unto him in all his ways; but those who desire evil things in
   their hearts, bring upon themselves death and captivity, especially
   they who set their affection upon this world, and who glory in their
   wealth, and lay not hold of the good things to come. The souls of those
   that have no hope, but have cast themselves and their lives away, shall
   greatly regret it. But do thou pray unto God, and thy sins shall be
   healed, and those of thy whole house and of all the saints.'

   2. "After she had spoken these words, the heavens were closed, and I
   remained trembling all over and was sorely troubled. And I said within
   myself: 'If this sin be set down against me, how can I be saved? or how
   can I propitiate God for the multitude of my sins? or with what words
   shall I ask the Lord to have mercy upon me?'

   "While I was meditating on these things, and was musing on them in my
   heart, I beheld in front of me a great white chair made out of fleeces
   of wool; and there came an aged woman, clad in very shining raiment,
   and having a book in her hand, and she sat down by herself on the chair
   and saluted me, saying: 'Hail, Hermas!" And I, sorrowing and weeping,
   said unto her: 'Hail, Lady!' And she said unto me: 'Why art thou
   sorrowful, O Hermas, for thou wert wont to be patient, and
   good-tempered, and always smiling? Why is thy countenance cast down?
   and why art thou not cheerful?' And I said unto her: 'O Lady, I have
   been reproached by a most excellent woman, who said unto me that I
   sinned against her.' And she said unto me: 'Far be it from the servant
   of God to do this thing. But of a surety a desire after her must have
   come into thy heart. Such an intent as this brings a charge of sin
   against the servant of God; for it is an evil and horrible intent that
   a devout and tried spirit should lust after an evil deed; and
   especially that the chaste Hermas should do so-he who abstained from
   every evil desire, and was full of all simplicity, and of great
   innocence!'

   3. " 'But [she continued] God is not angry with thee on account of
   this, but in order that thou mayest convert thy house, which has done
   iniquity against the Lord, and against you who art their parent. But
   thou, in thy love for your children (philoteknos on) didst not rebuke
   thy house, but didst allow it to become dreadfully wicked. On this
   account is the Lord angry with thee; but He will heal all the evils
   that happened aforetime in thy house; for through the sins and
   iniquities of thy household thou hast been corrupted by the affairs of
   this life. But the mercy of the Lord had compassion upon thee, and upon
   thy house, and will make thee strong and establish thee in His glory.
   Only be not slothful, but be of good courage and strengthen thy house.
   For even as the smith, by smiting his work with the hammer,
   accomplishes the thing that he wishes, so shall the daily word of
   righteousness overcome all iniquity. Fail not, therefore, to rebuke thy
   children, for I know that if they will repent with all their heart,
   they will be written in the book of life, together with the saints.'

   "After these words of hers were ended, she said unto me: 'Dost thou
   wish to hear me read?' I said unto her: 'Yea, Lady, I do wish it.' She
   said unto me: 'Be thou a hearer, and listen to the glories of God.'
   Then I heard, after a great and wonderful fashion, that which my memory
   was unable to retain; for all the words were terrible, and beyond man's
   power to bear. The last words, however, I remembered; for they were
   profitable for us, and gentle: 'Behold the God of power, who by his
   invisible strength, and His great wisdom, has created the world, and by
   His magnificent counsel hath crowned His creation with glory, and by
   His mighty word has fixed the heaven, and founded the earth upon the
   waters, and by His own wisdom and foresight has formed His holy church,
   which He has also blessed! Behold, He removes the heavens from their
   places, and the mountains, and the hills, and the stars, and everything
   becomes smooth before His elect, that He may give unto them the
   blessing which He promised them with great glory and joy, if only they
   shall keep with firm faith the laws of God which they have received.'

   4. "When, therefore, she had ended her reading, and had risen up from
   the chair, there came four young men, and took up the chair, and
   departed towards the east. Then she called me, and touched my breast,
   and said unto me: 'Hast thou been pleased with my reading?' And I said
   unto her: 'Lady, these last things pleased me; but the former were hard
   and harsh.' But she spake unto me, saying: 'These last are for the
   righteous; but the former are for the heathen and the apostates." While
   she was yet speaking with me, there appeared two men, and they took her
   up in their arms and departed unto the east, whither also the chair had
   gone. And she departed joyfully; and as she departed, she said: 'Be of
   good courage, O Hermas!'

   III. The theology of Hermas is ethical and practical. He is free from
   speculative opinions and Ignorant of theological technicalities. He
   views Christianity as a new law and lays chief stress on practice.
   Herein he resembles James, but he ignores the "liberty" by which James
   distinguishes the "perfect" Christian law from the imperfect old law of
   bondage. He teaches not only the merit, but the supererogatory merit of
   good works and the sin-atoning virtue of martyrdom. He knows little or
   nothing of the gospel, never mentions the word, and has no idea of
   justifying faith, although he makes faith the chief virtue and the
   mother of virtues. He dwells on man's duty and performance more than on
   God's gracious promises and saving deeds. In a word, his Christianity
   is thoroughly legalistic and ascetic, and further off from the
   evangelical spirit than any other book of the apostolic fathers. Christ
   is nowhere named, nor his example held up for imitation (which is the
   true conception of Christian life); yet he appears as "the Son of God,
   and is represented as pre-existent and strictly divine. [1283] 283 The
   word Christian never occurs.

   But this meagre view of Christianity, far from being heretical or
   schismatic, is closely connected with catholic orthodoxy as far as we
   can judge from hints and figures. Hermas stood in close normal relation
   to the Roman congregation (either under Clement or Pius), and has an
   exalted view of the "holy church," as he calls the church universal. He
   represents her as the first creature of God for which the world was
   made, as old and ever growing younger; yet he distinguishes this ideal
   church from the real and represents the latter as corrupt. He may have
   inferred this conception in part from the Epistle to the Ephesians, the
   only one of Paul's writings with which he shows himself familiar. He
   requires water-baptism as indispensable to salvation, even for the
   pious Jews of the old dispensation, who received it from the apostles
   in Hades. [1284] 284 He does not mention the eucharist, but this is
   merely accidental. The whole book rests on the idea of an exclusive
   church out of which there is no salvation. It closes with the
   characteristic exhortation of the angel: "Do good works, ye who have
   received earthly blessings from the Lord, that the building of the
   tower (the church) may not be finished while ye loiter; for the labor
   of the building has been interrupted for your sakes. Unless, therefore,
   ye hasten to do right, the tower will be finished, and ye will be shut
   out."

   Much of the theology of Hermas is drawn from the Jewish apocalyptic
   writings of pseudo-Enoch, pseudo-Esdras, and the lost Book of Eldad and
   Medad. [1285] 285 So his doctrine of angels. He teaches that six angels
   were first created and directed the building of the church. Michael,
   their chief, writes the law in the hearts of the faithful; the angel of
   repentance guards the penitent against relapse and seeks to bring back
   the fallen. Twelve good spirits which bear the names of Christian
   virtues, and are seen by Hermas in the form of Virgins, conduct the
   believer into the kingdom of heaven; twelve unclean spirits named from
   the same number of sins hinder him. Every man has a good and an evil
   genius. Even reptiles and other animals have a presiding angel. The
   last idea Jerome justly condemns as foolish.

   It is confusing and misleading to judge Hermas from the apostolic
   conflict between Jewish and Gentile Christianity. [1286] 286 That
   conflict was over. John shows no traces of it in his Gospel and
   Epistles. Clement of Rome mentions Peter and Paul as inseparable. The
   two types had melted into the one Catholic family, and continued there
   as co-operative elements in the same organization, but were as yet very
   imperfectly understood, especially the free Gospel of Paul. Jewish and
   pagan features reappeared, or rather they never disappeared, and
   exerted their influence for good and evil. Hence there runs through the
   whole history of Catholicism a legalistic or Judaizing, and an
   evangelical or Pauline tendency; the latter prevailed in the
   Reformation and produced Protestant Christianity. Hermas stood nearest
   to James and furthest from Paul; his friend Clement of Rome stood
   nearer to Paul and further off from James: but neither one nor the
   other had any idea of a hostile conflict between the apostles.

   IV. Relation to the Scriptures. Hermas is the only one of the apostolic
   fathers who abstains from quoting the Old Testament Scriptures and the
   words of our Lord. This absence is due in part to the prophetic
   character of the Shepherd, for prophecy is its own warrant, and speaks
   with divine authority. There are, however, indications that he knew
   several books of the New Testament, especially the Gospel of Mark, the
   Epistle of James, and the Epistle to the Ephesians. The name of Paul is
   nowhere mentioned, but neither are the other apostles. It is wrong,
   therefore, to infer from this silence an anti-Pauline tendency. Justin
   Martyr likewise omits the name, but shows acquaintance with the
   writings of Paul. [1287] 287

   V. Relation to Montanism. The assertion of the prophetic gift and the
   disciplinarian rigorism Hermas shares with the Montanists; but they
   arose half a century later, and there is no historic connection.
   Moreover his zeal for discipline does not run into schismatic excess.
   He makes remission and absolution after baptism difficult, but not
   impossible; he ascribes extra merit to celibacy and seems to have
   regretted his own unhappy marriage, but he allows second marriage as
   well as second repentance, at least till the return of the Lord which,
   with Barnabas, he supposes to be near at hand. Hence Tertullian as a
   Montanist denounced Hermas.

   VI. Authorship and time of composition. Five opinions are possible. (a)
   The author was the friend of Paul to whom he sends greetings in Rom.
   16:14, in the year 58. This is the oldest opinion and accounts best for
   its high authority. [1288] 288 (b) A contemporary of Clement,
   presbyter-bishop of Rome, a.d. 92-101. Based upon the testimony of he
   book itself. [1289] 289 (c) A brother of Bishop Pius of Rome (140). So
   asserts an unknown author of 170 in the Muratorian fragment of the
   canon. [1290] 290 But he may have confounded the older and younger
   Hermas with the Latin translator. (d) The book is the work of two or
   three authors, was begun under Trajan before 112 and completed by the
   brother of Pius in 140. [1291] 291 (e) Hermas is a fictitious name to
   lend apostolic authority to the Shepherd. (f) Barely worth mentioning
   is the isolated assertion of the Ethiopian version that the apostle
   Paul wrote the Shepherd under the name of Hermas which was given to him
   by the inhabitants of Lystra.

   We adopt the second view, which may be combined with the first. The
   author calls himself Hermas and professes to be a contemporary of the
   Roman Clement, who was to send his book to foreign churches. [1292] 292
   This testimony is clear and must outweigh every other. If the Hermas
   mentioned by Paul was a young disciple in 58, he may well have lived to
   the age of Trajan, and he expressly represents himself as an aged man
   at the time when he wrote.

   We further learn from the author that he was a rather unfortunate
   husband and the father of bad children, who had lost his wealth in
   trade through his own sins and those of his neglected sons but who
   awoke to repentance and now came forward himself, as a plain preacher
   of righteousness, though without any official position, and apparently
   a mere layman. [1293] 293 He had been formerly a slave and sold by his
   master to a certain Christian lady in Rome by the name of Rhoda. It has
   been inferred from his Greek style that be was born in Egypt and
   brought up in a Jewish family. [1294] 294 But the fact that he first
   mistook the aged woman who represents the church, for the heathen
   Sibyl, rather suggests that he was of Gentile origin. We may infer the
   same from his complete silence about the prophetic Scriptures of the
   Old Testament. He says nothing of his conversion.

   The book was probably written at the close of the first or early in the
   second century. It shows no trace of a hierarchical organization, and
   assumes the identity of presbyters and bishops; even Clement of Rome is
   not called a bishop. [1295] 295 The state of the church is indeed
   described as corrupt, but corruption began already in the apostolic
   age, as we see from the Epistles and the Apocalypse. At the time of
   Irenaeus the book was held in the highest esteem, which implies its
   early origin.

   VII. Authority and value. No product of post-apostolic literature has
   undergone a greater change in public esteem. The Shepherd was a book
   for the times, but not for all times. To the Christians of the second
   and third century it had all the charm of a novel from the
   spirit-world, or as Bunyan's Pilgrims' Progress has at the present day.
   It was even read in public worship down to the time of Eusebius and
   Jerome, and added to copies of the Holy Scriptures (as the Codex
   Sinaiticus, where it follows after the Ep. of Barnabas). Irenaeus
   quotes it as "divine Scripture." [1296] 296 The Alexandrian fathers,
   who with all their learning were wanting in sound critical
   discrimination, regarded it as "divinely inspired," though Origen
   intimates that others judged less favorably. [1297] 297 Eusebius
   classes it with the "spurious," though orthodox books, like the Epistle
   of Barnabas, the Acts of Paul, etc.; and Athanasius puts it on a par
   with the Apocrypha of the Old Testament, which are useful for
   catechetical instruction.

   In the Latin church where it originated, it never rose to such high
   authority. The Muratorian canon regards it as apocryphal, and remarks
   that "it should be read, [1298] 298 but not publicly used in the church
   or numbered among the prophets or the apostles." Tertullian, who took
   offence at its doctrine of the possibility of a second repentance, and
   the lawfulness of second marriage, speaks even contemptuously of it.
   [1299] 299 So does Jerome in one passage, though he speaks respectfully
   of it in another. [1300] 300 Ambrose and Augustin ignore it. The decree
   of Pope Gelasius I. (about 500) condemns the book as apocryphal. Since
   that time it shared the fate of all Apocrypha, and fell into entire
   neglect. The Greek original even disappeared for centuries, until it
   turned up unexpectedly in the middle of the nineteenth century to
   awaken a new interest, and to try the ingenuity of scholars as one of
   the links in the development of catholic Christianity.

   Note.

   The Pastor Hermae has long ceased to be read for devotion or
   entertainment. We add some modern opinions. Mosheim (who must have read
   it very superficially) pronounced the talk of the heavenly spirits in
   Hermas to be more stupid and insipid than that of the barbers of his
   day, and concluded that he was either a fool or an impostor. The great
   historian Niebuhr, as reported by Bunsen, used to say that he pitied
   the Athenian [why not the Roman?] Christians who were obliged to listen
   to the reader of such a book in the church. Bunsen himself pronounces
   it "a well-meant but silly romance."

   On the other hand, some Irvingite scholars, Dr. Thiersch and Mr. Gaâb,
   have revived the old belief in a supernatural foundation for the
   visions, as having been really seen and recorded in the church of Rome
   during the apostolic age, but afterwards modified and mingled with
   errors by the compiler under Pius. Gaâb thinks that Hermas was gifted
   with the power of vision, and inspired in the same sense as Swedenborg.

   Westcott ascribes "the highest value" to the Shepherd, "as showing in
   what way Christianity was endangered by the influence of Jewish
   principles as distinguished from Jewish forms." Hist. of the Canon of
   the N. T p. 173 (second ed.)

   Donaldson (a liberal Scotch Presbyterian) thinks that the Shepherd
   "ought to derive a peculiar interest from its being the first work
   extant, the main effort of which is to direct the soul to God. The
   other religious books relate to internal workings in the church--this
   alone specially deals with the great change requisite to living to God
   .... Its creed is a very short and simple one. Its great object is to
   exhibit the morality implied in conversion, and it is well calculated
   to awaken a true sense of the spiritual foes that are ever ready to
   assail him." (Ap. Fath., p. 339). But he also remarks (p. 336) that
   "nothing would more completely show the immense difference between
   ancient Christian feeling and modern, than the respect in which
   ancient, and a large number of modern Christians hold this work."

   George A. Jackson (an American Congregationalist) judges even more
   favorably (Ap. Fath., 1879, p. 15): Reading the 'Shepherd,' and
   remembering that it appeared in the midst of a society differing little
   from that satirized by Juvenal, we no longer wonder at the esteem in
   which it was held by the early Christians, but we almost join with them
   in calling it an inspired book."

   Mr. Hoole, of Oxford, agrees with the judgment of Athanasius, and puts
   its literary character on the same footing as the pious but rude art of
   the Roman catacombs.

   Dr. Salmon, of Dublin, compares Hermas with Savonarola, who sincerely
   believed: (a) that the church of his time was corrupt and worldly; (b)
   that a time of great tribulation was at hand, in which the dross should
   be purged away; (c) that there was still an intervening time for
   repentance; (d) that he himself was divinely commissioned to be a
   preacher of that repentance.

   [1280] Pastor Hermae, Ho Poimen. Comp. Vis. I. 1, 2, 4; II. 2.

   [1281] This division, however, is made by later editors.

   [1282] So v. Gebh. and Hilgenf. ed. II., with Cod. Sin. But the MSS.
   vary considerably. The Vatican MS. reads: vendidit quandam puellam
   Romae. The words, eis Rhomen would indicate that the writer was not
   from Rome; but he often confounds eis and en.

   [1283] In the Visions and Mandates the person of the Redeemer is
   mentioned only three times; in the Similitudes Hermas speaks repeatedly
   of the "Son of God." and seems to identify his pre-existent divine
   nature with the Holy Spirit. Sim. I X. 1 to pneuma to hagion... ho
   theos tou theou estin. But a passage in a parable must not be pressed
   and it is differently explained. Comp. Hilgenfeld, Ap. Väter, 166 sq.,
   Harnack's notes on Sim. V. 5 and IX. 1; the different view of Zahn, 139
   sqq. and 245 sqq., and especially Link's monograph quoted above (p.
   680).

   [1284] This is the natural interpretation of the carious passage Simil.
   IX. 16: These apostles and teachers who preached the name of the Son of
   God, after having fallen asleep in the power and faith of the Son of
   God, preached to those also who were asleep and gave to them the seal
   of preaching. They descended therefore into the water with them and
   again ascended (katebesan oun met' auton eis to hudor kai palin
   anebesan). But these descended alive and again ascended alive; but
   those who had fallen asleep before descended dead (nekroi) and ascended
   alive (xontes)."This imaginary post-mortem baptism is derived from the
   preaching of Christ in Hades, 1 Pet. 3:19; 4:6. Clement of Alex. quotes
   this passage with approbation, but supposed that Christ as well as the
   apostles baptized in Hades. Strom. II. 9. 44; VI. 6, 45, 46. Cotelier
   and Donaldson (p. 380) are wrong in interpreting Hermas as meaning
   merely a metaphorical and mystical baptism, or the divine blessings
   symbolized by it.

   [1285] The last is expressly quoted in the Second Vision.

   [1286] As is done by, the Tübingen School, but without unanimity.
   Schwegler, and, with qualifications, Hilgenfeld and Lipsius represent
   Hermas as an Ebionite, while Ritschl on the contrary assigns him to the
   school of Paul. There is no trace whatever in Hermas of the essential
   features of Ebionism circumcision, the sabbath, the antipathy to
   Paul;-nor on the other hand of an understanding of the specific
   doctrines of Paul. Uhlhorn his the point )l.c. p. 13): "Hermas ist ein
   Glied der damaligen orthodoxen Kirche, und seine Auffassung der
   christlichen Lehre die eines einfachen Gemeindegliedes one be stimmte
   Ausprägung irgend eines Parteicharakters."

   [1287] See the list of Scripture allusions of Hermas in Gebhardt's ed.
   p. 272-274; in Funk's ed. I. 575-578; Hilgenfeld, Die Ap. Väter,
   182-184; Zahn, Hermae Pastore N. T. illustratus, Gött. 1867; and D.
   Hirt d. H. 391-482. Zahn discovers considerable familiarity of H. with
   the N. T. writings. On the relation of Hermas to John see Holtzmann, in
   Hilgenfeld's "Zeitschrift für wissensch. Theol." 1875, p. 40 sqq.

   [1288] So Origen (his opinion, puto enim, etc.), Eusebius, Jerome,
   probably also Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria; among recent writers
   Cotelier, Cave, Lardner, Gallandi, Lumper, Lachmann, Sprinzl.

   [1289] Gaâb, Zahn, Caspari, Alzog, Salmon (in "Dict. of Chr. Biog. II.
   912 sqq.).

   [1290] "Pastorem vero nuperrime temporibus nostris in urbe Roma Herma
   (Hermas) conscripsit, sedente, [in] cathedra urbis Romae ecclesiae Pio
   episcopo, fratre ejus. Et ideo legi cum quidem opportet, se[d]
   publicare vero in ecclesia populo neque inter prophetas completum
   [read: completos] numero, neque inter apostolos, in finem temporum
   potest." The same view is set forth in a poem of pseudo-Tertullian
   against Marcion: Post hunc [Hyginus] deinde Pius, Hermas, cui germine
   frater, Angelicus Pastor, qui tradita verba locutus." It is also
   contained in the Liberian Catalogue of Roman bishops (A. D. 354), and
   advocated by Mosheim, Schröckh, Credner, Hefele, Lipsius, Ritschl,
   Heyne, v. Gebhardt, Harnack, Brüll, Funk, Uhlhorn, Baumgärtner. Others
   assume that the brother of Pius was the author, but simulated an elder
   Hermas.

   [1291] Hilgenfeld desIgnates these authors H. a=Hermas apocalypticus H.
   P.=Hermas pastoralis H. s.=Hermas secundarius. See Prol. p. XXI. sq.
   Thiersch, Count de Champagny (Les Antonins, ed. III 1875, T. I, p. 144)
   and Guéranger likewise assumed more than one author. But the book is a
   unit. Comp. Harnack versus Hilgenfeld in the "Theol."
   Literatur-Zeitung" for 1882, f. 249 sqq., Link, Baumgärtner, Lambros,
   quoted above.

   [1292] In Vis. II. 4 Hermas receives the command to write "two books
   and to send one to Clement and one to Grapte; " and Clement was to send
   the books to foreign cities (eis tas exo poleis). This seems to imply
   that he was the well known bishop of Rome. Grapte was a deaconess,
   having charge of widows and orphans. The opinion of Origen that Clement
   and Grapte represent the spiritual and literal methods of
   interpretation is merely an allegorical fancy. Donaldson and Harnack
   assume that Clement is an unknown person, but this is inconsistent with
   the assumed authority of that person.

   [1293] He is told in the Second Vision, ch. 2: "Your seed, Hermas, has
   sinned against God, and they have blasphemed against the Lord, and in
   their great wickedness they, have betrayed their parents ... and their
   iniquities have been filled up. But make known these words to all your
   children, and to your wife who is to be your sister. For she does not
   restrain her tongue, with which she commits iniquity; but on hearing
   these words she will control herself, and will obtain mercy." The words
   "who is to be your sister" probably refer to future continence or
   separation. Tillemont and Hefele regard Hermas as a presbyter, but
   Fleury, Hilgenfeld, Thiersch, Zahn, Uhlhorn and Salmon as a layman. He
   always speaks of presbyters as if he were not one of them, and severely
   censures the Roman clergy. Justin Martyr was also a lay-preacher, but
   with more culture.

   [1294] Zahn infers from the Jewish Greek idiom of Hermas that he grew
   up in Jewish circles and was perhaps acquainted with the Hebrew
   language. On the other hand Harnack supposes (Notes on Vis. I. 1) that
   Hermas was descended from Christian parents, else he would not have
   omitted to inform us of his conversion in the house of Rhoda.
   Hilgenfeld (p. 138) makes Hermas a Jew, but his master, who sold him, a
   Gentile. Robinson conjectures that he was a Greek slave )Sim. IX.) and
   wrote reminiscences of his youth.

   [1295] The church officers appear as a plurality of presbuteroi, or
   seniores, or praesides, of equal rank, but Clement of Rome is supposed
   to have a certain supervision in relation to foreign churches. Vis.
   II., 2, 4; III, 9; Simil. IX., 31. In one passage )Vis. III., 5) Hermas
   mentions four officers "apostles, bishops, teachers, and deacons." The
   "bishops" here include presbyters, and the "teachers " are either all
   preachers of the gospel or the presbyter-bishops in their teaching (as
   distinct from their ruling) capacity and function. In other passages be
   names only the apostoloi and didaskaloi, Sim. IX., 15, 16, 25; comp.
   Paul's poimenes kai didaskaloi, Eph. 4:11. The statements of Hermas on
   church organization are rather loose and indefinite. They have been
   discussed by Hilgenfeld and Harnack in favor of presbyterianism, by
   Hefele and Rothe in favor of episcopacy. Lightfoot, who identifies
   Hermas with the brother of bishop Pius (140), says: " Were it not known
   that the writer's own brother was bishop of Rome (?), we should be at a
   loss what to say about the constitution of the Roman church in his
   day."(Com. on Philipp., p. 218.)

   [1296] Adv. Haer. IV. 20, § 2: eipen he graphe he legousa. Then follows
   a quotation from Mand. I. 1: "First of all believe that there is one
   God who created and prepared and made all things out of nothing."
   Possibly the wrong reference was a slip of memory in view of familiar
   passages, 2 Macc. 7:28 (panta ex ouk onton epoisen); Heb. 11:3; Mark
   12:29 (ho theos eis esti); James 2:18 Hilgenfeld thinks that the Hermas
   was known also to the author of the kerugma Petrou and pseudo-Clement.

   [1297] See the quotations from Clement of Alex. and Origen in G. and H.
   Prol., p. LIII.-LVI. Zahn says that "the history of the ecclesiastical
   authority of Hermas in the East begins with an unbounded recognition of
   the same as a book resting on divine revelation."

   [1298] In private only, or in the church? The passage is obscure and
   disputed.

   [1299] On account of this comparative mildness (Mand. IV., 1),
   Tertullian calls Hermas sarcastically "ille apocryphus Pastor
   maechorum."De Pud. c. 20; comp. c. 10.

   [1300] Jerome calls the Shepherd "revera utilis liber." which was
   publicly read in certain churches of Greece, and quoted by many ancient
   writers as an authority, but "almost unknown among the Latins" (apud
   Latinos' paene Ignotus). Op. II. 846. In another passage, Op. VI. 604,
   he condemns the view of the angelic supervision of animals (Vis. IV.
   2).

   Papias, a disciple of John [1301] 301 and friend of Polycarp, was
   bishop of Hierapolis, in Phrygia, till towards the middle of the second
   century. According to a later tradition in the "Paschal Chronicle," he
   suffered martyrdom at Pergamon about the same time with Polycarp at
   Smyrna. As the death of the latter has recently been put back from 166
   to 155, the date of Papias must undergo a similar change; and as his
   contemporary friend was at least 86 years old, Papias was probably born
   about a.d. 70, so that he may have known St. John, St. Philip the
   Evangelist, and other primitive disciples who survived the destruction
   of Jerusalem.

   Papias was a pious, devout and learned student of the Scriptures, and a
   faithful traditionist, though somewhat credulous and of limited
   comprehension. [1302] 302 He carried the heavenly treasure in an
   earthen vessel. His associations give him considerable weight. He went
   to the primitive sources of the Christian faith. "I shall not regret,"
   he says, "to subjoin to my interpretations [of the Lord's Oracles],
   whatsoever I have at any time accurately ascertained and treasured up
   in my memory, as I have received it from the elders (para ton
   presbuteron) and have recorded it to give additional confirmation to
   the truth, by my testimony. For I did not, like most men, delight in
   those who speak much, but in those who teach the truth; nor in those
   who record the commands of others [or new and strange commands], but in
   those who record the commands given by the Lord to our faith, and
   proceeding from truth itself. If then any one who had attended on the
   elders came, I made it a point to inquire what were the words of the
   elders; what Andrew, or what Peter said, or Philip, or Thomas, or
   James, or John, or Matthew, or any other of the disciples of our Lord;
   and what things Aristion and the elder John, the disciples of the Lord,
   say. For I was of opinion that I could not derive so much benefit from
   books as from the living and abiding voice." [1303] 303 He collected
   with great zeal the oral traditions of the apostles and their disciples
   respecting the discourses and works of Jesus, and published them in
   five books under the title: "Explanation of the Lord's Discourses."
   [1304] 304

   Unfortunately this book, which still existed in the thirteenth century,
   is lost with the exception of valuable and interesting fragments
   preserved chiefly by Irenaeus and Eusebius. Among these are his
   testimonies concerning the Hebrew Gospel of Matthew and the Petrine
   Gospel of Mark, which figure so prominently in all the critical
   discussions on the origin of the Gospels. [1305] 305 The episode on the
   woman taken in adultery which is found in some MSS. of John 7:53-8:11,
   or after Luke 21:38, has been traced to the same source and was perhaps
   to illustrate the word of Christ, John 8:15 ("I judge no man"); for
   Eusebius reports that Papias "set forth another narrative concerning a
   woman who was maliciously accused before the Lord of many sins, which
   is contained in the Gospel according to the Hebrews." [1306] 306 If so,
   we are indebted to him for the preservation of a precious fact which at
   once illustrates in a most striking manner our Saviour's absolute
   purity in dealing with sin, and his tender compassion toward the
   sinner. Papias was an enthusiastic chiliast, and the famous parable of
   the fertility of the millennium which he puts in the Lord's mouth and
   which Irenaeus accepted in good faith, may have been intended as an
   explanation of the Lord's word concerning the fruit of the vine which
   he shall drink new in his Father's kingdom, Matt. 26:29. [1307] 307 His
   chiliasm is no proof of a Judaizing tendency, for it was the prevailing
   view in the second century. He also related two miracles, the
   resurrection of a dead man which took place at the time of Philip (the
   Evangelist), as he learned from his daughters, and the drinking of
   poison without harm by Justus Barsabas.

   Papias proves the great value which was attached to the oral traditions
   of the apostles and their disciples in the second century. He stood on
   the threshold of a new period when the last witnesses of the apostolic
   age were fast disappearing, and when it seemed to be of the utmost
   importance to gather the remaining fragments of inspired wisdom which
   might throw light on the Lord's teaching, and guard the church against
   error.

   But he is also an important witness to the state of the canon before
   the middle of the second century. He knew the first two Gospels, and in
   all probability also the Gospel of John, for he quoted, as Eusebius
   expressly says, from the first Epistle of John, which is so much like
   the fourth Gospel in thought and style that they stand or fall as the
   works of one and the same author. [1308] 308 He is one of the oldest
   witnesses to the inspiration and credibility of the Apocalypse of John,
   and commented on a part of it. [1309] 309 He made use of the first
   Epistle of Peter, but is silent as far as we know concerning Paul and
   Luke. This has been variously explained from accident or ignorance or
   dislike, but best from the nature of his design to collect only words
   of the Lord. Hermas and Justin Martyr likewise ignore Paul, and yet
   knew his writings. That Papias was not hostile to the great apostle may
   be inferred from his intimacy with Polycarp, who lauds Paul in his
   Epistle.

   Notes.

   The relation of Papias to the Apostle John is still a disputed point.
   Irenaeus, the oldest witness and himself a pupil of Polycarp, calls
   Papias Ioannou men akoustes, Polukarpou de hetairos (Adv. Haer. V. 33,
   4). He must evidently mean here the Apostle John. Following him, Jerome
   and later writers (Maximus Confessor, Andrew of Crete and Anastasius
   Sinaita) call him a disciple of the Apostle John, and this view has
   been defended with much learning and acumen by Dr. Zahn (1866), and,
   independently of him, by Dr. Milligan (on John the Presbyter, in
   Cowper's "Journal of Sacred Literature" for Oct., 1867, p. 106 sqq.),
   on the assumption of the identity of the Apostle John with "Presbyter
   John;" comp. 2 and 3 John, where the writer calls himself ho
   presbuteros. Riggenbach (on John the Ap. and John the Presbyter, in the
   "Jahrbücher für Deutsche Theologie," 1868, pp. 319-334), Hengstenberg,
   Leimbach, take the same view (also Schaff in History of the Apost. Ch.,
   1853, p. 421).

   On the other hand, Eusebius (H. E. III. 39) infers that Papias
   distinguishes between John the Apostle and "the Presbyter John" (ho
   presbuteros Ioannes) so called, and that he was a pupil of the
   Presbyter only. He bases the distinction on a fragment he quotes from
   the introduction to the "Explanation of the Lord's Discourses," where
   Papias says that he ascertained the primitive traditions: ti Andreas e
   ti Petros eipen [in the past tense], e ti Philippos e ti thomas e
   Iakobos e ti Ioannes [the Apostle] e Matthaios, e tis heteros ton tou
   kuriou matheton, ha te Aristion kai ho presbuteros Ioannes, hoi tou
   kuriou [not ton apostolon] mathetai, legousin[present tense]. Here two
   Johns seem to be clearly distinguished; but the Presbyter John,
   together with an unknown Aristion, is likewise called a disciple of the
   Lord (not of the Apostles). The distinction is maintained by Steitz,
   Tischendorf, Keim, Weiffenbach, Lüdemann, Donaldson, Westcott, and
   Lightfoot. In confirmation of this view, Eusebius states that two
   graves were shown at Ephesus bearing the name of John (III 39: duo en
   Epheso genesthai mnemata, kai ekateron Ioannou eti nun legesthai). But
   Jerome, De Vir. ill. c. 9, suggests, that both graves were only
   memories of the Apostle. Beyond this, nothing whatever is known of this
   mysterious Presbyter John, and it was a purely critical conjecture of
   the anti-millennarian Dionysius of Alexandria that he was the author of
   the Apocalypse (Euseb. VII. 25). The substance of the mediaeval legend
   of "Prester John" was undoubtedly derived from another source.

   In any case, it is certainly possible that Papias, like his friend
   Polycarp, may have seen and heard the aged apostle who lived to the
   close of the first or the beginning of the second century. It is
   therefore unnecessary to charge Irenaeus with an error either of name
   or memory. It is more likely that Eusebius misunderstood Papias, and is
   responsible for a fictitious John, who has introduced so much confusion
   into the question of the authorship of the Johannean Apocalypse.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1301] See notes at the end of this section.

   [1302] Eusebius, H. E. III. 39, says that he was sphodra smikros ton
   noun, " very, small-minded."and that this appears from his writings;
   but he was no doubt unfavorably influenced in his judgment by the
   strong millennarianism of Papias, which he mentions just before; and
   even if well founded, it would not invalidate his testimony as to mere
   facts. In another place (III. 36), Eusebius calls him a man of
   comprehensive learning and knowledge of the Scriptures (aner ta panta
   hoti malista logiotatos kai tes graphes eudemon, omni doctrinae genere
   instructissimus et in scriptura sacra versatus). Learning, piety, and
   good sense are not always combined. The passage, however, is wanting in
   some MSS. of Eusebius. See the note of Heinichen, vol. I. 141 sqq.

   [1303] para zoses phones kai menouses Eus. III. 39 (Heinichen, 1. 148).

   [1304] Logion kuriskon exegesis, Explanatio sermonum Domini. The word
   exegesis here no doubt means interpretation of some already existing
   gospel record, since Anastasius of Sinai (d. 599) classes Papias among
   Biblical exegetes or interpreters. He probably took as his text the
   canonical Gospels, and gave his own comments on the Lord's Discourses
   therein contained, together with additional sayings which he had
   derived, directly or indirectly, from personal disciples of Christ.
   Although this work has disappeared for several centuries, it may
   possibly yet be recovered either in the original, or in a Syriac or
   Armenian version. The work was still extant in 1218 in the MSS.
   collection of the church at Nismes, according to Gallandi and Pitra. It
   is also mentioned thrice in the Catalogue of the Library of the
   Benedictine Monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury, contained in the
   Cottonian MS. of the thirteenth or fourteenth centurvy. Donaldson, p.
   402. On the meaning of logia see Vol. I. 622 sq.

   [1305] See vol. I. p. 622, 633 sq.

   [1306] The plural (epi pollais hamartiais, H. E. III. 39) is no
   argument against the conjecture. Cod. D reads hamartia instead of
   mocheiain John 8:3.

   [1307] See above, §158, p. 616. Card. Pitra, in the first vol. of his
   Spicileg. Solesm., communicates a similar fragment, but this is, as the
   title and opening words intimate, a translation of Irenaeus, not of
   Papias. The authoress of "The Pupils of St. John." p. 203, remarks on
   that description of Papias: "Understood literally, this is of course
   utterly unlike anything we know of our blessed Lord's unearthly
   teaching; yet it does sound like what a literal and narrow mind,
   listening to mere word of mouth narrative, might make of the parable of
   the Vine, and of the Sower, or of the Grain of Mustard-seed; and we
   also see how providential and how merciful it was that the real words
   of our Lord were so early recorded by two eye-witnesses, and by two
   scholarly men, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, instead of being
   left to the versions that good but dull-minded believers might make of
   them."

   [1308] A mediaeval tradition assigns to Papias an account of the
   origin, and even a part in the composition, of the Gospel of John as
   his amanuensis. So a note prefixed to John's Gospel in a MS. of the
   ninth century, rediscovered by Pitra and Tischendorf in 1866 in the
   Vatican library. The note is, in Tischendorf's opinion, older than
   Jerome, and is as follows: "Evangelium johannis manifestatum et datum
   est ecclesiis ab johanne adhuc in corpore constituto, sicut papias
   nomine hierapolitanus discipulus johannis carus in exotericis
   [exegeticis], id est in extremis, quinque libras retulit. Discripsit
   vero evangeliumdictante johanne recte." etc. The last sentence is
   probably a mistaken translation of the Greek. See Lightfoot in the
   "Contemp. Rev. ." Oct. 1875, p. 854; Charteris, Canonicity, p. 168.
   Another testimony is found in a fragment of a Greek commentator
   Proaemium of the Catena Patrum Graecorum in S. Johannem, ed. by
   Corderius. Antwerp, 1630, according to which John dictated his Gospel
   to Papias of Hierapolis. See Papiae Frag. in Gebh. and Harn's ed. p.
   194. This tradition is discredited by the silence of Eusebius, but it
   shows that in the opinion of the mediaeval church Papias was closely
   connected with the Gospel of John.

   1. The short but precious document called the Epistle to Diognetus was
   unknown in Christian literature [1310] 310 until Henry Stephens, the
   learned publisher of Paris, issued it in Greek and Latin in 1592, under
   the name of Justin Martyr. [1311] 311 He gives no account of his
   sources. The only Codex definitely known is the Strassburg Codex of the
   thirteenth century, and even this (after having been thoroughly
   compared by Professor Cunitz for Otto's edition), was destroyed in the
   accidental fire at Strassburg during the siege of 1870. [1312] 312 So
   great is the mystery hanging over the origin of this document, that
   some modern scholars have soberly turned it into a post-Constantinian
   fiction in imitation of early Christianity, but without being able to
   agree upon an author, or his age, or his nationality.

   Yet this most obscure writer of the second century is at the same time
   the most brilliant; and while his name remains unknown to this day, he
   shed lustre on the Christian name in times when it was assailed and
   blasphemed from Jew and Gentile, and could only be professed at the
   risk of life. He must be ranked with the "great unknown" authors of Job
   and the Epistle to the Hebrews, who are known only to God.

   2. Diognetius was an inquiring heathen of high social position and
   culture, who desired information concerning the origin and nature of
   the religion of the Christians, and the secret of their contempt of the
   world, their courage in death, their brotherly love, and the reason of
   the late origin of this new fashion, so different from the gods of the
   Greeks and the superstition of the Jews. A Stoic philosopher of this
   name instructed Marcus Aurelius in his youth (about 133) in painting
   and composition, and trained him in Attic simplicity of life, and
   "whatever else of the kind belongs to Grecian discipline." Perhaps he
   taught him also to despise the Christian martyrs, and to trace their
   heroic courage to sheer obstinacy. It is quite probable that our
   Diognetus was identical with the imperial tutor; for he wished
   especially to know what enabled these Christians "to despise the world
   and to make light of death." [1313] 313

   3. The Epistle before us is an answer to the questions of this noble
   heathen. It is a brief but masterly vindication of Christian life and
   doctrine from actual experience. It is evidently the product of a man
   of genius, fine taste and classical culture. It excels in fresh
   enthusiasm of faith, richness of thought, and elegance of style, and is
   altogether one of the most beautiful memorials of Christian antiquity,
   unsurpassed and hardly equalled by any genuine work of the Apostolic
   Fathers. [1314] 314

   4. Contents. The document consists of twelve chapters. It opens with an
   address to Diognetus who is described as exceedingly desirous to learn
   the Christian doctrine and mode of worship in distinction from that of
   the Greeks and the Jews. The writer, rejoicing in this opportunity to
   lead a Gentile friend to the path of truth, exposes first the vanity of
   idols (ch. 2), then the superstitions of the Jews (ch. 3, 4); after
   this he gives by contrasts a striking and truthful picture of Christian
   life which moves in this world like the invisible, immortal soul in the
   visible, perishing body (ch. 5 and 6), [1315] 315 and sets forth the
   benefits of Christ's coming (ch. 7). He next describes the miserable
   condition of the world before Christ (ch. 8), and answers the question
   why He appeared so late (ch. 9). In this connection occurs a beautiful
   passage on redemption, fuller and clearer than any that can be found
   before Irenaeus. [1316] 316 He concludes with an account of the
   blessings and moral effects which flow from the Christian faith (ch.
   10). The last two chapters which were probably added by a younger
   contemporary, and marked as such in the MS., treat of knowledge, faith
   and spiritual life with reference to the tree of knowledge and the tree
   of life in paradise. Faith opens the paradise of a higher knowledge of
   the mysteries of the supernatural world.

   The Epistle to Diognetus forms the transition from the purely practical
   literature of the Apostolic Fathers to the reflective theology of the
   Apologists. It still glows with the ardor of the first love. It is
   strongly Pauline. [1317] 317 It breathes the spirit of freedom and
   higher knowledge grounded in faith. The Old Testament is ignored, but
   without any sign of Gnostic contempt.

   5. Authorship and Time of composition. The author calls himself "a
   disciple of the Apostles," [1318] 318 but this term occurs in the
   appendix, and may be taken in a wider sense. In the MS. the letter is
   ascribed to Justin Martyr, but its style is more elegant, vigorous and
   terse than that of Justin and the thoughts are more original and
   vigorous. [1319] 319 It belongs, however, in all probability, to the
   same age, that is, to the middle of the second century, rather earlier
   than later. Christianity appears in it as something still new and
   unknown to the aristocratic society, as a stranger in the world,
   everywhere exposed to calumny and persecution of Jews and Gentiles. All
   this suits the reign of Antoninus Pius and of Marcus Aurelius. If
   Diognetus was the teacher of the latter as already suggested, we would
   have an indication of Rome, as the probable place of composition.

   Some assign the Epistle to an earlier date under Trajan or Hadrian,
   [1320] 320 others to the reign of Marcus Aurelius, [1321] 321 others to
   the close of the second century or still later. [1322] 322 The
   speculations about the author begin with Apollos in the first, and end
   with Stephens in the sixteenth century. He will probably remain
   unknown. [1323] 323

   not a rare name; but the one of our Epistle was a person of social
   prominence, as the term kratistos, honorable, implies. Otto and Ewald
   identify the two. Keim and Dräseke (p. 141) admit that our Diognetus
   belonged to the imperial court, but put him later.

   [1314] Ewald (Geschichte des Volkes Israel, Bd. VII. p. 150) places it
   first among all the early Christian epistles which were not received
   into the N. T., and says that it combines perfectly "the fulness and
   art of Greek eloquence with the purest love of truth, and the ease and
   grace of words with the elevating seriousness of tlle Christian."
   Bunsen: "Indisputably, after Scripture, the finest monument of sound
   Christian feeling, noble courage, and manly eloquence." Semisch (in
   Herzog) calls it "ein Kleinod des christl. Alterthums, welchem in Geist
   und Fassung kaum ein zweites Schriftwerk der nachapostolishen Zeit
   gleichsteht." Keim (Rom und das Christenthum, p. 463 sq.) calIs it "das

   post-Constantinian date is exploded.

   the church(Bunsen); Quadratus Dorner); Apelles, the Gnostic in his old
   age (Dräseke, p. 141). The writer of the art. in Smith and Wace, II.
   162, identifies the author with one Ambrosius, "a chief man of Greece
   who became a Christian, and all his fellow councillors raised a clamor
   against him." and refers to Cureton's Spicil. Syriacum, p. 61-69. The
   Stephanie hypothesis of and Cotterill is a literary and moral
   impossibility.

   (p. 1-31, only the Syriac text, derived from seven MSS. of the Brit.
   Museum, the oldest before a.d. 553, but mutilated).

   The book is discussed in the "Max. Bibl." l. c.; by Fontaninus:
   Historia liter. Aquilejensis (Rom. 1742); by Fabricius, in the
   Bibliotheca Graeca, Tom. I. 870 sqq. (ed. Harles, 1790); by Ewald:
   Geschichte des Volkes Israel, vol. VII. (Göttingen, 1859), p. 321-326;
   and by Tobler in Annulus Rufini, Sent. Sext. (Tübingen 1878).

   Xystus, or as the Romans spelled the name, Sextus or Sixtus I., was the
   sixth bishop of Rome, and occupied this position about ten years under
   the reign of Hadrian (119-128). [1324] 324 Little or nothing is known
   about him except that he was supposed to be the author of a remarkable
   collection of moral and religious maxims, written in Greek, translated
   into Latin by Rufinus and extensively read in the ancient church. The
   sentences are brief and weighty after the manner of the Hebrew Proverbs
   and the Sermon on the Mount. They do not mention the prophets or
   apostles, or even the name of Christ, but are full of God and sublime
   moral sentiments, only bordering somewhat on pantheism. [1325] 325 If
   it is the production of a heathen philosopher, he came nearer the
   genius of Christian ethics than even Seneca, or Epictetus, or Plutarch,
   or Marcus Aurelius; but the product has no doubt undergone a
   transformation in Christian hands, and this accounts for its ancient
   popularity, and entitles it to a place in the history of ecclesiastical
   literature. Rufinus took great liberties as translator; besides, the
   MSS. vary very much.

   Origen first cites in two places the Gnomae or Sententiae of Sextus
   (gnomai Sextou), as a work well known and widely read among the
   Christians of his times, i.e., in the first half of the second century,
   but he does not mention that the writer was a bishop, or even a
   Christian. Rufinus translated them with additions, and ascribes them to
   Sixtus, bishop of Rome and martyr. But Jerome, who was well versed in
   classical literature, charges him with prefixing the name of a
   Christian bishop to the product of a christless and most heathenish
   Pythagorean philosopher, Xystus, who is admired most by those who teach
   Stoic apathy and Pelagian sinlessness. Augustin first regarded the
   author as one of the two Roman bishops Sixti, but afterwards retracted
   his opinion, probably in consequence of Jerome's statement. Maximus the
   Confessor and John of Damascus ascribe it to Xystus of Rome. Gennadius
   merely calls the work Xysti Sententiae. Pope Gelasius declares it
   spurious and written by heretics. [1326] 326 More recent writers (as
   Fontanini, Brucker, Fabricius, Mosheim) agree in assigning it to the
   elder Quintus Sextus or Sextius (Q. S. Pater), a Stoic philosopher who
   declined the dignity of Roman Senator offered to him by Julius Caesar
   and who is highly lauded by Seneca. He abstained from animal food, and
   subjected himself to a scrupulous self-examination at the close of
   every day. Hence this book was entirely ignored by modern church
   historians. [1327] 327 But Paul de Lagarde, who published a Syriac
   Version, and Ewald have again directed attention to it and treat it as
   a genuine work of the first Pope Xystus. Ewald puts the highest
   estimate on it. "The Christian conscience," he says," appears here for
   the first time before all the world to teach all the world its duty,
   and to embody the Christian wisdom of life in brief pointed sentences."
   . [1328] 328 But it seems impossible that a Christian sage and bishop
   should write a system of Christian Ethics or a collection of Christian
   proverbs without even mentioning the name of Christ.

   Notes.

   The following is a selection of the most important of the 430 Sentences
   of Xystus from the Bibliotheca Maxima Veterum Patrum, Tom. III.

   § 172. The Apologists. Quadratus and Aristides.

   On the Apologetic Lit. in general, see § 28, p. 85 sq., and § 37, p.
   104.

   We now proceed to that series of ecclesiastical authors who, from the
   character and name of their chief writings are called Apologists. They
   flourished during the reigns of Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus
   Aurelius, when Christianity was exposed to the literary as well as
   bloody persecution of the heathen world. They refuted the charges and
   slanders of Jews and Gentiles, vindicated the truths of the Gospel, and
   attacked the errors and vices of idolatry. They were men of more
   learning and culture than the Apostolic Fathers. They were mostly
   philosophers and rhetoricians, who embraced Christianity in mature age
   after earnest investigation, and found peace in it for mind and heart.
   Their writings breathe the same heroism, the same enthusiasm for the
   faith, which animated the martyrs in their sufferings and death.

   The earliest of these Apologists are Quadratus and Aristides who wrote
   against the heathen, and Aristo of Pella, who wrote against the Jews,
   all in the reign of Hadrian (117-137).

   Quadratus ( ) was a disciple of the apostles, and bishop (presbyter) of
   Athens. His Apology is lost. All we know of him is a quotation from
   Eusebius who says: "Quadratus addressed a discourse to Aelius Hadrian,
   as an apology for the religion that we profess; because certain
   malicious persons attempted to harass our brethren. The work is still
   in the hands of some of the brethren, as also in our own; from which
   any one may see evident proof, both of the understanding of the man,
   and of his apostolic faith. This writer shows the antiquity of the age
   in which he lived, in these passages: 'The deeds of our Saviour,' says
   he, 'were always before you, for they were true miracles; those that
   were healed, those that were raised from the dead, who were seen, not
   only when healed and when raised, but were always present. They
   remained living a long time, not only whilst our Lord was on earth, but
   likewise when he left the earth. So that some of them have also lived
   to our own times.' Such was Quadratus."

   Aristides was an eloquent philosopher at Athens who is mentioned by
   Eusebius as a contemporary of Quadratus. [1329] 329 His Apology
   likewise disappeared long ago, but a fragment of it was recently
   recovered in an Armenian translation and published by the Mechitarists
   in 1878. [1330] 330 It was addressed to Hadrian, and shows that the
   preaching of Paul in Athens had taken root. It sets forth the Christian
   idea of God as an infinite and indescribable Being who made all things
   and cares for all things, whom we should serve and glorify as the only
   God; and the idea of Christ, who is described as "the Son of the most
   high God, revealed by the Holy Spirit, descended from heaven, born of a
   Hebrew Virgin. His flesh he received from the Virgin, and he revealed
   himself in the human nature as the Son of God. In his goodness which
   brought the glad tidings, he has won the whole world by his life-giving
   preaching. [It was he who according to the flesh was born from the race
   of the Hebrews, of the mother of God, the Virgin Mariam.] [1331] 331 He
   selected twelve apostles and taught the whole world by his mediatorial,
   light-giving truth. And he was crucified, being pierced with nails by
   the Jews; and he rose from the dead and ascended to heaven. He sent the
   apostles into all the world and instructed all by divine miracles full
   of wisdom. Their preaching bears blossoms and fruits to this day, and
   calls the whole world to illumination."

   A curious feature in this document is the division of mankind into four
   parts, Barbarians, Greeks, Jews, and Christians.

   Aristo of Pella, a Jewish Christian of the first half of the second
   century, was the author of a lost apology of Christianity against
   Judaism. [1332] 332

   [1330] The discovery has called forth a considerable literature which
   is mentioned by Harnack, Texte und Untersuchungen, etc., I., p. 110,
   note 23. The first part is the most important. See a French translation
   by Gautier, in the "Revue de théol. et de philos., " 1879, p. 78-82; a
   German translation by Himpel in the "Tübing. Theol. Quartalschrift, "
   1880, reprinted by Harnack, pp. 111 and 112. The art. Aristides in the
   first vol. of Smith and Wace (p. 160) is behind the times. Bücheler and
   Renan doubt the genuineness of the document; Gautier, Baunard, Himpel,
   Harnack defend it; but Harnack assumes some interpolation, as the term
   theotokos, of the Virgin Mary. The Armenian MS. is dated 981, and the
   translation seems to have been made from the Greek in the fifth
   century. At the time of Eusebius the work was still well known in the
   church. But the second piece, which the Mechitarists also ascribe to
   Aristides, is a homily of later date, apparently directed against
   Nestorianism.

   [1331] The bracketed sentence sounds repetitious and like a post-Nicene
   interpolation.

   (1878).

   The most eminent among the Greek Apologists of the second century is
   Flavius Justinus, surnamed "Philosopher and Martyr." [1333] 333 He is
   the typical apologist, who devoted his whole life to the defense of
   Christianity at a time when it was most assailed, and he sealed his
   testimony with his blood. He is also the first Christian philosopher or
   the first philosophic theologian. His writings were well known to
   Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Eusebius, Epiphanius, Jerome, and Photius, and
   the most important of them have been preserved to this day.

   I. His Life. Justin was born towards the close of the first century, or
   in the beginning of the second, in the Graeco-Roman colony of Flavia
   Neapolis, so called after the emperor Flavius Vespasian, and built near
   the ruins of Sychem in Samaria (now Nablous). He calls himself a
   Samaritan, but was of heathen descent, uncircumcised, and ignorant of
   Moses and the prophets before his conversion. Perhaps he belonged to
   the Roman colony which Vespasian planted in Samaria after the
   destruction of Jerusalem. His grandfather's name was Greek (Bacchius),
   his father's (Priscus) and his own, Latin. His education was Hellenic.
   To judge from his employment of several teachers and his many journeys,
   he must have had some means, though he no doubt lived in great
   simplicity and may have been aided by his brethren.

   His conversion occurred in his early manhood. He himself tells us the
   interesting story. [1334] 334 Thirsting for truth as the greatest
   possession, he made the round of the systems of philosophy and knocked
   at every gate of ancient wisdom, except the Epicurean which he
   despised. He first went to a Stoic, but found him a sort of agnostic
   who considered the knowledge of God impossible or unnecessary; then to
   a Peripatetic, but he was more anxious for a good fee than for
   imparting instruction; next to a celebrated Pythagorean, who seemed to
   know something, but demanded too much preliminary knowledge of music,
   astronomy and geometry before giving him an insight into the highest
   truths. At last he threw himself with great zeal into the arms of
   Platonism under the guidance of a distinguished teacher who had
   recently come to his city. [1335] 335 He was overpowered by the
   perception of immaterial things and the contemplation of eternal ideas
   of truth, beauty, and goodness. He thought that he was already near the
   promised goal of this philosophy--the vision of God--when, in a
   solitary walk not far from the sea-shore, a venerable old Christian of
   pleasant countenance and gentle dignity, entered into a conversation
   with him, which changed the course of his life. The unknown friend
   shook his confidence in all human wisdom, and pointed him to the
   writings of the Hebrew prophets who were older than the philosophers
   and had seen and spoken the truth, not as reasoners, but as witnesses.
   More than this: they had foretold the coming of Christ, and their
   prophecies were fulfilled in his life and work. The old man departed,
   and Justin saw him no more, but he took his advice and soon found in
   the prophets of the Old Testament as illuminated and confirmed by the
   Gospels, the true and infallible philosophy which rests upon the firm
   ground of revelation. Thus the enthusiastic Platonist became a
   believing Christian.

   To Tatian also, and Theophilus at Antioch, and Hilary, the Jewish
   prophets were in like manner the bridge to the Christian faith. We must
   not suppose, however, that the Old Testament alone effected his
   conversion; for in the Second Apology, Justin distinctly mentions as a
   means the practical working of Christianity. While he was yet a
   Platonist, and listened to the calumnies against the Christians, he was
   struck with admiration for their fearless courage and steadfastness in
   the face of death. [1336] 336

   After his conversion Justin sought the society of Christians, and
   received from them instruction in the history and doctrine of the
   gospel. He now devoted himself wholly to the spread and vindication of
   the Christian religion. He was an itinerant evangelist or teaching
   missionary, with no fixed abode and no regular office in the church.
   [1337] 337 There is no trace of his ordination; he was as far as we
   know a lay-preacher, with a commission from the Holy Spirit; yet he
   accomplished far more for the good of the church than any known bishop
   or presbyter of his day. "Every one," says he, "who can preach the
   truth and does not preach it, incurs the judgment of God." Like Paul,
   he felt himself a debtor to all men, Jew and Gentile, that he might
   show them the way of salvation. And, like Aristides, Athenagoras,
   Tertullian, Heraclas, Gregory Thaumaturgus, he retained his
   philosopher's cloak, [1338] 338 that he might the more readily
   discourse on the highest themes of thought; and when he appeared in
   early morning (as he himself tells us), upon a public walk, many came
   to him with a "Welcome, philosopher!" [1339] 339 He spent some time in
   Rome where he met and combated Marcion. In Ephesus he made an effort to
   gain the Jew Trypho and his friends to the Christian faith.

   He labored last, for the second time, in Rome. Here, at the instigation
   of a Cynic philosopher, Crescens, whom he had convicted of ignorance
   about Christianity, Justin, with six other Christians, about the year
   166, was scourged and beheaded. Fearlessly and joyfully, as in life, so
   also in the face of death, he bore witness to the truth before the
   tribunal of Rusticus, the prefect of the city, refused to sacrifice,
   and proved by his own example the steadfastness of which he had so
   often boasted as a characteristic trait of his believing brethren. When
   asked to explain the mystery of Christ, he replied: "I am too little to
   say something great of him." His last words were: "We desire nothing
   more than to suffer for our Lord Jesus Christ; for this gives us
   salvation and joyfulness before his dreadful judgment seat, at which
   all the world must appear."

   Justin is the first among the fathers who may be called a learned
   theologian and Christian thinker. He had acquired considerable
   classical and philosophical culture before his conversion, and then
   made it subservient to the defense of faith. He was not a man of genius
   and accurate scholarship, but of respectable talent, extensive reading,
   and enormous memory. He had some original and profound ideas, as that
   of the spermatic Logos, and was remarkably liberal in his judgment of
   the noble heathen and the milder section of the Jewish Christians. He
   lived in times when the profession of Christ was a crime under the
   Roman law against secret societies and prohibited religious. He had the
   courage of a confessor in life and of a martyr in death. It is
   impossible not to admire his fearless devotion to the cause of truth
   and the defense of his persecuted brethren. If not a great man, he was
   (what is better) an eminently good and useful man, and worthy of an
   honored place in "the noble army of martyrs." [1340] 340

   II. Writings. To his oral testimony Justin added extensive literary
   labors in the field of apologetics and polemics. His pen was
   incessantly active against all the enemies of Christian truth, Jews,
   Gentiles, and heretics.

   (1) His chief works are apologetic, and still remain, namely, his two
   Apologies against the heathen, and his Dialogue with the Jew Trypho The
   First or larger Apology (68 chapters) is addressed to the Emperor
   Antoninus Pius (137-161) and his adopted sons, and was probably written
   about a.d. 147, if not earlier; the Second or smaller Apology (25
   chapters) is a supplement to the, former, perhaps its conclusion, and
   belongs to the same reign (not to that of Marcus Aurelius). [1341] 341
   Both are a defense of the Christians and their religion against heathen
   calumnies and persecutions. He demands nothing but justice for his
   brethren, who were condemned without trial simply as Christians and
   suspected criminals. He appeals from the, lower courts and the violence
   of the mob to the highest tribunal of law, and feels confident that
   such wise and philosophic rulers as he addresses would acquit them
   after a fair hearing. He ascribes the persecutions to the instigation
   of the demons who tremble for their power and will soon be dethroned.

   The Dialogue (142 chapters) is more than twice as large as the two
   Apologies, and is a vindication of Christianity from Moses and the
   prophets against the objections of the Jews. It was written after the
   former (which are referred to in ch. 120), but also in the reign of
   Antoninus Pius, i.e., before a.d. 161 probably about a.d. 148. [1342]
   342 In the Apologies he speaks like a philosopher to philosophers; in
   the Dialogue as a believer in the Old Testament with a son of Abraham.
   The disputation lasted two days, in the gymnasium just before a voyage
   of Justin, and turned chiefly on two questions, how the Christians
   could profess to serve God, and yet break his law, and how they could
   believe in a human Saviour who suffered and died. Trypho, whom Eusebius
   calls "the most distinguished among the Hebrews of his day," was not a
   fanatical Pharisee, but a tolerant and courteous Jew, who evasively
   confessed at last to have been much instructed, and asked Justin to
   come again, and to remember him as a friend. The book is a storehouse
   of early interpretation of the prophetic Scriptures.

   The polemic works, Against all Heresies, and Against Marcion, are lost.
   The first is mentioned in the First Apology; of the second, Irenaeus
   has preserved some fragments; perhaps it was only a part of the former.
   [1343] 343 Eusebius mentions also a Psalter of Justin, and a book On
   the Soul, which have wholly disappeared.

   (2) Doubtful works which bear Justin's name, and may have been written
   by him: An address To the Greeks; [1344] 344 a treatise On the Unity of
   God; another On the Resurrection.

   (3) Spurious works attributed to him: The Epistle to Diognetus probably
   of the same date, but by a superior writer, [1345] 345 the Exhortation
   to the Greeks, [1346] 346 the Deposition of the True Faith, the epistle
   To Zenas and Serenus, the Refutation of some Theses of Aristotle, the
   Questions to the Orthodox, the Questions of the Christians to the
   Heathens, and the Questions of the Heathens to the Christians. Some of
   these belong to the third or later centuries. [1347] 347

   The genuine works of Justin are of unusual importance and interest.
   They bring vividly before us the time when the church was still a small
   sect, despised and persecuted, but bold in faith and joyful in death.
   They everywhere attest his honesty and earnestness, his enthusiastic
   love for Christianity, and his fearlessness in its defense against all
   assaults from without and perversions from within. He gives us the
   first reliable account of the public worship and the celebration of the
   sacraments. His reasoning is often ingenious and convincing but
   sometimes rambling and fanciful, though not more so than that of other
   writers of those times. His style is fluent and lively, but diffuse and
   careless. He writes under a strong impulse of duty and fresh impression
   without strict method or aim at rhetorical finish and artistic effect.
   He thinks pen in hand, without looking backward or forward, and uses
   his memory more than books. Only occasionally, as in the opening of the
   Dialogue, there is a touch of the literary art of Plato, his old
   master. [1348] 348 But the lack of careful elaboration is made up by
   freshness and truthfulness. If the emperors of Rome had read the books
   addressed to them they must have been strongly impressed, at least with
   the honesty of the writer and the innocence of the Christians. [1349]
   349

   III. Theology. As to the sources of his religious knowledge, Justin
   derived it partly from the Holy Scriptures, partly from the living
   church tradition. He cites, most frequently, and generally from memory,
   hence often inaccurately, the Old Testament prophets (in the
   Septuagint), and the "Memoirs" of Christ, or "Memoirs by the Apostles,"
   as he calls the canonical Gospels, without naming the authors. [1350]
   350 He says that they were publicly read in the churches with the
   prophets of the Old Testament. He only quotes the words and acts of the
   Lord. He makes most use of Matthew and Luke, but very freely, and from
   John's Prologue (with the aid of Philo whom he never names) he derived
   the inspiration of the Logos-doctrine, which is the heart of his
   theology. [1351] 351 He expressly mentions the Revelation of John. He
   knew no fixed canon of the New Testament, and, like Hernias and Papias,
   he nowhere notices Paul; but several allusions to passages of his
   Epistles (Romans, First Corinthians, Ephesians, Colossians, etc.), can
   hardly be mistaken, and his controversy with Marcion must have implied
   a full knowledge of the ten Epistles which that heretic included in his
   canon. Any dogmatical inference from this silence is the less
   admissible, since, in the genuine writings of Justin, not one of the
   apostles or evangelists is expressly named except John once, and Simon
   Peter twice, and "the sons of Zebedee whom Christ called Boanerges,"
   but reference is always made directly to Christ and to the prophets and
   apostles in general. [1352] 352 The last are to him typified in the
   twelve bells on the border of the high priest's garment which sound
   through the whole world. But this no more excludes Paul from apostolic
   dignity than the names of the twelve apostles on the foundation stones
   of the new Jerusalem (Rev. 21:14). They represent the twelve tribes of
   Israel, Paul the independent apostolate of the Gentiles.

   Justin's exegesis of the Old Testament is apologetic, typological and
   allegorical throughout. He finds everywhere references to Christ, and
   turned it into a text book of Christian theology. He carried the whole
   New Testament into the Old without discrimination, and thus obliterated
   the difference. He had no knowledge of Hebrew, [1353] 353 and freely
   copied the blunders and interpolations of the Septuagint. He had no
   idea of grammatical or historical interpretation. He used also two or
   three times the Sibylline Oracles and Hystaspes for genuine prophecies,
   and appeals to the Apocryphal Acts of Pilate as an authority. We should
   remember, however, that he is no more credulous, inaccurate and
   uncritical than his contemporaries and the majority of the fathers.

   Justin forms the transition from the apostolic fathers to the church
   fathers properly so called. He must not be judged by the standard of a
   later orthodoxy, whether Greek, Roman, or Evangelical, nor by the
   apostolic conflict between Jewish and Gentile Christianity, or Ebionism
   and Gnosticism, which at that time had already separated from the
   current of Catholic Christianity. It was a great mistake to charge him
   with Ebionism. He was a converted Gentile, and makes a sharp
   distinction between the church and the synagogue as two antagonistic
   organizations. He belongs to orthodox Catholicism as modified by Greek
   philosophy. The Christians to him are the true people of God and heirs
   of all the promises. He distinguishes between Jewish Christians who
   would impose the yoke of the Mosaic law (the Ebionites), and those who
   only observe it themselves, allowing freedom to the Gentiles (the
   Nazarenes); the former he does not acknowledge as Christians, the
   latter be treats charitably, like Paul in Romans ch. 14 and 15. The
   only difference among orthodox Christians which he mentions is the
   belief in the millennium which he held, like Barnabas, Irenaeus and
   Tertullian, but which many rejected. But, like all the ante-Nicene
   writers, be had no clear insight into the distinction between the Old
   Testament and the New, between the law and the gospel, nor any proper
   conception of the depth of sin and redeeming grace, and the justifying
   power of faith. His theology is legalistic and ascetic rather than
   evangelical and free. He retained some heathen notions from his former
   studies, though he honestly believed them to be in full harmony with
   revelation.

   Christianity was to Justin, theoretically, the true philosophy, [1354]
   354 and, practically, a new law of holy living and dying. [1355] 355
   The former is chiefly the position of the Apologies, the latter that of
   the Dialogue.

   He was not an original philosopher, but a philosophizing eclectic, with
   a prevailing love for Plato, whom be quotes more frequently than any
   other classical author. He may be called, in a loose sense, a Christian
   Platonist. He was also influenced by Stoicism. He thought that the
   philosophers of Greece had borrowed their light from Moses and the
   prophets. But his relation to Plato after all is merely external, and
   based upon fancied resemblances. He illuminated and transformed his
   Platonic reminiscences by the prophetic Scriptures, and especially by
   the Johannean doctrine of the Logos and the incarnation. This is the
   central idea of his philosophical theology. Christianity is the highest
   reason. The Logos is the preexistent, absolute, personal Reason, and
   Christ is the embodiment of it, the Logos incarnate. Whatever is
   rational is Christian, and whatever is Christian is rational. [1356]
   356 The Logos endowed all men with reason and freedom, which are not
   lost by the fall. He scattered seeds ( ) of truth before his
   incarnation, not only among the Jews but also among the Greeks and
   barbarians, especially among philosophers and poets, who are the
   prophets of the heathen. Those who lived reasonably ( ) and virtuously
   in obedience to this preparatory light were Christians in fact, though
   not in name; while those who lived unreasonably ( ) were Christless and
   enemies of Christ. [1357] 357 Socrates was a Christian as well as
   Abraham, though he did not know it. None of the fathers or schoolmen
   has so widely thrown open the gates of salvation. He was the broadest
   of broad churchmen.

   This extremely liberal view of heathenism, however, did not blind him
   to the prevailing corruption. The mass of the Gentiles are idolaters,
   and idolatry is under the control of the devil and the demons. The Jews
   are even worse than the heathen, because they sin against better
   knowledge. And worst of all are the heretics, because they corrupt the
   Christian truths. Nor did he overlook the difference between Socrates
   and Christ, and between the best of heathen and the humblest Christian.
   "No one trusted Socrates," he says, "so as to die for his doctrine but
   Christ, who was partially known by Socrates, was trusted not only by
   philosophers and scholars, but also by artizans and people altogether
   unlearned."

   The Christian faith of Justin is faith in God the Creator, and in his
   Son Jesus Christ the Redeemer, and in the prophetic Spirit. All other
   doctrines which are revealed through the prophets and apostles, follow
   as a matter of course. Below the deity are good and bad angels; the
   former are messengers of God, the latter servants of Satan, who
   caricature Bible doctrines in heathen mythology, invent slanders, and
   stir up persecutions against Christians, but will be utterly overthrown
   at the second coming of Christ. The human soul is a creature, and hence
   perishable, but receives immortality from God, eternal happiness as a
   reward of piety, eternal fire as a punishment of wickedness. Man has
   reason and free will, and is hence responsible for all his actions; he
   sins by his own act, and hence deserves punishment. Christ came to
   break the power of sin, to secure forgiveness and regeneration to a new
   and holy life.

   Here comes in the practical or ethical side of this Christian
   philosophy. It is wisdom which emanates from God and leads to God. It
   is a new law and a new covenant, promised by Isaiah and Jeremiah, and
   introduced by Christ. The old law was only for the Jews, the new is for
   the whole world; the old was temporary and is abolished, the new is
   eternal; the old commands circumcision of the flesh, the new,
   circumcision of the heart; the old enjoins the observance of one day,
   the new sanctifies all days; the old refers to outward performances,
   the new to spiritual repentance and faith, and demands entire
   consecration to God.

   IV. From the time of Justin Martyr, the Platonic Philosophy continued
   to exercise a direct and indirect influence upon Christian theology,
   though not so unrestrainedly and naively as in his case. [1358] 358 We
   can trace it especially in Clement of Alexandria and Origen, and even
   in St. Augustin, who confessed that it kindled in him an incredible
   fire. In the scholastic period it gave way to the Aristotelian
   philosophy, which was better adapted to clear, logical statements. But
   Platonism maintained its influence over Maximus, John of Damascus,
   Thomas Aquinas, and other schoolmen, through the pseudo-Dionysian
   writings which first appear at Constantinople in 532, and were composed
   probably in the fifth century. They sent a whole system of the universe
   under the aspect of a double hierarchy, a heavenly and an earthly, each
   consisting of three triads.

   The Platonic philosophy offered many points of resemblance to
   Christianity. It is spiritual and idealistic, maintaining the supremacy
   of the spirit over matter, of eternal ideas over all temporary
   phenomena, and the pre-existence and immortality of the soul; it is
   theistic, making the supreme God above all the secondary deities, the
   beginning, middle, and end of all things; it is ethical, looking
   towards present and future rewards and punishments; it is religious,
   basing ethics, politics, and physics upon the authority of the Lawgiver
   and Ruler of the universe; it leads thus to the very threshold of the
   revelation of God in Christ, though it knows not this blessed name nor
   his saying grace, and obscures its glimpses of truth by serious errors.
   Upon the whole the influence of Platonism, especially as represented in
   the moral essays of Plutarch, has been and is to this day elevating,
   stimulating, and healthy, calling the mind away from the vanities of
   earth to the contemplation of eternal truth, beauty, and goodness. To
   not a few of the noblest teachers of the church, from Justin the
   philosopher to Neander the historian, Plato has been a schoolmaster who
   led them to Christ.

   Notes.

   The theology and philosophy of Justin are learnedly discussed by Maran,
   and recently by Möhler and Freppel in the Roman Catholic interest, and
   in favor of his full orthodoxy. Among Protestants his orthodoxy was
   first doubted by the authors of the "Magdeburg Centuries," who judged
   him from the Lutheran standpoint.

   Modern Protestant historians viewed him chiefly with reference to the
   conflict between Jewish and Gentile Christianity. Credner first
   endeavored to prove, by an exhaustive investigation (1832), that Justin
   was a Jewish Christian of the Ebionitic type, with the Platonic
   Logos-doctrine attached to his low creed as an appendix. He was
   followed by the Tübingen critics, Schwegler (1846), Zeller, Hilgenfeld,
   and Baur himself (1853). Baur, however, moderated Credner's view, and
   put, Justin rather between Jewish and Gentile Christianity, calling him
   a Pauline in fact, but not in name ("er ist der Sache nach Pauliner,
   aber dem Namen nach will er es nicht sein"). This shaky judgment shows
   the unsatisfactory character of the Tübingen construction of Catholic
   Christianity as the result of a conflux and compromise between Ebionism
   and Paulinism.

   Ritschl (in the second ed. of his Entstehung der altkatholischen
   Kirche, 1857) broke loose from this scheme and represented ancient
   Catholicism as a development of Gentile Christianity, and Justin as the
   type of the "katholisch werde de Heidenchristenthum," who was
   influenced by Pauline ideas, but unable to comprehend them in their
   depth and fulness, and thus degraded the standpoint of freedom to a new
   form of legalism. This he calls a "herabgekommemer orabgeschwächter
   Paulinismus." Engelhardt goes a step further, and explains this
   degradation of Paulinism from the influences of Hellenic heathenism and
   the Platonic and Stoic modes of thought. He says (p. 485): "Justin was
   at once a Christian and a heathen. We must acknowledge his Christianity
   and his heathenism in order to understand him." Harnack (in a review of
   E., 1878) agrees with him, and lays even greater stress on the heathen
   element. Against this Stähelin (1880) justly protests, and vindicates
   his truly Christian character.

   Among recent French writers, Aubé represents Justin's theology
   superficially as nothing more than popularized heathen philosophy.
   Renan (p. 389) calls his philosophy "une sorte d'eclectisme fondé sur
   un rationalisme mystic " Freppel returns to Maran's treatment, and
   tries to make the philosopher and martyr of the second century even a
   Vatican Romanist of the nineteenth.

   For the best estimates of his character and merits see Neander,
   Semisch, Otto, von Engelhardt, Stähelin, Donaldson (II. 147 sqq.), and
   Holland (in Smith and Wace).

   [1337] Tillemont and Maran (in Migne's ed. Col. 114) infer from his
   mode of describing baptism (Apol. I. 65) that he baptized himself, and
   consequently was a priest. But Justin speaks in the name of the
   Christians in that passage ("We after we have thus washed him, " etc.)
   and throughout the Apology; besides baptism was no exclusively clerical
   act, and could be performed by laymen. Equally inconclusive is the
   inference of Maran from the question of the prefect to the associates
   of Justin (in the Acts of his martyrdom): "Christianos vos ferit
   Justinus?"

   study or austere life, or both.

   [1339] thilosophe, Chaire !

   [1340] I add the estimate of Pressensé (Martyrs and Apologists, p.
   251): "The truth never had a witness more disinterested, more
   courageous, more worthy of the hatred of a godless age and of the
   approval of Heaven. The largeness of his heart and mind equalled the
   fervor of his zeal, and both were based on his Christian charity.
   Justin derived all his eloquence from his heart; his natural genius was
   not of rare order, but the experiences of his early life, illumined by
   revelation, became the source of much fruitful suggestion for himself,
   and gave to the Church a heritage of thought which, ripened and
   developed at Alexandria, was to become the basis of the great apology
   of Christianity. If we except the beautiful doctrine of the Word
   germinally present in every man, there was little originality in
   Justin's theological ideas. In exegesis he is subtle, and sometimes
   puerile; in argument he flags, but where his heart speaks, he stands
   forth in all his moral greatness, and his earnest, generous words are
   ever quick and telling. Had he remained a pagan he would have lived
   unnoted in erudite mediocrity . Christianity fired and fertilized his
   genius, and it is the glowing soul which we chiefly love to trace in
   all his writings."

   [1341] The year of composition cannot be fixed with absolute certainty.
   The First Apology is addressed "To the Emperor (autokratori)Titus
   Aelius Adrianus Antoninus, Pius, Augustus Caesar; and to Verissimus,
   his son, philosopher [i.e. Marcus Aurelius]; and to Lucius, the
   philosopher [?]--son by nature of a Caesar [i.e. Caesar Aelius Verus]
   and of Pius by adoption and to the sacred Senate;-and to the whole
   Roman people, " etc. The address violates the curial style, and is
   perhaps (as Mommsen and Volkmar suspect) a later addition, but no one
   doubts its general correctness. From the title "Verissimus, " which
   Marcus Aurelius ceased to bear after his adoption by Antonine in 138,
   and from the absence of the title "Caesar" which he received in 139,
   the older critics have inferred that it must have been written shortly
   after the death of Hadrian (137), and Eusebius, in the Chronicon,
   assigns it to 141. The early date is strengthened by the fact that in
   the Dialogue, which was written after the Apologies, the Bar-Cochba war
   (132-135) is represented as still going on, or at all events as recent
   (phugon ton nun genomenon polemon, ex bello nostra aetate profugus, ch.
   I; Comp. ch. 9). But, on the other hand, Marcus Aurelius was not really
   associated as co-regent with Antonine till 147, and in the book itself
   Tustin seems to imply two regents. Lucius Verus, moreover, was born
   130, and could not well be addressed in his eighth year as
   "philosopher; " Eusebius, however, reads "Son of the philosopher
   Caesar; " and the term philosophos was used in a very wide sense. Of
   more weight is the fact that the first Apology was written after the
   Syntagma against Marcion, who flourished in Rome between 139-145,
   though this chronology, too, is not quite certain. Justin says that he
   was writing 150 years after the birth of the Saviour; if this is not
   simply a round number, it helps to fix the date. For these reasons
   modern critics decide for 147-150 (Volkmar, Baur, Von Engelhardt, Hort,
   Donaldson, Holland), or 150 (Lipsius and Renan), or 160 (Keim and
   Aubé). The smaller Apology was written likewise under Antoninus Pius
   (so Neander, Otto, Volkmar, Hort, contrary to Eusebius, iv. 15, 18, and
   the two rulers, but only one autocrat, while after his death there were
   two older view, which puts it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius; for it
   presupposes " Augusti" or autocrats. See on the chronology Volkmar, Die
   Zeit Just. des M., in the " Theol. Jahrb."of Tübingen, 1855 (Nos. 2 and
   4); Hort On the Date of Justin M., in the " Journal of Classic and
   Sacred Philology, " June 1856; Donaldson, II. 73 sqq.; Engelhardt, l.c.
   71-80; Keim, Rom. u. d. Christenth., p. 425; Renan, l.c. p. 367, note,
   and Harnack, Texte und Unters., etc. 1. 172 sq.

   [1342] Hort puts the Dial. between 142 and 148; Volkmar in 155; Keim
   between 160-164; Englehardt in 148 or after.

   Renan's judgment is interesting, but hardly Just. He says (p. 365):
   "Justin n'était un grand esprit; il manquait à la, fois de philosophie
   et de critique; son exégèse surtout passerait aujour d' hui pour très
   défectueuse; mais il fait preuve dun sens général assez droit; it avait
   cette espèce, de crédulité médiocre qui permet de raissonner sensément
   sur des prémisses puériles et de s'arrêter à temps de façon à n'être
   qu'à moitié absurde." On the next page he says: "Justin était un esprit
   faible; mais c'était un noble et bon coeur." Donaldson justly remarks
   (II. 15 sq.) that the faults of style and reasoning attributed to
   Justin and other Apologists may be paralleled in Plutarch and all other
   contemporaries, and that more learned and able writers could not have
   done better than present the same arguments in a more elaborate and
   polished form.

   [1350] apomnemoneumata ton apostolon, a designation peculiar to Justin,
   and occurring in the Apologies and the Dialogue, but nowhere else,
   borrowed, no doubt, from Xenophon's Memorabilia of Socrates. Four times
   he calls them simply "Memoirs," four times "Memoirs of (or by) the
   Apostles;" once "Memoirs made by the Apostles, " which constitute the
   one Gospel (to euangelion, Dial. c. 10), and which "are called Gospels"
   (ha kaleitai euangelia, Apol. I.66, a decisive passage), once, quoting
   from Mark. "Peter's Memoirs." After long and thorough discussion the
   identity of these Memoirs with our canonical Gospels is settled
   notwithstanding the doubts of the author of Supernatural Religion. It
   is possible, however, that Justin may have used also some kind of
   gospel harmony such as his pupil Tatian actually prepared.

   [1351] One unquestionable quotation from John (3:3-5) is discussed in
   vol. I. 703 sq. If he did not cite the words of John, he evidently
   moved in his thoughts.

   [1352] See the list of Justin's Scripture quotations or allusions in
   Otto's edition, 579-592. The most numerous are from the Pentateuch,
   Isaiah, Matthew, and Luke. Of profane authors he quotes Plato, Homer,
   Euripides, Xenophon, and Menander.

   [1353] Donaldson (II. 148) infers from his Samaritan origin, and his
   attempts in one or two cases to give the etymology of Hebrew words
   (Apol. I. 33), that he, must have known a little Hebrew, but it must
   have been a very little indeed; at all events he never appeals to the
   Hebrew text.

   [1354] He calls the Christian religion (Dial. c. 8) mone philosophia
   asphales te kai sumphoros-i,-isola philosophia tuta atque utilis.

   [1355] teleutaios nomos kai diatheke kuriotate pason, novissima lex et
   foedus omnium firmissimum. Dial. c. II.

   [1356] Very different from the principle of Hegel: All that is rational
   is real, and all that is real is rational.

   [1357] He calls them achrestoi (useless), Apol. I. 46; with reference
   to the frequent confusion of Christos with chrestos, good. Comp. Apol.
   I. 4: Christianoi heinai kategoroumetha; to de chreston miseisthai ou
   dikaion. Justin knew, however, the true derivation of Christos see
   Apol. II. 6.

   On Tatian see § 131, p. 493-496.

   Tatian of Assyria (110-172) was a pupil of Justin Martyr whom he calls
   a most admirable man ( ), and like him an itinerant Christian
   philosopher; but unlike him he seems to have afterwards wandered to the
   borders of heretical Gnosticism, or at least to an extreme type of
   asceticism. He is charged with having condemned marriage as a
   corruption and denied that Adam was saved, because Paul says: "We all
   die in Adam." He was an independent, vigorous and earnest man, but
   restless, austere, and sarcastic. [1359] 359 In both respects he
   somewhat resembles Tertullian. Before his conversion he had studied
   mythology, history, poetry, and chronology, attended the theatre and
   athletic games, became disgusted with the world, and was led by the
   Hebrew Scriptures to the Christian faith. [1360] 360

   We have from him an apologetic work addressed To the Greeks. [1361] 361
   It was written in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, probably in Rome, and
   shows no traces of heresy. He vindicates Christianity as the
   "philosophy of the barbarians," and exposes the contradictions,
   absurdities, and immoralities of the Greek mythology from actual
   knowledge and with much spirit and acuteness but with vehement contempt
   and bitterness. He proves that Moses and the prophets were older and
   wiser than the Greek philosophers, and gives much information on the
   antiquity of the Jews. Eusebius calls this "the best and most useful of
   his writings," and gives many extracts in his Praeparatio Evangelica.

   The following specimens show his power of ridicule and his radical
   antagonism to Greek mythology and philosophy:

   Ch. 21.--Doctrines of the Christians and Greeks respecting God
   compared.

   We do not act as fools, O Greeks, nor utter idle tales, when we
   announce that God was born in the form of a man. (en ). I call on you
   who reproach us to compare your mythical accounts with our narrations.
   Athene, as they say, took the form of Deiphobus for the sake of Hector,
   and the unshorn Phoebus for the sake of Admetus fed the trailing-footed
   oxen, and the spouse of Zeus came as an old woman to Semélé. But, while
   you treat seriously such things, how can you deride us? Your Asclepios
   died, and he who ravished fifty virgins in one night at Thespiae, lost
   his life by delivering himself to the devouring flame. Prometheus,
   fastened to Caucasus, suffered punishment for his good deeds to men.
   According to you, Zeus is envious, and hides the dream from men,
   wishing their destruction. Wherefore, looking at your own memorials,
   vouchsafe us your approval, though it were only as dealing in legends
   similar to your own. We, however, do not deal in folly, but your
   legends are only idle tales. If you speak of the origin of the gods,
   you also declare them to be mortal. For what reason is Hera now never
   pregnant? Has she grown old? or is there no one to give you
   information? Believe me now, O Greeks, and do not resolve your myths
   and gods into allegory. If you attempt to do this, the divine nature as
   held by you is overthrown by your own selves; for, if the demons with
   you are such as they are said to be, they are worthless as to
   character; or, if regarded as symbols of the powers of nature, they are
   not what they are called. But I cannot be persuaded to pay religious
   homage to the natural elements, nor can I undertake to persuade my
   neighbor. And Metrodorus of Lampsacus, in his treatise concerning
   Homer, has argued very foolishly, turning everything into allegory. For
   he says that neither Hera, nor Athene, nor Zeus are what those persons
   suppose who consecrate to them sacred enclosures and groves, but parts
   of nature and certain arrangements of the elements. Hector also, and
   Achilles, and Agamemnon, and all the Greeks in general, and the
   Barbarians with Helen and Paris, being of the same nature, you will of
   course say are introduced merely for the sake of the machinery of the
   poem, not one of these personages having really existed.

   But these things we have put forth only for argument's sake; for it is
   not allowable even to compare our notions of God with those who are
   wallowing in matter and mud."

   Ch. 25.--Boastings and quarrels of the philosophers.

   What great and wonderful things have your philosophers effected? They
   leave uncovered one of their shoulders; they let their hair grow long;
   they cultivate their beards; their nails are like the claws of wild
   beasts. Though they say that they want nothing, yet, like Proteus [the
   Cynic, Proteus Peregrinus known to us from Lucian], they need a currier
   for their wallet, and a weaver for their mantle, and a woodcutter for
   their staff, and they need the rich [to invite them to banquets], and a
   cook also for their gluttony. O man competing with the dog [cynic
   philosopher], you know not God, and so have turned to the imitation of
   an irrational animal. You cry out in public with an assumption of
   authority, and take upon you to avenge your own self; and if you
   receive nothing, you indulge in abuse, for philosophy is with you the
   art of getting money. You follow the doctrines of Plato, and a disciple
   of Epicurus lifts up his voice to oppose you. Again, you wish to be a
   disciple of Aristotle, and a follower of Democritus rails at you.
   Pythagoras says that he was Euphorbus, and he is the heir of the
   doctrine of Pherecydes, but Aristotle impugns the immortality of the
   soul. You who receive from your predecessors doctrines which clash with
   one another, you the inharmonious, are fighting against the harmonious.
   One of you asserts "that God is body," but I assert that He is without
   body; "that the world is indestructible," but I assert that it is to be
   destroyed; "that a conflagration will take place at various times," but
   I say that it will come to pass once for all; "that Minos and
   Rhadamanthus are judges," but I say that God Himself is Judge; "that
   the soul alone is endowed with immortality," but I say that the flesh
   also is endowed with it. What injury do we inflict upon you, O Greeks?
   Why do you hate those who follow the word of God, as if they were the
   vilest of mankind? It is not we who eat human flesh--they among you who
   assert such a thing have been suborned as false witnesses; it is among
   you that Pelops is made a supper for the gods, although beloved by
   Poseidon; and Kronos devours his children, and Zeus swallows Metis."

   Of great importance for the history of the canon and of exegesis is
   Tatian's Diatessaron or Harmony of the Four Gospels, once widely
   circulated, then lost, but now measurably recovered. [1362] 362
   Theodoret found more than two hundred copies of it in his diocese.
   Ephraem the Syrian wrote a commentary on it which was preserved in an
   Armenian translation by the Mechitarists at Venice, translated into
   Latin by Aucher (1841), and published with a learned introduction by
   Mösinger (1876). From this commentary Zahn has restored the text
   (1881). Since then an Arabic translation of the Diatessaron itself has
   been discovered and published by Ciasca (1888). The Diatessaron begins
   with the Prologue of John (In principio erat Verbum, etc.), follows his
   order of the festivals, assuming a two years' ministry, and makes a
   connected account of the life of Christ from the four Evangelists.
   There is no heretical tendency, except perhaps in the omission of
   Christ's human genealogies in Matthew and Luke, which may have been due
   to the influence of a docetic spirit. This Diatessaron conclusively
   proves the existence and ecclesiastical use of the four Gospels, no

   [1360] He tells his conversion himself, Ad Gr. c. 29 and 30. The
   following passage (29) is striking: "While I was giving my most earnest
   attention to the matter [the discovery of the truth], I happened to
   meet with certain barbaric writings, too old to be compared with the
   opinions of the Greeks, and too divine to be compared with their errors
   and I was led to put faith in these by the unpretending cast of the
   language, the inartificial character of the writers, the foreknowledge
   displayed of future events, the excellent quality of the precepts, and
   the declaration of the government of the universe as centred in one
   Being. And, my soul being taught of God, I discerned that the former
   class of writings lead to condemnation, but that these put an end to
   the slavery that is in the world, and rescue us from a multiplicity of
   rulers and ten thousand tyrants, while they give us, not indeed what we
   had not before received, but what we had received, but were prevented
   by error from retaining."

   § 175. Athenagoras.

   Otto, Vol. VII.; Migne, VI. 890-1023. Am. ed. by W. B. Owen, N. Y.,
   1875.

   Clarisse: De Athenagorae vita, scriptis doctrina (Lugd. Bat. 1819);
   Donaldson, III. 107-178; Harnack, Texte, I. 176 sqq., and his art.
   "Athen." in Herzog2 I. 748-750; Spencer Mansel in Smith and Wace, 1.
   204-207; Renan, Marc-Auréle, 382-386.

   Athenagoras was "a Christian philosopher of Athens," during the reign
   of Marcus Aurelius (A. D., 161-180), but is otherwise entirely unknown
   and not even mentioned by Eusebius, Jerome, and Photius. [1363] 363 His
   philosophy was Platonic, but modified by the prevailing eclecticism of
   his age. He is less original as an apologist than Justin and Tatian,
   but more elegant and classical in style.

   He addressed an Apology or Intercession in behalf of the Christians to
   the Emperors Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. [1364] 364 He reminds the
   rulers that all their subjects are allowed to follow their customs
   without hindrance except the Christians who are vexed, plundered and
   killed on no other pretence than that they bear the name of their Lord
   and Master. We do not object to punishment if we are found guilty, but
   we demand a fair trial. A name is neither good nor bad in itself, but
   becomes good or bad according to the character and deeds under it. We
   are accused of three crimes, atheism, Thyestean banquets (cannibalism),
   Oedipodean connections (incest). Then he goes on to refute these
   charges, especially that of atheism and incest. He does it calmly,
   clearly, eloquently, and conclusively. By a divine law, he says,
   wickedness is ever fighting against virtue. Thus Socrates was condemned
   to death, and thus are stories invented against us. We are so far from
   committing the excesses of which we are accused, that we are not
   permitted to lust after a woman in thought. We are so particular on
   this point that we either do not marry at all, or we marry for the sake
   of children, and only once in the course of our life. Here comes out
   his ascetic tendency which he shares with his age. He even condemns
   second marriage as "decent adultery." The Christians are more humane
   than the heathen, and condemn, as murder, the practices of abortion,
   infanticide, and gladiatorial shows.

   Another treatise under his name, "On the Resurrection of the Dead, is a
   masterly argument drawn from the wisdom, power, and justice of God, as
   well as from the destiny of man, for this doctrine which was especially
   offensive to the Greek mind. It was a discourse actually delivered
   before a philosophical audience. For this reason perhaps he does not
   appeal to the Scriptures.

   AlI historians put a high estimate on Athenagoras. "He writes," says
   Donaldson, "as a man who is determined that the real state of the case
   should be exactly known. He introduces similes, he occasionally has an
   antithesis, he quotes poetry but always he has his main object
   distinctly before his mind, and he neither makes a useless exhibition
   of his own powers, nor distracts the reader by digressions. His Apology
   is the best defence of the Christians produced in that age." Spencer
   Mansel declares him "decidedly superior to most of the Apologists,
   elegant, free from superfluity of language, forcible in style, and
   rising occasionally into great powers of description, and in his
   reasoning remarkable for clearness and cogency."

   Tillemont found traces of Montanism in the condemnation of second
   marriage and the view of prophetic inspiration, but the former was
   common among the Greeks, and the latter was also held by Justin M. and
   others. Athenagoras says of the prophets that they were in an ecstatic
   condition of mind and that the Spirit of God "used them as if a
   flute-player were breathing into his flute." Montanus used the
   comparison of the plectrum and the lyre.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1363] The account of Philippus Sidetes, deacon of Chrysostom, as
   preserved by Nicephorus Callistus, is entirely unreliable. It makes
   Athenagoras the first head of the school of Alexandria under Hadrian,
   and the teacher of Clement of Alex.--a palpable chronological
   blunder--and states that he addressed his Apology to Hadrian and
   Antoninus, which is contradicted by the inscription. But in a fragment
   of Methodius, De Resurrectione, there is a quotation from the Apology
   of Athenagoras (c. 24) with his name attached.

   [1364] Presbeia (embassy) peri Christianon, Legatio (also Supplicatio,
   Intercessio)pro Christianis. Some take the title in its usual sense,
   and assume that Athenagoras really went as a deputation to the emperor.
   The book was often copied in the fifteenth century, and there are
   seventeen MSS. extant; the three best contain also the treatise on the
   Resurrection. Both were edited by Henry Stephens, 1557, and often
   since. The objections against the genuineness are weak and have been
   refuted.

   Theophilus was converted from heathenism by the study of the
   Scriptures, and occupied the episcopal see at Antioch, the sixth from
   the Apostles, during the later part of the reign of Marcus Aurelius. He
   died about a.d. 181. [1365] 365

   His principal work, and the only one which has come down to us, is his
   three books to Autolycus, an educated heathen friend. [1366] 366 His
   main object is to convince him of the falsehood of idolatry, and of the
   truth of Christianity. He evinces extensive knowledge of Grecian
   literature, considerable philosophical talent, and a power of graphic
   and elegant composition. His treatment of the philosophers and poets is
   very severe and contrasts unfavorably with the liberality of Justin
   Martyr. He admits elements of truth in Socrates and Plato, but charges
   them with having stolen the same from the prophets. He thinks that the
   Old Testament already contained all the truths which man requires to
   know. He was the first to use the term "triad" for the holy Trinity,
   and found this mystery already in the words: Let us make man "(Gen.
   1:26); for, says he, "God spoke to no other but to his own Reason and
   his own Wisdom," that is, to the Logos and the Holy Spirit
   hypostatized. [1367] 367 He also first quoted the Gospel of John by
   name, [1368] 368 but it was undoubtedly known and used before by
   Tatian, Athenagoras, Justin, and by the Gnostics, and can be traced as
   far back as 125 within the lifetime of many personal disciples of the
   Apostle. Theophilus describes the Christians as having a sound mind,
   practising self-restraint, preserving marriage with one, keeping
   chastity, expelling injustice, rooting out sin, carrying out
   righteousness as a habit, regulating their conduct by law, being ruled
   by truth, preserving grace and peace, and obeying God as king. They are
   forbidden to visit gladiatorial shows and other public amusements, that
   their eyes and ears may not be defiled. They are commanded to obey
   authorities and to pray for them, but not to worship them.

   The other works of Theophilus, polemical and exegetical, are lost.
   Eusebius mentions a book against Hermogenes, in which he used proofs
   from the Apocalypse of John, another against Marcion and "certain
   catechetical books" ( Gr. ) Jerome mentions in addition commentaries on
   the Proverbs, and on the Gospel, but doubts their genuineness. There
   exists under his name though only in Latin, a sort of exegetical Gospel
   Harmony, which is a later compilation of uncertain date and authorship.

   Notes.

   Jerome is the only ancient writer who mentions a Commentary or
   Commentaries of Theophilus on the Gospel, but adds that they are
   inferior to his other books in elegance and style; thereby indicating a
   doubt as to their genuineness. De Vir ill. 25: La734 "Legi sub nomine
   eius [Theophili] in Evangelium et in Proverbia Salomonis Commentarios,
   (qui mihi cum superiorum voluminum [the works Contra Marcionem, Ad
   Autolycum, and Contra Hermogenem] elegantia et phrasi non videntur
   congruere." He alludes to the Gospel Commentary in two other passages
   (in the Pref. to his Com. on Matthew, and Ep. 121 (ad Algasiam), and
   quotes from it the exposition of the parable of the unjust steward
   (Luke 16:1 sqq.). Eusebius may possibly have included the book in the
   katechetika biblia which he ascribes to Theophilus.

   A Latin Version of this Commentary was first published (from MSS. not
   indicated and since lost) by Marg. de la Bigne in Sacrae, Bibliothecae
   Patrum, Paris 1576, Tom. V. Col. 169-196; also by Otto in the Corp.
   Apol. VIII. 278-324, and with learned notes by Zahn in the second vol.
   of his Forschungen zur Gesch. des neutest. Kanons (1883), p. 31-85. The
   Commentary begins with an explanation of the symbolical import of the
   four Gospels as follows: "Quatuor evangelia quatuor animalibus figurata
   Jesum Christum demonstrant. Matthaeus enim salvatorem nostrum natum
   passumque homini comparavit. Marcus leonis gerens figuram a solitudine
   incipit dicens: ' Vox clamantis in deserto: parate viam Domini,' sane
   qui regnat invictus. Joannes habet similitudinem aquilae, quod ab imis
   alta petiverit; ait enim: 'In principio erat Verbum, et verbum erat
   apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; hoc erat in principio apud Deum; vel
   quia Christus resurgens volavit ad coelos. Lucas vituli speciem gestat,
   ad instar salvator noster est immolatus, vel quod sacerdotii figurat
   officium." The position of Luke as the fourth is very peculiar and
   speaks for great antiquity. Then follows a brief exposition of the
   genealogy of Christ by Matthew with the remark that Matthew traces the
   origin "per reges," Luke "per sacerdotes." The first book of the
   Commentary is chiefly devoted to Matthew, the second and third to Luke,
   the fourth to John. It concludes with an ingenious allegory
   representing Christ as a gardener (who appeared to Mary Magdalene, John
   20:15), and the church as his garden full of rich flowers) as follows
   (see Zahn, p. 85): "Hortus Domini est ecclesia catholica, in qua sunt
   rosae martyrum, lilia virginum, violae viduarum, hedera coniugum; nam
   illa, quae aestimabat eum hortulanum esse significabat scilicet eum
   plantantem diversis virtutibus credentium vitam. Amen."

   Dr. Zahn, in his recent monograph (1883), which abounds in rare
   patristic learning, vindicates this Commentary to Theophilus of Antioch
   and dates the translation from the third century. If so, we would have
   here a work of great apologetic as well as exegetical importance,
   especially for the history of the canon and the text; for Theophilus
   stood midway between Justin Martyr and Irenaeus and would be the oldest
   Christian exegete. But a Nicene or post-Nicene development of theology
   and church organization is clearly indicated by the familiar use of
   such terms as regnum Christi catholicum, catholica doctrina, catholicum
   dogma, sacerdos, peccatum originale, monachi, saeculares, pagani. The
   suspicion of a later date is confirmed by the discovery of a MS. of
   this commentary in Brussels, with an anonymous preface which declares
   it to be a compilation. Harnack, who made this discovery, ably refutes
   the conclusions of Zahn, and tries to prove that the commentary
   ascribed to Theophilus is a Latin work by an anonymous author of the
   fifth or sixth century (470-520). Zahn (1884) defends in part his
   former position against Harnack, but admits the weight of the argument
   furnished by the Brussels MS. Hauck holds that the commentary was
   written after a.d. 200, but was used by Jerome. Bornemann successfully
   defends Harnack's view against Zahn and Hauck, and puts the work
   between 450 and 700.

   Melito, bishop of Sardis, [1369] 369 the capital of Lydia, was a
   shining light among the churches of Asia Minor in the third quarter of
   the second century. Polycrates of Ephesus, in his epistle to bishop
   Victor of Rome (d. 195), calls him a "eunuch who, in his whole conduct,
   was full of the Holy Ghost, and sleeps in Sardis awaiting the
   episcopate from heaven (or visitation, ,) on the day of the
   resurrection." The term "eunuch" no doubt refers to voluntary celibacy
   for the kingdom of God (Matt. 19:12). [1370] 370 He was also esteemed
   as a prophet. He wrote a book on prophecy, probably against the
   pseudo-prophecy of the Montanists; but his relation to Montanism is not
   clear. He took an active part in the paschal and other controversies
   which agitated the churches of Asia Minor. He was among the chief
   supporters of the Quartadeciman practice which was afterwards condemned
   as schismatic and heretical. This may be a reason why his writings fell
   into oblivion. Otherwise he was quite orthodox according to the
   standard of his age, and a strong believer in the divinity of Christ,
   as is evident from one of the Syrian fragments (see below).

   Melito was a man of brilliant mind and a most prolific author.
   Tertullian speaks of his elegant and eloquent genius. [1371] 371
   Eusebius enumerates no less than eighteen or twenty works from his pen,
   covering a great variety of topics, but known to us now only by name.
   [1372] 372 He gives three valuable extracts. There must have been an
   uncommon literary fertility in Asia Minor after the middle of the
   second century. [1373] 373 The Apology of Melito was addressed to
   Marcus Aurelius, and written probably at the outbreak of the violent
   persecutions in 177, which, however, were of a local or provincial
   character, and not sanctioned by the general government. He remarks
   that Nero and Domitian were the only imperial persecutors, and
   expresses the hope that, Aurelius, if properly informed, would
   interfere in behalf of the innocent Christians. In a passage preserved
   in the "Paschal Chronicle" he says: "We are not worshipers of senseless
   stones, but adore one only God, who is before all and over all, and His
   Christ truly God the Word before all ages."

   A Syriac Apology bearing his name [1374] 374 was discovered by Tattam,
   with other Syrian MSS. in the convents of the Nitrian desert (1843),
   and published by Cureton and Pitra (1855). But it contains none of the
   passages quoted by Eusebius, and is more an attack upon idolatry than a
   defense of Christianity, but may nevertheless be a work of Melito under
   an erroneous title.

   To Melito we owe the first Christian list of the Hebrew Scriptures. It
   agrees with the Jewish and the Protestant canon, and omits the
   Apocrypha. The books of Esther and Nehemiah are also omitted, but may
   be included in Esdras. The expressions "the Old Books," "the Books of
   the Old Covenant," imply that the church at that time had a canon of
   the New Covenant. Melito made a visit to Palestine to seek information
   on the Jewish canon.

   He wrote a commentary on the Apocalypse, and a "Key" ( ), probably to
   the Scriptures. [1375] 375

   The loss of this and of his books "on the Church" and "on the Lord's
   Day" are perhaps to be regretted most.

   Among the Syriac fragments of Melito published by Cureton is one from a
   work "On Faith," which contains a remarkable christological creed, an
   eloquent expansion of the Regula Fidei. [1376] 376 The Lord Jesus
   Christ is acknowledged as the perfect Reason, the Word of God; who was
   begotten before the light; who was Creator with the Father; who was the
   Fashioner of man; who was all things in all; Patriarch among the
   patriarchs, Law in the law, Chief Priest among the priests, King among
   the kings, Prophet among the prophets, Archangel among the angels; He
   piloted Noah, conducted Abraham, was bound with Isaac, exiled with
   Jacob, was Captain with Moses; He foretold his own sufferings in David
   and the prophets; He was incarnate in the Virgin; worshipped by the
   Magi; He healed the lame, gave sight to the blind, was rejected by the
   people, condemned by Pilate, hanged upon the tree, buried in the earth,
   rose from the dead and appeared to the apostles, ascended to heaven; He
   is the Rest of the departed, the Recoverer of the lost, the Light of
   the blind, the Refuge of the afflicted, the Bridegroom of the Church,
   the Charioteer of the cherubim, the Captain of angels; God who is of
   God, the Son of the Father, the King for ever and ever.

   [1369] This is the English spelling. The Germans and French spell
   Sardes (Gr. hai Sar'deis, but also Sardis in Herodotus).

   [1370] Renan thinks of an act of self-mutilation (in L'église chrét.
   436): "Comme plus tard Origène, il voulut que sa chasteté fût en
   quelque sorte matériellement constatée." But St. John, too, is called
   spado by Tertullian (De Monog. 17) and eunuchus by Jerome (In Es. c.
   56). Athenagoras uses eunouchia for male continence, Leg. c. 33: to en
   partheneia kai en eunouchia meinai, in virginitate et eunuchi statu
   manere.

   [1371] Elegans et declamatorium ingenium, " in his lost book on
   Ecstasis, quoted by Jerome, De Vir. ill. 24. Harnack draws a comparison
   between Melito and Tertullian; they resembled each other in the variety
   of topics on which they wrote, and in eloquence, but not in elegance of
   style.

   [1372] Eusebius (IV. 26) mentions first his Apology for the faith
   addressed to the emperor of the Romans, and then the following: "Two
   works On the Passover, and those On the Conduct of Life and the
   Prophets (to peri politeias kai propheton, perhaps two separate books,
   perhaps kai for ton), one On the Church, and another discourse On the
   Lord's Day (peri kuriakes), one also On the Nature (peri phuseos , al.
   Faith, pisteos)of Man, and another On his Formation (peri plaseos) a
   work On the Subjection of the Senses to Faith [ ho peri hupakoes
   pisteos aistheterion, which Rufinus changes into two books 'de
   obedientia fidei; de sensibus,' so also Nicephorus]. Besides these, a
   treatise On the Soul, the Body, and the Mind. A dissertation also, On
   Baptism; one also On Truth and Faith, and [probably another on] the
   Generation of Christ. His discourse On Prophecy, and that On
   Hospitality. A treatise called The Key (he kleis), his works On the,
   Devil, and The Revelation of John. The treatise On God Incarnate (peri
   ensomatou theou, comp. ensomatosis =incarnation), and last of all, the
   discourse (biblidion) addressed to Antonine."He then add, ; still
   another book called Eklogai, and containing extracts from the Old
   Testament. Some of these titles may indicate two distinct books, as ta
   peri tou diabolou, kai tes apokalupseos Ioannou.. So Rufinus and Jerome
   understood this title. See Heinichen's notes. Other works were ascribed
   to him by later writers, as On the Incarnation of Christ (peri
   sarkoseos Christou ), On the Cross, On Faith, and two decidedly
   spurious works, De Passione S. Joannis, and De Transitu b. Mariae.

   [1373] Comp. Euseb. IV. 21, 25. Renan says (p. 192): "Jamais peut-être
   le christianisme n'a plus écrit que durant le IIesiécle en Asie. La
   culture littéraire était extrémement répandue dans cette province;
   l'art d'écrire y était fort commun, et le christianisme en profitait.
   La littérature des Pères d l'Église commencait. Les siécles suivants ne
   dépassèrent pas ces premiers essais de l'éloquence chrétienne; mais, au
   point de vue de l'orthodoxie, les livres de ces Pères du IIesiécle
   offraient plus d'une pierre el'achoppement. La lecture en devint
   suspecte; on les copia de moins en moins, et ainsi presque tons ces
   beaux écrits disparurent, pour faire place aux écrivains classiques,
   postérieurs au concile de Nicée, écrivains plus corrects comme
   doctrine, mais, en général, bien moins originaux que ceux du Ilesiècle.

   [1374] Under the heading, "The oration of Melito the Philosopher, held
   before Antonintus Caesar, and he spoke [?] to Caesar that he might know
   God, and he showed him the way of truth, and began to speak as
   follows." Ewald (in the "Gött. Gel. Anz." 1856, p. 655 sqq.) and Renan
   (M. Aur. 184, note) suggest that it is no apology, but Melito's tract
   peri aletheias as this word very often occurs. Jacobi, Otto, and
   Harnack ascribe it to a different author, probably from Syria.

   [1375] A Latin work under the title Melitonis Clavis Sanctae Scripturae
   was mentioned by Labbé in 1653 as preserved in the library of Clermont
   College, and was at last, after much trouble, recovered in Strassburg
   and elsewhere, and published by Cardinal Pitra in the Spicilegium
   Solesm. 1855 (Tom. II. and III.). But, unfortunately, it turned out to
   be no translation of Melito's kleisat all, but a mediaeval glossary of
   mystic interpretation of the Scriptures compiled from Gregory I. and
   other Latin fathers. This was conclusively proven by Steitz in the "
   Studien und Kritiken "for 1857, p. 584-596. Renan assents (p. 181,
   note): "L'ouvrage latin que om Pitra a publié comme étant la Cle de
   Meliton, est une compilation de passages des Pères latins pouvant
   servir à l'explication allégorique des écritures qui figure pour la
   première fois dans la Bible de Théodulphe."

   § 178. Apolinarius of Hierapolis. Miltiades.

   Claudius Apolinarius, [1377] 377 bishop of Hierapolis in Phrygia, a
   successor of Papias, was a very active apologetic and polemic writer
   about a.d. 160-180. He took a leading part in the Montanist and Paschal
   controversies. Eusebius puts him with Melito of Sardis among the
   orthodox writers of the second century, and mentions four of his "many
   works" as known to him, but since lost, namely an "Apology" addressed
   to Marcus Aurelius (before 174). "Five books against the Greeks" "Two
   books on Truth." "Two books against the Jews." He also notices his
   later books "Against the heresy of the Phrygians" (the Montanists),
   about 172. [1378] 378

   Apolinarius opposed the Quartodeciman observance of Easter, which
   Melito defended. [1379] 379 Jerome mentions his familiarity with
   heathen literature, but numbers him among the Chiliasts. [1380] 380 The
   latter is doubtful on account of his opposition to Montanism. Photius
   praises his style. He is enrolled among the saints. [1381] 381

   Miltiades was another Christian Apologist of the later half of the
   second century whose writings are entirely lost. Eusebius mentions
   among them an "Apology" addressed to the rulers of the world, a
   treatise "against the Greeks," and another "against the Jews;" but be
   gives no extracts. [1382] 382 Tertullian places him between Justin
   Martyr and Irenaeus. [1383] 383
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1377] This is the spelling of the ancient Greek authors who refer to
   him. Latin writers usually spell his name Apollinaris or Apollinarius.
   There are several noted persons of this name: 1) the legendary St.
   Apollinaris, bishop of Ravenna (50-78?), who followed St. Peter from
   Antioch to Rome, was sent by him to Ravenna, performed miracles, died a
   martyr, and gave name to a magnificent basilica built in the sixth
   century. See Acta Sanct. Jul. V. 344. 2) Apollinarus the Elder,
   presbyter at Laodicea in Syria (not in Phrygia), an able classical
   scholar and poet, about the middle of the fourth century. 3)
   Apollinaris the Younger, son of the former, and bishop of Laodicea
   between 362 and 380, who with his father composed Christian classics to
   replace the heathen classics under the reign of Julian, and afterwards
   originated the christological heresy which is named after him. See my
   article in Smith and Wace I. 134 sq.

   [1378] H. E. IV. 27; repeated by Jerome, De Viris ill. 26. Two extracts
   of a work not mentioned by Eusebius are preserved in the Chron. Pasch.
   Copies of three of his apologetic books, pros Hellenas peri eusebeias,
   peri aletheias , are mentioned by Photius. The last two are probably
   identical, as they are connected by kai. See the fragments in Routh, I.
   159-174. Comp. Donaldson III. 243; Harnack, Texte, I. 232-239, and
   Smith and Wace I. 132.

   [1379] See above, p. 214 sq., and Chron. Pasch. 1. 13.

   [1380] De Vir. ill. 18; Com. in Ezech. c. 36. In the latter place
   Jerome mentions Irenaeus as the first, and Apollinaris as the last, of
   the Greek Chiliasts (" ut Graecos nominem, et primum extremumque
   conjugam, Iren. et Ap."); but this is a palpable error, for Barnabas
   and Papias were Chiliasts before Irenaeus; Methodius and Nepos long
   after Apolinarius. Perhaps he meant Apollinaris of Laodicea, in Syria.

   either honorably= rhetor or philosophus (See Otto and Salmon), or with
   an implied censure ("mit einem üblen Nebegeschmack, " as Harnack
   thinks). The relation of Miltiades to Montanism is quite obscure, but
   probably he was an opponent.

   Donaldson, III. 179-181.

   Under the name of the "philosopher" Hermias (Hermeias or Hermias)
   otherwise entirely unknown to us, we have a "Mockery of Heathen
   Philosophers," which, with the light arms of wit and sarcasm, endeavors
   to prove from the history of philosophy, by exposing the contradictions
   of the various systems, the truth of Paul's declaration, that the
   wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. He derives the false
   philosophy from the demons. He first takes up the conflicting heathen
   notions about the soul, and then about the origin of the world, and
   ridicules them. The following is a specimen from the discussion of the
   first topic:

   "I confess I am vexed by the reflux of things. For now I am immortal,
   and I rejoice; but now again I become mortal, and I weep; but
   straightway I am dissolved into atoms. I become water, and I become
   air: I become fire: then after a little I am neither air nor fire: one
   makes me a wild beast, one makes me a fish. Again, then, I have
   dolphins for my brothers. But when I see myself, I fear my body, and I
   no longer know how to call it, whether man, or dog, or wolf, or bull,
   or bird, or serpent, or dragon, or chimaera. I am changed by the
   philosophers into all the wild beasts, into those that live on land and
   on water, into those that are winged, many-shaped, wild, tame,
   speechless, and gifted with speech, rational and irrational. I swim,
   fly, creep, run, sit; and there is Empedocles too, who makes me a
   bush."

   The work is small and unimportant. [1384] 384 Some put it down to the
   third or fourth century; but the writer calls himself a "philosopher"
   (though be misrepresents his profession), has in view a situation of
   the church like that under Marcus Aurelius, and presents many points of
   resemblance with the older Apologists and with Lucian who likewise
   ridiculed the philosophers with keen wit, but from the infidel heathen
   standpoint. Hence we may well assign him to the later part of the
   second century.

   Quellen, etc., III. 345-348.

   The orthodoxy of Hegesippus has been denied by the Tübingen critics,
   Baur, Schwegler, and, more moderately by Hilgenfeld, but defended by
   Dorner, Donaldson, Nösgen, Weizsäcker, Caspari and Milligan.

   Contemporary with the Apologists, though not of their class, were
   Hegesippus (d. about 180), and Dionysius of Corinth (about 170).

   Hegesippus was an orthodox Jewish Christian [1385] 385 and lived during
   the reigns of Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus Aurelius. He travelled
   extensively through Syria, Greece, and Italy, and was in Rome during
   the episcopate of Anicetus. He collected "Memorials" [1386] 386 of the
   apostolic and post-apostolic churches. He used written sources and oral
   traditions. Unfortunately this work which still existed in the
   sixteenth century, [1387] 387 is lost, but may yet be recovered. It is
   usually regarded as a sort of church history, the first written after
   the Acts of St. Luke. This would make Hegesippus rather than Eusebius
   "the father of church history." But it seems to have been only a
   collection of reminiscences of travel without regard to chronological
   order (else the account of the martyrdom of James would have been put
   in the first instead of the fifth book.) He was an antiquarian rather
   than a historian. His chief object was to prove the purity and
   catholicity of the church against the Gnostic heretics and sects.

   Eusebius has preserved his reports on the martyrdom of St. James the
   Just, Simeon of Jerusalem, Domitian's inquiry for the descendants of
   David and the relatives of Jesus, the rise of heresies, the episcopal
   succession, and the preservation of the orthodox doctrine in Corinth
   and Rome. These scraps of history command attention for their
   antiquity; but they must be received with critical caution. They reveal
   a strongly Jewish type of piety, like that of James, but by no means
   Judaizing heresy. He was not an Ebionite, nor even a Nazarene, but
   decidedly catholic. There is no trace of his insisting on circumcision
   or the observance of the law as necessary to salvation. His use of "the
   Gospel according to the Hebrews" implies no heretical bias. He derived
   all the heresies and schisms from Judaism. He laid great stress on the
   regular apostolic succession of bishops. In ever city he set himself to
   inquire for two things: purity of doctrine and the unbroken succession
   of teachers from the times of the apostles. The former depended in his
   view on the latter. The result of his investigation was satisfactory in
   both respects. He found in every apostolic church the faith maintained.
   "The church of Corinth," he says, "continued in the true faith, until
   Primus was bishop there [the predecessor of Dionysius], with whom I had
   familiar intercourse, as I passed many days at Corinth, when I was
   about sailing to Rome, during which time we were mutually refreshed in
   the true doctrine. After coming to Rome, I stayed with Anicetus, whose
   deacon was Eleutherus. After Anicetus, Soter succeeded, and after him
   Eleutherus. In every succession, however, and in every city, the
   doctrine prevails according to what is announced by the law and the
   prophets and the Lord." [1388] 388 He gives an account of the heretical
   corruption which proceeded from the unbelieving Jews, from Thebuthis
   and Simon Magus and Cleobius and Dositheus, and other unknown or
   forgotten names, but "while the sacred choir of the apostles still
   lived, the church was undefiled and pure, like a virgin, until the age
   of Trajan, when those impious errors which had so long crept in
   darkness ventured forth without shame into open daylight." [1389] 389
   He felt perfectly at home in the Catholic church of his day which had
   descended from, or rather never yet ascended the lofty mountain-height
   of apostolic knowledge and freedom. And as Hegesippus was satisfied
   with the orthodoxy of the Western churches, so Eusebius was satisfied
   with the orthodoxy of Hegesippus, and nowhere intimates a doubt.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1385] Eusebius (iv. 22) expressly calls him "a convert from the
   Hebrews, " and this is confirmed by the strongly Jewish coloring of his
   account of James, quoted in full, vol. I. 276 sq. He was probably from
   Palestine.

   as an argument against the Pastoral and other apostolic epistles which
   warn against the Gnostic heresy, but it clearly teaches that its open
   manifestation under Trajan was preceded by its secret working as far
   back as Simon Magus. Hegesippus, therefore, only confirms the N. T.
   allusions, which likewise imply a distinction between present
   beginnings and future developments of error.

   § 181. Dionysius of Corinth.

   Euseb.: H. E. II. 25; III. 4; IV. 21, 23. Hieron.: De Vir. ill. 27.

   Routh: Rel. S. I. 177-184 (the fragments), and 185-201 (the
   annotations). Includes Pinytus Cretensis and his Ep. ad Dion. (Eus. IV.
   23).

   Donaldson III. 214-220. Salmon in Smith and Wace II. 848 sq.

   Dionysius was bishop of Corinth (probably the successor of Primus) in
   the third quarter of the second century, till about a.d. 170. He was a
   famous person in his day, distinguished for zeal, moderation, and a
   catholic and peaceful spirit. He wrote a number of pastoral letters to
   the congregations of Lacedaemon, Athens, Nicomedia, Rome, Gortyna in
   Crete, and other cities. One is addressed to Chrysophora, "a most
   faithful sister." They are all lost, with the exception of a summary of
   their contents given by Eusebius, and four fragments of the letter to
   Soter and the Roman church. They would no doubt shed much light on the
   spiritual life of the church. Eusebius says of him that he "imparted
   freely not only to his own people, but to others abroad also, the
   blessings of his divine (or inspired) industry." [1390] 390 His letters
   were read in the churches.

   Such active correspondence promoted catholic unity and gave strength
   and comfort in persecution from without and heretical corruption
   within. The bishop is usually mentioned with honor, but the letters are
   addressed to the church; and even the Roman bishop Soter, like his
   predecessor Clement, addressed his own letter in the name of the Roman
   church to the church of Corinth. Dionysius writes to the Roman
   Christians: "To-day we have passed the Lord's holy day, in which we
   have read your epistle. [1391] 391 In reading it we shall always have
   our minds stored with admonition, as we shall also from that written to
   us before by Clement." He speaks very highly of the liberality of the
   church of Rome in aiding foreign brethren condemned to the mines, and
   sending contributions to every city.

   Dionysius is honored as a martyr in the Greek, as a confessor in the
   Latin church.

   in Zahn's art. in Herzog2.

   A full and satisfactory monograph of Irenaeus and his age is still a
   desideratum.

   Almost simultaneously with the apology against false religions without
   arose the polemic literature against the heresies, or various forms of
   pseudo-Christianity, especially the Gnostic; and upon this was formed
   the dogmatic theology of the church. At the head of the old catholic
   controversialists stand Irenaeus and his disciple Hippolytus, both of
   Greek education, but both belonging, in their ecclesiastical relations
   and labors, to the West.

   Asia Minor, the scene of the last labors of St. John, produced a
   luminous succession of divines and confessors who in the first three
   quarters of the second century reflected the light of the setting sun
   of the apostolic age, and may be called the pupils of St. John. Among
   them were Polycarp of Smyrna, Papias of Hierapolis, Apolinarius of
   Hierapolis, Melito of Sardis, and others less known but honorably
   mentioned in the letter of Polycrates of Ephesus to bishop Victor of
   Rome (A. D. 190).

   The last and greatest representative of this school is Irenaeus, the
   first among the fathers properly so called, and one of the chief
   architects of the Catholic system of doctrine.

   I. Life and Character. Little is known of Irenaeus except what we may
   infer from his writings. He sprang from Asia Minor, probably from
   Smyrna, where he spent his youth. [1392] 392 He was born between A.D.
   115 and 125. [1393] 393 He enjoyed the instruction of the venerable
   Polycarp of Smyrna, the pupil of John, and of other "Elders," who were
   mediate or immediate disciples of the apostles. The spirit of his
   preceptor passed over to him. "What I heard from him" says he, "that
   wrote I not on paper, but in my heart, and by the grace of God I
   constantly bring it afresh to mind." Perhaps he also accompanied
   Polycarp on his journey to Rome in connexion with the Easter
   controversy (154). He went as a missionary to Southern Gaul which seems
   to have derived her Christianity from Asia Minor. During the
   persecution in Lugdunum and Vienne under Marcus Aurelius (177), he was
   a presbyter there and witnessed the horrible cruelties which the
   infuriated heathen populace practiced upon his brethren. [1394] 394 The
   aged and venerable bishop, Pothinus, fell a victim, and the presbyter
   took the post of danger, but was spared for important work.

   He was sent by the Gallican confessors to the Roman bishop Eleutherus
   (who ruled a.d. 177-190), as a mediator in the Montanistic disputes.
   [1395] 395

   After the martyrdom of Pothinus he was elected bishop of Lyons (178),
   and labored there with zeal and success, by tongue and pen, for the
   restoration of the heavily visited church, for the spread of
   Christianity in Gaul, and for the defence and development of its
   doctrines. He thus combined a vast missionary and literary activity. If
   we are to trust the account of Gregory of Tours, he converted almost
   the whole population of Lyons and sent notable missionaries to other
   parts of pagan France.

   After the year 190 we lose sight of Irenaeus. Jerome speaks of him as
   having flourished in the reign of Commodus, i.e., between 180 and 192.
   He is reported by later tradition (since the fourth or fifth century)
   to have died a martyr in the persecution under Septimus Severus, a.d.
   202, but the silence of Tertullian, Hippolytus, Eusebius, and
   Epiphanius makes this point extremely doubtful. He was buried under the
   altar of the church of St. John in Lyons. [1396] 396 This city became
   again famous in church history in the twelfth century as the birthplace
   of the Waldensian martyr church, the Pauperes de Lugduno.

   II. His Character and Position. Irenaeus is the leading representative
   of catholic Christianity in the last quarter of the second century, the
   champion of orthodoxy against Gnostic heresy, and the mediator between
   the Eastern and Western churches. He united a learned Greek education
   and philosophical penetration with practical wisdom and moderation. He
   is neither very original nor brilliant, but eminently sound and
   judicious. His individuality is not strongly marked, but almost lost in
   his catholicity. He modestly disclaims elegance and eloquence, and says
   that he had to struggle in his daily administrations with the barbarous
   Celtic dialect of Southern Gaul; but he nevertheless handles the Greek
   with great skill on the most abstruse subjects. [1397] 397 He is
   familiar with Greek poets (Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Sophocles) and
   philosophers (Thales, Pythagoras, Plato), whom he occasionally cites.
   He is perfectly at home in the Greek Bible and in the early Christian
   writers, as Clement of Rome, Polycarp, Papias, Ignatius, Hermas, Justin
   M., and Tatian. [1398] 398 His position gives him additional weight,
   for he is linked by two long lives, that of his teacher and
   grand-teacher, to the fountain head of Christianity. We plainly trace
   in him the influence of the spirit of Polycarp and John. "The true way
   to God," says he, in opposition to the false Gnosis, "is love. It is
   better to be willing to know nothing but Jesus Christ the crucified,
   than to fall into ungodliness through over-curious questions and paltry
   subtleties." We may trace in him also the strong influence of the
   anthropology and soteriology of Paul. But he makes more account than
   either John or Paul of the outward visible church, the episcopal
   succession, and the sacraments; and his whole conception of
   Christianity is predominantly legalistic. Herein we see the catholic
   churchliness which so strongly set in during the second century.

   Irenaeus is an enemy of all error and schism, and, on the whole, the
   most orthodox of the ante-Nicene fathers. [1399] 399 We must, however,
   except his eschatology. Here, with Papias and most of his
   contemporaries, be maintains the pre-millennarian views which were
   subsequently abandoned as Jewish dreams by the catholic church. While
   laboring hard for the spread and defense of the church on earth, he is
   still "gazing up into heaven," like the men of Galilee, anxiously
   waiting for the return of the Lord and the establishment of his
   kingdom. He is also strangely mistaken about the age of Jesus from a
   false inference of the question of the Jews, John 8:57.

   Irenaeus is the first among patristic writers who makes full use of the
   New Testament. The Apostolic Fathers reëcho the oral traditions; the
   Apologists are content with quoting the Old Testament prophets and the
   Lord's own words in the Gospels as proof of divine revelation; but
   Irenaeus showed the unity of the Old and New Testaments in opposition
   to the Gnostic separation, and made use of the four Gospels and nearly
   all Epistles in opposition to the mutilated canon of Marcion. [1400]
   400

   With all his zeal for pure and sound doctrine, Irenaeus was liberal
   towards subordinate differences, and remonstrated with the bishop of
   Rome for his unapostolic efforts to force an outward uniformity in
   respect to the time and manner of celebrating Easter. [1401] 401 We may
   almost call him a forerunner of Gallicanism in its protest against
   ultramontane despotism. "The apostles have ordained," says he in the
   third fragment, which appears to refer to that controversy, "that we
   make conscience with no one of food and drink, or of particular feasts,
   new moons, and sabbaths. Whence, then, controversies; whence schisms?
   We keep feasts but with the leaven of wickedness and deceit, rending
   asunder the church of God, and we observe the outward, to the neglect
   of the higher, faith and love." He showed the same moderation in the
   Montanistic troubles. He was true to his name Peaceful ( Gr. ) and to
   his spiritual ancestry.

   III. His Writings. (1.) The most important work of Irenaeus is his
   Refutation of Gnosticism, in five books. [1402] 402 It was composed
   during the pontificate of Eleutherus, that is between the years 177 and
   190. [1403] 403 It is at once the polemic theological masterpiece of
   the ante-Nicene age, and the richest mine of information respecting
   Gnosticism and the church doctrine of that age. It contains a complete
   system of Christian divinity, but enveloped in polemical smoke, which
   makes it very difficult and tedious reading. The work was written at
   the request of a friend who wished to be informed of the Valentinian
   heresy and to be furnished with arguments against it. Valentinus and
   Marcion had taught in Rome about a.d. 140, and their doctrines had
   spread to the south of France. The first book contains a minute
   exposition of the gorgeous speculations of Valentinus and a general
   view of the other Gnostic sects; the second an exposure of the
   unreasonableness and contradictions of these heresies; especially the
   notions of the Demiurge as distinct from the Creator, of the Aeons, the
   Pleroma and Kenoma, the emanations, the fall of Achamoth, the formation
   of the lower world of matter, the sufferings of the Sophia, the
   difference between the three classes of men, the Somatici, Psychici,
   and Pneumatici. The last three books refute Gnosticism from the Holy
   Scripture and Christian tradition which teach the same thing; for the
   same gospel which was first orally preached and transmitted was
   subsequently committed to writing and faithfully preserved in all the
   apostolic churches through the regular succession of the bishops and
   elders; and this apostolic tradition insures at the same time the
   correct interpretation of Scripture against heretical perversion. To
   the ever-shifting and contradictory opinions of the heretics Irenaeus
   opposes the unchanging faith of the catholic church which is based on
   the Scriptures and tradition, and compacted together by the episcopal
   organization. It is the same argument which Bellarmin, Bossuet, and
   Möhler use against divided and distracted Protestantism, but
   Protestantism differs as much from old Gnosticism as the New Testament
   from the apocryphal Gospels, and as sound, sober, practical sense
   differs from mystical and transcendental nonsense. The fifth book
   dwells on the resurrection of the body and the millennial kingdom.
   Irenaeus derived his information from the writings of Valentinus and
   Marcion and their disciples, and from Justin Martyr's Syntagma. [1404]
   404

   The interpretation of Scripture is generally sound and sober, and
   contrasts favorably with the fantastic distortions of the Gnostics. He
   had a glimpse of a theory of inspiration which does justice to the
   human factor. He attributes the irregularities of Paul's style to his
   rapidity of discourse and the impetus of the Spirit which is in him.
   [1405] 405

   (2.) The Epistle to Florinus, of which Eusebius has preserved an
   interesting and important fragment, treated On the Unity of God, and
   the Origin of Evil. [1406] 406 It was written probably after the work
   against heresies, and as late as 190. [1407] 407 Florinus was an older
   friend and fellow-student of lrenaeus and for some time presbyter in
   the church of Rome, but was deposed on account of his apostasy to the
   Gnostic heresy. Irenaeus reminded him very touchingly of their common
   studies at the feet of the patriarchal Polycarp, when he held some
   position at the royal court (probably during Hadrian's sojourn at
   Smyrna), and tried to bring him back to the faith of his youth, but we
   do not know with what effect.

   (3.) On the Ogdoad [1408] 408 against the Valentinian system of Aeons,
   in which the number eight figures prominently with a mystic meaning.
   Eusebius says that it was written on account of Florinus, and that he
   found in it "a most delightful remark," as follows: "I adjure thee,
   whoever thou art, that transcribest this book, by our Lord Jesus Christ
   and by his gracious appearance, when he shall come to judge the quick
   and the dead, to compare what thou hast copied, and to correct it by
   this original manuscript, from which thou hast carefully transcribed.
   And that thou also copy this adjuration, and insert it in the copy."
   The carelessness of transcribers in those days is the chief cause of
   the variations in the text of the Greek Testament which abounded
   already in the second century. Irenaeus himself mentions a remarkable
   difference of reading in the mystic number of Antichrist (666 and 616),
   on which the historic interpretation of the book depends (Rev. 13:18).

   (4.) A book On Schism, addressed to Blastus who was the head of the
   Roman Montanists and also a Quartodeciman. [1409] 409 It referred
   probably to the Montanist troubles in a conciliatory spirit.

   (5.) Eusebius mentions [1410] 410 several other treatises which are
   entirely lost, as Against the Greeks (or On Knowledge), On Apostolic
   Preaching, a Book on Various Disputes, [1411] 411 and on the Wisdom of
   Solomon. In the Syriac fragments some other lost works are mentioned.

   (6.) Irenaeus is probably the author of that touching account of the
   persecution of 177, which the churches of Lyons and Vienne sent to the
   churches in Asia Minor and Phrygia, and which Eusebius has in great
   part preserved. He was an eyewitness of the cruel scene, yet his name
   is not mentioned, which would well agree with his modesty; the document
   breathes his mild Christian spirit, reveals his aversion to Gnosticism,
   his indulgence for Montanism, his expectation of the near approach of
   Antichrist. It is certainly one of the purest and most precious remains
   of ante-Nicene literature and fully equal, yea superior to the
   "Martyrdom of Polycarp," because free from superstitious relic-worship.
   [1412] 412

   (7.) Finally, we must mention four more Greek fragments of Irenaeus,
   which Pfaff discovered at Turin in 1715, and first published. Their
   genuineness has been called in question by some Roman divines, chiefly
   for doctrinal reasons. [1413] 413 The first treats of the true
   knowledge, [1414] 414 which consists not in the solution of subtle
   questions, but in divine wisdom and the imitation of Christ; the second
   is on the eucharist; [1415] 415 the third, on the duty of toleration in
   subordinate points of difference, with reference to the Paschal
   controversies; [1416] 416 the fourth, on the object of the incarnation,
   which is stated to be the purging away of sin and the annihilation of
   all evil. [1417] 417
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1392] Harvey derives from the alleged familiarity of Irenaeus with
   Hebrew and the Syriac Peshito the conclusion that he was a Syrian, but
   Ropes denies the premise and defends the usual view of his Greek
   nationality. See also Caspari, Quellen zur Gesch. des Taufsymb III. 343
   sq.

   [1393] The change of Polycarp's martyrdom from 166 to 155 necessitates
   a corresponding change in the chronology of Irenaeus, his pupil, who
   moreover says that the Apocalypse of John was written at the end of
   Domitian's reign (d. 96), "almost within our age" (schedon epi tes
   hemeteras geneas, Adv. Haer. v. 30, 3). Zahn (in Herzog) decides for
   115, Lipsius (in Smith and Wace) for 130 or 125, as the date of his
   birth. Dodwell favored the year 97 or 98; Grabe 108, Tillemont and
   Lightfoot 120, Leimbach, Hilgenfeld, and Ropes 126, Oscar von Gebhardt
   126-130, Harvey 130, Massuet, Dupin, Böhringer, Kling 140 (quite too
   late), Ziegler 142-147 (impossible). The late date is derived from a
   mistaken understanding of the reference to the old age of Polycarp
   (panu geraleosbut this, as Zahn and Lightfoot remark, refers to the
   time of his martyrdom, not the time of his acquaintance with Irenaeus),
   and from the assumption of the wrong date of his martyrdom (166 instead
   of 155 or 156). The term prote helikia, "first age, " which Irenaeus
   uses of the time of his acquaintance with Polycarp (III. 3, § 4; comp.
   Euseb. H. E. IV. 14), admits of an extension from boyhood to youth and
   early manhood; for Irenaeus counts five ages of a man's life (Adv. Haer
   I. 22, § 4; 24, § 4--infans, parvullus, puer, juvenis, senior), and
   includes the thirtieth year in the youth, by calling Christ a juvenis
   at the time of his baptism. Hence Zahn and Lipsius conclude that the
   prote helikiaof Irenaeus's connection with Polycarp is not the age of
   childhood, but of early young-manhood."Als junger Mann, " says
   Zahn."etwa zwischen dem 18. und 35. Lebensjahre, will Ir. sich des
   Umqangs mit Pol erfreut haben." Another hint is given in the letter of
   Iren. to Florinus, in which be reminds him of their mutual acquaintance
   with Polycarp in lower Asia in their youth when Florinus was at "the
   royal court" (aule basilike). Lightfoot conjectures that this means by
   anticipation the court of Antoninus Pius, when he was proconsul of Asia
   Minor, a.d. 136, two years before he ascended the imperial throne
   (Waddington, Fastes des provinces Asiatiques, p. 714). But Zahn
   reasserts the more natural explanation of Dodwell, that the court of
   Emperor Hadrian is meant, who twice visited Asia Minor as emperor
   between the years 122 and 130.

   by the Calvinists in 1562 has been abundantly refuted." Encycl. Brit.,
   ninth ed XIII. 273.

   [1397] This is evident from the very passage in which he makes that
   apology to his friend (Adv. Haer., Pref. § 3): "Thou wilt not require
   from me, who dwell among the Celts (en Keltois), and am accustomed for
   the most part to use a barbarous dialect (barbaron dialekton)any skill
   in discourse which I have not learned, nor any power of composition
   which I have not practised, nor any beauty of style nor persuasiveness
   of which I know nothing. But thou wilt accept lovingly what I write
   lovingly to thee in simplicity, truthfully, and in my own way (haplos
   kai alethos kai idiotikos); whilst thou thyself (as being more
   competent than I am) wilt expand those ideas of which I send thee, as
   it were, only the seeds and principles (spermata kai archas); and in
   the comprehensiveness of thine understanding, wilt develop to their
   full extent the points on which I briefly touch, so as to set with
   power before thy companions those things which I have uttered in
   weakness."Jerome praises the style of Irenaeus as "doctissmus et
   eloquentissimus," and Massuet (Diss. II. § 51) adds that his " Greek
   text as far as preserved, is elegant, polished, and grave."

   [1398] Harvey claims for him also Hebrew and Syriac scholarship; but
   this is disputed.

   [1399] Bishop Lightfoot ("Contemp. Rev." May, 1875, p. 827) says that
   Irenaeus If on all the most important points conforms to the standard
   which has satisfied the Christian church ever since."Renan (p. 341)
   calls him "le modèle de l'homme ecclésiastique accompli."

   aireseis).The Greek original of the work, together with the five books
   of Hegesippus, was still in existence in the sixteenth century, and may
   yet be recovered. See Zahn in Brieger's " Zeitschrift für K.
   Gesch."1877, p. 288-291. But so far we only have fragments of it
   preserved in Hippolytus (Philosophumena), Eusebius, Theodoret, and
   especially in Epiphanius (Haer. XXXl.c. 9-33). We have, however, the
   entire work in a slavishly literal translation into barbarous Latin,
   crowded with Grecisms, but for this very reason very valuable. Three
   MSS. of the Latin version survive, the oldest is the Codex
   Claromontanus of the tenth or eleventh century. This and the Arundel
   MS. are now in England (see a description in Harvey's Preface, i. viii.
   sqq. with facsimiles). Besides, we have now fragments of a Syrian
   version, derived from the Nitrian MSS. of the British Museum, and
   fragments of an Armenian translation, published by Pitra in his
   Spicilegium Solesmense vol. I. (1852), both incorporated in Harvey's
   edition, vol. II. 431-469. They agree closely with the Latin Version.
   An attempt to restore the Greek text from the Latin, for the better
   understanding of it, has been made on the first four chapters of the
   third book by H. W. J. Thiersch (" Stud. u. Kritiken," 1842). Semler's
   objections to the genuineness have been so thoroughly refuted by Chr.
   G. F. Walch (De authentia libiorum Irenaei, 1774), that Möhler and
   Stieren might have spared themselves the trouble.

   [1403] Eleutherus is mentioned, III. 3, 3, as then occupying the see of
   Rome. Lipsius fixes the composition between a.d. 180 and 185, Harvey
   between 182 and 188 (L.CLVIII).

   [1407] Leimbach and Lightfoot regard the letter as one of the earliest
   writings of Irenaeus, but Lipsius (p. 263) puts it down to about a.d.
   190 or after, on the ground of the Syriac fragment, from a letter of
   Irenaeus to Victor of Rome (190-202) concerning "Florinus, a presbyter
   and partisan of the error of Valentinus, who published an abominable
   book." See the fragment in Harvey, II. 457. Eusebius makes no mention
   of such a letter, but there is no good reason to doubt its genuineness.

   litterature chrétienne au Ilesiecle." He attributes it to Irenaeus;
   Harvey denies it to him; Donaldson leaves the authorship in doubt.

   I. Life Of Hippolytus. This famous person has lived three lives, a real
   one in the third century as an opponent of the popes of his day, a
   fictitious one in the middle ages as a canonized saint, and a literary
   one in the nineteenth century after the discovery of his long lost
   works against heresies. He was undoubtedly one of the most learned and
   eminent scholars and theologians of his time. The Roman church placed
   him in the number of her saints and martyrs, little suspecting that he
   would come forward in the nineteenth century as an accuser against her.
   But the statements of the ancients respecting him are very obscure and
   confused. Certain it is, that he received a thorough Grecian education,
   and, as he himself says, in a fragment preserved by Photius, heard the
   discourses of Irenaeus (in Lyons or in Rome). His public life falls in
   the end of the second century and the first three decennaries of the
   third (about 198 to 236), and he belongs to the western church, though
   he may have been, like Irenaeus, of Oriental extraction. At all events
   he wrote all his books in Greek. [1418] 418

   Eusebius is the first who mentions him, and he calls him indefinitely,
   bishop, and a contemporary of Origen and Beryl of Bostra; he evidently
   did not know where he was bishop, but he gives a list of his works
   which he saw (probably in the library of Caesarea). Jerome gives a more
   complete list of his writings, but no more definite information as to
   his see, although he was well acquainted with Rome and Pope Damasus. He
   calls him martyr, and couples him with the Roman senator Apollonius. An
   old catalogue of the popes, the Catalogus Liberianus (about a.d. 354),
   states that a "presbyter" Hippolytus was banished, together with the
   Roman bishop Pontianus, about 235, to the unhealthy island of Sardinia,
   and that the bodies of both were deposited on the same day (Aug. 13),
   Pontianus in the cemetery of Callistus, Hippolytus on the Via Tiburtina
   (where his statue was discovered in 1551). The translation of Pontianus
   was effected by Pope Fabianus about 236 or 237. From this statement we
   would infer that Hippolytus died in the mines of Sardinia and was thus
   counted a martyr, like all those confessors who died in prison. He may,
   however, have returned and suffered martyrdom elsewhere. The next
   account we have is from the Spanish poet Prudentius who wrote in the
   beginning of the fifth century. He represents Hippolytus in poetic
   description as a Roman presbyter (therein agreeing with the Liberian
   Catalogue) who belonged to the Novatian party [1419] 419(which,
   however, arose several years after the death of Hippolytus), but in the
   prospect of death regretted the schism exhorted his numerous followers
   to return into the bosom of the catholic church, and then, in bitter
   allusion to his name and to the mythical Hippolytus, the son of
   Theseus, was bound by the feet to a team of wild horses and dragged to
   death over stock and stone. He puts into his mouth his last words:
   "These steeds drag my limbs after them; drag Thou, O Christ, my soul to
   Thyself." [1420] 420 He places the scene of his martyrdom at Ostia or
   Portus where the Prefect of Rome happened to be at that time who
   condemned him for his Christian profession. Prudentius also saw the
   subterranean grave-chapel in Rome and a picture which represented his
   martyrdom (perhaps intended originally for the mythological
   Hippolytus). [1421] 421 But as no such church is found in the early
   lists of Roman churches, it may have been the church of St. Lawrence,
   the famous gridiron-martyr, which adjoined the tomb of Hippolytus.
   Notwithstanding the chronological error about the Novatian schism and
   the extreme improbability of such a horrible death under Roman laws and
   customs, there is an important element of truth in this legend, namely
   the schismatic position of Hippolytus which suits the Philosophumena,
   perhaps also his connection with Portus. The later tradition of the
   catholic church (from the middle of the seventh century) makes him
   bishop of Portus Romanus (now Porto) which lies at the Northern mouth
   of the Tiber, opposite Ostia, about fifteen miles from Rome. [1422] 422
   The Greek writers, not strictly distinguishing the city from the
   surrounding country, call him usually bishop of Rome. [1423] 423

   These are the vague and conflicting traditions, amounting to this that
   Hippolytus was an eminent presbyter or bishop in Rome or the vicinity,
   in the early part of the third century, that he wrote many learned
   works and died a martyr in Sardinia or Ostia. So the matter stood when
   a discovery in the sixteenth century shed new light on this mysterious
   person.

   In the year 1551, a much mutilated marble statue, now in the Lateran
   Museum, was exhumed at Rome near the basilica of St. Lawrence on the
   Via Tiburtina (the road to Tivoli). This statue is not mentioned indeed
   by Prudentius, and was perhaps originally designed for an entirely
   different purpose, possibly for a Roman senator; but it is at all
   events very ancient, probably from the middle of the third century.
   [1424] 424 It represents a venerable man clothed with the Greek pallium
   and Roman toga, seated in a bishop's chair. On the back of the cathedra
   are engraved in uncial letters the paschal cycle, or easter-table of
   Hippolytus for seven series of sixteen years, beginning with the first
   year of Alexander Severus (222), and a list of writings, presumably
   written by the person whom the statue represents. Among these writings
   is named a work On the All, which is mentioned in the tenth book of the
   Philosophumena as a product of the writer. [1425] 425 This furnishes
   the key to the authorship of that important work.

   Much more important is the recent discovery and publication (in 1851)
   of one of his works themselves, and that no doubt the most valuable of
   them all, viz. the Philosophumena, or Refutation of all Heresies. It is
   now almost universally acknowledged that this work comes not from
   Origen, who never was a bishop, nor from the antimontanistic and
   antichiliastic presbyter Caius, but from Hippolytus; because, among
   other reasons, the author, in accordance with the Hippolytus-statue,
   himself refers to a work On the All, as his own, and because Hippolytus
   is declared by the fathers to have written a work Adversus omnes
   Haereses. [1426] 426 The entire matter of the work, too, agrees with
   the scattered statements of antiquity respecting his ecclesiastical
   position; and at the same time places that position in a much clearer
   light, and gives us a better understanding of those statements. [1427]
   427 The author of the Philosophumena appears as one of the most
   prominent of the clergy in or near Rome in the beginning of the third
   century; probably a bishop, since he reckons himself among the
   successors of the apostles and the guardians of the doctrine of the
   church. He took an active part in all the doctrinal and ritual
   controversies of his time, but severely opposed the Roman bishops
   Zephyrinus (202-218) and Callistus (218-223), on account of their
   Patripassian leanings, and their loose penitential discipline. The
   latter especially, who had given public offence by his former mode of
   life, he attacked without mercy and not without passion. He was,
   therefore, if not exactly a schismatical counter-pope (as Döllinger
   supposes), yet the head of a disaffected and schismatic party, orthodox
   in doctrine, rigoristic in discipline, and thus very nearly allied to
   the Montanists before him, and to the later schism of Novatian. It is
   for this reason the more remarkable, that we have no account respecting
   the subsequent course of this movement, except the later unreliable
   tradition, that Hippolytus finally returned into the bosom of the
   catholic church, and expiated his schism by martyrdom, either in the
   mines of Sardinia or near Rome (A. D. 235, or rather 236, under the
   persecuting emperor Maximinus the Thracian).

   II. His Writings. Hippolytus was the most learned divine and the most
   voluminous writer of the Roman church in the third century; in fact the
   first great scholar of that church, though like his teacher, Irenaeus,
   he used the Greek language exclusively. This fact, together with his
   polemic attitude to the Roman bishops of his day, accounts for the
   early disappearance of his works from the remembrance of that church.
   He is not so much an original, productive author, as a learned and
   skilful compiler. In the philosophical parts of his Philosophumena he
   borrows largely from Sextus Empiricus, word for word, without
   acknowledgment; and in the theological part from Irenaeus. In doctrine
   he agrees, for the most part, with Irenaeus, even to his chiliasm, but
   is not his equal in discernment, depth, and moderation. He repudiates
   philosophy, almost with Tertullian's vehemence, as the source of all
   heresies; yet he employs it to establish his own views. On the subject
   of the trinity he assails Monarchianism, and advocates the hypostasian
   theory with a zeal which brought down upon him the charge of ditheism.
   His disciplinary principles are rigoristic and ascetic. In this respect
   also he is akin to Tertullian, though he places the Montanists, like
   the Quartodecimanians, but with only a brief notice, among the
   heretics. His style is vigorous, but careless and turgid. Caspari calls
   Hippolytus "the Roman Origen." This is true as regards learning and
   independence, but Origen had more genius and moderation.

   The principal work of Hippolytus is the Philosophumena or Refutation of
   all Heresies. It is, next to the treatise of Irenaeus, the most
   instructive and important polemical production of the ante-Nicene
   church, and sheds much new light, not only upon the ancient heresies,
   and the development of the church doctrine, but also upon the history
   of philosophy and the condition of the Roman church in the beginning of
   the third century. It furthermore affords valuable testimony to the
   genuineness of the Gospel of John, both from the mouth of the author
   himself, and through his quotations from the much earlier Gnostic
   Basilides, who was a later contemporary of John (about a.d. 125). The
   composition falls some years after the death of Callistus, between the
   years 223 and 235. The first of the ten books gives an outline of the
   heathen philosophies which he regards as the sources of all heresies;
   hence the title Philosophumena which answers the first four books, but
   not the last six. It is not in the Athos-MS., but was formerly known
   and incorporated in the works of Origen. The second and third books,
   which are wanting, treated probably of the heathen mysteries, and
   mathematical and astrological theories. The fourth is occupied likewise
   with the heathen astrology and magic, which must have exercised great
   influence, particularly in Rome. In the fifth book the author comes to
   his proper theme, the refutation of all the heresies from the times of
   the apostles to his own. He takes up thirty-two in all, most of which,
   however, are merely different branches of Gnosticism and Ebionism. He
   simply states the heretical opinions from lost writings, without
   introducing his own reflection, and refers them to the Greek
   philosophy, mysticism, and magic, thinking them sufficiently refuted by
   being traced to those heathen sources. The ninth book, in refuting the
   doctrine of the Noëtians and Callistians, makes remarkable disclosures
   of events in the Roman church. He represents Pope Zephyrinus as a weak
   and ignorant man who gave aid and comfort to the Patripassian heresy,
   and his successor Callistus, as a shrewd and cunning manager who was
   once a slave, then a dishonest banker, and became a bankrupt and
   convict, but worked himself into the good graces of Zephyrinus and
   after his death obtained the object of his ambition, the papal chair,
   taught heresy and ruined the discipline by extreme leniency to
   offenders. Here the author shows himself a violent partizan, and must
   be used with caution.

   The tenth book, made use of by Theodoret, contains a brief
   recapitulation and the author's own confession of faith, as a positive
   refutation of the heresies. The following is the most important part
   relating to Christ:

   "This Word (Logos) the Father sent forth in these last days no longer
   to speak by a prophet, nor willing that He should be only guessed at
   from obscure preaching, but bidding Him be manifested face to face, in
   order that the world should reverence Him when it beheld Him, not
   giving His commands in the person of a prophet, nor alarming the soul
   by an angel, but Himself present who had spoken.

   "Him we know to have received a body from the Virgin and to have
   refashioned the old man by a new creation, and to have passed in His
   life through every age, in order that He might be a law to every age,
   and by His presence exhibit His own humanity as a pattern to all men,
   [1428] 428 and thus convince man that God made nothing evil, and that
   man possesses free will, having in himself the power of volition or
   non-volition, and being able to do both. Him we know to have been a man
   of the same nature with ourselves.

   "For, if He were not of the same nature, He would in vain exhort us to
   imitate our Master. For if that man was of another nature, why does He
   enjoin the same duties on me who am weak? And how can He be good and
   just? But that He might be shown to be the same as we, He underwent
   toil and consented to suffer hunger and thirst, and rested in sleep,
   and did not refuse His passion, and became obedient unto death, and
   manifested His resurrection, having consecrated in all these things His
   own humanity, as first fruits, in order that thou when suffering mayest
   not despair, acknowledging thyself a man of like nature and waiting for
   the appearance of what thou gavest to Him. [1429] 429

   "Such is the true doctrine concerning the Deity, O ye Greeks and
   Barbarians, Chaldaeans and Assyrians, Egyptians and Africans, Indians
   and Ethiopians, Celts, and ye warlike Latins, and all ye inhabitants of
   Europe, Asia, and Africa, whom I exhort, being a disciple of the
   man-loving Word and myself a lover of men ( ). Come ye and learn from
   us, who is the true God, and what is His well-ordered workmanship, not
   heeding the sophistry of artificial speeches, nor the vain professions
   of plagiarist heretics, but the grave simplicity of unadorned truth. By
   this knowledge ye will escape the coming curse of the judgment of fire,
   and the dark rayless aspect of Tartarus, never illuminated by the voice
   of the Word ....

   "Therefore, O men, persist not in your enmity, nor hesitate to retrace
   your steps. For Christ is the God who is over all ( , comp. Rom. 9:5),
   who commanded men to wash away sin [in baptism], [1430] 430
   regenerating the old man, having called him His image from the
   beginning, showing by a figure His love to thee. If thou obeyest His
   holy commandment and becomest an imitator in goodness of Him who is
   good, thou wilt become like Him, being honored by Him. For God has a
   need and craving for thee, having made thee divine for His glory."

   Hippolytus wrote a large number of other works, exegetical,
   chronological, polemical, and homiletical, all in Greek, which are
   mostly lost, although considerable fragments remain. He prepared the
   first continuous and detailed commentaries on several books of the
   Scriptures, as the Hexaëmeron (used by Ambrose), on Exodus, Psalms,
   Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the larger prophets (especially Daniel),
   Zechariah, also on Matthew, Luke, and the Apocalypse. He pursued in
   exegesis the allegorical method, like Origen, which suited the taste of
   his age.

   Among, his polemical works was one Against Thirty-two Heresies,
   different from the Philosophumena, and described by Photius as a
   "little book," [1431] 431 and as a synopsis of lectures which
   Hippolytus heard from Irenaeus. It must have been written in his early
   youth. It began with the heresy of Dositheus and ended with that of
   Noëtus. [1432] 432 His treatise Against Noëtus which is still
   preserved, presupposes previous sections, and formed probably the
   concluding part of that synopsis. [1433] 433 If not, it must have been
   the conclusion of a special work against the Monarchian heretics,
   [1434] 434 but no such work is mentioned.

   The book On the Universe [1435] 435 was directed against Platonism. It
   made all things consist of the four elements, earth, air, fire, and
   water. Man is formed of all four elements, his soul, of air. But the
   most important part of this book is a description of Hades, as an abode
   under ground where the souls of the departed are detained until the day
   of judgment: the righteous in a place of light and happiness called
   Abraham's Bosom; the wicked in a place of darkness and misery; the two
   regions being separated by a great gulf. The entrance is guarded by an
   archangel. On the judgment day the bodies of the righteous will rise
   renewed and glorified, the bodies of the wicked with all the diseases
   of their earthly life for everlasting punishment. This description
   agrees substantially with the eschatology of Justin Martyr, Irenaeus,
   and Tertullian. [1436] 436

   The anonymous work called The Little Labyrinth, [1437] 437 mentioned by
   Eusebius and Theodoret as directed against the rationalistic heresy of
   Artemon, is ascribed by some to Hippolytus, by others to Caius. But The
   Labyrinth mentioned by Photius as a work of Caius is different and
   identical with the tenth book of the Philosophumena, which begins with
   the words, "The labyrinth of heresies." [1438] 438

   The lost tract on the Charismata [1439] 439 dealt probably with the
   Montanistic claims to continued prophecy. Others make it a collection
   of apostolical canons.

   The book on Antichrist [1440] 440 which has been almost entirely
   recovered by Gudius, represents Antichrist as the complete counterfeit
   of Christ, explains Daniel's four kingdoms as the Babylonian, Median,
   Grecian, and Roman, and the apocalyptic number of the beast as meaning
   , i.e., heathen Rome. This is one of the three interpretations given by
   Irenaeus who, however, preferred Teitan.

   In a commentary on the Apocalypse [1441] 441 he gives another
   interpretation of the number, namely Dantialos (probably because
   Antichrist was to descend from the tribe of Dan). The woman in the
   twelfth chapter is the church; the sun with which she is clothed, is
   our Lord; the moon, John the Baptist; the twelve stars, the twelve
   apostles; the two wings on which she was to fly, hope and love.
   Armageddon is the valley of Jehoshaphat. The five kings (17:13) are
   Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Darius, Alexander, and his four successors; the
   sixth is the Roman empire, the seventh will be Antichrist. In his
   commentary on Daniel he fixes the consummation at a.d. 500, or A. M.
   6000, on the assumption that Christ appeared in the year of the world
   5500, and that a sixth millennium must yet be completed before the
   beginning of the millennial Sabbath, which is prefigured by the divine
   rest after creation. This view, in connection with his relation to
   Irenaeus, and the omission of chiliasm from his list of heresies, makes
   it tolerably certain that he was himself a chiliast, although he put
   off the millennium to the sixth century after Christ. [1442] 442

   We conclude this section with an account of a visit of Pope Alexander
   III. to the shrine of St. Hippolytus in the church of St. Denis in
   1159, to which his bones were transferred from Rome under Charlemagne.
   [1443] 443 "On the threshold of one of the chapels the Pope paused to
   ask, whose relics it contained. 'Those of St. Hippolytus,' was the
   answer. 'Non credo, non credo,' replied the infallible authority, 'the
   bones of St. Hippolytus were never removed from the holy city.' But St.
   Hippolytus, whose dry bones apparently had as little reverence for the
   spiritual progeny of Zephyrinus and Callistus as the ancient bishop's
   tongue and pen had manifested towards these saints themselves, was so
   very angry that be rumbled his bones inside the reliquary with a noise
   like thunder. To what lengths he might have gone if rattling had not
   sufficed we dare not conjecture. But the Pope, falling on his knees,
   exclaimed in terror, I believe, O my Lord Hippolytus, I believe, pray
   be quiet.' And he built an altar of marble there to appease the
   disquieted saint."

   Notes.

   The questions concerning the literary works of Hippolytus, and
   especially his ecclesiastical status are not yet sufficiently solved.
   We add a few additional observations.

   I. The List of Books on the back of the Hippolytus-statue has been
   discussed by Fabricius, Cave, Döllinger, Wordsworth, and Volkmar. See
   the three pictures of the statue with the inscriptions on both sides in
   Fabricius, I. 36-38, and a facsimile of the book titles in the
   frontispiece of Wordsworth's work. It is mutilated and reads--with the
   conjectural supplements in brackets and a translation--as follows

   [pros tous Iouda ious.

   Against the Jews.

   [Peri parthe] nias.

   On Virginity.

   [Or, perhaps, eis paroimias]

   [Or, On the Proverbs.]

   [eis tous ps] almous.

   [apologia] huper tou kata Ioannen

   Apology of the Gospel according to John,

   Peri tou agathou, kai pothen to kakon

   Concerning the good, and the origin of evil.

   Comp. on this list Fabricius I. 79-89; Wordsworth p. 233-240; Volkmar,
   p. 2 sqq.

   Eusebius and Jerome give also lists of the works of Hippolytus, some
   being the same, some different, and among the latter both mention one
   Against Heresies, which is probably identical with the Philosophumena.
   On the Canon Pasch. of Hippol. see the tables in Fabricius, I. 137-140.

   II. Was Hippolytus a bishop, and where?

   Hippolytus does not call himself a bishop, nor a "bishop of Rome," but
   assumes episcopal authority, and describes himself in the preface to
   the first book as "a successor of the Apostles, a partaker with them in
   the same grace and principal sacerdocy (archierateia), and doctorship,
   and as numbered among the guardians of the church." Such language is
   scarcely applicable to a mere presbyter. He also exercised the power of
   excommunication on certain followers of the Pope Callistus. But where
   was his bishopric? This is to this day a point in dispute.

   (1.) He was bishop of Portus, the seaport of Rome. This is the
   traditional opinion in the Roman church since the seventh century, and
   is advocated by Ruggieri (De Portuensi S. Hippolyti, episcopi et
   martyris, Sede, Rom. 1771), Simon de Magistris (Acta Martyrum ad Ostia
   Tiberina, etc. Rom. 1795), Baron Bunsen, Dean Milman, and especially by
   Bishop Wordsworth. In the oldest accounts, however, he is represented
   as a Roman "presbyter." Bunsen combined the two views on the unproved
   assumption that already at that early period the Roman suburban
   bishops, called cardinales episcopi, were at the same time members of
   the Roman presbytery. In opposition to this Dr. Döllinger maintains
   that there was no bishop in Portus before the year 313 or 314; that
   Hippolytus considered himself the rightful bishop of Rome, and that he
   could not be simultaneously a member of the Roman presbytery and bishop
   of Portus. But his chief argument is that from silence which bears with
   equal force against his own theory. It is true that the first bishop of
   Portus on record appears at the Synod of Arles, 314, where he signed
   himself Gregorius episcopus de loco qui est in Portu Romano. The
   episcopal see of Ostia was older, and its occupant had (according to
   St. Augustin) always the privilege of consecrating the bishop of Rome.
   But it is quite possible that Ostia and Portus which were only divided
   by an island at the mouth of the Tiber formed at first one diocese.
   Prudentius locates the martyrdom of Hippolytus at Ostia or Portus (both
   are mentioned in his poem). Moreover Portus was a more important place
   than Döllinger will admit. The harbor whence the city derived its name
   Portus (also Portus Ostien Portus Urbis, Portus Romae) was constructed
   by the Emperor Claudius (perhaps Augustus, hence Portus Augusti),
   enlarged by Nero and improved by Trajan (hence Portus Trajani), and was
   the landing place of Ignatius on his voyage to Rome (Martyr. Ign. c. 6:
   tou kaloumenou Portou) where he met Christian brethren. Constantine
   surrounded it with strong walls and towers. Ostia may have been much
   more important as a commercial emporium and naval station (see Smith's
   Dict. of Gr. and Rom. Geogr. vol. II 501-504); but Cavalier de Rossi,
   in the Bulletino di Archeol., 1866, p. 37 (as quoted by Wordsworth, p.
   264, secd ed.), proves from 13 inscriptions that "the site and name of
   Portus are celebrated in the records of the primitive [?] church," and
   that "the name is more frequently commemorated than that of Ostia." The
   close connection of Portus with Rome would easily account for the
   residence of Hippolytus at Rome and for his designation as Roman
   bishop. In later times the seven suburban bishops of the vicinity of
   Rome were the suffragans of the Pope and consecrated him. Finally, as
   the harbor of a large metropolis attracts strangers from every nation
   and tongue, Hippolytus might with propriety be called "bishop of the
   nations" (episkopos hethnon). We conclude then that the
   Portus-hypothesis is not impossible, though it cannot be proven.

   (2.) He was bishop of the Arabian Portus Romanus, now Aden on the Red
   Sea. This was the opinion of Stephen Le Moyne (1685), adopted by Cave,
   Tillemont, and Basnage, but now universally given up as a baseless
   conjecture, which rests on a misapprehension of Euseb. VI. 20, where
   Hippolytus accidentally collocated with Beryllus, bishop of Bostra in
   Arabia. Adan is nowhere mentioned as an episcopal see, and our
   Hippolytus belonged to the West, although he may have been of eastern
   origin, like Irenaeus.

   (3.) Rome. Hippolytus was no less than the first Anti-Pope and claimed
   to be the legitimate bishop of Rome. This is the theory of Döllinger,
   derived from the Philosophumena and defended with much learning and
   acumen. The author of the Philosophumena was undoubtedly a resident of
   Rome, claims episcopal dignity, never recognized Callistus as bishop,
   but treated him merely as the head of a heretical school (didaskaleion)
   or sect, calls his adherents "Callistians," some of whom he had
   excommunicated, but admits that Callistus had aspired to the episcopal
   throne and "imagined himself to have obtained" the object of his
   ambition after the death of Zephyrinus, and that his school formed the
   majority and claimed to be the catholic church Callistus on his part
   charged Hippolytus, on account of his view of the independent
   personality of the Logos, with the heresy of ditheism (a charge which
   stung him to the quick), and probably proceeded to excommunication. All
   this looks towards an open schism. This would explain the fact that
   Hippolytus was acknowledged in Rome only as a presbyter, while in the
   East he was widely known as bishop, and even as bishop of Rome. Dr.
   Döllinger assumes that the schism continued to the pontificate of
   Pontianus, the successor of Callistus, was the cause of the banishment
   of the two rival bishops to the pestilential island of Sardinia (in
   235), and brought to a close by their resignation and reconciliation;
   hence their bones were brought back to Rome and solemnly deposited on
   the same day. Their death in exile was counted equivalent to martyrdom.
   Dr. Caspari of Christiania who has shed much light on the writings of
   Hippolytus, likewise believes that the difficulty between Hippolytus
   and Callistus resulted in an open schism and mutual excommunication (l.
   c. III. 330). Langen (Gesch. der röm. Kirche, Bonn. 1881, p. 229) is
   inclined to accept Döllinger's conclusion as at least probable.

   This theory is plausible and almost forced upon us by the
   Philosophumena, but without any solid support outside of that polemical
   work. History is absolutely silent about an Anti-Pope before
   Novatianus, who appeared fifteen years after the death of Hippolytus
   and shook the whole church by his schism (251), although he was far
   less conspicuous as a scholar and writer. A schism extending through
   three pontificates (for Hippolytus opposed Zephyrinus as well as
   Callistus) could not be hidden and so soon be forgotten, especially by
   Rome which has a long memory of injuries done to the chair of St. Peter
   and looks upon rebellion against authority as the greatest sin. The
   name of Hippolytus is not found in any list of Popes and Anti-Popes,
   Greek or Roman, while that of Callistus occurs in all. Even Jerome who
   spent over twenty years from about 350 to 372, and afterwards four more
   years in Rome and was intimate with Pope Damasus, knew nothing of the
   see of Hippolytus, although he knew some of his writings. It seems
   incredible that an Anti-Pope should ever have been canonized by Rome as
   a saint and martyr. It is much easier to conceive that the divines of
   the distant East were mistaken. The oldest authority which Döllinger
   adduces for the designation "bishop of Rome," that of Presbyter
   Eustratius of Constantinople about a.d. 582 (see p. 84), is not much
   older than the designation of Hippolytus as bishop of Portus, and of no
   more critical value.

   (4.) Dr. Salmon offers a modification of the Döllinger-hypothesis by
   assuming that Hippolytus was a sort of independent bishop of a
   Greek-speaking congregation in Rome. He thus explains the enigmatical
   expression ethnon episkopos,which Photius applies to Caius, but which
   probably belongs to Hippolytus. But history knows nothing of two
   independent and legitimate bishops in the city of Rome. Moreover there
   still remains the difficulty that Hippolytus notwithstanding his open
   resistance rose afterwards to such high honors in the papal church. We
   can only offer the following considerations as a partial solution:
   first, that he wrote in Greek which died out in Rome, so that his books
   became unknown; secondly, that aside from those attacks he did, like
   the schismatic Tertullian, eminent service to the church by his
   learning and championship of orthodoxy and churchly piety; and lastly,
   that be was believed (as we learn from Prudentius) to have repented of
   his schism and, like Cyprian, wiped out his sin by his martyrdom.

   III. But no matter whether Hippolytus was bishop or presbyter in Rome
   or Portus, he stands out an irrefutable witness against the claims of
   an infallible papacy which was entirely unknown in the third century.
   No wonder that Roman divines of the nineteenth century (with the
   exception of Döllinger who seventeen years after he wrote his book on
   Hippolytus seceded from Rome in consequence of the Vatican decree of
   infallibility) deny his authorship of this to them most obnoxious book.
   The Abbé Cruice ascribes it to Caius or Tertullian, the Jesuit
   Armellini to Novatian, and de Rossi (1866) hesitatingly to Tertullian,
   who, however, was no resident of Rome, but of Carthage. Cardinal Newman
   declares it "simply incredible" that a man so singularly honored as St.
   Hippolytus should be the author of "that malignant libel on his
   contemporary popes," who did not scruple "in set words to call Pope
   Zephyrinus a weak and venal dunce, and Pope Callistus a sacrilegious
   swindler, an infamous convict, and an heresiarch ex cathedra." (Tracts,
   Theological and Ecclesiastical, 1874, p. 222, quoted by Plummer, p.
   xiv. and 340.) But he offers no solution, nor can he. Dogma versus
   history is as unavailing as the pope's bull against the comet. Nor is
   Hippolytus, or whoever wrote that "malignant libel "alone in his
   position. The most eminent ante-Nicene fathers, and the very ones who
   laid the foundations of the catholic system, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and
   Cyprian (not to speak of Origen, and of Novatian, the Anti-Pope),
   protested on various grounds against Rome. And it is a remarkable fact
   that the learned Dr. Döllinger who, in 1853, so ably defended the Roman
   see against the charges of Hippolytus should, in 1870, have assumed a
   position not unlike that of Hippolytus, against the error of papal
   infallibility.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1418] Dr. Caspari (III. 351 note 153) thinks it probable that
   Hippolytus came from the East to Rome in very early youth, and grew up
   there as a member, and afterwards officer of the Greek part of the
   Roman congregation. Lipsius (p. 40 sqq.) supposes that Hippolytus was a
   native of Asia Minor, and a pupil there of Irenaeus in 170. But this is
   refuted by Harnack and Caspari (p. 409)

   [1419] He calls it schisma Novati, instead of Novatiani. The two names
   are often confounded, especially by Greek writers including Eusebius.

   [1420] Ultima vox autdita senis venerabilis haec est. "Hi rapiant
   artus, tu rape, Christe, animam."

   [1421] No. xi. of the Peristephanon Liber. Plummer, in Append. C. to
   Döllinger, p. 345-35l, gives the poem in full (246 lines) from
   Dressel's text (1860). Baronius charged Prudentius with confounding
   three different Hippolytis and transferring the martyrdom of
   Hippolytus, the Roman officer, guard, and disciple of St. Lawrence,
   upon the bishop of that name. Döllinger severely analyses the legend of
   Prudentius, and derives it from a picture of a martyr torn to pieces by
   horses, which may have existed near the church of the martyr St.
   Lawrence (p. 58).

   [1422] So first the Paschal Chronicle, and Anastasius.

   [1423] Salmon says: 'Of the fragments collected in De Lagardes edition
   the majority are entitled merely of 'Hippolytus,' or 'of Hippolytus,
   bishop and martyr,' but about twenty describe him as 'bishop of Rome,'
   and only three place him elsewhere. The earliest author who can be
   named as so describing him is Apollinaris in the fourth century ....
   Hippol. likewise appears as pope and bishop of Rome in the Greek
   menologies, and is also honored with the same title by the Syrian,
   Coptic, and Abyssinian churches."See the authorities in Döllinger.

   [1424] The reasons for this early age are: (1) The artistic character
   of the statue, which ante-dates the decline of art, which began with
   Constantine. (2) The paschal cycle, which gives the list of the paschal
   full moons accurately for the years 217-223, but for the next eight
   years wrongly, so that the table after that date became useless, and
   hence must have been written soon after 222. (3) The Greek language of
   the inscription, which nearly died out in Rome in the fourth century,
   and gave way to the Latin as the language of the Roman church. Dr.
   Salmon fixes the date of the erection of the statue at 235, very
   shortly after the banishment of Hippolytus. A cast of the
   Hippolytus-statue is in the library of the Union Theol. Seminary in New
   York, procured from Berlin through Professor Piper.

   [1425] Peri tou pantos. See the list of books in the notes.

   [1426] On the chair of the statue, it is true, the Philosophumena is
   not mentioned, and cannot be concealed under the title Pros Hellenas,
   which is connected by kai with the work against Plato. But this silence
   is easily accounted for, partly from the greater rarity of the book,
   partly from its offensive opposition to two Roman popes.

   [1427] The authorship of Hippolytus is proved or conceded by Bunsen,
   Gieseler, Jacobi, Döllinger, Duncker, Schneidewin, Caspari, Milman,
   Robertson, Wordsworth, Plummer, Salmon. Cardinal Newman denies it on
   doctrinal grounds, but offers no solution. The only rival claimants are
   Origen (so the first editor, Miller, and Le Normant), and Cajus (so
   Baur and Cruice, the latter hesitating between Caius and Tertullian).
   Origen is out of the question, because of the difference of style and
   theology, and because he was no bishop and no resident at Rome, but
   only a transient visitor (under Zephyrinus, about 211). The only claim
   of Caius is the remark of Photius, based on a marginal note in his MS.,
   but doubted by himself, that Caius wrote a work peri tou pantos and an
   anti-heretical work called " The Labyrinth," and that he was " a
   presbyter of Rome," and also declared by some " a bishop of the
   heathen."But Caius was an anti-Chiliast, and an opponent of Montanism;
   while Hippolytus was probably a Chiliast, like Irenaeus, and accepted
   the Apocalypse as Johannean, and sympathized with the disciplinary
   rigorism of the Montanists, although he mildly opposed them. See
   Döllinger, l. c. p. 250 sqq. (Engl. translation), Volkmar, l. c. p.
   60-71; and Wordsworth, l.c. p. 16-28. Two other writers have been
   proposed as authors of the Philosophumena, but without a shadow of
   possibility, namely Tertullian by the Abbé Cruice, and the schismatic
   Novatian by the Jesuit Torquati Armellini, in a dissertation De
   priscarefutatione haereseon Origenis nomine ac philosophumenon tituto
   recens vulgata, Rom.,1862 (quoted by Plummer, p. 354).

   [1428] This idea is borrowed from Irenaeus.

   [1429] The reading here is disputed.

   [1430] The passage is obscure: hos ten hamartian ex anthropon
   apoplunein prosetaxe. Wordsworth translates: " who commanded us to wish
   away sin from man;" Macmahon: " He has arranged to wash away sin from
   human beings."Bunsen changes the reading thus: " For Christ is He whom
   the God of all has ordered to wash away the sins of mankind."Hippolytus
   probably refers to the command to repent and be baptized for the
   forgiveness of sin.

   [1431] biblidarion. The more usual diminutive of biblis or biblos is
   biblidion.

   [1432] Lipsius, in his Quellenkrilik des Epiphanios, has made the
   extraordinary achievement of a partial reconstruction of this work from
   unacknowledged extracts in the anti-heretical writings of Epiphanius,
   Philaster, and Pseudo-Tertullian.

   [1433] As suggested by Fabricius (T., 235), Neander (I. 682, Engl.
   ed.), and Lipsius. It bears in the MS. the title "Homily of Hippolytus
   against the Heresy of one Noëtus" homilia Hippol. eis hairesin Noetou
   tinos, and was first printed by Vossius in Latin, and then by Fabricius
   in Greek from a Vatican MS. (vol. II. 5-20, in Latin, vol. I. 235-244),
   and by P. de Lagarde in Greek (Hippol. Opera Gr. p. 43-57). Epiphanius
   made a mechanical use of it. It presupposes preceding sections by
   beginning: "Certain others are privily introducing another doctrine,
   having become disciple, ; of one Noëtus." The only objection to the
   identification is that Photius describes the entire work against
   thirty-two Heresies as a little book (biblidarion). Hence Lipsius
   suggests that this was not the suvntagma itself, but only a summary of
   its contents, such as was frequently attached to anti-heretical works.
   Döllinger (p. 191 sqq.) shows the doctrinal agreement of the treatise
   against Noëtus with the corresponding section of the Philosophumena,
   and finds both heretical on the subject of the Trinity and the
   development of the Logos as a subordinate Divine personality called
   into existence before the world by an act of the Father's will, which
   doctrine afterwards became a main prop of Arianism. Döllinger finds
   here the reason for the charge of partial Valentinianism raised against
   Hippolytus, as his doctrine of the origination of the Logos was
   confounded with the Gnostic emanation theory.

   [1434] So Volkmar (l.c. p. 165: "Der Cod. Vatic. 'Contra Noëtum' ist
   der Schluss nicht jener kürzeren Häreseologie, sondern einer anderen,
   von Epiphanius noch vorgefundenen Schrift desselben Hippolyt, wie es
   scheint, gegen alle Monarchianer." Caspari (III. 400 sq.) decides for
   the same view.

   [1435] Peri tes tou pantos aitias (or ousias, as Hippol. himself gives
   the title, Philos. X. 32 ed. D. and Schn.), or Peri tou pantos (on the
   Hippolytus-statue). Greek and Latin in Fabricius I. 220-222. Greek in
   P. de Lagarde, p. 68-73. The book was a sort of Christian cosmogony and
   offset to Plato's Timaeus.

   [1436] Comp. Döllinger, p. 330 sqq. He connects the view of Hippolytus
   on the intermediate state with his chiliasm, which does not admit that
   the souls of the righteous ever can attain to the kingdom of heaven and
   the beatific vision before the resurrection. Wordsworth on the other
   hand denies that Hippol. believed in a millennium and "the Romish
   doctrine of Purgatory," and accepts his view of Hades as agreeing with
   the Burial Office of the Church of England, and the sermons of Bishop
   Bull on the state of departed souls. Hippol. p. 210-216. He also gives,
   in Appendix A, p. 306-308, an addition to the fragment of the book On
   the Universe, from a MS. in the Bodleian library.

   [1437] SmikrosLaburinthos (Theodoret, Haer. Fa b. II. 5) or spoudasma

   and the Hippolytus liter., § 183, especially Döllinger. (250 sq.) and
   Volkmar. (60-71).

   Among the Western divines who, like Irenaeus and Hippolytus, wrote
   exclusively in Greek, must be mentioned Caius who flourished during the
   episcopate of Zephyrinus in the first quarter of the third century. He
   is known to us only from a few Greek fragments as an opponent of
   Montanism and Chiliasm. He was probably a Roman presbyter. From his
   name, [1444] 444 and from the fact that he did not number Hebrews among
   the Pauline Epistles, we may infer that he was a native of Rome or at
   least of the West. Eusebius calls him a very learned churchman or
   ecclesiastic author at Rome, [1445] 445 and quotes four times his
   disputation with Proclus (Gr. ), the leader of one party of the
   Montanists. [1446] 446 He preserves from it the notice that Philip and
   his four prophetic daughters are buried at Hierapolis in Phrygia, and
   an important testimony concerning the monuments or trophies (Gr. ) of
   Peter and Paul, the founders of the Roman church, on the Vatican hill
   and the Ostian road.

   This is nearly all that is certain and interesting about Caius. Jerome,
   as usual in his catalogue of illustrious men, merely repeats the,
   statements of Eusebius, although from his knowledge of Rome we might
   expect some additional information. Photius, on the strength of a
   marginal note in the MS. of a supposed work of Caius On the Universe,
   says that he was a "presbyter of the Roman church during the episcopate
   of Victor and Zephyrinus, and that he was elected bishop of the
   Gentiles ( )." He ascribes to him that work and also The Labyrinth, but
   hesitatingly. His testimony is too late to be of any value, and rests
   on a misunderstanding of Eusebius and a confusion of Caius with
   Hippolytus, an error repeated by modern critics. [1447] 447 Both
   persons have so much in common--age, residence, title--that they have
   been identified (Caius being supposed to be simply the praenomen of
   Hippolytus). [1448] 448 But this cannot be proven; Eusebius clearly
   distinguishes them, and Hippolytus was no opponent of Chiliasm, and
   only a moderate opponent of Montanism; while Caius wrote against the
   Chiliastic dreams of Cerinthus; but he did not deny, as has been
   wrongly inferred from Eusebius, the Johannean authorship of the
   Apocalypse; he probably meant pretended revelations ( ) of that
   heretic. He and Hippolytus no doubt agreed with the canon of the Roman
   church, which recognized thirteen epistles of Paul (excluding Hebrews)
   and the Apocalypse of John.

   Caius has been surrounded since Photius with a mythical halo of
   authorship, and falsely credited with several works of Hippolytus,
   including the recently discovered Philosophumena. The Muratorian
   fragment on the canon of the New Testament was also ascribed to him by
   the discoverer (Muratori, 1740) and recent writers. But this fragment
   is of earlier date (a.d. 170), and written in Latin, though perhaps
   originally in Greek. It is as far as we know the oldest Latin church
   document of Rome, and of very great importance for the history of the
   canon. [1449] 449
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1444] The name, however, was common, and the New Testament mentions
   four Caii (Acts 19:29; 20:4; Rom. 16:24; 1 Cor. 1:14; 3 John 1),
   Eusebius five.

   [1445] aner ekklesiastikos and logiotatos (II. 25 and VT. 20). The
   former term does not necessarily imply an office, but is rendered by
   Valesius vir catholicus, by Heinichen (Euseb. Com. III. 64) ein
   rechtgläubiger Schriftsteller.

   [1446] No doubt the same with the "Proculus noster" commended by
   Tertullian, Adv. Val. 5. Comp. Jerome (C. 59): "Proculum Montani
   sectatorem." His followers were Trinitarians; another party of the
   Montanists were Monarchians

   [1447] See above § 183, p. 762 sq.

   [1448] So Lightfoot in the "Journal of Philology," I. 98. and Salmon,
   l. c. p. 386.

   [1449] See the document and the discussion about the authorship in
   Routh. I. 398 sqq., the article of Salmon in Smith and Wace III. 1000
   sqq., and the different works on the Canon. Most of the writers on the
   subject, including Salmon, regard the fragment as a translation from a
   Greek original, since all other documents of the Roman Church down to
   Zephyrinus and Hippolytus are in Greek. Hilgenfeld and P. de Lagarde
   have attempted a re-translation. But Hesse (Das Murator. Fragment,
   Giessen, 1873, p. 25-39), and Caspari (Quellen, III. 410 sq.)
   confidently assert the originality of the Latin for the reason that the
   re-translation into the Greek does not clear up the obscurities. The
   Latin barbarisms occur also in other Roman writers. Caspari, however,
   thinks that it was composed by an African residing in Rome, on the
   basis of in older Greek document of the Roman church. He regards it as
   the oldest ecclesiastical document in the Latin language ("das älteste
   in lateinischer Sprache geschriebene originale kirchliche
   Schriftstück").

   C. H. Bigg: The Christian Platonists of Alexandria. Lond. 1886.

   Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great three hundred and twenty-two
   years before Christ, on the mouth of the Nile, within a few hours' sail
   from Asia and Europe, was the metropolis of Egypt, the flourishing seat
   of commerce, of Grecian and Jewish learning, and of the greatest
   library of the ancient world, and was destined to become one of the
   great centres of Christianity, the rival of Antioch and Rome. There the
   religious life of Palestine and the intellectual culture of Greece
   commingled and prepared the way for the first school of theology which
   aimed at a philosophic comprehension and vindication of the truths of
   revelation. Soon after the founding of the church which tradition
   traces to St. Mark, the Evangelist, there arose a "Catechetical school"
   under the supervision of the bishop. [1450] 450 It was originally
   designed only for the practical purpose of preparing willing heathens
   and Jews of all classes for baptism. But in that home of the Philonic
   theology, of Gnostic heresy, and of Neo-Platonic philosophy, it soon
   very naturally assumed a learned character, and became, at the same
   time, a sort of theological seminary, which exercised a powerful
   influence on the education of many bishops and church teachers, and on
   the development of Christian science. It had at first but a single
   teacher, afterwards two or more, but without fixed salary, or special
   buildings. The more wealthy pupils paid for tuition, but the offer was
   often declined. The teachers gave their instructions in their
   dwellings, generally after the style of the ancient philosophers.

   The first superintendent of this school known to us was Pantaenus, a
   converted Stoic philosopher, about a.d. 180. He afterwards labored as a
   missionary in India, and left several commentaries, of which, however,
   nothing remains but some scanty fragments. [1451] 451 He was followed
   by Clement, to a.d. 202 and Clement, by Origen, to 232, who raised the
   school to the summit of its prosperity, and founded a similar one at
   Caesarea in Palestine. The institution was afterwards conducted by
   Origen's pupils, Heraclas (d. 248), and Dionysius (d. 265), and last by
   the blind but learned Didymus (d. 395), until, at the end of the fourth
   century, it sank for ever amidst the commotions and dissensions of the
   Alexandrian church, which at last prepared the way for the destructive
   conquest of the Arabs (640). The city itself gradually sank to a mere
   village, and Cairo took its place (since 969). In the present century
   it is fast rising again, under European auspices, to great commercial
   importance.

   From this catechetical school proceeded a peculiar theology, the most
   learned and genial representatives of which were Clement and Origen.
   This theology is, on the one hand, a regenerated Christian form of the
   Alexandrian Jewish religious philosophy of Philo; on the other, a
   catholic counterpart, and a positive refutation of the heretical
   Gnosis, which reached its height also in Alexandria, but half a century
   earlier. The Alexandrian theology aims at a reconciliation of
   Christianity with philosophy, or, subjectively speaking, of pistis with
   gnosis; but it seeks this union upon the basis of the Bible, and the
   doctrine of the church. Its centre, therefore, is the Divine Logos,
   viewed as the sum of all reason and all truth, before and after the
   incarnation. Clement came from the Hellenic philosophy to the Christian
   faith; Origen, conversely, was led by faith to speculation. The former
   was an aphoristic thinker, the latter a systematic. The one borrowed
   ideas from various systems; the other followed more the track of
   Platonism. But both were Christian philosophers and churchly gnostics.
   As Philo, long before them, in the same city, had combined Judaism with
   Grecian culture, so now they carried the Grecian culture into
   Christianity. This, indeed, the apologists and controversialists of the
   second century had already done, as far back as Justin the
   "philosopher." But the Alexandrians were more learned, and made much
   freer use of the Greek philosophy. They saw in it not sheer error, but
   in one view a gift of God, and an intellectual schoolmaster for Christ,
   like the law in the moral and religious here. Clement compares it to a
   wild olive tree, which can be ennobled by faith; Origen (in the
   fragment of an epistle to Gregory Thaumaturgus), to the jewels, which
   the Israelites took with them out of Egypt, and turned into ornaments
   for their sanctuary, though they also wrought them into the golden
   calf. Philosophy is not necessarily an enemy to the truth, but may, and
   should be its handmaid, and neutralize the attacks against it. The
   elements of truth in the heathen philosophy they attributed partly to
   the secret operation of the Logos in the world of reason, partly to
   acquaintance with the writings of Moses and the prophets.

   So with the Gnostic heresy. The Alexandrians did not sweepingly condemn
   it, but recognized the desire for deeper religious knowledge, which lay
   at its root, and sought to meet this desire with a wholesome supply
   from the Bible itself. Their maxim was, in the words of Clement: "No
   faith without knowledge, no knowledge without faith;" or: "Unless you
   believe, you will not understand." [1452] 452 Faith and knowledge have
   the same substance, the saving truth of God, revealed in the Holy
   Scriptures, and faithfully handed down by the church; they differ only
   in form. Knowledge is our consciousness of the deeper ground and
   consistency of faith. The Christian knowledge, however, is also a gift
   of grace, and has its condition in a holy life. The ideal of a
   Christian gnostic includes perfect love as well as perfect knowledge,
   of God. Clement describes him as one "who, growing grey in the study of
   the Scriptures, and preserving the orthodoxy of the apostles and the
   church, lives strictly according to the gospel."

   The Alexandrian theology is intellectual, profound, stirring and full
   of fruitful germs of thought, but rather unduly idealistic and
   spiritualistic, and, in exegesis, loses itself in arbitrary allegorical
   fancies. In its efforts to reconcile revelation and philosophy it took
   up, like Philo, many foreign elements, especially of the Platonic
   stamp, and wandered into speculative views which a later and more
   orthodox, but more narrow-minded and less productive age condemned as
   heresies, not appreciating the immortal service of this school to its
   own and after times.

   I. Titus Flavius Clemens [1453] 453 sprang from Greece, probably from
   Athens. He was born about 150, and brought up in heathenism. He was
   versed in all branches of Hellenic literature and in all the existing
   systems of philosophy; but in these he found nothing to satisfy his
   thirst for truth. In his adult years, therefore, he embraced the
   Christian religion, and by long journeys East and West he sought the
   most distinguished teachers, "who preserved the tradition of pure
   saving doctrine, and implanted that genuine apostolic seed in the
   hearts of their pupils." He was captivated by Pantaenus in Egypt, who,
   says he, "like the Sicilian bee, plucked flowers from the apostolic and
   prophetic meadow, and filled the souls of his disciples with genuine,
   pure knowledge." He became presbyter in the church of Alexandria, and
   about A.D. 189 succeeded Pantaenus as president of the catechetical
   school of that city. Here he labored benignly some twelve years for the
   conversion of heathens and the education of the Christians, until, as
   it appears, the persecution under Septimius Severus in 202 compelled
   him to flee. After this we find him in Antioch, and last (211) with his
   former pupil, the bishop Alexander, in Jerusalem. Whether he returned
   thence to Alexandria is unknown. He died before the year 220, about the
   same time with Tertullian. He has no place, any more than Origen, among
   the saints of the Roman church, though he frequently bore this title of
   honor in ancient times. His name is found in early Western
   martyrologies, but was omitted in the martyrology issued by Clement
   VIII. at the suggestion of Baronius. Benedict XIV. elaborately defended
   the omission (1748), on the ground of unsoundness in doctrine.

   II. Clement was the father of the Alexandrian Christian philosophy. He
   united thorough biblical and Hellenic learning with genius and
   speculative thought. He rose, In many points, far above the prejudices
   of his age, to more free and spiritual views. His theology, however, is
   not a unit, but a confused eclectic mixture of true Christian elements
   with many Stoic, Platonic, and Philonic ingredients. His writings are
   full of repetition, and quite lacking in clear, fixed method. He throws
   out his suggestive and often profound thoughts in fragments, or
   purposely veils them, especially in the Stromata, in a mysterious
   darkness, to conceal them from the exoteric multitude, and to stimulate
   the study of the initiated or philosophical Christians. He shows here
   an affinity with the heathen mystery cultus, and the Gnostic arcana.
   His extended knowledge of Grecian literature and rich quotations from
   the lost works of poets, philosophers, and historians give him
   importance also in investigations regarding classical antiquity. He
   lived in an age of transition when Christian thought was beginning to
   master and to assimilate the whole domain of human knowledge. "And when
   it is frankly admitted" (says Dr. Westcott) "that his style is
   generally deficient in terseness and elegance; that his method is
   desultory; that his learning is undigested: we can still thankfully
   admire his richness of information, his breadth of reading, his
   largeness of sympathy, his lofty aspirations, his noble conception of
   the office and capacities of the Faith."

   III. The three leading works which he composed during his residence as
   teacher in Alexandria, between the years 190 and 195, represent the
   three stages in the discipline of the human race by the divine Logos,
   corresponding to the three degrees of knowledge required by the ancient
   in mystagogues, [1454] 454 and are related to one another very much as
   apologetics, ethics, and dogmatics, or as faith, love, and mystic
   vision, or as the, stages of the Christian cultus up to the celebration
   of the sacramental mysteries. The "Exhortation to the Greeks," [1455]
   455 in three books, with almost a waste of learning, points out the
   unreasonableness and immorality, but also the nobler prophetic element,
   of heathenism, and seeks to lead the sinner to repentance and faith.
   The "Tutor" or "Educator" [1456] 456 unfolds the Christian morality
   with constant reference to heathen practices, and exhorts to a holy
   walk, the end of which is likeness to God. The Educator is Christ, and
   the children whom he trains, are simple, sincere believers. The
   "Stromata" or "Miscellanies," [1457] 457 in seven books (the eighth,
   containing, an imperfect treatise on logic, is spurious), furnishes a
   guide to the deeper knowledge of Christianity, but is without any
   methodical arrangement, a heterogeneous mixture of curiosities of
   history, beauties of poetry, reveries of philosophy, Christian truths
   and heretical errors (hence the name). He compares it to a thick-grown,
   shady mountain or garden, where fruitful and barren trees of all kinds,
   the cypress, the laurel, the ivy, the apple, the olive, the fig, stand
   confusedly grouped together, that many may remain hidden from the eye
   of the plunderer without escaping the notice of the laborer, who might
   transplant and arrange them in pleasing order. It was, probably, only a
   prelude to a more comprehensive theology. At the close the author
   portrays the ideal of the true gnostic, that is, the perfect Christian,
   assigning to him, among other traits, a stoical elevation above all
   sensuous affections. The inspiring thought of Clement is that
   Christianity satisfies all the intellectual and moral aspirations and
   wants of man.

   Besides these principal works we have, from Clement also, an able and
   moderately ascetic treatise, on the right use of wealth. [1458] 458 His
   ethical principles are those of the Hellenic philosophy, inspired by
   the genius of Christianity. He does not run into the excesses of
   asceticism, though evidently under its influence. His exegetical works,
   [1459] 459 as well as a controversial treatise on prophecy against the
   Montanists, and another on the passover, against the Judaizing practice
   in Asia Minor, are all lost, except some inconsiderable fragments.

   To Clement we owe also the oldest Christian hymn that has come down to
   us; an elevated but somewhat turgid song of praise to the Logos, as the
   divine educator and leader of the human race. [1460] 460

   [1453] 453 Klemens. It is strange that he, and not his distinguished
   Roman namesake, should be called Flavius. Perhaps he was descended from
   a freedman of Titus Flavius Clemens, the nephew of the Emperor
   Vespasian and Consul in 95, who with his wife Domitilla was suddenly
   arrested and condemned on the charge of " atheism," i.e. Christianity,

   I. Life And Character. Origenes, [1461] 461 surnamed "Adamantius" on
   account of his industry and purity of character [1462] 462 is one of
   the most remarkable men in history for genius and learning, for the
   influence he exerted on his age, and for the controversies and
   discussions to which his opinions gave rise. He was born of Christian
   parents at Alexandria, in the year 185, and probably baptized in
   childhood, according to Egyptian custom which he traced to apostolic
   origin. [1463] [1464] 464 who was probably a rhetorician, and of the
   celebrated Clement at the catechetical school, he received a pious and
   learned education. While yet a boy, he knew whole sections of the Bible
   by memory, and not rarely perplexed his father with questions on the
   deeper sense of Scripture. The father reproved his curiosity, but
   thanked God for such a son, and often, as he slept, reverentially
   kissed his breast as a temple of the Holy Spirit. Under the persecution
   of Septimius Severus in 202, he wrote to his father in prison,
   beseeching him not to deny Christ for the sake of his family, and
   strongly desired to give himself up to the heathen authorities, but was
   prevented by his mother, who hid his clothes. Leonides died a martyr,
   and, as his property was confiscated, he left a helpless widow with
   seven children. Origen was for a time assisted by a wealthy matron, and
   then supported himself by giving instruction in the Greek language and
   literature, and by copying manuscripts.

   In the year 203, though then only eighteen years of age, he was
   nominated by the bishop Demetrius, afterwards his opponent, president
   of the catechetical school of Alexandria, left vacant by the flight of
   Clement. To fill this important office, he made himself acquainted with
   the various heresies, especially the Gnostic, and with the Grecian
   philosophy; he was not even ashamed to study under the heathen Ammonius
   Saccas, the celebrated founder of Neo-Platonism. He learned also the
   Hebrew language, and made journeys to Rome (211), Arabia, Palestine
   (215), and Greece. In Rome he became slightly acquainted with
   Hippolytus, the author of the Philosophumena, who was next to himself
   the most learned man of his age. Döllinger thinks it all but certain
   that he sided with Hippolytus in his controversy with Zephyrinus and
   Callistus, for he shared (at least in his earlier period) his
   rigoristic principles of discipline, had a dislike for the proud and
   overbearing bishops in large cities, and held a subordinatian view of
   the Trinity, but he was far superior to his older contemporary in
   genius, depth, and penetrating insight. [1465] 465

   When his labors and the number of his pupils increased he gave the
   lower classes of the catechetical school into the charge of his pupil
   Heraclas, and devoted himself wholly to the more advanced students. He
   was successful in bringing many eminent heathens and heretics to the
   Catholic church; among them a wealthy Gnostic, Ambrosius, who became
   his most liberal patron, furnishing him a costly library for his
   biblical studies, seven stenographers, and a number of copyists (some
   of whom were young Christian women), the former to note down his
   dictations, the latter to engross them. His fame spread far and wide
   over Egypt. Julia Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander Severus,
   brought him to Antioch in 218, to learn from him the doctrines of
   Christianity. An Arabian prince honored him with a visit for the same
   purpose.

   His mode of life during the whole period was strictly ascetic. He made
   it a matter of principle, to renounce every earthly thing not
   indispensably necessary. He refused the gifts of his pupils, and in
   literal obedience to the Saviour's injunction he had but one coat, no
   shoes, and took no thought of the morrow. He rarely ate flesh, never
   drank wine; devoted the greater part of the night to prayer and study,
   and slept on the bare floor. Nay, in his youthful zeal for ascetic
   holiness, he even committed the act of self-emasculation, partly to
   fulfil literally the mysterious words of Christ, in Matt. 19:12, for
   the sake of the kingdom of God, partly to secure himself against all
   temptation and calumny which might arise from his intercourse with many
   female catechumens. [1466] 466 By this inconsiderate and misdirected
   heroism, which he himself repented in his riper years, he incapacitated
   himself, according to the canons of the church, for the clerical
   office. Nevertheless, a long time afterwards, in 228, he was ordained
   presbyter by two friendly bishops, Alexander of Jerusalem, and
   Theoctistus of Caesarea in Palestine, who had, even before this, on a
   former visit of his, invited him while a layman, to teach publicly in
   their churches, and to expound the Scriptures to their people.

   But this foreign ordination itself, and the growing reputation of
   Origen among heathens and Christians, stirred the jealousy of the
   bishop Demetrius of Alexandria, who charged him besides, and that not
   wholly without foundation, with corrupting Christianity by foreign
   speculations. This bishop held two councils, A.D. 231 and 232, against
   the great theologian, and enacted, that he, for his false doctrine, his
   self-mutilation, and his violation of the church laws, be deposed from
   his offices of presbyter and catechist, and excommunicated. This
   unrighteous sentence, in which envy, hierarchical arrogance, and zeal
   for orthodoxy joined, was communicated, as the custom was, to other
   churches. The Roman church, always ready to anathematize, concurred
   without further investigation; while the churches of Palestine, Arabia,
   Phoenicia, and Achaia, which were better informed, decidedly
   disapproved it.

   In this controversy Origen showed a genuine Christian meekness. "We
   must pity them," said he of his enemies, "rather than hate them; pray
   for them, rather than curse them; for we are made for blessing, and not
   for cursing." He betook himself to his friend, the bishop of Caesarea
   in Palestine, prosecuted his studies there, opened a new philosophical
   and theological school, which soon outshone that of Alexandria, and
   labored for the spread of the kingdom of God. The persecution under
   Maximinus Thrax (235) drove him for a time to Cappadocia. Thence he
   went to Greece, and then back to Palestine. He was called into
   consultation in various ecclesiastical disputes, and had an extensive
   correspondence, in which were included even the emperor Philip the
   Arabian, and his wife. Though thrust out as a heretic from his home, he
   reclaimed the erring in foreign lands to the faith of the church. At an
   Arabian council, for example, be convinced the bishop Beryllus of his
   christological error, and persuaded him to retract (A. D. 244).

   At last he received an honorable invitation to return to Alexandria,
   where, meantime, his pupil Dionysius had become bishop. But in the
   Decian persecution he was cast into prison, cruelly tortured, and
   condemned to the stake; and though he regained his liberty by the death
   of the emperor, yet he died some time after, at the age of sixty-nine,
   in the year 253 or 254, at Tyre, probably in consequence of that
   violence. He belongs, therefore, at least among the confessors, if not
   among the martyrs. He was buried at Tyre.

   It is impossible to deny a respectful sympathy, veneration and
   gratitude to this extraordinary man, who, with all his brilliant
   talents and a best of enthusiastic friends and admirers, was driven
   from his country, stripped of his sacred office, excommunicated from a
   part of the church, then thrown into a dungeon, loaded with chains,
   racked by torture, doomed to drag his aged frame and dislocated limbs
   in pain and poverty, and long after his death to have his memory
   branded, his name anathematized, and his salvation denied; [1467] 467
   but who nevertheless did more than all his enemies combined to advance
   the cause of sacred learning, to refute and convert heathens and
   heretics, and to make the church respected in the eyes of the world.

   II. His Theology. Origen was the greatest scholar of his age, and the
   most gifted, most industrious, and most cultivated of all the
   ante-Nicene fathers. Even heathens and heretics admired or feared his
   brilliant talent and vast learning. His knowledge embraced all
   departments of the philology, philosophy, and theology of his day. With
   this he united profound and fertile thought, keen penetration, and
   glowing imagination. As a true divine, he consecrated all his studies
   by prayer, and turned them, according to his best convictions, to the
   service of truth and piety.

   He may be called in many respects the Schleiermacher of the Greek
   church. He was a guide from the heathen philosophy and the heretical
   Gnosis to the Christian faith. He exerted an immeasurable influence in
   stimulating the development of the catholic theology and forming the
   great Nicene fathers, Athanasius, Basil, the two Gregories, Hilary, and
   Ambrose, who consequently, in spite of all his deviations, set great
   value on his services. But his best disciples proved unfaithful to many
   of his most peculiar views, and adhered far more to the reigning faith
   of the church. For--and in this too he is like Schleiermacher--he can
   by no means be called orthodox, either in the Catholic or in the
   Protestant sense. His leaning to idealism, his predilection for Plato,
   and his noble effort to reconcile Christianity with reason, and to
   commend it even to educated heathens and Gnostics, led him into many
   grand and fascinating errors. Among these are his extremely ascetic and
   almost docetistic conception of corporeity, his denial of a material
   resurrection, his doctrine of the pre-existence and the pre-temporal
   fall of souls (including the pre-existence of the human soul of
   Christ), of eternal creation, of the extension of the work of
   redemption to the inhabitants of the stars and to all rational
   creatures, and of the final restoration of all men and fallen angels.
   Also in regard to the dogma of the divinity of Christ, though he
   powerfully supported it, and was the first to teach expressly the
   eternal generation of the Son, yet he may be almost as justly
   considered a forerunner of the Arian heteroousion, or at least of the
   semi-Arian homoiousion, as of the Athanasian homoousion.

   These and similar views provoked more or less contradiction during his
   lifetime, and were afterwards, at a local council in Constantinople in
   543, even solemnly condemned as heretical. [1468] 468 But such a man
   might in such an age hold erroneous opinions without being a heretic.
   For Origen propounded his views always with modesty and from sincere
   conviction of their agreement with Scripture, and that in a time when
   the church doctrine was as yet very indefinite in many points. For this
   reason even learned Roman divines, such as Tillemont and Möhler have
   shown Origen the greatest respect and leniency; a fact the more to be
   commended, since the Roman church has refused him, as well as Clement
   of Alexandria and Tertullian, a place among the saints and the fathers
   in the stricter sense.

   Origen's greatest service was in exegesis. He is father of the critical
   investigation of Scripture, and his commentaries are still useful to
   scholars for their suggestiveness. Gregory Thaumaturgus says, he had
   "received from God the greatest gift, to be an interpreter of the word
   of God to men." For that age this judgment is perfectly just. Origen
   remained the exegetical oracle until Chrysostom far surpassed him, not
   indeed in originality and vigor of mind and extent of learning, but in
   sound, sober tact, in simple, natural analysis, and in practical
   application of the text. His great defect is the neglect of the
   grammatical and historical sense and his constant desire to find a
   hidden mystic meaning. He even goes further in this direction than the
   Gnostics, who everywhere saw transcendental, unfathomable mysteries.
   His hermeneutical principle assumes a threefold sense--somatic,
   psychic, and pneumatic; or literal, moral, and spiritual. His
   allegorical interpretation is ingenious, but often runs far away from
   the text and degenerates into the merest caprice; while at times it
   gives way to the opposite extreme of a carnal literalism, by which he
   justifies his ascetic extravagance. [1469] 469

   Origen is one of the most important witnesses of the ante-Nicene text
   of the Greek Testament, which is older than the received text. He
   compared different MSS. and noted textual variations, but did not
   attempt a recension or lay down any principles of textual criticism.
   The value of his testimony is due to his rare opportunities and
   life-long study of the Bible before the time when the traditional
   Syrian and Byzantine text was formed.

   Engelhardt, Redepenning, and Neander, against the unfounded doubts of
   Baur and Schnitzer. The comments of Origen on the passage in Matthew
   speak for rather than against the fact. See also Möller (p. 93).

   [1467] Stephen Binet, a Jesuit, wrote a little book, De salute
   Origenis, Par. 1629, in which the leading writers on the subject debate
   the question of the salvation of Origen, and Baronius proposes a
   descent to the infernal regions to ascertain the truth at last the
   final revision of the heresy-trial is wisely left with the secret
   counsel of God. See an account of this book by Bayle, Diction. sub
   Origene."Tom. III. 541, note 1). Origen's " gravest errors," says
   Westcott (l.c.)" are attempts to solve that which is insoluble."

   [1468] Not at the fifth ecumenical council of 553, as has been often,
   through confusion, asserted. See Hefele, Conciliengesch. vol. II. 790
   sqq. and 859 sqq, Möller, however, in Herzog2 xi. 113, again defends
   the other view of Noris and Ballerini. See the 15 anathematisms in
   Mansi, Conc. ix. 534.

   [1469] His exegetical method and merits are fully discussed by Huetius,
   and by Redepenning (I. 296-324), also by Diestel, Gesch. des A. T in
   der christl. Kirche, 1869, p. 36 sq. and 53 sq.

   § 188. The Works of Origen.

   Origen was an uncommonly prolific author, but by no means an idle
   bookmaker. Jerome says, he wrote more than other men can read.
   Epiphanius, an opponent, states the number of his works as six
   thousand, which is perhaps not much beyond the mark, if we include all
   his short tracts, homilies, and letters, and count them as separate
   volumes. Many of them arose without his cooeperation, and sometimes
   against his will, from the writing down of his oral lectures by others.
   Of his books which remain, some have come down to us only in Latin
   translations, and with many alterations in favor of the later
   orthodoxy. They extend to all branches of the theology of that day.

   1. His biblical works were the most numerous, and may be divided into
   critical, exegetical, and hortatory.

   Among the critical were the Hexapla [1470] 470 (the Sixfold Bible) and
   the shorter Tetrapla (the Fourfold), on which he spent eight-and-twenty
   years of the most unwearied labor. The Hexapla was the first polyglott
   Bible, but covered only the Old Testament, and was designed not for the
   critical restoration of the original text, but merely for the
   improvement of the received Septuagint, and the defense of it against
   the charge of inaccuracy. It contained, in six columns, the original
   text in two forms, in Hebrew and in Greek characters, and the four
   Greek versions of the Septuagint, of Aquila, of Symmachus, and of
   Theodotion. To these he added, in several books two or three other
   anonymous Greek versions. [1471] 471 The order was determined by the
   degree of literalness. The Tetrapla [1472] 472 contained only the four
   versions of Aquila, Symmachus, the Septuagint, and Theodotion. The
   departures from the standard he marked with the critical signs asterisk
   (*) for alterations and additions, and obelos (÷) for proposed
   omissions. He also added marginal notes, e.g., explanations of Hebrew
   names. The voluminous work was placed in the library at Caesarea, was
   still much used in the time of Jerome (who saw it there), but doubtless
   never transcribed, except certain portions, most frequently the
   Septuagint columns (which were copied, for instance, by Pamphilus and
   Eusebius, and regarded as the standard text), and was probably
   destroyed by the Saracens in 653. We possess, therefore, only some
   fragments of it, which were collected and edited by the learned
   Benedictine Montfaucon (1714), and more recentl;y by an equallt learned
   Anglican scholar, Dr. Field (1875).1473

   His commentaries covered almost all the books of the Old and New
   Testaments, and contained a vast wealth of original and profound
   suggestions, with the most arbitrary allegorical and mystical fancies.
   They were of three kinds: (a) Short notes on single difficult passages
   for beginners; [1473] 474 all these are lost, except what has been
   gathered from the citations of the fathers (by Delarue under the title
   EklogaiSelecta). (b) Extended expositions of whole books, for higher
   scientific study; [1474] 475 of, these we have a number of important
   fragments in the original, and in the translation of Rufinus. In the
   Commentary on John the Gnostic exegeses of Heracleon is much used. (c)
   Hortatory or practical applications of Scripture for the congregation
   or Homilies. [1475] 476 They were delivered extemporaneously, mostly in
   Caesarea and in the latter part of his life, and taken down by
   stenographers. They are important also to the history of pulpit
   oratory. But we have them only in part, as translated by Jerome and
   Rufinus, with many unscrupulous retrenchments and additions, which
   perplex and are apt to mislead investigators.

   2. Apologetic and polemic works. The refutation of Celsus's attack upon
   Christianity, in eight books, written in the last years of his life,
   about 248, is preserved complete in the original, and is one of the
   ripest and most valuable productions of Origen, and of the whole
   ancient apologetic literature. [1476] 477 And yet he did not know who
   this Celsus was, whether he lived in the reign of Nero or that of
   Hadrian, while modern scholars assign him to the period a.d. 150 to
   178. His numerous polemic writings against heretics are all gone.

   3. Of his dogmatic writings we have, though only in the inaccurate
   Latin translation of Rufinus, his juvenile production, De Principiis,
   i.e. on the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith, in four
   books. [1477] 478 It was written in Alexandria, and became the chief
   source of objections to his theology. It was the first attempt at a
   complete system of dogmatics, but full of his peculiar Platonizing and
   Gnosticizing errors, some of which he retracted in his riper years. In
   this work Origen treats in four books, first, of God, of Christ, and of
   the Holy Spirit; in the second book, of creation and the incarnation,
   the resurrection and the judgment; in the third, of freedom, which he
   very strongly sets forth and defends against the Gnostics; in the
   fourth, of the Holy Scriptures, their inspiration and authority, and
   the interpretation of them; concluding with a recapitulation of the
   doctrine of the trinity. His Stromata, in imitation of the work of the
   same name by Clemens Alex., seems to have been doctrinal and
   exegetical, and is lost with the exception of two or three fragments
   quoted in Latin by Jerome. His work on the Resurrection is likewise
   lost.

   4. Among his practical works may be mentioned a treatise on prayer,
   with an exposition of the Lord's Prayer, [1478] 479 and an exhortation
   to martyrdom, [1479] 480 written during the persecution of Maximin
   (235-238), and addressed to his friend and patron Ambrosius.

   5. Of his letters, of which Eusebius collected over eight hundred, we
   have, besides a few fragments, only all answer to Julius Africanus on
   the authenticity of the history of Susanna.

   Among the works of Origen is also usually inserted the Philocalia, or a
   collection, in twenty-seven chapters, of extracts from his writings on
   various exegetical questions, made by Gregory Nazianzen and Basil the
   Great. [1480] 481

   Most of the Greek fathers of the third and fourth centuries stood more
   or less under the influence of the spirit and the works of Origen,
   without adopting all his peculiar speculative views. The most
   distinguished among his disciples are Gregory Thaumaturgus, Dionysius
   of Alexandria, surnamed the Great, Heraclas, Hieracas, Pamphilus; in a
   wider sense also Eusebius, Gregory of Nyssa and other eminent divines
   of the Nicene age.

   Gregory, surnamed Thaumaturgus, "the wonder-worker," was converted from
   heathenism in his youth by Origen at Caesarea, in Palestine, spent
   eight years in his society, and then, after a season of contemplative
   retreat, labored as bishop of Neo-Caesarea in Pontus from 244 to 270
   with extraordinary success. He could thank God on his death-bed, that
   he had left to his successor no more unbelievers in his diocese than he
   had found Christians in it at his accession; and those were only
   seventeen. He must have had great missionary zeal and executive
   ability. He attended the Synod of Antioch in 265, which condemned Paul
   of Samasota.

   Later story represents him as a "second Moses," and attributed
   extraordinary miracles to him. But these are not mentioned till a
   century after his time, by Gregory of Nyssa and Basil, who made him
   also a champion of the Nicene orthodoxy before the Council of Nicaea.
   Eusebius knows nothing of them, nor of his trinitarian creed which is
   said to have been communicated to him by a special revelation in a
   vision. [1481] 482 This creed is almost too Orthodox for an admiring
   Pupil Of Origen, and seems to presuppose the Arian controversy
   (especially the conclusion). It has probably been enlarged. Another and
   fuller creed ascribed to him, is the work of the younger Apollinaris at
   the end of the fourth century. [1482] 483

   Among his genuine writings is a glowing eulogy on his beloved teacher
   Origen, which ranks as a masterpiece of later Grecian eloquence. [1483]
   484 Also a simple paraphrase of the book of Ecclesiastes. [1484] 485 To
   these must be added two books recently published in a Syriac
   translation, one on the co-equality of the Father, Son, and Holy
   Spirit, and the other on the impassibility and the possibility of God.

   Notes.

   I. The Declaration of faith (ekthesis pisteos kata apokalupsin) is said
   to have been revealed to Gregory in a night vision by St. John, at the
   request of the Virgin Mary, and the autograph of it was, at the time of
   Gregory of Nyssa (as he says), in possession of the church of
   Neocaesarea. It is certainly a very remarkable document and the most
   explicit statement of the doctrine of the Trinity from the ante-Nicene
   age. Caspari (in his Alte und neue Quellen, etc., 1879, pp. 25-64),
   after an elaborate discussion, comes to the conclusion that the creed
   contains nothing inconsistent with a pupil of Origen, and that it was
   written by Gregory in opposition to Sabellianism and Paul of Samosata,
   and with reference to the controversy between Dionysius of Alexandria
   and Dionysius of Rome on the Trinity, between a.d. 260 and 270. But I
   think it more probable that it has undergone some enlargement at the
   close by a later hand. This is substantially also the view of Neander,
   and of Dorner (Entwicklungsgesch. der L. v. d. Pers. Christi, I.
   735-737). The creed is at all events a very remarkable production and a
   Greek anticipation of the Latin Quicunque which falsely goes under the
   name of the "Athanasian Creed." We give the Greek with a translation.

   There is one God, the Father of the living Word, (who is his)
   subsisting Wisdom and Power and eternal Impress (lmage): perfect
   Begetter of the Perfect [Begotten], Father of the only begotten Son.

   There is one Lord, Only of Only, God of God, the Image and Likeness of
   the Godhead, the efficient Word, Wisdom comprehensive of the system of
   all things, and Power productive of the whole creation; true Son of the
   true Father, Invisible of Invisible, and Incorruptible of
   Incorruptible, and Immortal of Immortal, and Eternal of Eternal.

   And there is one Holy Ghost, having his existence from God, and being
   manifested (namely, to mankind) by the Son; the perfect Likeness of the
   perfect Son: Life, the Cause of the living; sacred Fount; holiness, the
   Bestower of sanctification; in whom is revealed God the Father, who is
   over all things and in all things, and God the Son, who is through all
   things: a perfect Trinity, in glory and eternity and dominion, neither
   divided nor alien.

   Oute oun ktiston ti e doulon en te triadi, oute epeisakton, hos
   proteron men ouch huparchon, husteron de epeiselthon; oute oun enelipe
   pote Huios Patri, oute Huio Pneuma alla atreptos kai analloiotos he
   aute trias aei.

   There is therefore nothing created or subservient in the Trinity, nor
   super-induced, as though not before existing, but introduced afterward
   Nor has the Son ever been wanting to the Father, nor the Spirit to the
   Son, but there is unvarying and unchangeable the same Trinity forever.

   II. The Miracles ascribed to Gregory Thaumaturgus in the fourth
   century, one hundred years after his death, by the enlightened and
   philosophic Gregory of Nyssa, and defended in the nineteenth century by
   Cardinal Newman of England as credible (Two Essays on Bibl. and Eccles.
   Miracles. Lond. 3d ed., 1873, p. 261-270), are stupendous and surpass
   all that are recorded of the Apostles in the New Testament.

   Gregory not only expelled demons, healed the sick, banished idols from
   a heathen temple, but he moved large stones by a mere word, altered the
   course of the Armenian river Lycus, and, like Moses of old, even dried
   up a lake. The last performance is thus related by St. Gregory of
   Nyssa: Two young brothers claimed as their patrimony the possession of
   a lake. (The name and location are not given.) Instead of dividing it
   between them, they referred the dispute to the Wonderworker, who
   exhorted them to be reconciled to one another. The young men however,
   became exasperated, and resolved upon a murderous duel, when the man of
   God, remaining on the banks of the lake, by the power of prayer,
   transformed the whole lake into dry land, and thus settled the
   conflict.

   Deducting all these marvellous features, which the magnifying distance
   of one century after the death of the saint created, there remains the
   commanding figure of a great and good man who made a most powerful
   impression upon his and the subsequent generati

   Dionysius Of Alexandria --so distinguished from the contemporary
   Dionysius of Rome--surnamed "the Great," [1485] 486 was born about A.D.
   190, [1486] 487 of Gentile parents, and brought up to a secular
   profession with bright prospects of wealth and renown, but he examined
   the claims of Christianity and was won to the faith by Origen, to whom
   he ever remained faithful. He disputes with Gregory Thaumaturgus the
   honor of being the chief disciple of that great teacher; but while
   Gregory was supposed to have anticipated the Nicene dogma of the
   trinity, the orthodoxy of Dionysius was disputed. He became Origen's
   assistant in the Catechetical School (233), and after the death of
   Heraclas bishop of Alexandria (248). During the violent persecution
   under Decius (249-251) he fled, and thus exposed himself, like Cyprian,
   to the suspicion of cowardice. In the persecution under Valerian (247),
   he was brought before the praefect and banished, but he continued to
   direct his church from exile. On the accession of Gallienus he was
   allowed to return (260). He died in the year 265.

   His last years were disturbed by war, famine and pestilence, of which
   he gives a lively account in the Easter encyclical of the year 263.
   [1487] 488 "The present time," he writes, "does not appear a fit season
   for a festival ... All things are filled with tears, all are mourning,
   and on account of the multitudes already dead and still dying, groans
   are daily heard throughout the city ... There is not a house in which
   there is not one dead ... After this, war and famine succeeded which we
   endured with the heathen, but we bore alone those miseries with which
   they afflicted us ... But we rejoiced in the peace of Christ which he
   gave to us alone ... Most of our brethren by their exceeding great love
   and affection not sparing themselves and adhering to one another, were
   constantly superintending the sick, ministering to their wants without
   fear and cessation, and healing them in Christ." The heathen, on the
   contrary, repelled the sick or cast them half-dead into the street. The
   same self-denying charity in contrast with heathen selfishness
   manifested itself at Carthage during the raging of a pestilence, under
   the persecuting reign of Gallus (252), as we learn from Cyprian.

   Dionysius took an active part in the christological, chiliastic, and
   disciplinary controversies of his time, and showed in them moderation,
   an amiable spirit of concession, and practical churchly tact, but also
   a want of independence and consistency. He opposed Sabellianism, and
   ran to the brink of tritheism, but in his correspondence with the more
   firm and orthodox Dionysius of Rome he modified his view, and
   Athanasius vindicated his orthodoxy against the charge of having sowed
   the seeds of Arianism. He wished to adhere to Origen's christology, but
   the church pressed towards the Nicene formula. There is nothing,
   however, in the narrative of Athanasius which implies a recognition of
   Roman supremacy. His last christological utterance was a letter
   concerning the heresy of Paul of Samosata; he was prevented from
   attending the Synod of Antioch in 264, which condemned and deposed
   Paul. He rejected, with Origen, the chiliastic notions, and induced
   Nepos and his adherents to abandon them, but he denied the apostolic
   origin of the Apocalypse and ascribed it to the "Presbyter John," of
   doubtful existence. He held mild views on discipline and urged the
   Novatians to deal gently with the lapsed and to preserve the peace of
   the church. He also counselled moderation in the controversy between
   Stephen and Cyprian on the validity of heretical baptism, though he
   sided with the more liberal Roman theory.

   Dionysius wrote many letters and treatises on exegetic, polemic, and
   ascetic topics, but only short fragments remain, mostly in Eusebius.
   The chief books were Commentaries on Ecclesiastes, and Luke; Against
   Sabellius (christological); On Nature (philosophical); On the Promises
   (against Chiliasm): On Martyrdom. He compared the style of the fourth
   Gospel and of the Apocalypse to deny the identity of authorship, but he
   saw only the difference and not the underlying unity. [1488] 489 "All
   the fragments of Dionysius," says Westcott, "repay careful perusal.
   They are uniformly inspired by the sympathy and large-heartedness which
   he showed in practice."

   Dionysius is commemorated in the Greek church on October 3, in the
   Roman on November 17.

   construction. He admits however, that the author of the Apocalypse "saw
   a revelation and received knowledge and prophecy," and disclaims the
   intention of depreciating the book only he cannot conceive that it is
   the product of the same pen as the fourth Gospel. He anticipated the
   theory of the Schleiermacher school of critics who defend the Johannean
   origin of the Gospel and surrender the Apocalypse; while the Tübingen
   critics and Renan reverse the case. See on this subject vol. I. 716 sq.

   Julius Africanus, [1489] 490 the first Christian chronographer and
   universal historian, an older friend of Origen, lived in the first half
   of the second century at Emmaus (Nicopolis), in Palestine, [1490] 491
   made journeys to Alexandria, where he heard the lectures of Heraclas,
   to Edessa, Armenia and Phrygia, and was sent on an embassy to Rome in
   behalf of the rebuilding of Emmaus which had been ruined (221). He died
   about a.d. 240 in old age. He was not an ecclesiastic, as far as we
   know, but a philosopher who pursued his favorite studies after his
   conversion and made them useful to the church. He may have been a
   presbyter, but certainly not a bishop. [1491] 492 He was the forerunner
   of Eusebius, who in his Chronicle has made copious use of his learned
   labor and hardly gives him sufficient credit, although he calls his
   chronography "a most accurate and labored performance." He was
   acquainted with Hebrew. Socrates classes him for learning with Clement
   of Alexandria and Origen.

   His chief work is his chronography, in five books. It commenced with
   the creation (B. C. 5499) and came down to the year 221, the fourth
   year of Elagabalus. It is the foundation of the mediaeval
   historiography of the world and the church. We have considerable
   fragments of it and can restore it in part from the Chronicle of
   Eusebius. A satisfactory estimate of its merits requires a fuller
   examination of the Byzantine and oriental chronography of the church
   than has hitherto been made. Earlier writers were concerned to prove
   the antiquity of the Christian religion against the heathen charge of
   novelty by tracing it back to Moses and the prophets who were older
   than the Greek philosophers and poets. But Africanus made the first
   attempt at a systematic chronicle of sacred and profane history. He
   used as a fixed point the accession of Cyrus, which he placed Olymp.
   55, 1, and then counting backwards in sacred history, he computed 1237
   years between the exodus and the end of the seventy years' captivity or
   the first year of Cyrus. He followed the Septuagint chronology, placed
   the exodus A. M. 3707, and counted 740 years between the exodus and
   Solomon. He fixed the Lord's birth in A. M. 5500, and 10 years before
   our Dionysian era, but he allows only one year's public ministry and
   thus puts the crucifixion A. M. 5531. He makes the 31 years of the
   Saviour's life the complement of the 969 years of Methuselah. He
   understood the 70 weeks of Daniel to be 490 lunar years, which are
   equivalent to 475 Julian years. He treats the darkness at the
   crucifixion as miraculous, since an eclipse of the sun could not have
   taken place at the full moon.

   Another work of Africanus, called Cesti (Kestoi) or Variegated Girdles,
   was a sort of universal scrap-book or miscellaneous collection of
   information on geography, natural history, medicine, agriculture, war,
   and other subjects of a secular character. Only fragments remain. Some
   have unnecessarily denied his authorship on account of the secular
   contents of the book, which was dedicated to the Emperor Alexander
   Severus.

   Eusebius mentions two smaller treatises of Africanus, a letter to
   Origen, "in which he intimates his doubts on the history of Susanna, in
   Daniel, as if it were a spurious and fictitious composition," and "a
   letter to Aristides on the supposed discrepancy between the genealogies
   of Christ in Matthew and Luke, in which he most clearly establishes the
   consistency of the two evangelists, from an account which had been
   handed down from his ancestors."

   The letter to Origen is still extant and takes a prominent rank among
   the few specimens of higher criticism in the literature of the ancient
   church. He urges the internal improbabilities of the story of Susanna,
   its omission from the Hebrew canon, the difference of style as compared
   with the canonical Daniel, and a play on Greek words which shows that
   it was originally written in Greek, not in Hebrew. Origen tried at
   great length to refute these objections, and one of his arguments is
   that it would be degrading to Christians to go begging to the Jews for
   the unadulterated Scriptures.

   The letter to Aristides on the genealogies solves the difficulty by
   assuming that Matthew gives the natural, Luke the legal, descent of our
   Lord. It exists in fragments, from which F. Spitta has recently
   reconstructed it. [1492] 493

   § 192. Minor Divines of the Greek Church.

   A number of divines of the third century, of great reputation in their
   day, mostly of Egypt and of the school of Origen, deserve a brief
   mention, although only few fragments of their works have survived the
   ravages of time.

   I. Heraclas and his brother Plutarch (who afterwards died a martyr)
   were the oldest distinguished converts and pupils of Origen, and older
   than their teacher. Heraclas had even before him studied the
   New-platonic philosophy under Ammonius Saccas. He was appointed
   assistant of Origen, and afterwards his successor in the Catechetical
   School. After the death of Demetrius, the jealous enemy of Origen,
   Heraclas was elected bishop of Alexandria and continued in that high
   office sixteen years (A. D. 233-248). We know nothing of his
   administration, nor of his writings. He either did not adopt the
   speculative opinions of Origen, or prudently concealed them, at least
   he did nothing to recall his teacher from exile. He was succeeded by
   Dionysius the Great. Eusebius says that he was "devoted to the study of
   the Scriptures and a most learned man, not unacquainted with
   philosophy," but is silent about his conduct to Origen during and after
   his trial for heresy. [1493] 494

   II. Among the successors of Heraclas and Dionysius in the Catechetical
   School was Theognostus, not mentioned by Eusebius, but by Athanasius
   and Photius. We have from him a brief fragment on the blasphemy against
   the Holy Ghost, and a few extracts from his Hypotyposeis
   (Adumbrations). [1494] 495

   III. Pierius probably, succeeded Theognostus while Theonas was bishop
   of Alexandria (d. 300), and seems to have outlived the Diocletian
   persecution. He was the teacher of Pamphilus, and called "the younger
   Origen." [1495] 496

   IV. Pamphilus, a great admirer of Origen, a presbyter and theological
   teacher at Caesarea in Palestine, and a martyr of the persecution of
   Maximinus (309), was not an author himself, but one of the most liberal
   and efficient promoters of Christian learning. He did invaluable
   service to future generations by founding a theological school and
   collecting a large library, from which his pupil and friend Eusebius
   (hence called "Eusebius Pampili "), Jerome, and many others, drew or
   increased their useful information. Without that library the church
   history of Eusebius would be far less instructive than it is now.
   Pamphilus transcribed with his own hand useful books, among others the
   Septuagint from the Hexapla of Origen. [1496] 497 He aided poor
   students, and distributed the Scriptures. While in prison, he wrote a
   defense of Origen, which was completed by Eusebius in six books, but
   only the first remains in the Latin version of Rufinus, whom Jerome
   charges with wilful alterations. It is addressed to the confessors who
   were condemned to the mines of Palestine, to assure them of the
   orthodoxy of Origen from his own writings, especially on the trinity
   and the person of Christ. [1497] 498

   V. Peter, pupil and successor of Theonas, was bishop of Alexandria
   since A.D. 300, lived during the terrible times of the Diocletian
   persecution, and was beheaded by order of Maximinus in 311. He held
   moderate views on the restoration of the lapsed, and got involved in
   the Meletian schism which engaged much of the attention of the Council
   of Nicaea. Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis, taking advantage of Peter's
   flight from persecution, introduced himself into his diocese, and
   assumed the character of primate of Egypt, but was deposed by Peter in
   306 for insubordination. We have from Peter fifteen canons on
   discipline, and a few homiletical fragments in which he rejects
   Origen's views of the pre-existence and ante-mundane fall of the soul
   as heathenish, and contrary to the Scripture account of creation. This
   dissent would place him among the enemies of Origen, but Eusebius makes
   no allusion to it, and praises him for piety, knowledge of the
   Scriptures, and wise administration. [1498] 499

   VI. Hieracas (Hierax), from Leontopolis in Egypt, towards the end of
   the third century, belongs only in a wider sense to the Alexandrian
   school, and perhaps had no connexion with it at all. Epiphanius reckons
   him among the Manichaean heretics. He was, at all events, a perfectly
   original phenomenon, distinguished for his varied learning, allegorical
   exegesis, poetical talent, and still more for his eccentric asceticism.
   Nothing is left of the works which he wrote in the Greek and Egyptian
   languages. He is said to have denied the historical reality of the fall
   and the resurrection of the body, and to have declared celibacy the
   only sure way to salvation, or at least to the highest degree of
   blessedness. His followers were called Hieracitae. [1499] 500

   martyrdom of his friend and the school which he founded, but it is
   lost. See H. E. VII. 32; comp. VI. 32; VIII. 13, and especially De

   derived from "the Hellenic philosophy, and is foreign to those who
   would lead a godly life in Christ" (Routh, p. 49 sq.).

   [1499] 0ur information about Hierax is almost wholly derived from
   Epiphanius, Haer. 67, who says that he lived during the Diocletian
   persecution. Eusebius knows nothing about him; for the Egyptian bishop
   Hierax whom he mentions in two places (VII. 21 and 30), was a
   contemporary of Dionysius of Alexandria, to whom he wrote a paschal
   letter about 262.

   Tom. XVIII. Col. 9-408; and by A. Jahn (S. Methodii Opera, et S.
   Methodius Platonizans, Hal. 1865, 2 pts.). The first ed. was publ. by
   Combefis, 1644, and more completely in 1672. English translation in

   Eusebius is silent about Method., perhaps because of his opposition to
   Origen; while Photius, perhaps for the same reason, pays more attention
   to him than to Origen, whose De Principiis he pronounces blasphemous,
   Bibl 8. Gregory of Nyssa, Arethas, Leontius Byzantius, Maximus, the
   Martyrologium Romanum (XIV. Kal. Oct.) and the Menologium Graecum (ad
   diem 20 Junii), make honorable mention of him.

   relation of Methodius to Origen.) G. Salmon in Smith and Wace, III.
   909-911.

   The opposition of Demetrius to Origen proceeded chiefly from personal
   feeling, and had no theological significance. Yet it made a pretext at
   least of zeal for orthodoxy, and in subsequent opponents this motive
   took the principal place. This was the case, so early as the third
   century, with Methodius, who may be called a forerunner of Epiphanius
   in his orthodox war against Origen, but with this difference that he
   was much more moderate, and that in other respects he seems to have
   been an admirer of Plato whom he imitated in the dramatic dress of
   composition, and of Origen whom he followed in his allegorical method
   of interpretation. He occupied the position of Christian realism
   against the speculative idealism of the Alexandrian teacher.

   Methodius (also called Eubulius) was bishop first of Olympus and then
   of Patara (both in the province of Lycia, Asia Minor on the southern
   coast), and died a martyr in 311 or earlier in the Diocletian
   persecution. [1500] 501

   His principal work is his Symposium or Banquet of Ten Virgins. [1501]
   502 It is an eloquent but verbose and extravagant eulogy on the
   advantages and blessings of voluntary virginity, which he describes as
   "something supernaturally great, wonderful, and glorious," and as "the
   best and noblest manner of life." It was unknown before Christ (the
   archiparthenos). At first men were allowed to marry sisters, then came
   polygamy, the next progress was monogamy, with continence, but the
   perfect state is celibacy for the kingdom of Christ, according to his
   mysterious hint in Matt. 19:12, the recommendation of Paul, 1 Cor. 7:1,
   7, 34, 40, and the passage in Revelation 14:1-4, where "a hundred and
   forty-four thousand virgins" are distinguished from the innumerable
   multitude of other saints (7:9).

   The literary form is interesting. The ten virgins are, of course,
   suggested by the parable in the gospel. The conception of the Symposium
   and the dialogue are borrowed from Plato, who celebrated the praises of
   Eros, as Methodius the praises of virginity. Methodius begins with a
   brief dialogue between Eubulios and Eubuloin (i.e. himself) and the
   virgin Gregorion who was present at a banquet of the ten virgins in the
   gardens of Arete (i.e. personified virtue) and reports to him ten
   discourses which these virgins successively delivered in praise of
   chastity. At the end of the banquet the victorious Thecla, chief of the
   virgins (St. Paul's apocryphal companion), standing on the right hand
   of Arete, begins to sing a hymn of chastity to which the virgins
   respond with the oft-repeated refrain,


   I keep myself pure for Thee, O Bridegroom,

   And holding a lighted torch, I go to meet Thee." [1502] 503

   Then follows a concluding dialogue between Eubulios and Gregorion on
   the question, whether chastity ignorant of lust is preferable to
   chastity which feels the power of passion and overcomes it, in other
   words, whether a wrestler who has no opponents is better than a
   wrestler who has many and strong antagonists and continually contends
   against them without being worsted. Both agree in giving the palm to
   the latter, and then they betake themselves to "the care of the outward
   man," expecting to resume the delicate discussion on the next day.

   The taste and morality of virgins discussing at great length the merits
   of sexual purity are very questionable, at least from the standpoint of
   modern civilization, but the enthusiastic praise of chastity to the
   extent of total abstinence was in full accord with the prevailing
   asceticism of the fathers, including Origen, who freed himself from
   carnal temptation by an act of violence against nature.

   The work On the Resurrection, likewise in the form of a dialogue, and
   preserved in large extracts by Epiphanius and Photius, was directed
   against Origen and his views on creation, pre-existence, and the
   immateriality of the resurrection body. The orthodox speakers (Eubulios
   and Auxentios) maintain that the soul cannot sin without the body, that
   the body is not a fetter of the soul, but its inseparable companion and
   an instrument for good as well is evil, and that the earth will not be
   destroyed, but purified and transformed into a blessed abode for the
   risen saints. In a book On Things Created [1503] 504 he refutes
   Origen's view of the eternity of the world, who thought it necessary to
   the conception of God as an Almighty Creator and Ruler, and as the
   unchangeable Being.

   The Dialogue On Free Will [1504] 505 treats of the origin of matter,
   and strongly resembles a work on that subject (peri tes hules) of which
   Eusebius gives an extract and which he ascribes to Maximus, a writer
   from the close of the second century. [1505] 506

   Other works of Methodius, mentioned by Jerome, are: Against Porphyry
   (10, 000 lines); Commentaries on Genesis and Canticles; De Pythonissa
   (on the witch of Endor, against Origen's view that Samuel was laid
   under the power of Satan when he evoked her by magical art). A Homily
   for Palm Sunday, and a Homily on the Cross are also assigned to him.
   But there were several Methodii among the patristic writers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1500] Jerome makes him bishop of Tyre ("Meth. Olympi Lyciae et postea
   Tyri episcopus"); but as all other authorities mention Patara as his
   second diocese, "Tyre" is probably the error of a transcriber for
   "Patara," or for "Myra, " which lies nearly midway between Olympus and
   Patara, and probably belonged to the one or the other diocese before it
   became an independent see. It is not likely that Tyre in Phoenicia
   should have called a bishop from so great a distance. Jerome locates
   the martyrdom of Methodius at "Chalcis in Greece" (in EubOEa). But
   Sophronius, the Greek translator, substitutes "in the East for " in
   Greece."Perhaps (as Salmon suggests, p. 909) Jerome confounded
   Methodius of Patara with a Methodius whose name tradition has preserved
   as a martyr, at Chalcis in the Decian persecution. This confusion is
   all the more probable as he did not know the time of the martyrdom, and
   says that some assign it to the Diocletian persecution ("ad extremum
   novissimae persecutionis") others to the persecution " sub Decio et
   Valeriano."

   On his textual labors see the critical Introductions to the Bible.

   I. Lucian was an eminent presbyter of Antioch and martyr of the
   Diocletian persecution, renewed by Maximin. Very little is known of
   him. He was transported from Antioch to Nicomedia, where the emperor
   then resided, made a noble confession of his faith before the judge and
   died under the tortures in prison (311). His memory was celebrated in
   Antioch on the 7th of January. His piety was of the severely ascetic
   type.

   His memory was obscured by the suspicion of unsoundness in the faith.
   Eusebius twice mentions him and his glorious martyrdom, but is silent
   about his theological opinions. Alexander of Alexandria, in an
   encyclical of 321, associates him with Paul of Samosata and makes him
   responsible for the Arian heresy; he also says that he was
   excommunicated or kept aloof from the church (aposunagogos emeine)
   during the episcopate of Domnus, Timaeus, and Cyrillus; intimating that
   his schismatic condition ceased before his death. The charge brought
   against him and his followers is that he denied the eternity of the
   Logos and the human soul of Christ (the Logos taking the place of the
   rational soul). Arius and the Arians speak of him as their teacher. On
   the other hand Pseudo-Athanasius calls him a great and holy martyr, and
   Chrysostom preached a eulogy on him Jan. 1, 387. Baronius defends his
   orthodoxy, other Catholics deny it. [1506] 507 Some distinguished two
   Lucians, one orthodox, and one heretical; but this is a groundless
   hypothesis.

   The contradictory reports are easily reconciled by the assumption that
   Lucian was a critical scholar with some peculiar views on the Trinity
   and Christology which were not in harmony with the later Nicene
   orthodoxy, but that he wiped out all stains by his heroic confession
   and martyrdom. [1507] 508

   II. The creed which goes by his name and was found after his death, is
   quite orthodox as far as it goes, and was laid with three similar
   creeds before the Synod of Antioch held a.d. 341, with the intention of
   being substituted for the Creed of Nicaea. [1508] 509 It resembles the
   creed of Gregorius Thaumaturgus, is strictly trinitarian and
   acknowledges Jesus Christ "as the Son of God, the only begotten God,
   [1509] 510 through whom all things were made, who was begotten of the
   Father before all ages, God of God, Whole of Whole, One of One, Perfect
   of Perfect, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, the living Word, Wisdom,
   Life, True Light, Way, Truth, Resurrection, Shepherd, Door,
   unchangeable and unalterable, the immutable Likeness of the Godhead,
   both of the substance and will and power and glory of the Father, the
   first-born of all creation, [1510] 511 who was in the beginning with
   God, the Divine Logos, according to what is said in the Gospel: 'And
   the Word was God (John 1:1), through whom all things were made' (ver.
   3), and in whom 'all things consist' (Col. 1:17): who in the last days
   came down from above, and was born of a Virgin, according to the
   Scriptures, and became man, the Mediator between God and man, etc.
   [1511] 512

   III. Lucianus is known also by his critical revision of the text of the
   Septuagint and the Greek Testament. Jerome mentions that copies were
   known in his day as "exemplaria Lucianea," but in other places he
   speaks rather disparagingly of the texts of Lucian, and of Hesychius, a
   bishop of Egypt (who distinguished himself in the same field). In the
   absence of definite information it is impossible to decide the merits
   of his critical labors. His Hebrew scholarship is uncertain, and hence
   we do not know whether his revision of the Septuagint was made from the
   original. [1512] 513

   As to the New Testament, it is likely that he contributed much towards
   the Syrian recension (if we may so call it), which was used by
   Chrysostom and the later Greek fathers, and which lies at the basis of
   the textus receptus. [1513] 514

   of the Synod of Antioch ascribed it to him, and also that a Semi-Arian
   synod in Caria, 367, adopted it under his name (VI. 12). It is regarded
   as genuine by Cave, Bssnage, Bull, Hahn, Dorner, but questioned either
   in whole or in part by Routh (I. 16), Hefele, Keim, Harnack, and

   which was enlarged by the Antiochian synod. The concluding anathema is

   Lucian is the reputed founder of the Antiochian School of theology,
   which was more fully developed in the fourth century. He shares this
   honor with his friend Dorotheus, likewise a presbyter of Antioch, who
   is highly spoken of by Eusebius as a biblical scholar acquainted with
   Hebrew. [1514] 515 But the real founders of that school are Diodorus,
   bishop of Tarsus (c. a.d. 379-394), and Theodorus, bishop of Mopsuestia
   (393-428), both formerly presbyters of Antioch.

   The Antiochian School was not a regular institution with a continuous
   succession of teachers, like the Catechetical School of Alexandria, but
   a theological tendency, more particularly a peculiar type of
   hermeneutics and exegesis which had its centre in Antioch. The
   characteristic features are, attention to the revision of the text, a
   close adherence to the plain, natural meaning according to the use of
   language and the condition of the writer, and justice to the human
   factor. In other words, its exegesis is grammatical and historical, in
   distinction from the allegorical method of the Alexandrian School. Yet,
   as regards textual criticism, Lucian followed in the steps of Origen.
   Nor did the Antiochians disregard the spiritual sense, and the divine
   element in the Scriptures. The grammatico-historical exegesis is
   undoubtedly the only safe and sound basis for the understanding of the
   Scriptures as of any other book; and it is a wholesome check upon the
   wild licentiousness of the allegorizing method which often substitutes
   imposition for exposition. But it may lead to different results in
   different hands, according to the spirit of the interpreter. The Arians
   and Nestorians claimed descent from, or affinity with, Lucian and his
   school; but from the same school proceeded also the prince of
   commentators among the fathers, John Chrysostom, the eulogist of Lucian
   and Diodorus, and the friend and fellow student of Theodore of
   Mopsuestia. Theodoret followed in the same line.

   After the condemnation of Nestorius, the Antiochian theology continued
   to be cultivated at Nisibis and Edessa among the Nestorians.

   Notes.

   Cardinal Newman, when still an Anglican (in his book on Arians of the
   Fourth Century, p. 414) made the Syrian School of biblical criticism
   responsible for the Arian heresy, and broadly maintained that the
   "mystical interpretation and orthodoxy will stand or fall together."
   But Cardinal Hergenröther, who is as good a Catholic and a better
   scholar, makes a proper distinction between use and abuse, and gives
   the following fair and discriminating statement of the relation between
   the Antiochian and Alexandrian schools, and the critical and mystical
   method of interpretation to which a Protestant historian can fully
   assent. (Handbuch der allgem. Kirchengeschichte. Freiburg i. B. 2nd ed.
   1879, vol. I. p. 281.)

   "Die Schule von Antiochien hatte bald den Glanz der Alexandrinischen
   erreicht, ja sogar überstrahlt. Beide konnten sich vielfach ergänzen,
   da jede ihre eigenthümliche Entwicklung, Haltung und Methode hatte,
   konnten aber auch eben wegen iherer Verschiedenheit leicht unter sich
   in Kampf und auf Abwege von der Kirchenlehre gerathen. Während bei den
   Alexandrinern eine speculativ-intuitive, zum Mystischen sich
   hinneigende Richtung hervortrat, war bei den Antiochenern eine
   logisch-reflectirende, durchaus nüchterne Verstandesrichtung
   vorherrschend. Während jene enge an die platonische Philosophie sich
   anschlossen und zwar vorherrschend in der Gestalt, die sie unter dem
   hellenistischen Juden Philo gewonnen hatte, waren die Antiochener einem
   zum Stoicismus hinneigenden Eklekticismus, dann der Aristotelischen
   Schule ergeben, deren scharfe Dialektik ganz ihrem Geiste zusagte.
   Demgemäss wurde in der alexandrinischen Schule, vorzugsweise die
   allegorisch-mystische Erklärung der heiligen Schrift gepflegt, in der
   Antiochenischen dagegen die buchstäbliche, grammatisch-logische und
   historische Interpretation, ohne dass desshalb der mystische Sinn und
   insbesondere die Typen des Alten Bundes gänzlich in Abrede gestellt
   worden wären. Die Origenisten suchen die Unzulänglichkeit des blossen
   buchstäblichen Sinnes und die Nothwendigkeit der allegorischen
   Auslegung nachzuweisen, da der Wortlaut vieler biblischen Stellen
   Falsches, Widersprechendes, Gottes Unwürdiges ergebe; sie fehlten hier
   durch das Uebermass des Allegorisirens und durch Verwechslung der
   figürlichen Redeweisen, die dem Literalsinne angehören, mit der
   mystischen Deutung; sie verflüchtigten oft den historischen Gehalt der
   biblischen Erzählung, hinter deren äusserer Schale sie einen
   verborgenen Kern suchen zu müssen glaubten. Damit stand ferner in
   Verbindung, dass in der alexandrinischen Schule das Moment des
   Uebervernünftigen, Unausprechlichen, Geheimnissvollen in den göttlichen
   Dingen stark betont wurde, während die Antiochener vor Allem das
   Vernunftgemässe, dem menschlichen Geiste Entsprechende in den Dogmen
   hervorhoben, das Christenthum als eine das menschliche Denken
   befriedligende Wahrheit nachzuweisen suchten. Indem sie aber dieses
   Streben verfolgten, wollten die hervorragen den Lehrer der
   antiochenischen Schule keineswegs den übernatürlichen Charakter und die
   Mysterien der Kirchenlehre bestreiten, sie erkannten diese in der
   Mehrzahl an, wie Chrysotomus und Theodoret; aber einzelne Gelehrte
   konnten über dem Bemühen, die Glaubenslehren leicht verständlich und
   begreiflich zu machen, ihren Inhalt verunstalten und zerstören."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1514] Euseb. H. E. VII. 32 (in the beginning) speaks of Dorotheos as
   having known him personally. He calls him " a learned man (Logion
   andra) who was honored with the rank of presbyter of Antioch" at the
   time of bishop Cyrillus, and " a man of fine taste in sacred
   literature, much devoted to the study of the Hebrew languages so that
   he read the Hebrew Scriptures with great facility."He adds that he "
   was of a very liberal mind and not unacquainted with the preparatory
   studies pursued among the Greeks, but in other respects a eunuch by
   nature, having been such from his birth."

   The Western church in this period exhibits no such scientific
   productiveness as the Eastern. The apostolic church was predominantly
   Jewish, the ante-Nicene church, Greek, the post-Nicene, Roman. The
   Roman church itself was first predominantly Greek, and her earliest
   writers--Clement, Hermas, Irenaeus, Hippolytus--wrote exclusively in
   Greek. Latin Christianity begins to appear in literature at the end of
   the second century, and then not in Italy, but in North Africa, not in
   Rome, but in Carthage, and very characteristically, not with converted
   speculative philosophers, but with practical lawyers and rhetoricians.
   This literature does not gradually unfold itself, but appears at once
   under a fixed, clear stamp, with a strong realistic tendency. North
   Africa also gave to the Western church the fundamental book--the Bible
   in its first Latin Version, the so-called Itala, and this was the basis
   of Jerome's Vulgata which to this day is the recognized standard Bible
   of Rome. There were, however, probably several Latin versions of
   portions of the Bible current in the West before Jerome.

   I. Life of Tertullian.

   Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus is the father of the Latin
   theology and church language, and one of the greatest men of Christian
   antiquity. We know little of his life but what is derived from his book
   and from the brief notice of Jerome in his catalogue of illustrious
   men. But few writers have impressed their individuality so strongly in
   their books as this African father. In this respect, as well as in
   others, he resembles St. Paul, and Martin Luther. He was born about the
   year 150, at Carthage, the ancient rival of Rome, where his father was
   serving as captain of a Roman legion under the proconsul of Africa. He
   received a liberal Graeco-Roman education; his writings manifest an
   extensive acquaintance with historical, philosophical, poetic, and
   antiquarian literature, and with juridical terminology and all the arts
   of an advocate. He seems to have devoted himself to politics and
   forensic eloquence, either in Carthage or in Rome. Eusebius calls him
   "a man accurately acquainted with the Roman laws," [1515] 516 and many
   regard him as identical with the Tertyllus, or Tertullianus, who is the
   author of several fragments in the Pandects.

   To his thirtieth or fortieth year he lived in heathen blindness and
   licentiousness. [1516] 517 Towards the end of the second century be
   embraced Christianity, we know not exactly on what occasion, but
   evidently from deepest conviction, and with all the fiery energy of his
   soul; defended it henceforth with fearless decision against heathens,
   Jews, and heretics; and studied the strictest morality of life. His own
   words may be applied to himself: "Fiunt, non nascuntur Christiani." He
   was married, and gives us a glowing picture of Christian family life,
   to which we have before referred; but in his zeal for every form of
   self-denial, he set celibacy still higher, and advised his wife, in
   case he should die before her to remain a widow, or, at least never to
   marry an unbelieving husband; and he afterwards put second marriage
   even on a level with adultery. He entered the ministry of the Catholic
   church, [1517] 518 first probably in Carthage, perhaps in Rome, where
   at all events he spent some time [1518] 519 but, like Clement of
   Alexandria and Origen, he never rose above the rank of presbyter.

   Some years after, between 199 and 203, he joined the puritanic, though
   orthodox, sect of the Montanists. Jerome attributes this change to
   personal motives, charging it to the envy and insults of the Roman
   clergy, from whom he himself experienced many an indignity. [1519] 520
   But Tertullian was inclined to extremes from the first, especially to
   moral austerity. He was no doubt attracted by the radical contempt for
   the world, the strict asceticism, the severe discipline, the martyr
   enthusiasm, and the chiliasm of the Montanists, and was repelled by the
   growing conformity to the world in the Roman church, which just at that
   period, under Zephyrinus and Callistus, openly took under its
   protection a very lax penitential discipline, and at the same time,
   though only temporarily, favored the Patripassian error of Praxeas, an
   opponent of the Montanists. Of this man Tertullian therefore says, in
   his sarcastic way: He has executed in Rome two works of the devil; has
   driven out prophecy (the Montanistic) and brought in heresy (the
   Patripassian); has turned off the Holy Ghost and crucified the Father.
   [1520] 521 Tertullian now fought the catholics, or the psychicals, as
   he frequently calls them, with the same inexorable sternness with which
   he had combated the heretics. The departures of the Montanists,
   however, related more to points of morality and discipline than of
   doctrine; and with all his hostility to Rome, Tertullian remained a
   zealous advocate of the catholic faith, and wrote, even from his
   schismatic position, several of his most effective works against the
   heretics, especially the Gnostics. Indeed, as a divine, he stood far
   above this fanatical sect, and gave it by his writings an importance
   and an influence in the church itself which it certainly would never
   otherwise have attained.

   He labored in Carthage as a Montanist presbyter and an author, and
   died, as Jerome says, in decrepit old age, according to some about the
   year 220, according to others not till 240; for the exact time, as well
   as the manner of his death, are unknown. His followers in Africa
   propagated themselves, under the name of "Tertullianists," down to the
   time of Augustin in the fifth century, and took perhaps a middle place
   between the proper Montanists and the catholic church. That he ever
   returned into the bosom of Catholicism is an entirely groundless
   opinion.

   Strange that this most powerful defender of old catholic orthodoxy and
   the teacher of the high-churchly Cyprian, should have been a schismatic
   and all antagonist of Rome. But he had in his constitution the tropical
   fervor and acerbity of the Punic character, and that bold spirit of
   independence in which his native city of Carthage once resisted,
   through more than a hundred years' war, [1521] 522 the rising power of
   the seven-hilled city on the Tiber. He truly represents the African
   church, in which a similar antagonism continued to reveal itself, not
   only among the Donatists, but even among the leading advocates of
   Catholicism. Cyprian died at variance with Rome on the question of
   heretical baptism; and Augustin, with all his great services to the
   catholic system of faith, became at the same time, through the
   anti-Peligian doctrines of sin and grace, the father of evangelical
   Protestantism and of semi-Protestant Jansenism.

   Hippolytus presents several interesting points of contact. He was a
   younger contemporary of Tertullian though they never met is far as we
   know. Both were champions of catholic orthodoxy against heresy, and yet
   both opposed to Rome. Hippolytus charged two popes with heresy as well
   as laxity of discipline; and yet in view of his supposed repentance and
   martyrdom (as reported by Prudentius nearly two hundred years
   afterwards), he was canonized in the Roman church; while such honor was
   never conferred upon the African, though he was a greater and more
   useful man.

   II. Character. Tertullian was a rare genius, perfectly original and
   fresh, but angular, boisterous and eccentric; full of glowing fantasy,
   pointed wit, keen discernment, polemic dexterity, and moral
   earnestness, but wanting in clearness, moderation, and symmetrical
   development. He resembled a foaming mountain torrent rather than a
   calm, transparent river in the valley. His vehement temper was never
   fully subdued, although he struggled sincerely against it. [1522] 523
   He was a man of strong convictions, and never hesitated to express them
   without fear or favor.

   Like almost all great men, he combined strange contrarieties of
   character. Here we are again reminded of Luther; though the reformer
   had nothing of the ascetic gloom and rigor of the African father, and
   exhibits instead with all his gigantic energy, a kindly serenity and
   childlike simplicity altogether foreign to the latter. Tertullian
   dwells enthusiastically on the divine foolishness of the gospel, and
   has a sublime contempt for the world, for its science and its art; and
   yet his writings are a mine of antiquarian knowledge, and novel,
   striking, and fruitful ideas. He calls the Grecian philosophers the
   patriarchs of all heresies, and scornfully asks: "What has the academy
   to do with the church? what has Christ to do with Plato--Jerusalem with
   Athens?" He did not shrink from insulting the greatest natural gift of
   God to man by his "Credo quia absurdum est." And yet reason does him
   invaluable service against his antagonists. [1523] 524 He vindicates
   the principle of church authority and tradition with great force and
   ingenuity against all heresy; yet, when a Montanist, he claims for
   himself with equal energy the right of private judgment and of
   individual protest. [1524] 525 He has a vivid sense of the corruption
   of human nature and the absolute need of moral regeneration; yet he
   declares the soul to be born Christian, and unable to find rest except
   in Christ. "The testimonies of the soul, says he, "are as true as they
   are simple; as simple as they are popular; as popular as they are
   natural; as natural as they are divine." He is just the opposite of the
   genial, less vigorous, but more learned and comprehensive Origen. He
   adopts the strictest supranatural principles; and yet he is a most
   decided realist, and attributes body, that is, as it were, a corporeal,
   tangible substantiality, even to God and to the soul; while the
   idealistic Alexandrian cannot speak spiritually enough of God, and can
   conceive the human soul without and before the existence of the body.
   Tertullian's theology revolves about the great Pauline antithesis of
   sin and grace, and breaks the road to the Latin anthropology and
   soteriology afterwards developed by his like-minded, but clearer,
   calmer, and more considerate countryman, Augustin. For his opponents,
   be they heathens, Jews, heretics, or Catholics, he has as little
   indulgence and regard as Luther. With the adroitness of a special
   pleader he entangles them in self-contradictions, pursues them into
   every nook and corner, overwhelms them with arguments, sophisms,
   apophthegms, and sarcasms, drives them before him with unmerciful
   lashings, and almost always makes them ridiculous and contemptible. His
   polemics everywhere leave marks of blood. It is a wonder that he was
   not killed by the heathens, or excommunicated by the Catholics.

   His style is exceedingly characteristic, and corresponds with his
   thought. It is terse, abrupt, laconic, sententious, nervous,
   figurative, full of hyperbole, sudden turns, legal technicalities,
   African provincialisms, or rather antiquated or vulgar latinisms.
   [1525] 526 It abounds in latinized Greek words, and new expressions, in
   roughnesses, angles, and obscurities; sometimes, like a grand volcanic
   eruption, belching precious stones and dross in strange confusion; or
   like the foaming torrent tumbling over the precipice of rocks and
   sweeping all before it. His mighty spirit wrestles with the form, and
   breaks its way through the primeval forest of nature's thinking. He had
   to create the church language of the Latin tongue. [1526] 527

   In short, we see in this remarkable man both intellectually and
   morally, the fermenting of a new creation, but not yet quite set free
   from the bonds of chaotic darkness and brought into clear and beautiful
   order.

   Notes.

   I. Gems from Tertullian's writings.

   The philosophy of persecution:

   "Semen Est Sanguis Christianorum." (Apol. c. 50.)

   The human soul and Christianity (made for Christ, yet requiring a new
   birth):

   "Testimonium Animae Naturaliter. Christianae." (De Test. Anim. c. 2;
   see the passages quoted § 40, p. 120.)

   "Fiunt, non, nascuntur Christiani." (Apol. 18. De Test. Anim. 1)

   Christ the Truth, not Habit (versus traditionalism):

   "Christus Veritas Est, Non Consuetudo." (De Virg. vel 1.)

   General priesthood of the laity (versus an exclusive hierarchy):

   "Nonne Et Laici Sacerdotes Sumus? "(De Exhort. Cast. 7.)

   Religious Liberty, an inalienable right of man (versus compulsion and
   persecution:

   "Humani Juris Et Naturalis Potestatis Est Unicuique Quod Putaverit
   Colere." (Ad Scap. 2; comp. Apol. 14 and the passages quoted § 13, p.
   35.)

   Dr. Baur (Kirchengesch.I. 428) says: "It is remarkable how already the
   oldest Christian Apologists, in vindicating the Christian faith, were
   led to assert the Protestant principle of freedom of faith and
   conscience "[and we must add, of public worship], "as an inherent
   attribute of the conception of religion against their heathen
   opponents." Then he quotes Tertullian, as the first who gave clear
   expression to this principle.

   II. Estimates of Tertullian as a man and an author.

   Neander (Ch. Hist. I. 683 sq., Torrey's translation): "Tertullian
   presents special claims to attention, both as the first representative
   of the theological tendency in the North-African church, and as a
   representative of the Montanistic mode of thinking. He was a man of an
   ardent and profound spirit, of warm and deep feelings; inclined to give
   himself up, with his whole soul and strength, to the object of his
   love, and sternly to repel everything that was foreign from this. He
   possessed rich and various stores of knowledge; which had been
   accumulated, however, at random, and without scientific arrangement.
   His profoundness of thought was not united with logical clearness and
   sobriety: an ardent, unbridled imagination, moving in a world of
   sensuous images, governed him. His fiery and passionate disposition,
   and his previous training as an advocate and rhetorician, easily
   impelled him, especially in controversy, to rhetorical exaggerations.
   When he defends a cause, of whose truth he was convinced, we often see
   in him the advocate, whose sole anxiety is to collect together all the
   arguments which can help his case, it matters not whether they are true
   arguments or only plausible sophisms; and in such cases the very
   exuberance of his wit sometimes leads him astray from the simple
   feeling of truth. What must render this man a phenomenon presenting
   special claims to the attention of the Christian historian is the fact,
   that Christianity is the inspiring soul of his life and thoughts; that
   out of Christianity an entirely new and rich inner world developed
   itself to his mind: but the leaven of Christianity had first to
   penetrate through and completely refine that fiery, bold and withal
   rugged nature. We find the new wine in an old bottle; and the tang
   which it has contracted there, may easily embarrass the inexperienced
   judge. Tertullian often had more within him than he was able to
   express: the overflowing mind was at a loss for suitable forms of
   phraseology. He had to create a language for the new spiritual
   matter,--and that out of the rude Punic Latin,--without the aid of a
   logical and grammatical education, and as he was hurried along in the
   current of thoughts and feelings by his ardent nature. Hence the often
   difficult and obscure phraseology; but hence, too, the original and
   striking turns in his mode of representation. And hence this great
   church-teacher, who unites great gifts with great failings, has been so
   often misconceived by those who could form no friendship with the
   spirit which dwelt in so ungainly a form."

   Hase (Kirchengesch. p. 91, tenth ed.): "Die lateinische Kirche hatte
   fast nur Übersetzungen, bis Tertullianus, als Heide Rhetor und
   Sachwalter zu Rom, mit reicher griechischer Gelehrsamkeit, die auch der
   Kirchenvater gern sehen liess, Presbyter in seiner Vaterstadt Karthago,
   ein strenger, düsterer, feuriger Character, dem Christenthum aus
   punischem Latein eine Literatur errang, in welcher geistreiche
   Rhetorik, genialer so wie gesuchter Witz, der sinnliches Anfassen des
   Idealen, tiefes Gefühl and juridische Verstandesansicht mit einander
   ringen. Er hat der afrikanischen Kirche die Losung angegeben: Christus
   sprach: Ich bin die Wahrheit, nicht, das Herkommen. Er hat das
   Gottesbewusstsein in den Tiefen der Seele hochgehalten, aber ein Mann
   der Auctoritaet hat er die Thorheit des Evangeliums der Weltweisheit
   seiner Zeitgenossen, das Unglaubliche der Wunder Gottes dem gemeinen
   Weltverstande mit stolzer Ironie entgegengehalten. Seine Schriften,
   denen er unbedenklich Fremdes angeeignet und mit dent Gepraege seines
   Genius versehen hat, sind theils polemisch mit dem höchsten
   Selbstvertraun der katholischen Gesinnung gegen Heiden, Juden und
   Haeretiker, theils erbaulich; so jedoch, dass auch in jenen das
   Erbauliche, in diesen das Polemische für strenge Sitte und Zucht
   vorhanden ist "

   Hauck (Tertullian's Leben und Schriften, p. 1)  Unter den
   Schriftstellern der lateinischen Christenheit ist Tertullianeiner der
   bedeutendsten und intressantesten. Er ist der Anfänger der lateinischen
   Theologie, der nicht nur ihrer Sprache seinen Stempel aufgeprägt hat,
   sondern sie auch an die Bahn hinwies, welche sie lange einheilt. Seine
   Persönlichkeit hat ebensoviel Anziehendes als Abstossendes; denn wer
   könnte den Ernst seines sittlichen Strebens, den Reichthum und die
   Lebhaftigkeit seines Geistes, die Festigkeit seiner Ueberzeugung und
   die stürmische Kraft seiner Beredtsamkeit verkennen? Allein ebensowenig
   lässt sich übersehen, dass ihm in allen Dingen das Mass fehlte. Seine
   Erscheinung hat nichts Edles; er war nicht frei von Bizzarem, ja
   Gemeinem. So zeigen ihn seine Schriften, die Denkmäler seines Lebens Er
   war ein Mann, der sich in unaufhörlichen Streite bewegte: sein ganzes
   Wesen trägt die Spuren hievon "

   Cardinal Hergenröther, the first Roman Catholic church historian now
   living (for Döllinger was excommunicated in 1870), says of Tertullian
   (in his Kirchengesch. I. 168, second ed., 1879): "Strenge und ernst,
   oft beissend sarkastisch, in der, Sprache gedrängt und dunkel der
   heidnischen Philosophie durchaus abgeneigt, mit dem römischen Rechte
   sehr vertraut, hat er in seinen zahlreichen Schriften Bedeutendes für
   die Darstellung der Kirchlichen Lehre geleistet, und ungeachtet seines
   Uebertritts zu den Montanisten betrachteten ihn die späteren
   africanischen Schriftsteller, auch Cyprian, als Muster und Lehrer "

   Pressensé (Martyrs and Apoloqists, p. 375): "The African nationality
   gave to Christianity its most eloquent defender, in whom the intense
   vehemence, the untempered ardor of the race, appear purified indeed,
   but not subdued. No influence in the early ages could equal that of
   Tertullian; and his writings breathe a spirit of such undying power
   that they can never grow old, and even now render living, controversies
   which have been silent for fifteen centuries. We must seek the man in
   his own pages, still aglow with his enthusiasm and quivering with his
   passion, for the details of his personal history are very few. The man
   is, as it were, absorbed in the writer, and we can well understand it,
   for his writings embody his whole soul. Never did a man more fully
   infuse his entire moral life into his books, and act through his
   words."

   [1523] In a similar manner Luther, though himself one of the most
   original and fruitful thinkers, sometimes unreasonably abuses reason as
   the devil's mistress.

   [1524] In this apparent contradiction Luther resembles Tertullian: he
   fought Romanism with private judgment, and Zwinlianism, Anabaptists,
   and all sectarians ("Schwarm - und Rottengeister" as he called them)
   with catholic authority; he denounced "the damned heathen Aristotle,"
   as the father of Popish scholaisticism, and used scholastic
   distinctions in support of the ubiquity of Christ's body against
   Zwingli.

   d'Afrigue contribua ainsi dans une large part à la formation de la
   langue ecclésiastique de I' Occident, et ainsi elle exerça une
   influence décisive sur nos langues modernes. Mais il résulta de là une
   autre conséquence; cest que les textes fondamentaux de la littérature

   trouvèrent barbare et corrompue, ce qui plus tard donna occasion de la

   [1526] Ruhnken calls Tertullian "Latinitatis pessimum auctorem" and
   Bishop Kaye the harshest and most obscure of writers," but Niebuhr,
   (Lectures on Ancient History, vol. II. p. 54), Oehler (Op. III. 720),
   and Holmes (the translator of Tert. against Marcion, p. ix.) judge more
   favorably of his style, which is mostly " the terse and vigorous
   expression of terse and vigorous thought."Renan (Marc Aurèle, p. 456)
   calls Tertullian the strangest literary phenomenon "un mélange inouï de
   talent, de fausseté d'esprit, d'éloquence et de mauvais goût grand
   écrivain, si l'on admet que sacrifier toute grammaire et toute
   correction à l' effet sois bien écrire."Cardinal Newman calls him " the
   most powerful writer of the early centuries "(Tracts, Theol. and
   Eccles., p. 219).
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 197. The Writings of Tertullian.

   Tertullian developed an extraordinary literary activity in two
   languages between about 190 and 220. His earlier books in the Greek
   language, and some in the Latin, are lost. Those which remain are
   mostly short; but they are numerous, and touch nearly all departments
   of religious life. They present a graphic picture of the church of his
   day. Most of his works, according to internal evidence, fall in the
   first quarter of the third century, in the Montanistic period of his
   life, and among these many of his ablest writings against the heretics;
   while, on the other hand, the gloomy moral austerity, which predisposed
   him to Montanism, comes out quite strongly even in his earliest
   productions. [1527] 528

   His works may be grouped in three classes: apologetic; polemic or
   anti-heretical; and ethic or practical; to which may be added as a
   fourth class the expressly Montanistic tracts against the Catholics. We
   can here only mention the most important:

   1. In the Apologetic works against heathens and Jews, he pleads the
   cause of all Christendom, and deserves the thanks of all Christendom.
   Preëminent among them is the Apologeticus (or Apologeticum). [1528] 529
   It was composed in the reign of Septimius Severus, between 197 and 200.
   It is unquestionably one of the most beautiful monuments of the heroic
   age of the church. In this work, Tertullian enthusiastically and
   triumphantly repels the attacks of the heathens upon the new religion,
   and demands for it legal toleration and equal rights with the other
   sects of the Roman empire. It is the first plea for religious liberty,
   as an inalienable right which God has given to every man, and which the
   civil government in its own interest should not only tolerate but
   respect and protect. He claims no support, no favor, but simply
   justice. The church was in the first three centuries a self-supporting
   and self-governing society (as it ought always to be), and no burden,
   but a blessing to the state, and furnished to it the most peaceful and
   useful citizens. The cause of truth and justice never found a more
   eloquent and fearless defender in the very face of despotic power, and
   the blazing fires of persecution, than the author of this book. It
   breathes from first to last the assurance of victory in apparent
   defeat.

   "We conquer," are his concluding words to the prefects and judges of
   the Roman empire, "We conquer in dying; we go forth victorious at the
   very time we are subdued .... Many of your writers exhort to the
   courageous bearing of pain and death, as Cicero in the Tusculans, as
   Seneca in his Chances, as Diogenes, Pyrrhus, Callinicus. And yet their
   words do not find so many disciples as Christians do, teachers not by
   words, but by their deeds. That very obstinacy you rail against is the
   preceptress. For who that contemplates it is not excited to inquire
   what is at the bottom of it? Who, after inquiry, does not embrace our
   doctrines? And, when he has embraced them, desires not to suffer that
   he may become partaker of the fulness of God's grace, that he may
   obtain from God complete forgiveness, by giving in exchange his blood?
   For that secures the remission of all offences. On this account it is
   that we return thanks on the very spot for your sentences. As the
   divine and human are ever opposed to each other, when we are condemned
   by you, we are acquitted by the Highest."

   The relation of the Apologeticus to the Octavius of Minucius Felix will
   be discussed in the next section. But even if Tertullian should have
   borrowed from that author (as he undoubtedly borrowed, without
   acknowledgment, much matter from Irenaeus, in his book against the
   Valentinians), he remains one of the most original and vigorous
   writers. [1529] 530 Moreover the plan is different; Minucius Felix
   pleads for Christianity as a philosopher before philosophers, to
   convince the intellect; Tertullian as a lawyer and advocate before
   judges, to induce them to give fair play to the Christians, who were
   refused even a hearing in the courts.

   The beautiful little tract "On the Testimony of the Soul," (6 chapters)
   is a supplement to the Apologeticus, and furnishes one of the strongest
   positive arguments for Christianity. Here the human soul is called to
   bear witness to the one true God: it springs from God, it longs for
   God; its purer and nobler instincts and aspirations, if not diverted
   and perverted by selfish and sinful passions, tend upwards and
   heavenwards, and find rest and peace only in God. There is, we may say,
   a pre-established harmony between the soul and the Christian religion;
   they are made for each other; the human soul is constitutionally
   Christian. And this testimony is universal, for as God is everywhere,
   so the human soul is everywhere. But its testimony turns against itself
   if not heeded.

   "Every soul," he concludes, "is a culprit as well as a witness: in the
   measure that it testifies for truth, the guilt of error lies on it; and
   on the day of judgment it will stand before the court of God, without a
   word to say. Thou proclaimedst God, O soul, but thou didst not seek to
   know Him; evil spirits were detested by thee, and yet they were the
   objects of thy adoration; the punishments of hell were foreseen by
   thee, but no care was taken to avoid them; thou hadst a savor of
   Christianity, and withal wert the persecutor of Christians."

   2. His polemic works are occupied chiefly with the refutation of the
   Gnostics. Here belongs first of all his thoroughly catholic tract." On
   the Prescription of Heretics." [1530] 531 It is of a general character
   and lays down the fundamental principle of the church in dealing with
   heresy. Tertullian cuts off all errors and neologies at the outset from
   the right of legal contest and appeal to the holy Scriptures, because
   these belong only to the catholic church as the legitimate heir and
   guardian of Christianity. Irenaeus had used the same argument, but
   Tertullian gave it a legal or forensic form. The same argument,
   however, turns also against his own secession; for the difference
   between heretics and schismatics is really only relative, at least in
   Cyprian's view. Tertullian afterwards asserted, in contradiction with
   this book, that in religious matters not custom nor long possession,
   but truth alone, was to be consulted.

   Among the heretics, he attacked chiefly the Valentinian Gnostics, and
   Marcion. The work against Marcion (A. D. 208) is his largest, and the
   only one in which he indicates the date of composition, namely the 15th
   year of the reign of Septimius Severus (A. D. 208). [1531] 532 He wrote
   three works against this famous heretic; the first he set aside as
   imperfect, the second was stolen from him and published with many
   blunders before it was finished. In the new work (in five books), he
   elaborately defends the unity of God, the Creator of all, the integrity
   of the Scriptures, and the harmony of the Old and New Testaments. He
   displays all his power of solid argument, subtle sophistry, ridicule
   and sarcasm, and exhausts his vocabulary of vituperation. He is more
   severe upon heretics than Jews or Gentiles. He begins with a graphic
   description of all the physical abnormities of Pontus, the native
   province of Marcion, and the gloomy temper, wild passions, and
   ferocious habits of its people, and then goes on to say:

   "Nothing in Pontus is so barbarous and sad as the fact that Marcion was
   born there, fouler than any Scythian, more roving than the Sarmatian,
   more inhuman than the Massagete, more audacious than an Amazon, darker
   than the cloud of the Euxine, colder than its winter, more brittle than
   its ice, more deceitful than the Ister, more craggy than Caucasus. Nay,
   more, the true Prometheus, Almighty God, is mangled by Marcion's
   blasphemies. Marcion is more savage than even the beasts of that
   barbarous region. For what beaver was ever a greater emasculator than
   he who has abolished the nuptial bond? What Pontic mouse ever had such
   gnawing powers as he who has gnawed the Gospel to pieces? Verily, O
   Euxine, thou hast produced a monster more credible to philosophers than
   to Christians. For the cynic Diogenes used to go about, lantern in
   hand, at mid-day, to find a man; whereas Marcion has quenched the light
   of his faith, and so lost the God whom he had found."

   The tracts "On Baptism" "On the Soul," "On the Flesh of Christ," "On
   the Resurrection of the Flesh" "Against Hermogenes," "Against Praxeas,"
   are concerned with particular errors, and are important to the doctrine
   of baptism, to Christian psychology, to eschatology, and christology.

   3. His numerous Practical or Ascetic treatises throw much light on the
   moral life of the early church, as contrasted with the immorality of
   the heathen world. Among these belong the books "On Prayer" "On
   Penance" "On Patience,"--a virtue, which he extols with honest
   confession of his own natural impatience and passionate temper, and
   which he urges upon himself as well as others,--the consolation of the
   confessors in prison (Ad Martyres), and the admonition against visiting
   theatres (De Spectaculis), which he classes with the pomp of the devil,
   and against all share, direct or indirect, in the worship of idols (De
   Idololatria).

   4. His strictly Montanistic or anti-catholic writings, in which the
   peculiarities of this sect are not only incidentally touched, as in
   many of the works named above, but vindicated expressly and at large,
   are likewise of a practical nature, and contend, in fanatical rigor,
   against the restoration of the lapsed (De Pudicitia), flight in
   persecutions, second marriage (De Monogamia, and De Exhortatione
   Castitatis), display of dress in females (De Cultu Feminarum), and
   other customs of the "Psychicals," as he commonly calls the Catholics
   in distinction from the sectarian Pneumatics. His plea, also, for
   excessive fasting (De Jejuniis), and his justification of a Christian
   soldier, who was discharged for refusing to crown his head (De Corona
   Militis), belong here. Tertullian considers it unbecoming the followers
   of Christ, who, when on earth, wore a crown of thorns for us, to adorn
   their heads with laurel, myrtle, olive, or with flowers or gems. We may
   imagine what he would have said to the tiara of the pope in his
   mediaeval splendor.

   Notes.

   The chronological order of Tertullian's work can be approximately
   determined by the frequent allusions to the contemporaneous history of
   the Roman empire, and by their relation to Montanism. See especially
   Uhlhorn, Hauck, Bonwetsch, and also Bp. Kaye (in Oehler's ed. of the
   Opera III. 709-718.) We divide the works into three classes, according
   to their relation to Montanism.

   (1) Those books which belong to the author's catholic period before
   a.d. 200; viz.: Apologeticus or Apologeticum (in the autumn of 197,
   according to Bonwetsch; 198, Ebert; 199, Hesselberg; 200, Uhlhorn); Ad
   Martyres (197); Ad Nationes (probably soon after Apol.); De Testimonio
   Animae; De Poenitentia; De Oratione; De Baptismo (which according to
   cap. 15, was preceded by a Greek work against the validity of Heretical
   Baptism); Ad Uxorem; De Patientia; Adv. Judaeos; De Praescriptione
   Haereticorum; De Spectaculis (and a lost work on the same subject in
   the Greek language).

   Kaye puts De Spectaculis in the Montanistic period. De Praescriptione
   is also placed by some in the Montanistic period before or after Adv.
   Marcionem. But Bonwetsch (p. 46) puts it between 199 and 206, probably
   in 199. Hauck makes it almost simultaneous with De Baptismo. He also
   places De Idololatria in this period.

   (2) Those which were certainly not composed till after his transition
   to Montanism, between a.d. 200 and 220; viz.: Adv. Marcionem (5 books,
   composed in part at least in the 15th year of the Emperor Septimius
   Severus, i.e. a.d. 207 or 208; comp. I. 15); De Anima; De Carne
   Christi; De Resurrectione Carnis; Adv. Praxean; Scorpiace (i.e.
   antidote against the poison of the Gnostic heresy); De Corona Militis;
   De Virginibus ve!andis; De Exhortatione Castitatis; De Pallio (208 or
   209); De Fuga in persecutione; De Monogamia; De Jejuniis; De Pudicitia;
   Ad Scapulam (212); De Ecstasi (lost); De Spe Fidelium (likewise lost).

   Kellner (1870) assigns De Pudicitia, De Monogamia, De Jejunio, and Adv.
   Praxean to the period between 218 and 222.

   (3) Those which probably belong to the Montanistic period; viz.: Adv.
   Valentinianos; De cultu Feminarum (2 libri); Adv. Hermogenem.

   against heretical assailants; but its force is weakened by Tertullian's
   Montanism.

   Wissenschaften"); W. Hartel (in Zeitschrift für d. öester. Gymnas.

   des Min. Fel. in "Jahr b. für Prot. Theol.' " 1883, p. 263-294).

   In close connection with Tertullian, either shortly before, or shortly
   after him, stands the Latin Apologist Minucius Felix. [1532] 533

   Converts are always the most zealous, and often the most effective
   promoters of the system or sect which they have deliberately chosen
   from honest and earnest conviction. The Christian Apologists of the
   second century were educated heathen philosophers or rhetoricians
   before their conversion, and used their secular learning and culture
   for the refutation of idolatry and the vindication of the truths of
   revelation. In like manner the Apostles were Jews by birth and
   training, and made their knowledge of the Old Testament Scriptures
   subservient to the gospel. The Reformers of the sixteenth century came
   out of the bosom of mediaeval Catholicism, and were thus best qualified
   to oppose its corruptions and to emancipate the church from the bondage
   of the papacy. [1533] 534

   I. Marcus Minucius Felix belongs to that class of converts, who brought
   the rich stores of classical culture to the service of Christianity. He
   worthily opens the series of Latin writers of the Roman church which
   had before spoken to the world only in the Greek tongue. He shares with
   Lactantius the honor of being the Christian Cicero. [1534] 535 He did
   not become a clergyman, but apparently continued in his legal
   profession. We know nothing of his life except that he was an advocate
   in Rome, but probably of North African descent. [1535] 536

   II. We have from him an apology of Christianity, in the form of a
   dialogue under the title Octavius. [1536] 537 The author makes with his
   friend Octavius Januarius, who had, like himself, been converted from
   heathen error to the Christian truth an excursion from Rome to the
   sea-bath at Ostia. There they meet on a promenade along the beach with
   Caecilius Natalis, another friend of Minucius, but still a heathen,
   and, as appears from his reasoning, a philosopher of the sceptical
   school of the New Academy. Sitting down on the large stones which were
   placed there for the protection of the baths, the two friends in full
   view of the ocean and inhaling the gentle sea breeze, begin, at the
   suggestion of Caecilius, to discuss the religious question of the day.
   Minucius sitting between them is to act as umpire (chaps. 1-4).

   Caecilius speaks first (chs. 5-15), in defence of the heathen, and in
   opposition to the Christian, religion. He begins like a sceptic or
   agnostic concerning the existence of a God as being doubtful, but he
   soon shifts his ground, and on the principle of expediency and utility
   he urges the duty of worshipping the ancestral gods. It is best to
   adhere to what the experience of all nations has found to be salutary.
   Every nation has its peculiar god or gods; the Roman nation, the most
   religious of all, allows the worship of all gods, and thus attained to
   the highest power and prosperity. He charges the Christians with
   presumption for claiming a certain knowledge of the highest problems
   which lie beyond human ken; with want of patriotism for forsaking the
   ancestral traditions; with low breeding (as Celsus did). He ridicules
   their worship of a crucified malefactor and the instrument of his
   crucifixion, and even an ass's head. He repeats the lies of secret
   crimes, as promiscuous incest, and the murder of innocent children, and
   quotes for these slanders the authority of the celebrated orator
   Fronto. He objects to their religion that it has no temples, nor
   altars, nor images. He attacks their doctrines of one God, of the
   destruction of the present world, the resurrection and judgment, as
   irrational and absurd. He pities them for their austere habits and
   their aversion to the theatre, banquets, and other innocent enjoyments.
   He concludes with the re-assertion of human ignorance of things which
   are above us, and an exhortation to leave those uncertain things alone,
   and to adhere to the religion of their fathers, "lest either a childish
   superstition should be introduced, or all religion should be
   overthrown."

   In the second part (ch. 16-38), Octavius refutes these charges, and
   attacks idolatry; meeting each point in proper order. He vindicates the
   existence and unity of the Godhead, the doctrine of creation and
   providence, as truly rational, and quotes in confirmation the opinions
   of various philosophers (from Cicero). He exposes the absurdity of the
   heathen mythology, the worship of idols made of wood and stone, the
   immoralities of the gods, and the cruelties and obscene rites connected
   with their worship. The Romans have not acquired their power by their
   religion, but by rapacity and acts of violence. The charge of
   worshipping a criminal and his cross, rests on the ignorance of his
   innocence and divine character. The Christians have no temples, because
   they will not limit the infinite God, and no images, because man is
   God's image, and a holy life the best sacrifice. The slanderous charges
   of immorality are traced to the demons who invented and spread them
   among the people, who inspire oracles, work false miracles and try in
   every way to draw men into their ruin. It is the heathen who practice
   such infamies, who cruelly expose their new-born children or kill them
   by abortion. The Christians avoid and abhor the immoral amusements of
   the theatre and circus where madness, adultery, and murder are
   exhibited and practiced, even in the name of the gods. They find their
   true pleasure and happiness in God, his knowledge and worship.

   At the close of the dialogue (chs. 39-40), Caecilius confesses himself
   convinced of his error, and resolves to embrace Christianity, and
   desires further instruction on the next day. Minucius expresses his
   satisfaction at this result, which made a decision on his part
   unnecessary. Joyful and thankful for the joint victory over error, the
   friends return from the sea-shore to Ostia. [1537] 538

   III. The apologetic value of this work is considerable, but its
   doctrinal value is very insignificant. It gives us a lively idea of the
   great controversy between the old and the new religion among the higher
   and cultivated classes of Roman society, and allows fair play and full
   force to the arguments on both sides. It is an able and eloquent
   defense of monotheism against polytheism, and of Christian morality
   against heathen immorality. But this is about all. The exposition of
   the truths of Christianity is meagre, superficial, and defective. The
   unity of the Godhead, his all-ruling providence, the resurrection of
   the body, and future retribution make up the whole creed of Octavius.
   The Scriptures, the prophets and apostles are ignored, [1538] 539 the
   doctrines of sin and grace, Christ and redemption, the Holy Spirit and
   his operations are left out of sight, and the name of Christ is not
   even mentioned; though we may reasonably infer from the manner in which
   the author repels the charge of worshipping "a crucified malefactor,"
   that he regarded Christ as more than a mere man (ch. 29). He leads only
   to the outer court of the temple. His object was purely apologetic, and
   he gained his point. [1539] 540 Further instruction is not excluded,
   but is solicited by the converted Caecilius at the close, "as being
   necessary to a perfect training." [1540] 541 We have therefore no right
   to infer from this silence that the author was ignorant of the deeper
   mysteries of faith. [1541] 542

   His philosophic stand-point is eclectic with a preference for Cicero,
   Seneca, and Plato. Christianity is to him both theoretically and
   practically the true philosophy which teaches the only true God, and
   leads to true virtue and piety. In this respect he resembles Justin
   Martyr. [1542] 543

   IV. The literary form of Octavius is very pleasing and elegant. The
   diction is more classical than that of any contemporary Latin writer
   heathen or Christian. The book bears a strong resemblance to Cicero's
   De Natura Deorum, in many ideas, in style, and the urbanity, or
   gentlemanly tone. Dean Milman says that it "reminds us of the golden
   days of Latin prose." Renan calls it "the pearl of the apologetic
   literature of the last years of Marcus Aurelius." But the date is under
   dispute, and depends in part on its relation to Tertullian.

   V. Time of composition. Octavius closely resembles Tertullian's
   Apologeticus, both in argument and language, so that one book
   presupposes the other; although the aim is different, the former being
   the plea of a philosopher and refined gentleman, the other the plea of
   a lawyer and ardent Christian. The older opinion (with some exceptions
   [1543] 544) maintained the priority of Apologeticus, and consequently
   put Octavius after A.D. 197 or 200 when the former was written. Ebert
   reversed the order and tried to prove, by a careful critical
   comparison, the originality of Octavius. [1544] 545 His conclusion is
   adopted by the majority of recent German writers, [1545] 546 but has
   also met with opposition. [1546] 547 If Tertullian used Minucius, he
   expanded his suggestions; if Minucius used Tertullian, he did it by way
   of abridgement.

   It is certain that Minucius borrowed from Cicero (also from Seneca,
   and, perhaps, from Athenagoras), [1547] 548 and Tertullian (in his Adv.
   Valent.) from Irenaeus; though both make excellent use of their
   material, reproducing rather than copying it; but Tertullian is beyond
   question a far more original, vigorous, and important writer. Moreover
   the Roman divines used the Greek language from Clement down to
   Hippolytus towards the middle of the third century, with the only
   exception, perhaps, of Victor (190-202). So far the probability is for
   the later age of Minucius.

   But a close comparison of the parallel passages seems to favor his
   priority; yet the argument is not conclusive. [1548] 549 The priority
   of Minucius has been inferred also from the fact that he twice mentions
   Fronto (the teacher and friend of Marcus Aurelius), apparently as a
   recent celebrity, and Fronto died about 168. Keim and Renan find
   allusions to the persecutions under Marcus Aurelius (177), and to the
   attack of Celsus (178), and hence put Octavius between 178 and 180.
   [1549] 550 But these assumptions are unfounded, and they would lead
   rather to the conclusion that the book was not written before 200; for
   about twenty years elapsed (as Keim himself supposes) before the
   Dialogue actually was recorded on paper.

   An unexpected argument for the later age of Minucius is furnished by
   the recent French discovery of the name of Marcus Caecilius Quinti F.
   Natalis, as the chief magistrate of Cirta (Constantine) in Algeria, in
   several inscriptions from the years 210 to 217. [1550] 551 The heathen
   speaker Caecilius Natalis of our Dialogue hailed from that very city
   (chs. 9 and 31). The identity of the two persons can indeed not be
   proven, but is at least very probable.

   Considering these conflicting possibilities and probabilities, we
   conclude that Octavius was written in the first quarter of the third
   century, probably during the peaceful reign of Alexander Severus (A. D.
   222-235). The last possible date is the year 250, because Cyprian's
   book De Idolorum Vanitate, written about that time is largely based
   upon it. [1551] 552
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1532] Jerome puts him after Tertullian (and Cyprian), Lactantius
   beforeTertullian.

   [1533] We may, also refer to more recent analogies: the ablest
   champions of Romanism-as Hurter, Newman, Manning, Brown, owe their
   intellectual and moral equipment to Protestantism; while the Old
   Catholic leaders of the opposition to Vatican Romanism--as Döllinger,
   Friedrich, Reinkens, Reusch, Langen, von Schulte--were formerly eminent
   teachers in the Roman church.

   [1534] Jerome decribes him as "in signis causidicis Romani fori," but
   he depended on Lactantius, who may have derived this simply from the
   introduction to the book, where the author speaks of taking advantage
   of the court holidays for an excursion to Ostia. The gens Minucia was
   famous in Rome, and an inscription (Gruter, p. 918) mentions one with
   the cognomen Felix

   [1535] From Cirta (now Constantine). This we must infer from the fact
   that he call Corn. Fronto "Cirtensis noster, " Octav. c. 9; comp. c.
   31, "tuus Fronto."

   [1536] In 40 (al. 41) short chapters which, in Halm's edition, cover 54
   pages, oct. The book was written several years after the Dialogue and
   after the death of Octavius (c. 1: "discedens or decedens vir eximius
   et sanctus immensum sui deside rium nobis reliquit, " etc.).

   [1537] "Post haec laeti hilaresque discessimus, Caecilius quod
   crediderit, Octavius gaudere [ad gaudendum] quod vicerit, ego [Minuc.
   Fel.] et quod hic crediderit et hie vicerit."

   [1538] The only traces are in chs. 29 and 34, which perhaps allude to
   Jer. 17:5 and I Cor. 15:36, 42.

   [1539] Keim supposes that he intended to refute Celsus (but he is
   nowhere mentioned); De Félice, that he aimed at Fronto (who is twice
   mentioned); Kühn better: public opinion, the ignorant prejudice of the
   higher classes against Christianity.

   [1540] C. 40: "Etiam nunc tamen aliqua consubsidunt non obstrepentia
   veritati, sed perfectae institutioni necessaria, de quibus crastino,
   quod iam sol occasu declivis est, ut de toto (oret die
   toto)congruentius, promptius requiremus."

   [1541] Renan (p. 402) takes a different view, namely that Minucius was
   a liberal Christian of the Deistic stamp, a man of the world "qui
   n'empêche ni la gaieté, ni le talent, ni le goût aimable de la vie, ni
   la recherche, de l'élégance du style. Que nous sommes loin de
   l'ébionite ou méme du juif de Galilée! Octavius, c'est Cicéron, ou
   mieux Fronton, devenu chrétien. En réalité, c'est par la culture
   intellectuelle qu'il arrive au déisme. Il aime la nature, il se plaît a
   la conversation des gens biens élevés. Des hommes faits sur ce modèle
   n'auraient créé ni l'Évangile ni l'Apocalypse; mais, réciproquement,
   sans de tels adhérents, l'Évangile, l'Apocalypse, les épItres de Paul
   fussent restés les éscrits secrets d'une secte ferméé, qui, comme les
   esséens ou les théapeutes, eut finlement disparu." Kühn, also,
   represents Minucius as a philosopher rather than a Christian, and seems
   to explain his silence on the specific doctrines of Christianity from
   ignorance. But no educated Christian could be ignorant of Christ and
   His work, nor of the prophets and apostles who were regularly read in
   public worship.

   [1542] On the philosophy of Minucius, see the analysis of Kühn, p. 21
   sqq.; 58 sqq.

   [1543] Blondel (1641), Daillé (1660), Rösler (1777), Russwurm (1824),
   doubted the priority of Tertullian. See Kühn, l.c., p. v.

   [1544] In his essay on the subject (1866), Ebert put Octavius between
   160 and the close of the second century; in his more recent work on the
   History of Christ. Lat. Lit. (1874), vol. I., p. 25, be assigns it more
   definitely to between 179 and 185 (" Anfang oder Mitte der achtziger
   Jahre des 2. Jahrh."). He assumes that Minucius used Athenagoras who
   wrote 177.

   [1545] Ueberweg (1866), Rönsch (Das n. T. Tertull. 1871), Keim (1873),
   Caspari (1875, III. 411), Herzog (1876), Hauck (1877), Bonwetsch
   (1878), Mangold (in Herzog2 1882), Kühn (1882), Renan (1882), Schwenke
   (1883). The last (pp. 292 and 294) puts the oral dialogue even so far
   back as Hadrian (before 137), and the composition before the death of
   Antoninus Pius (160).

   [1546] Hartel (1869), Jeep (1869), Klussmann (1878), Schultze (1881),
   and Salmon (1883). Hartel, while denying that Tertullian borrowed from
   Minucius, leaves the way open for an independent use of an older book
   by both. Schultze puts Minucius down to the reign of Domitian
   (300-303), which is much too late.

   [1547] Renan (p. 390) calls Minucius (although he puts him before
   Tertullian) a habitual plagiarist who often copies from Cicero without
   acknowledgment. Dombart (p. 135 sqq.), and Schwenke (p. 273 sqq.) prove
   his dependence on Seneca.

   [1548] The crucial test of relative priority applied by Ebert is the
   relation of the two books to Cicero. Minucius wrote with Cicero open
   before him; Tertullian shows no fresh reading of Cicero; consequently
   if the parallel passages contain traces of Cicero, Tertullian must have
   borrowed them from Minucius. But these traces in Tertullian are very
   few, and the inference is disputable. The application of this test has
   led Hartel and Salmon (in Smith and Wace, III. 92) to the opposite
   conclusion. And Schultze proves 1) that Minucius used other works of
   Tertullian besides the Apologeticus, and 2) that Minucius, in copying
   from Cicero, makes the same kind of verbal changes in copying from
   Tertullian.

   [1549] Chs. 29, 33, 37. I can find in these passages no proof of any
   particular violent persecution. Tortures are spoken of in ch. 37, but
   to these the Christians were always exposed. Upon the whole the
   situation of the church appears in the introductory chapters, and
   throughout the Dialogue, is a comparatively quiet one, such as we know
   it to have been at intervals between the imperial persecutions. This is
   also the impression of Schultze and Schwenke. Minucius is silent about
   the argument so current under Marcus Aurelius, that the Christians are
   responsible for all the public calamities.

   [1550] Mommsen, Corp. Lat. Inscript. VIII. 6996 and 7094-7098; Recueil
   de Constantine, 1869, p. 695. See an article by Dessau in "Hermes, "
   1880, t. xv., p. 471-74; Salmon, l.c., p. 924; and Renan, l.c., p.'090
   sq. Renan admits the possible identity of this Caecilius with the
   friend of Minucius, but suggests in the interest of his hypothesis that
   he was the son.

   [1551] V. Schultze denies Cyprian's authorship; but the book is
   attester by Jerome and Augustin.

   I. Life of Cyprian.

   Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus, bishop and martyr, and the impersonation
   of the catholic church of the middle of the third century, sprang from
   a noble and wealthy heathen family of Carthage, where he was born about
   the year 200, or earlier. His deacon and biographer, Pontius, considers
   his earlier life not worthy of notice in comparison with his subsequent
   greatness in the church. Jerome tells us, that he stood in high repute
   as a teacher of rhetoric. [1552] 553 He was, at all events, a man of
   commanding literary, rhetorical, and legal culture, and of eminent
   administrative ability which afterwards proved of great service to him
   in the episcopal office. He lived in worldly splendor to mature age,
   nor was he free from the common vices of heathenism, as we must infer
   from his own confessions. But the story, that he practised arts of
   magic arises perhaps from some confusion, and is at any rate
   unattested. Yet, after he became a Christian he believed, like
   Tertullian and others, in visions and dreams, and had some only a short
   time before his martyrdom.

   A worthy presbyter, Caecilius, who lived in Cyprian's house, and
   afterwards at his death committed his wife and children to him, first
   made him acquainted with the doctrines of the Christian religion, and
   moved him to read the Bible. After long resistance Cyprian forsook the
   world, entered the class of catechumens, sold his estates for the
   benefit of the poor, [1553] 554 took a vow of chastity, and in 245 or
   246 received baptism, adopting, out of gratitude to his spiritual
   father, the name of Caecilius.

   He himself, in a tract soon afterwards written to a friend, [1554] 555
   gives us the following oratorical description of his conversion: While
   I languished in darkness and deep night, tossing upon the sea of a
   troubled world, ignorant of my destination, and far from truth and
   light, I thought it, according to my then habits, altogether a
   difficult and hard thing that a man could be born anew, and that, being
   quickened to new life by the bath of saving water, he might put off the
   past, and, while preserving the identity of the body, might transform
   the man in mind and heart. How, said I, is such a change possible? How
   can one at once divest himself of all that was either innate or
   acquired and grown upon him?... Whence does he learn frugality, who was
   accustomed to sumptuous feasts? And how shall he who shone in costly
   apparel, in gold and purple, come down to common and simple dress? He
   who has lived in honor and station, cannot bear to be private and
   obscure .... But when, by the aid of the regenerating water, [1555] 556
   the stain of my former life was washed away, a serene and pure light
   poured from above into my purified breast. So soon as I drank the
   spirit from above and was transformed by a second birth into a new man,
   then the wavering mind became wonderfully firm; what had been closed
   opened; the dark became light; strength came for that which had seemed
   difficult; what I had thought impossible became practicable."

   Cyprian now devoted himself zealously, in ascetic retirement, to the
   study of the Scriptures and the church teachers, especially Tertullian,
   whom he called for daily with the words: "Hand me the master!" [1556]
   557 The influence of Tertullian on his theological formation is
   unmistakable, and appears at once, for example, on comparing the tracts
   of the two on prayer and on patience, or the work of the one on the
   vanity of idols with the apology of the other. It is therefore rather
   strange that in his own writings we find no acknowledgment of his
   indebtedness, and, as far as I recollect, no express allusion whatever
   to Tertullian and the Montanists. But he could derive no aid and
   comfort from him in his conflict with schism.

   Such a man could not long remain concealed. Only two years after his
   baptism, in spite of his earnest remonstrance, Cyprian was raised to
   the bishopric of Carthage by the acclamations of the people, and was
   thus at the same time placed at the head of the whole North African
   clergy. This election of a neophyte was contrary to the letter of the
   ecclesiastical laws (comp. 1 Tim. 3:6), and led afterwards to the
   schism of the party of Novatus. But the result proved, that here, as in
   the similar elevation of Ambrose, Augustin, and other eminent bishops
   of the ancient church, the voice of the people was the voice of God.

   For the space of ten years, ending with his triumphant martyrdom,
   Cyprian administered the episcopal office in Carthage with exemplary
   energy, wisdom, and fidelity, and that in a most stormy time, amidst
   persecutions from without and schismatic agitations within. The
   persecution under Valerian brought his active labors to a close. He was
   sent into exile for eleven months, then tried before the Proconsul, and
   condemned to be beheaded. When the sentence was pronounced, he said:
   "Thanks be to God," knelt in prayer, tied the bandage over his eyes
   with his own hand, gave to the executioner a gold piece, and died with
   the dignity and composure of a hero. His friends removed and buried his
   body by night. Two chapels were erected on the spots of his death and
   burial. The anniversary of his death was long observed; and five
   sermons of Augustin still remain in memory of Cyprian's martyrdom,
   Sept. 14, 258.

   II. Character and Position.

   As Origen was the ablest scholar, and Tertullian the strongest writer,
   so Cyprian was the greatest bishop, of the third century. He was born
   to be a prince in the church. In executive talent, he even surpassed
   all the Roman bishops of his time; and he bore himself towards them,
   also, as "frater" and "collega," in the spirit of full equality.
   Augustin calls him by, eminence, "the catholic bishop and catholic
   martyr;" and Vincentius of Lirinum, "the light of all saints, all
   martyrs, and all bishops." His stamp of character was more that of
   Peter than either of Paul or John.

   His peculiar importance falls not so much in the field of theology,
   where he lacks originality and depth, as in church organization and
   discipline. While Tertullian dealt mainly with heretics, Cyprian
   directed his polemics against schismatics, among whom he had to
   condemn, though he never does in fact, his venerated teacher, who died
   a Montanist. Yet his own conduct was not perfectly consistent with his
   position; for in the controversy on heretical baptism he himself
   exhibited his master's spirit of opposition to Rome. He set a limit to
   his own exclusive catholic principle of tradition by the truly
   Protestant maxims: "Consuetudo sine veritate vetustas erroris est, and,
   Non est de consuetudine praescribendum, sed ratione vincendum." In him
   the idea of the old catholic hierarchy and episcopal autocracy, both in
   its affinity and in its conflict with the idea of the papacy, was
   personally embodied, so to speak, and became flesh and blood. The unity
   of the church, as the vehicle and medium of all salvation, was the
   thought of his life and the passion of his heart. But he contended with
   the same zeal for an independent episcopate as for a Roman primacy; and
   the authority of his name has been therefore as often employed against
   the papacy as in its favor. On both sides he was the faithful organ of
   the churchly spirit of the age.

   It were great injustice to attribute his high churchly principle to
   pride and ambition, though temptations to this spirit unquestionably
   beset a prominent position like his. Such principles are, entirely
   compatible with sincere personal humility before God. It was the deep
   conviction of the divine authority, and the heavy responsibility of the
   episcopate, which lay it the bottom both of his first "nolo episcopari,
   " and of subsequent hierarchical feeling. He was as conscientious in
   discharging the duties, as he was jealous in maintaining the rights, of
   his office. Notwithstanding his high conception of the dignity of a
   bishop, he took counsel of his presbyters in everything, and respected
   the rights of his people. He knew how to combine strictness and
   moderation, dignity and gentleness, and to inspire love and confidence
   as well as esteem and veneration. He took upon himself, like a father,
   the care of the widows and orphans, the poor and sick. During the great
   pestilence of 252 he showed the most self-sacrificing fidelity to his
   flock, and love for his enemies. He forsook his congregation, indeed,
   in the Decian persecution, but only, as he expressly assured them, in
   pursuance of a divine admonition, and in order to direct them during
   his fourteen months of exile by pastoral epistles. His conduct exposed
   him to the charge of cowardice. In the Valerian persecution he
   completely washed away the stain of that flight with the blood of his
   calm and cheerful martyrdom.

   He exercised first rigid discipline, but at a later period--not in
   perfect consistency--he moderated his disciplinary principles in
   prudent accommodation to the exigencies of the times. With Tertullian
   he prohibited all display of female dress, which only deformed the work
   of the Creator; and he warmly opposed all participation in heathen
   amusements,--even refusing a converted play-actor permission to give
   instruction in declamation and pantomime. He lived in a simple, ascetic
   way, under a sense of the perishableness of all earthly things, and in
   view of the solemn eternity, in which alone also the questions and
   strifes of the church militant would be perfectly settled. "Only
   above," says he in his tract De Mortalitate, which be composed during
   the pestilence, "only above are true peace, sure repose, constant,
   firm, and eternal security; there is our dwelling, there our home. Who
   would not fain hasten to reach it? There a great multitude of beloved
   awaits us; the numerous host of fathers, brethren, and children. There
   is a glorious choir of apostles there the number of exulting prophets;
   there the countless multitude of martyrs, crowned with victory after
   warfare and suffering; there triumphing virgins; there the merciful
   enjoying their reward. Thither let us hasten with longing desire; let
   us wish to be soon with them, soon with Christ. After the earthly comes
   the heavenly; after the small follows the great after perishableness,
   eternity."

   III. His writings.

   As an author, Cyprian is far less original, fertile and vigorous than
   Tertullian, but is clearer, more moderate, and more elegant and
   rhetorical in his style. He wrote independently only on the doctrines
   of the church, the priesthood, and sacrifice.

   (1.) His most important works relate to practical questions on church
   government and discipline. Among these is his tract on the Unity of the
   Church (A. D. 251), that "magna charta" of the old catholic high-church
   spirit, the commanding importance of which we have already considered.
   Then eighty-one Epistles, [1557] 558 some very long, to various
   bishops, to the clergy and the churches of Africa and of Rome, to the
   confessors, to the lapsed, &c.; comprising also some letters from
   others in reply, as from Cornelius of Rome and Firmilian of Caesarea.
   They give us a very graphic picture of his pastoral labors, and of the
   whole church life of that day. To the same class belongs also his
   treatise: De Lapsis (A. D. 250) against loose penitential discipline.

   (2.) Besides these he wrote a series of moral works, On the Grace of
   God (246); On the Lord's Prayer (252); On Mortality (252); against
   worldly-mindedness and pride of dress in consecrated virgins (De Habitu
   Virginum); a glowing call to Martyrdom; an exhortation to liberality
   (De Opere el Eleemosynis, between 254 and 256), with a touch of the
   "opus operatum" doctrine; and two beautiful tracts written during his
   controversy with pope Stephanus: De Bono Patienti, and De Zelo et
   Livore (about 256), in which he exhorts the excited minds to patience
   and moderation.

   (3.) Least important are his two apologetic works, the product of his
   Christian pupilage. One is directed against heathenism (de Idolorum
   Vanitate), and is borrowed in great part, often verbally, from
   Tertullian and Minucius Felix. The other, against Judaism (Testimonia
   adversus Judaeos), also contains no new thoughts, but furnishes a
   careful collection of Scriptural proofs of the Messiahship and divinity
   of Jesus.

   Note.--Among the pseudo-Cyprianic writings is a homily against
   dice-playing and all games of chance (Adversus Aleatores, in Hartel's
   ed. III. 92-103), which has been recently vindicated for Bishop Victor
   of Rome (190-202), an African by birth and an exclusive high churchman.
   It is written in the tone of a papal encyclical and in rustic Latin.
   See Harnack: Der pseudo-cyprian. Tractat De Aleatoribus, Leipzig 1888.

   or 230.

   601-604. (Dem Tertulliannahe stehend, von ihm abhängig, aber auch ihn
   verflachend ist Novatian.")

   Novatian, the second Roman anti-Pope (Hippolytus being probably the
   first), orthodox in doctrine, but schismatic in discipline, and in both
   respects closely resembling Hippolytus and Tertullian, flourished in
   the middle of the third century and became the founder of a sect called
   after his name. [1558] 559 He was a man of unblemished, though austere
   character, considerable biblical and philosophical learning,
   speculative talent, and eloquence. [1559] 560 He is moreover, next to
   Victor and Minucius Felix, the first Roman divine who used the Latin
   Language, and used it with skill. We may infer that at his time the
   Latin had become or was fast becoming the ruling language of the Roman
   church, especially in correspondence with North Africa and the West;
   yet both Novatian and his rival Cornelius addressed the Eastern bishops
   in Greek. The epitaphs of five Roman bishops of the third century,
   Urbanus, Anteros, Fabianus, Lucius, and Eutychianus (between 223 and
   283), in the cemetery of Callistus are Greek, but the epitaph of
   Cornelius (251-253) who probably belonged to the noble Roman family of
   that name, is Latin ("Cornelius Martyr E. R. X.") [1560] 561

   At that time the Roman congregation numbered forty presbyters, seven
   deacons, seven sub-deacons, forty-two acolytes, besides exorcists,
   readers and janitors, and an "innumerable multitude of the people,"
   which may have amounted perhaps to about 50,000 members. [1561] 562

   We know nothing of the time and place of the birth and death of
   Novatian. He was probably an Italian. The later account of his Phrygian
   origin deserves no credit, and may have arisen from the fact that he
   had many followers in Phrygia, where they united with the Montanists.
   He was converted in adult age, and received only clinical baptism by
   sprinkling on the sick bed without subsequent episcopal confirmation,
   but was nevertheless ordained to the priesthood and rose to the highest
   rank in the Roman clergy. He conducted the official correspondence of
   the Roman see during the vacancy from the martyrdom of Fabian, January
   21, 250, till the election of Cornelius, March, 251. In his letter to
   Cyprian, written in the name of "the presbyters and deacons abiding at
   Rome," [1562] 563 he refers the question of the restoration of the
   lapsed to a future council, but shows his own preference for a strict
   discipline, as most necessary in peace and in persecution, and as "the
   rudder of safety in the tempest." [1563] 564

   He may have aspired to the papal chair to which he seemed to have the
   best claim. But after the Decian persecution had ceased his rival
   Cornelius, unknown before, was elected by a majority of the clergy and
   favored the lenient discipline towards the Fallen which his
   predecessors Callistus and Zephyrinus had exercised, and against which
   Hippolytus had so strongly protested twenty or thirty years before.
   Novatian was elected anti-Pope by a minority and consecrated by three
   Italian bishops. [1564] 565 He was excommunicated by a Roman council,
   and Cornelius denounced him in official letters as "a deceitful,
   cunning and savage beast." Both parties appealed to foreign churches.
   Fabian of Antioch sympathized with Novatian, but Dionysius of
   Alexandria, and especially Cyprian who in the mean time had relaxed his
   former rigor and who hated schism like the very pest, supported
   Cornelius, and the lax and more charitable system of discipline,
   together with worldly conformity triumphed in the Catholic church.
   Nevertheless the Novatian schism spread East and West and maintained
   its severe discipline and orthodox creed in spite of imperial
   persecution down to the sixth century. Novatian died a martyr according
   to the tradition of his followers. The controversy turned on the extent
   of the power of the Keys and the claims of justice to the purity of the
   church and of mercy towards the fallen. The charitable view prevailed
   by the aid of the principle that out of the church there is no
   salvation.

   Novatian was a fruitful author. Jerome ascribes to him works On the
   Passover; On the Sabbath; On Circumcision; On the Priest (De
   Sacerdote); On Prayer; On the Jewish Meats; On Perseverance; [1565] 566
   On Attilus (a martyr of Pergamus); and "On the Trinity."

   Two of these books are preserved. The most important is his Liber de
   Trinitate (31 chs.), composed a.d. 256. It has sometimes been ascribed
   to Tertullian or Cyprian. Jerome calls it a "great work," and an
   extract from an unknown work of Tertullian on the same subject.
   Novatian agrees essentially with Tertullian's subordination
   trinitarianism. He ably vindicates the divinity of Christ and of the
   Holy Spirit, strives to reconcile the divine threeness with unity, and
   refutes the Monarchians, especially the Sabellians by biblical and
   philosophical arguments.

   In his Epistola de Cibus Judaicis (7 chapters) written to his flock
   from a place of retirement during persecution, he tries to prove by
   allegorical interpretation, that the Mosaic laws on food are no longer
   binding upon Christians, and that Christ has substituted temperance and
   abstinence for the prohibition of unclean animals, with the exception
   of meat offered to idols, which is forbidden by the Apostolic council
   (Acts 15).

   cap. 4, where Cyprian quotes a passage from the same, and then adds
   "Additum est etiam Novatiano tunc scribente," etc.

   [1563] Ch. 2. Comp. also ch. 3, where he says: "Far be it from the
   Roman Church to slacken her vigor with so profane a facility, and to
   loosen the nerves of her severity by overthrowing the majesty of faith;
   so that when the wrecks of your ruined brethren are not only lying, but
   are falling around, remedies of a too hasty kind, and certainly not
   likely to avail, should be afforded for Communion; and by a false
   mercy, new wounds should be impressed on the old wounds of their
   transgression; so that even repentance should be snatched from there
   wretched beings, to their greater overthrow." And in ch. 7: "Whosoever
   shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father and
   before his angels. For God, as He is merciful, so He exacts obedience
   to his precepts, and indeed carefully exacts it; and as be invites to
   the banquet, so the man that hath not a wedding garment be binds hands
   and feet, and casts him out beyond the assembly of the saints. He has
   prepared heaven but he has also prepared hell. He has prepared places
   of refreshment, but he has also prepared eternal punishment. He has
   prepared the light that none can approach unto, but he has also
   prepared the vast and eternal gloom of perpetual night." At the close
   be favors an exception in case of impending death of the penitent
   lapsed, to whom cautious help should be administered, "that neither
   ungodly men should praise our smooth facility, nor truly penitent men
   accuse our severity as cruel." This letter relieves Novatian of the
   reproach of being chiefly influenced in his schism by personal motives,
   as Pope Cornelius (Euseb. VI. 43), and Roman historians maintain (also
   Harnack, in Herzog X. 661).

   imposition of hands."

   Caspari, p. 428, note 284 versus Lardner and Lumper, who explain it of

   for which, however, the Vatican Cod. reads De Ordinatione.

   Commodian was probably a clergyman in North Africa. [1566] 567 He was
   converted from heathenism by the study of the Scriptures, especially of
   the Old Testament. [1567] 568 He wrote about the middle of the third
   century two works in the style of vulgar African latinity, in uncouth
   versification and barbarian hexameter, without regard to quantity and
   hiatus. They are poetically and theologically worthless, but not
   unimportant for the history of practical Christianity, and reveal under
   a rude dress with many superstitious notions, an humble and fervent
   Christian heart. Commodian was a Patripassian in christology and a
   Chiliast in eschatology. Hence he is assigned by Pope Gelasius to the
   apocryphal writers. His vulgar African latinity is a landmark in the
   history of the Latin language and poetry in the transition to the
   Romance literature of the middle ages.

   The first poem is entitled "Instructions for the Christian Life,"
   written about a.d. 240 or earlier. [1568] 569 It is intended to convert
   heathens and Jews, and gives also exhortations to catechumens,
   believers, and penitents. The poem has over twelve hundred verses and
   is divided into eighty strophes, each of which is an acrostic, the
   initial letters of the lines composing the title or subject of the
   section. The first 45 strophes are apologetic, and aimed at the
   heathen, the remaining 35 are parenetic and addressed to Christians.
   The first part exhorts unbelievers to repent in view of the impending
   end of the world, and gives prominence to chiliastic ideas about
   Antichrist, the return of the Twelve Tribes, the first resurrection,
   the millennium, and the last judgment. The second part exhorts
   catechumens and various classes of Christians. The last acrostic which
   again reminds the reader of the end of the world, is entitled "Nomen
   Gazaei," [1569] 570 and, if read backwards, gives the name of the
   author: Commodianus mendicus Christi. [1570] 571

   2. The second work which was only brought to light in 1852, is an
   "Apologetic Poem against Jews and Gentiles," and was written about 249.
   It exhorts them (like the first part of the "Instructions" to repent
   without delay in view of the approaching end of the world. It is
   likewise written in uncouth hexameters and discusses in 47 sections the
   doctrine of God, of man, and of the Redeemer (vers. 89-275); the
   meaning of the names of Son and Father in the economy of salvation
   (276-573); the obstacles to the progress of Christianity(574-611); it
   warns Jews and Gentiles to forsake their religion (612-783), and gives
   a description of the last things (784-1053).

   The most interesting part of this second poem is the conclusion. It
   contains a fuller description of Antichrist than the first poem. The
   author expects that the end of the world will soon come with the
   seventh persecution; the Goths will conquer Rome and redeem the
   Christians; but then Nero will appear as the heathen Antichrist,
   reconquer Rome, and rage against the Christians three years and a-half;
   he will be conquered in turn by the Jewish and real Antichrist from the
   east, who after the defeat of Nero and the burning of Rome will return
   to Judaea, perform false miracles, and be worshipped by the Jews. At
   last Christ appears, that is God himself (from the Monarchian
   standpoint of the author), with the lost Twelve Tribes as his army,
   which had lived beyond Persia in happy simplicity and virtue; under
   astounding phenomena of nature he will conquer Antichrist and his host,
   convert all nations and take possession of the holy city of Jerusalem.
   The concluding description of the judgment is preserved only in broken
   fragments. The idea of a double Antichrist is derived from the two
   beasts of the Apocalypse, and combines the Jewish conception of the
   Antimessiah, and the heathen Nero-legend. But the remarkable feature is
   that the second Antichrist is represented as a Jew and as defeating the
   heathen Nero, as he will be defeated by Christ. The same idea of a
   double antichrist appears in Lactantius. [1571] 572
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1566] In the MSS. of the second poem be is called a bishop. Commodian
   gives no indication of his clerical status, but it may be fairly
   inferred from his learning. In the last section of his second poem, he
   calls himself Gazaeus. Ebert understands this geographically, from the
   city of Gaza in Syria. But in this case he would have written in Greek
   or in Syriac. The older interpretation is preferable, from Gaza (gaza),
   treasure, or gazophylacium (gazophulakion) treasury, which indicates
   either his possession of the treasure of saving truth or his dependence
   for support on the treasury of the church.

   [1567] Ebert suggests that he was a Jewish proselyte; but in the
   introduction to the first poem he says that he formerly worshipped the
   gods (deos vanos), which he believed to be demons, like most of the
   patristic writers.

   [1568] The author upbraids the Gentiles for persevering in unbelief
   after Christianity had existed for 200 years (VI. 2). Ebert dates the
   Instructions back as far as 239. Alzog puts it down much later.

   Arnobius, a successful teacher of rhetoric with many pupils (Lactantius
   being one of them), was first an enemy, then an advocate of
   Christianity. He lived in Sicca, an important city on the Numidian
   border to the Southwest of Carthage, in the latter part of the third
   and the beginning of the fourth century . He was converted to Christ in
   adult age, like his more distinguished fellow-Africans, Tertullian and
   Cyprian. "O blindness," he says, in describing the great change, "only
   a short time ago I was worshipping images just taken from the forge,
   gods shaped upon the anvil and by the hammer .... When I saw a stone
   made smooth and smeared with oil, I prayed to it and addressed it as if
   a living power dwelt in it, and implored blessings from the senseless
   stock. And I offered grievious insult even to the gods, whom I took to
   be such, in that I considered them wood, stone, and bone, or fancied
   that they dwelt in the stuff of such things. Now that I have been led
   by so great a teacher into the way of truth, I know what all that is, I
   think worthily of the Worthy, offer no insult to the Godhead, and give
   every one his due .... Is Christ, then, not to be regarded as God? And
   is He who in other respects may be deemed the very greatest, not to be
   honored with divine worship, from whom we have received while alive so
   great gifts, and from whom, when the day comes we expect greater
   gifts?" [1572] 573

   The contrast was very startling indeed, if we remember that Sicca bore
   the epithet "Veneria," as the seat of the vile worship of the goddess
   of lust in whose temple the maidens sacrificed their chastity, like the
   Corinthian priestesses of Aphrodite. He is therefore especially severe
   in his exposure of the sexual immoralities of the heathen gods, among
   whom Jupiter himself takes the lead in all forms of vice. [1573] 574

   We know nothing of his subsequent life and death. Jerome, the only
   ancient writer who mentions him, adds some doubtful particulars, namely
   that he was converted by visions or dreams, that he was first refused
   admission to the Church by the bishop of Sicca, and hastily wrote his
   apology in proof of his sincerity. But this book, though written soon
   after his conversion, is rather the result of an inward impulse and
   strong conviction than outward occasion.

   We have from him an Apology of Christianity in seven books of unequal
   length, addressed to the Gentiles. It was written a.d. 303, [1574] 575
   at the outbreak of the Diocletian persecution; for he alludes to the
   tortures, the burning of the sacred Scriptures and the destruction of
   the meeting houses, which were the prominent features of that
   persecution. [1575] 576 It is preserved in only one manuscript (of the
   ninth or tenth century), which contains also the "Octavius" of Minucius
   Felix. [1576] 577 The first two books are apologetic, the other five
   chiefly polemic. Arnobius shows great familiarity with Greek and Roman
   mythology and literature, and quotes freely from Homer, Plato, Cicero,
   and Varro. He ably refutes the objections to Christianity, beginning
   with the popular charge that it brought the wrath of the gods and the
   many public calamities upon the Roman empire. He exposes at length the
   absurdities and immoralities of the heathen mythology. He regards the
   gods as real, but evil beings.

   The positive part is meagre and unsatisfactory. Arnobius seems as
   ignorant about the Bible as Minucius Felix. He never quotes the Old
   Testament, and the New Testament only once. [1577] 578 He knows nothing
   of the history of the Jews, and the Mosaic worship, and confounds the
   Pharisees and Sadducees. Yet be is tolerably familiar, whether from the
   Gospels or from tradition, with the history of Christ. He often refers
   in growing language to his incarnation, crucifixion, and exaltation. He
   represents him as the supreme teacher who revealed God to man, the
   giver of eternal life, yea, as God, though born a man, as God on high,
   God in his inmost nature, as the Saviour God, and the object of
   worship. [1578] 579 Only his followers can be saved, but he offers
   salvation even to his enemies. His divine mission is proved by his
   miracles, and these are attested by their unique character, their
   simplicity, publicity and beneficence. He healed at once a hundred or
   more afflicted with various diseases, he stilled the raging tempest, he
   walked over the sea with unwet foot, he astonished the very waves, he
   fed five thousand with five loaves, and filled twelve baskets with the
   fragments that remained, he called the dead from the tomb. He revealed
   himself after the resurrection "in open day to countless numbers of
   men;" "he appears even now to righteous men of unpolluted mind who love
   him, not in any dreams, but in a form of pure simplicity." [1579] 580

   His doctrine of God is Scriptural, and strikingly contrasts with the
   absurd mythology. God is the author and ruler of all things, unborn,
   infinite, spiritual, omnipresent, without passion, dwelling in light,
   the giver of all good, the sender of the Saviour.

   As to man, Arnobius asserts his free will, but also his ignorance and
   sin, and denies his immortality. The soul outlives the body but depends
   solely on God for the gift of eternal duration. The wicked go to the
   fire of Gehenna, and will ultimately be consumed or annihilated. He
   teaches the resurrection of the flesh, but in obscure terms.

   Arnobius does not come up to the standard of Catholic orthodoxy, even
   of the ante-Nicene age. Considering his apparent ignorance of the
   Bible, and his late conversion, we need not be surprised at this.
   Jerome now praises, now censures him, as unequal, prolix, and confused
   in style, method, and doctrine. Pope Gelasius in the fifth century
   banished his book to the apocryphal index, and since that time it was
   almost forgotten, till it was brought to light again in the sixteenth
   century. Modern critics agree in the verdict that he is more successful
   in the refutation of error than in the defense of truth.

   But the honesty, courage, and enthusiasm of the convert for his new
   faith are as obvious as the defects of his theology. If be did not know
   or clearly understand the doctrines of the Bible, be seized its moral
   tone. [1580] 581 "We have learned," he says, "from Christ's teaching
   and his laws, that evil ought not to be requited with evil (comp. Matt.
   5:39), that it is better to suffer wrong than to inflict it, that we
   should rather shed our own blood than stain our hands and our
   conscience with that of another. An ungrateful world is now for a long
   period enjoying the benefit of Christ; for by his influence the rage of
   savage ferocity has been softened, and restrained from the blood of a
   fellow-creature. If all would lend an ear to his salutary and peaceful
   laws, the world would turn the use of steel to occupations of peace,
   and live in blessed harmony, maintaining inviolate the sanctity of
   treaties." [1581] 582 He indignantly asks the heathen, "Why have our
   writings deserved to be given to the flames, and our meetings to be
   cruelly broken up? In them prayer is offered to the supreme God, peace
   and pardon are invoked upon all in authority, upon soldiers, kings,
   friends, enemies, upon those still in life, and those released from the
   bondage of the flesh. In them all that is said tends to make men
   humane, gentle, modest, virtuous, chaste, generous in dealing with
   their substance, and inseparably united to all that are embraced in our
   brotherhood." [1582] 583 He uttered his testimony boldly in the face of
   the last and most cruel persecution, and it is not unlikely that he
   himself was one of its victims.

   The work of Arnobius is a rich store of antiquarian and mythological
   knowledge, and of African latinity.

   [1573] In book V. 22 he details the crimes of Jupiter who robbed Ceres,

   [1574] He says that Christianity had then existed three hundred years
   (I. 13), and that the city of Rome was one thousand and fifty years old

   Victorinus, probably of Greek extraction, was first a rhetorician by
   profession, and became bishop of Petavium, or Petabio, [1583] 584 in
   ancient Panonia (Petau, in the present Austrian Styria). He died a
   martyr in the Diocletian persecution (303). We have only fragments of
   his writings, and they are not of much importance, except for the age
   to which they belong. Jerome says that he understood Greek better than
   Latin, and that his works are excellent for the sense, but mean as to
   the style. He counts him among the Chiliasts, and ascribes to him
   commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Habakkuk,
   Canticles, the Apocalypse, a book Against all Heresies, "et multa
   alia." Several poems are also credited to him, but without good reason.
   [1584] 585

   1. The fragment on the Creation of the World is a series of notes on
   the account of creation, probably a part of the commentary on Genesis
   mentioned by Jerome. The days are taken liberally. The creation of
   angels and archangels preceded the creation of man, as light was made
   before the sky and the earth. The seven days typify seven millennia;
   the seventh is the millennial sabbath, when Christ will reign on earth
   with his elect. It is the same chiliastic notion which we found in the
   Epistle of Barnabas, with the same opposition to Jewish sabbatarianism.
   Victorinus compares the seven days with the seven eyes of the Lord
   (Zech. 4:10), the seven heavens (comp. Ps. 33:6), the seven spirits
   that dwelt in Christ (Isa. 11:2, 3), and the seven stages of his
   humanity: his nativity, infancy, boyhood, youth, young-manhood, mature
   age, death. This is a fair specimen of these allegorical plays of a
   pious imagination.

   2. The scholia on the Apocalypse of John are not without interest for
   the history of the interpretation of this mysterious book. [1585] 586
   But they are not free from later interpolations of the fifth or sixth
   century. The author assigns the Apocalypse to the reign of Domitian
   (herein agreeing with Irenaeus), and combines the historical and
   allegorical methods of interpretation. He also regards the visions in
   part as synchronous rather than successive. He comments only on the
   more difficult passages. [1586] 587 We select the most striking points.

   The woman in ch. 12 is the ancient church of the prophets and apostles;
   the dragon is the devil. The woman sitting on the seven hills (in ch.
   17), is the city of Rome. The beast from the abyss is the Roman empire;
   Domitian is counted as the sixth, Nerva as the seventh, and Nero
   revived as the eighth Roman King. [1587] 588 The number 666 (13:18)
   means in Greek Teitan [1588] 589 (this is the explanation preferred by
   Irenaeus), in Latin Diclux. Both names signify Antichrist, according to
   the numerical value of the Greek and Roman letters. But Diclux has this
   meaning by contrast, for Antichrist, "although he is cut off from the
   supernal light, yet transforms himself into an angel of light, daring
   to call himself light." [1589] 590 To this curious explanation is
   added, evidently by a much later hand, an application of the mystic
   number to the Vandal king Genseric (genserikos) who in the fifth
   century laid waste the Catholic church of North Africa and sacked the
   city of Rome.

   The exposition of ch. 20:1-6 is not so strongly chiliastic, as the
   corresponding passage in the Commentary on Genesis, and hence some have
   denied the identity of authorship. The first resurrection is explained
   spiritually with reference to Col. 3:1, and the author leaves it
   optional to understand the thousand years as endless or as limited.
   Then he goes on to allegorize about the numbers: ten signifies the
   decalogue, and hundred the crown of virginity; for he who keeps the vow
   of virginity completely, and fulfils the precepts of the decalogue, and
   destroys the impure thoughts within the retirement of his own heart, is
   the true priest of Christ, and reigns with him; and "truly in his case
   the devil is bound." At the close of the notes on ch. 22, the author
   rejects the crude and sensual chiliasm of the heretic Cerinthus. "For
   the kingdom of Christ," he says, "is now eternal in the saints,
   although the glory of the saints shall be manifested after the
   resurrection." [1590] 591 This looks like a later addition, and
   intimates the change which Constantine's reign produced in the mind of
   the church as regards the millennium. Henceforth it was dated from the
   incarnation of Christ. [1591] 592

   agree in regarding this commentary as a work of Victorinus, but with
   later interpolations. Bleek assumes that it was originally more
   pronounced in its chiliasm.

   [1586] As Cassiodorus remarks: "Difficillima quaedam loca breviter
   tractavit.';

   [1587] This explanation of 17:10, 11 rests on the expectation of the
   return of Nero as Antichrist, and was afterwards justly abandoned by
   Andreas and Arethas, but has been revived again, though with a
   different counting of the emperors, by the modern champions of the
   Nero-hypothesis. See the discussion in vol. I, 864 sqq.

   mentioned by Irenaeus. Titus was the destroyer of Jerusalem, but in
   unconconsious fulfilment of Christ's prophecy; he was no persecutor of
   the church, and was one of the best among the Roman emperors.

   Hosius); W. Möller in Herzog2 VI. 326-328; and T. D. C. Morse in Smith
   and Wace III. 162-174.

   At the close of our period we meet with three representative divines,
   in close connection with the first Christian emperor who effected the
   politico-ecclesiastical revolution known as the union of church and
   state. Their public life and labors belong to the next period, but must
   at least be briefly foreshadowed here.

   Eusebius, the historian, Lactantius, the rhetorician, and Hosius, the
   statesman, form the connecting links between the ante-Nicene and Nicene
   ages; their long lives--two died octogenarians, Hosius a
   centenarian--are almost equally divided between the two; and they
   reflect the lights and shades of both. [1592] 593 Eusebius was bishop
   of Caesarea and a man of extensive and useful learning, and a liberal
   theologian; Lactantius, a professor of eloquence in Nicomedia, and a
   man of elegant culture; Hosius, bishop of Cordova and a man of counsel
   and action. [1593] 594 They thus respectively represented the Holy
   Land, Asia Minor, and Spain; we may add Italy and North Africa, for
   Lactantius was probably a native Italian and a pupil of Arnobius of
   Sicca, and Hosius acted to some extent for the whole western church in
   Eastern Councils. With him Spain first emerges from the twilight of
   legend to the daylight of church history; it was the border land of the
   west which Paul perhaps had visited, which had given the philosopher
   Seneca and the emperor Trajan to heathen Rome, and was to furnish in
   Theodosius the Great the strong defender of the Nicene faith.

   Eusebius, Lactantius, and Hosius were witnesses of the cruelties of the
   Diocletian persecution, and hailed the reign of imperial patronage.
   They carried the moral forces of the age of martyrdom into the age of
   victory. Eusebius with his literary industry saved for us the
   invaluable monuments of the first three centuries down to the Nicene
   Council; Lactantius bequeathed to posterity, in Ciceronian Latin, an
   exposition and vindication of the Christian religion against the waning
   idolatry of Greece and Rome, and the tragic memories of the imperial
   persecutors; Hosius was the presiding genius of the synods of Elvira
   (306), Nicaea (325), and Sardica (347), the friend of Athanasius in the
   defense of orthodoxy and in exile.

   All three were intimately associated with Constantine the Great,
   Eusebius as his friend and eulogist, Lactantius as the tutor of his
   eldest son, Hosius as his trusted counsellor who probably suggested to
   him the idea of convening the first OEcumenical synod; he was we may
   say for a few years his ecclesiastical prime minister. They were, each
   in his way, the emperor's chief advisers and helpers in that great
   change which gave to the religion of the cross the moral control over
   the vast empire of Rome. The victory was well deserved by three hundred
   years of unjust persecution and heroic endurance, but it was fraught
   with trials and temptations no less dangerous to the purity and peace
   of the church than fire and sword.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1592] Eusebius died a.d. 340; Lactantius between 320 and 330; Hosius
   between 357 and 360.

   [1593] Hosius left no literary work. The only document we have from his
   pen is his letter to the Arian Emperor Constantius, preserved by
   Athanasius (Hist. Arian. 44). See Gains, l.c. II. 215 sqq. It begins
   with this noble sentence: "I was a confessor of the faith long before
   your grandfather Maximian persecuted the church. If you persecute me, I
   am ready to suffer all rather than to shed innocent blood and to betray
   the truth." Unfortunately, in his extreme old age he yielded under the
   infliction of physical violence, and subscribed an Arian creed, but
   bitterly repented before his death. Athanasius expressly says (l. c.
   45), that "at the approach of death, as it were by his last testament,
   he abjured the Arian heresy, and gave strict charge that no one should
   receive it." It is a disputed point whether he died at Sirmium in 357,
   or was permitted to return to Spain, and died there about 359 or 360.
   We are only informed that he was over a hundred years old, and over
   sixty years a bishop. Athan. l.c.; Sulpicius Severus, Hist. II. 55.

       Alexandrinischen erreicht, ja sogar überstrahlt. Beide konnten sich
       vielfach ergänzen, da jede ihre eigenthümliche Entwicklung, Haltung
       und Methode hatte, konnten aber auch eben wegen iherer
       Verschiedenheit leicht unter sich in Kampf und auf Abwege von der
       Kirchenlehre gerathen. Während bei den Alexandrinern eine
       speculativ-intuitive, zum Mystischen sich hinneigende Richtung
       hervortrat, war bei den Antiochenern eine logisch-reflectirende,
       durchaus nüchterne Verstandesrichtung vorherrschend. Während jene
       enge an die platonische Philosophie sich anschlossen und zwar
       vorherrschend in der Gestalt, die sie unter dem hellenistischen
       Juden Philo gewonnen hatte, waren die Antiochener einem zum
       Stoicismus hinneigenden Eklekticismus, dann der Aristotelischen
       Schule ergeben, deren scharfe Dialektik ganz ihrem Geiste zusagte.
       Demgemäss wurde in der alexandrinischen Schule, vorzugsweise die
       allegorisch-mystische Erklärung der heiligen Schrift gepflegt, in
       der Antiochenischen dagegen die buchstäbliche, grammatisch-logische
       und historische Interpretation, ohne dass desshalb der mystische
       Sinn und insbesondere die Typen des Alten Bundes gänzlich in Abrede

       unter den christlich-lateinischen Autoren
     * [2886]isten suchen die Unzulänglichkeit des blossen buchstäblichen
       Sinnes und die Nothwendigkeit der allegorischen Auslegung
       nachzuweisen, da der Wortlaut vieler biblischen Stellen Falsches,
       Widersprechendes, Gottes Unwürdiges ergebe; sie fehlten hier durch
       das Uebermass des Allegorisirens und durch Verwechslung der
       figürlichen Redeweisen, die dem Literalsinne angehören, mit der
       mystischen Deutung; sie verflüchtigten oft den historischen Gehalt
       der biblischen Erzählung, hinter deren äusserer Schale sie einen
       verborgenen Kern suchen zu müssen glaubten. Damit stand ferner in
       Verbindung, dass in der alexandrinischen Schule das Moment des
       Uebervernünftigen, Unausprechlichen, Geheimnissvollen in den
       göttlichen Dingen stark betont wurde, während die Antiochener vor
       Allem das Vernunftgemässe, dem menschlichen Geiste Entsprechende in
       den Dogmen hervorhoben, das Christenthum als eine das menschliche
       Denken befriedligende Wahrheit nachzuweisen suchten. Indem sie aber
       dieses Streben verfolgten, wollten die hervorragen den Lehrer der
       antiochenischen Schule keineswegs den übernatürlichen Charakter und
       die Mysterien der Kirchenlehre bestreiten, sie erkannten diese in
       der Mehrzahl an, wie Chrysotomus und Theodoret; aber einzelne
       Gelehrte konnten über dem Bemühen, die Glaubenslehren leicht
       verständlich und begreiflich zu machen, ihren Inhalt verunstalten
       und zerstören.

       geistreiche Rhetorik, genialer so wie gesuchter Witz, der
       sinnliches Anfassen des Idealen, tiefes Gefühl and juridische
       Verstandesansicht mit einander ringen. Er hat der afrikanischen
       Kirche die Losung angegeben: Christus sprach: Ich bin die Wahrheit,
       nicht, das Herkommen. Er hat das Gottesbewusstsein in den Tiefen

       Thorheit des Evangeliums der Weltweisheit seiner Zeitgenossen, das
       Unglaubliche der Wunder Gottes dem gemeinen Weltverstande mit
       stolzer Ironie entgegengehalten. Seine Schriften, denen er
