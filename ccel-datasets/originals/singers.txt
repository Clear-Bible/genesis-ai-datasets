PREFACE.

   The hymns of Germany are so steadily becoming naturalized in England
   that English readers may be glad to know something of the men who wrote
   them, and the times in which they had their origin. Scarcely one of the
   numerous hymn-books which have been compiled here within the last
   fifteen years is without its proportion--sometimes a considerable
   proportion--of German hymns. This is, in fact, one of the many ways in
   which the literature of each nation now tends to become, through the
   medium of translations, the common property of both. But hymns form
   only a part, though an important part, of the religious poetry of
   Germany, which itself constitutes but one sharply defined branch of the
   general literature of the country. Yet it is impossible to trace the
   course historically of even this one channel of national expression,
   without being brought into contact with those great movements which
   have stirred the life of the people, and finding the passing fashions
   of each successive age, in thought or phraseology, reflected from its
   surface. Such a work as the present cannot attempt more than an outline
   of a subject which is thus linked on the one side to the general
   history and literature of Germany, while on the other it has a separate
   history of its own, full of minute and almost technical details. Only
   the principal schools and authors are described, and specimens are
   selected from their works; but other writers of secondary rank are
   mentioned, to enable readers who may be inclined to do so, to fill up
   the picture of any particular school or period more completely for
   themselves. The choice of the specimens has been determined partly by
   their intrinsic merits, partly by their novelty to the English public;
   hence nearly all the great classical hymns are named as illustrating
   the spirit of certain times, but they are not given in full, because
   they have been previously translated, and are in many instances
   familiar to us already. A very few, which it was impossible to pass
   over, form the only exceptions to this rule.

   In reading the poems scattered through the following pages, it must be
   remembered that they suffer under the disadvantage of being all
   translations and from one hand, which inevitably robs them of somewhat
   of that variety of diction which marks, in the original, the date of
   the composition or the individuality of the author. Still, as far as
   possible, their characteristic differences have been carefully
   imitated, and the general style and metre of the poem retained. Verses
   have been occasionally omitted for the sake of brevity, and once or
   twice a Trochaic metre has been altered into an Iambic, where the
   change did not seriously affect the shape of the poem, whilst it
   enabled the English version to reproduce certain striking expressions
   in the German. Single rhymes have been throughout substituted for
   double ones, cxcept where the latter constitute an essential element of
   the metre; this modification necessitates the addition or the omission
   of a syllable in the line, but makes it possible to give a more
   faithful and spirited rendering than can be managed within the very
   limited range of English dissyllabic rhymes. The frequent recurrence of
   particular phrases and rhymes is not accidental, but is a peculiarity
   of all German popular poetry from the Niebelungen Lied downwards.
   Besides the specimens given in this volume, many of which are rather
   poems than hymns, between three and four hundred German hymns in
   English dress may now be found in various collections of translations.
   Of these the chief are "Hymns from the Land of Luther;" "Sacred Hymns
   from the German" by Miss Cox; the "Spiritual Songs of Luther" and "Lyra
   Domestica" of Mr. Massie; "Hymns for the Church of England" by Arthur
   Tozer Russell; the "[2]Lyra Germanica" [and the "[3]Second Series"] and
   the "[4]Chorale Book for England." Nearly all the German hymns in our
   ordinary hymnbooks are drawn from some one of these sources or from
   John Wesley. Where only the first English line is mentioned in this
   work, the complete hymn may generally be met with in the "[5]Lyra
   Germanica," or is one of [6]Wesley's well-known versions. [1]

   It seems out of place in a work like this to give a list of
   authorities, which would necessarily be long. German hymns, like our
   own, have undergone many revisions, and are to be met with in very
   varying forms; of course these specimens have been taken from what
   appeared to me the most trustworthy sources at my command. But I may be
   allowed to express my obligations to the following important
   works:--Wackernagel's great work, "das Deutsche Kirchenlied," both in
   the edition of 1842 and the one now in progress; his lives and editions
   of Heermann and Gerhardt, and his brother's "Altdeutsches Lesebuch;"
   the "Geschichte des Kirchenliedes und Kirchengesanges," by Dean Koch of
   Wurtemberg, to which I owe many details of the biographies of the chief
   hymn writers; the "Geistliche Volkslieder" of Hommel; Von Hagenbach's
   "Kirchengeschichte," Gervinus' "Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung;" and
   Gustav Freitag's charming series of sketches of German life, "Bilder
   aus der deutschen Vergangenheit."

"A PREFACE TO ALL GOOD HYMN-BOOKS."

   By [13]DR. MARTIN LUTHER, 1543.

   Lady Musick speaketh.

   Vor allen Freuden auf Erden


   Of all the joys that are on earth

   Is none more dear nor higher worth,

   Than what in my sweet songs is found

   And instruments of various sound.

   Where friends and comrades sing in tune,

   All evil passions vanish soon;

   Hate, anger, envy, cannot stay,

   All gloom and heartache melt away;

   The lust of wealth, the cares that cling,

   Are all forgotten while we sing.

   Freely we take our joy herein,

   For this sweet pleasure is no sin,

   But pleaseth God far more, we know,

   Than any joys the world can show;

   The devil's work it doth impede

   And hinders many a deadly deed.

   So fared it with King Saul of old;

   When David struck his harp of gold,

   So sweet and clear its tones rang out,

   Saul's murderous thoughts were put to rout.

   The heart grows still when I am heard,

   And opens to God's Truth and Word;

   So are we by Elisha taught,

   Who on the harp the Spirit sought.

   The best time o' the year is mine,

   When all the little birds combine

   To sing until the earth and air

   Are filled with sweet sounds everywhere;

   And most the tender nightingale

   Makes joyful every wood and dale,

   Singing her love-song o'er and o'er,

   For which we thank her evermore.

   But yet more thanks are due from us

   To the dear Lord who made her thus,

   A singer apt to touch the heart,

   Mistress of all my dearest art.

   To God she sings by night and day,

   Unwearied, praising Him alway;

   Him I too laud in every song,

   To Whom all thanks and praise belong.

CHAPTER I.
THE EARLY DAWN OF GERMAN SACRED POETRY AND SONG.
A. D. 800-900

   Each Christian people has brought its own characteristic tribute to the
   vast treasury of devotional thought and literature, which is the common
   property of the whole Christian Church. The tribute of Germany is
   pre-eminently that of sacred song, of verse and music in combination
   and adapted for use in the Church and among the people. Her literature
   begins with a work of religious poetry, and from that time onwards has
   been always remarkably rich in productions of this class. The very
   genius of the people--its inborn love for music, especially for
   part-singing, its bent towards the expression of feeling in the lyrical
   form--peculiarly fitted it for this work; and the result has been the
   creation of a literature of hymns and hymn-tunes, which has had a wide
   influence not only within but beyond Germany. The hymn-books of
   Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, and in part those of Holland,
   consist, to a large extent (until recently it would have been correct,
   we believe, to say, almost entirely), of translations and adaptations
   from the German; which have, however, become so completely naturalized
   among the people that their alien origin is forgotten, and they have
   furnished the model on which the hymns of native growth have been
   composed. In Switzerland, in the Protestant Church of France, and to
   some extent in Holland, the spread of the German hymns has been checked
   by the influence of the Calvinistic Churches, which have always feared
   to give a prominent place to art of any kind in the worship of
   God--rather indeed have allowed it to creep in on sufferance, than
   delighted to introduce it as a free-will offering of beauty. Yet here,
   too, hymns adopted from the German, or of the German type, have
   gradually made their way. In England the national character of our
   Reformation has left less scope for the influence of foreign elements.
   Our Church has distinguished its services more by the beauty of its
   prayers than its hymns, while our Nonconformist sects have been
   strongly imbued with those Calvinistic views of worship of whose
   influence we have just spoken. But a people with so marked a genius for
   poetry as the English, could not but use their gift in the service of
   religion as well as in secular ways; though the fact that hymns
   occupied a less important place in the religious worship of England
   than Germany, produced a marked difference in form in the compositions
   of the two countries. Germany's preeminence is in her hymns; but in
   sacred poetry not of this class, she has had no names of equal rank
   with those of Milton or Herbert of old, or Keble, Coleridge, and
   Wordsworth in the present day. In course of time, however, her hymns
   reached us too. There can be no doubt that the acquaintance of the
   Wesleys with the stores of her hymnology led them to see both the
   beauty of this form of poetry and the immense advantages that might be
   drawn from it, in spreading a knowledge of the truth among the common
   people, and in increasing the warmth and attractiveness of worship.
   They not only translated many German hymns, but wrote a large number
   themselves in the same style; and it is from their time that the
   impulse dates which has led to the study of hymnology, not only of
   English or German, but also of Latin and Eastern growth, and to the
   rise among us of a large number of new and very good hymn-writers and
   hymn-books.

   The story of the hymnology of Germany in the sense we have here given
   it, begins properly speaking with the Reformation. It was not until the
   people possessed the word of God and liberty to worship Him in their
   own language, that such a body of hymns could be created, though
   vernacular hymns and sacred lyrics had existed in Germany throughout
   the Middle Ages. But it was then that a great outburst of national
   poetry and music took place which reflected the spirit of those times;
   and on a somewhat smaller scale the same thing has happened both before
   and since that time at every great crisis in the history of the German
   people. The most marked of these periods are the twelfth and thirteenth
   centuries--the era of the Crusades abroad and the rise of the great
   cities at home; the Reformation; the great struggle for religious
   liberty in the seventeenth century; and the revival of literature
   towards the close of the eighteenth century, after the exhaustion that
   followed the Thirty Years' War.

   As far back, however, as we hear anything of the German race, we hear
   of their love for song. They sang hymns, we are told, in their heathen
   worship, and lays in honour of their heroes at their banquets; and
   their heaven was pictured as echoing with the songs of the brave heroes
   who had fallen in battle. The first dawn of Christianity came to the
   Gothic races from Greece, but in Southern Germany it seems to have
   proceeded from the many missionaries who were sent out by the British
   and Irish monasteries in the sixth century, who sought no special
   authorization from Rome, and did not carry with them the Roman liturgy.
   But the chief instruments in the conversion of the remoter regions were
   the Anglo-Saxon monk Winifred, better known as St. Boniface, who was
   martyred in 755, and Charlemagne. Both these great men saw the
   imperative need of some centre of unity and order to restore society
   and preserve anything of faith or of letters in those times of utter
   chaos and discord, and believed that they had found the means to this
   end in the unity of the Church. That they greatly promoted civilization
   there is no doubt, but their work, even that of Boniface, had its
   darker side, where it came in contact with an already existing
   Christianity, and forcibly repressed what was national and distinctive
   in its character. For wherever they went they introduced at once not
   only the Christian religion, but the hierarchy and liturgy of Rome, and
   with it the Gregorian Church music and the Latin hymns.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Ambrosian Church Music

   This style of music owes its origin to Pope Gregory the Great, who
   ascended the papal chair in 590, and thenceforward devoted his
   extraordinary abilities and energy to securing the unity and
   independence of the Church. Here, however, we are only concerned with
   his influence on Church music. Before his time the Ambrosian style had
   been widely prevalent through the Western Church. It was founded on the
   Greek system of music, and was introduced by [14]St. Ambrose, with the
   assistance of Pope Damasius, into the Great Church of Milan in the year
   386. A true instinct taught St. Ambrose to adopt for his hymns the most
   rhythmical form of Latin verse that was then in use, and for his tunes
   a popular and congregational style of melody, and thus both spread
   rapidly through the Western Church, and became a powerful engine for
   affecting the minds of the people of all classes. In a well-known
   passage of his "Confessions," [2] St. Augustine tells us (he is
   addressing our Lord):--"How did I weep, in Thy Hymns and Canticles,
   touched to the quick by the voices of Thy sweet-attuned Church! The
   voices flowed into my ears, and the Truth distilled into my heart,
   whence the affections of my devotion overflowed, and tears ran down,
   and happy was I therein. Not long had the Church of Milan begun to use
   this kind of consolation and exhortation, the brethren zealously
   joining with harmony of voice and hearts. For it was a year, or not
   much more, that Justina, mother to the Emperor Valentinian, a child,
   persecuted Thy servant, Ambrose, in favour of her heresy, to which she
   was seduced by the Arians. The devout people kept watch in the Church,
   ready to die with their bishop, Thy servant. Then it was first
   instituted that after the manners of the Eastern Churches, hymns and
   psalms should be sung, lest the people should wax faint through the
   tediousness of service; and from that day to this the custom is
   retained, almost all The congregations throughout other parts of the
   world following herein."

   One tune from the Ambrosian period is still preserved in Germany to the
   present day, in connexion with Luther's German version of St. Ambrose's
   great hymn, Veni Redemptor gentium. It is a simple, dignified, somewhat
   quaint melody. [3]

   In course of time, however, there is no doubt that Church music had
   become deteriorated by the introduction of a more secular style, and
   that this was one cause of the reaction under Gregory the Great. Yet
   another may perhaps be found in the fact that the Ambrosian style was
   an intrinsically congregational method of singing, which enabled all
   the people to bear a part, and not a small one, in the service; while
   the Gregorian, which had less melody and rhythm, and was extremely
   difficult to acquire, was necessarily restricted to the clergy and the
   trained choir, and therefore harmonized better with the hierarchical
   principles of Gregory.

     __________________________________________________________________

  Gregorian Church Music

   It was natural, therefore, that from this period onwards, as the
   hierarchical element in the Church gained strength, this system should
   have rapidly supplanted its rival; nor would it be fair to say that
   this was altogether without its advantage, for in those distracted
   times the impulse towards unity in the Church was in many ways a true
   instinct towards self-preservation, and a common liturgy is one of the
   strongest bonds of a common religious life. There is, too, undoubtedly
   much grandeur and beauty in this style, which adapt it for certain
   forms and occasions of worship; but its stiffness and monotony, and its
   aptness to degenerate into a nasal unmusical chant in the hands of
   untrained singers, unfit it for truly popular and common use. It has
   maintained its place in the Roman Church to the present day, and has
   exerted a strong influence on the music of the reformed Churches.
   During the eighteenth century this influence showed itself markedly in
   Germany in the adoption of a certain slow and uniform style of singing
   the old chorales, admitting only notes of equal length, and in "common"
   time. Recently there has again been a reaction towards the freer and
   more varied rhythm of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the
   laity delighted to assert their right to a share in the Christian
   priesthood, by bearing a part in the public service of God.

   One thing that helped to make the Gregorian chanting an affair of the
   learned, was the very complicated method of notation then employed, and
   it was soon found necessary to establish schools, in which singers went
   through a training that lasted often for years. Gregory founded a
   famous school in Rome, with a prior and four masters, and for many
   generations afterwards the sofa was shown on which he used to recline
   while himself examining the scholars. They were mostly orphan boys who
   were entirely maintained here, and afterwards received appointments
   from the Pope. In the days of King Ethelbert, forty of them came to
   England, and introduced the Gregorian music into this country.

   Charlemagne, like our own Alfred, was an enthusiastic lover of Church
   music, and especially of this style which he had learnt to know in
   Rome. In his own chapel he carefully noted the powers of all the
   priests and singers, and sometimes acted as choir-master himself, in
   which capacity he proved a very strict, often severe master, He
   extinguished the last remnants of the Ambrosian style at Milan, and it
   was with his approval that Pope Leo III. (795-810) imposed a penalty of
   exile or imprisonment on any singer who might deviate from the orthodox
   Cantus firmus et choralis. He not only founded schools of music in
   France, but throughout Germany, at Fulda, Mayence, Treves, Reichenau,
   and other places. Trained singers from the famous choirs in Rome were
   sent for to take charge of these institutions, and seem to have been
   not a little shocked at first by the barbarism of their pupils. One
   says that their notion of singing in Church was to howl like wild
   beasts; while another, Johannes Didimus, in his Life of Gregory,
   affirms that--"These gigantic bodies, whose voices roar like thunder,
   cannot imitate our sweet tones, for their barbarous and ever-thirsty
   throats can only produce sounds as harsh as those of a loaded waggon
   passing over a rough road."
     __________________________________________________________________

  A Benedictine Monastery

   The new style of Church music naturally found its most zealous
   promoters in the cloisters, among whom we may name Rabanus Maurus, a
   pupil of Alcuin, and abbot of the great convent of Fulda, and Walafrid
   (nicknamed Strabo), abbot of Reichenau. The Benedictine monasteries
   which were henceforward founded in increasing numbers north of the
   Alps, were for the next two or three centuries, the asylums where arts
   and letters were preserved through the storms of those stormy times.
   Every convent, in fact, constituted a little town in itself when it had
   attained its full proportions. It began generally in the humblest
   manner. The abbot of some considerable monastery would send a small
   band of missionary monks to some spot, chosen either for its natural
   advantages, or from the needs, or perhaps the earnestly-expressed
   wishes, of the surrounding population. First, the monks would fell the
   trees, and erect temporary huts for themselves; then the chapel was
   built and service celebrated; then more permanent abodes were
   constructed, and gardens and fields were brought into cultivation.
   Then, if possible, the relics of some saint were procured, and
   deposited within the altar to give a special sanctity to the place, and
   attract worshippers in the hope of obtaining miraculous cures, and
   henceforward the number of monks and dependants would rapidly increase.
   When the institution was completed, we know by plans still preserved in
   the archives of St. Gall, that it would consist of the church as
   centre, the monks' dwellings, the cloisters, and the convent school
   within the inner inclosure; around which clustered handsome buildings
   for the abbot's and physician's houses; for the secular school, the
   hospital, the lodgings for travellers, whether monks or laymen; and the
   smaller abodes and workshops necessary for the various artificers whose
   crafts here found employment. The whole of this little town, so to
   speak, was itself inclosed within a ditch, and in later times fortified
   with walls and towers.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Notker's Sequences

   Among the most complete and famous of these monasteries was that of St.
   Gall. In that lonely but sheltered spot on the lower slopes of the
   Alps, and not far from Lake Constance, which gave access to Southern
   Germany, there was cherished for centuries a sacred fire of true
   enthusiasm for learning, which spread its light by degrees into many a
   half-barbarous court and distant convent. Here the earliest and most
   strenuous efforts were made to tame the rough mother-tongue of the
   Germans, and teach it to express as far as might be the shades of
   thought and feeling which the languages of Greece and Rome had so
   marvellously embodied, and all that the Christian faith had to say
   besides. There exists in its archives a very ancient Latin and German
   dictionary traditionally ascribed to St. Gall himself (died 638), and
   many other glossaries, paraphrases, and interlinear translations from
   the Latin. Among those who thus occupied themselves in the ninth
   century was a monk named [15]Notker, whom Walafrid, then Dean of St.
   Gall's, strongly urged to devote himself to sacred poetry. He wrote,
   however, in Latin, and his hymns therefore concern our subject only
   because he was the originator of a form of Latin hymnology, which when
   translated into German gave rise to the earliest German hymns, properly
   so called, with which we are acquainted. This was the Latin Sequence or
   Prose. It was customary in all cases where a Hallelujah was introduced
   to prolong the last syllable, and to sing on the vowel "ah" a series of
   elaborate passages intended to represent an outburst of jubilant
   feeling. These were termed Sequences, because they followed the
   Hallelujah and repeated its notes, and were of course sung without
   words. What Notker did was to write words for them, and he tells us
   himself how he came to do it, in a letter addressed to Bishop Luitward,
   to whom he dedicated a volume of these compositions. "When I was yet
   young and could not always succeed in retaining in my memory the
   long-drawn melodies on the last syllable of the Hallelujah, I cast
   about in my mind for some method of making them easier to remember. Now
   it happened that a certain priest from Gimedia came to us who had an
   Antiphonarium, wherein were written some strophes to these melodies,
   but indeed by no means free from faults. This put it into my mind to
   compose others for myself after the same manner. I showed them to my
   teacher, Yso, whom they pleased on the whole, only he remarked, that as
   many notes as there were in the music, so many words must there be in
   the text. At this suggestion I went through my work again, and now Yso
   accepted it with full approbation, and gave the text to the boys to
   sing." These Sequences spread rapidly, for they supplied the want that
   was beginning to be felt of melodies in which sometimes the people
   could join, and words which could be adapted to special occasions
   beyond the ordinary service of the mass. They increased in number
   therefore more quickly than the hymns properly so called, and gradually
   assumed a strictly metrical form, which at first they did not possess.
   Notker himself composed thirty-five of them; and one which still finds
   a place in our own Burial Service, the "[16]Media vita in morte," is
   traditionally ascribed to him, and said to have been written while
   watching some workmen building the bridge of St. Martin at the peril of
   their lives. It cannot however be certainly traced beyond the eleventh
   century, but from that time onwards it was in use in the Latin, and
   afterwards in a German version as a battle-song, which was supposed to
   exert magical influences.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Heliand

   It is to this same ninth century, and in one instance, to the teachings
   of the convent of St. Gall, that we owe the two earliest specimens of
   German sacred poetry. They are both Harmonies of the Gospels, and it
   strikingly shows the affinity of the Teutonic mind for the Jewish
   Scriptures, that the earliest monuments of its written literature are
   all drawn from this source--the translation of the Bible into Gothic by
   Ulphilas, the great Bishop of the Goths, who died in 388, and the two
   books now before us. The earliest of them is called "The Heliand," or
   the Saviour, and is written in Saxon, therefore in the ancient Low
   German dialect. It is said to have been suggested by Louis the Pious to
   teach the newly-converted Saxons something of the faith they had
   accepted, and to have been carried out by a peasant who heard in his
   sleep a voice summoning him to the undertaking. About thirty years
   later, a similar task was achieved by Otfried, a monk probably of
   Alemannic race, who had been educated at first at Fulda under Rabanus
   Maurus, then had lived many years in St. Gall, and finally removed to
   Weissenburg in Alsace, another of the numerous monasteries scattered
   along the border of Switzerland, where the mountains break down to the
   lakes and cultivated country of Northern Europe. Though they thus
   belong to the same period of time, these works were composed under
   widely different circumstances. In Southern Germany the Romans had
   founded large cities, and Roman and Celtic elements were mingled with
   the Teutonic blood. Christianity had early made its way there, and a
   considerable amount of it existed before the earliest missionaries from
   Rome came thither. In the seventh century St. Emmeran found a multitude
   of priests and churches in Bavaria; the land had already gloried in
   several native saints before the time of Charlemagne; and culture must
   have made no inconsiderable progress, when we are told that the noble
   lady Theudelinde was able to maintain a pious and learned
   correspondence with Pope Gregory the Great. In Northern Germany, on the
   other hand, little had been done for the introduction of Christianity
   until Charlemagne converted the people by force, and the country long
   remained scantily populated and unsettled. Vast tracts of forest or
   heath were interrupted by solitary farmsteads of immense extent, where
   cattle and sheep were the chief source of wealth; for, until the close
   of the tenth century, there was but little agriculture; towns and
   monasteries existed but in small numbers and at great distances, and it
   was long before any churches except the convent chapels were built.
   Slowly the new religion permeated this wild and scattered people; but
   as it did so, it rooted itself the more deeply in the popular life, and
   bore less of the impress of the hierarchical and Roman element than the
   religion of Southern Germany, a distinction which has maintained itself
   even to the present day.

   The form of the two works is contrasted as we might expect from their
   origin; the Heliand is written in the alliterative measure of the
   ancient ballads, but without strophes; the work of Otfried is composed
   in four-lined verses with rhyme. Rhyme is a peculiarly Christian
   ornament of verse, and the struggle was long between accented and
   rhymed forms of poetry, and the ancient forms of classical metre.
   Otfried's is the first rhymed poem we possess, and thus has always
   marked an important epoch in European literature. The Heliand is not so
   much a Harmony of the Gospels as a Saxon epic on the life of our Lord,
   and it seems to have been intended to form part of a larger work
   embracing the whole course of Scripture History. The style is simple
   and naïve: the writer nowhere brings forward his own personality, but
   is evidently inspired by a strong love to his subject. The relation of
   the disciples, and implicitly the relation of all Christians to their
   Lord, is conceived after the true Teutonic type as that of followers
   bound by an oath to their duke or leader; all that expresses personal
   loyalty and obedience on the one hand, or affectionate condescension on
   the other, is brought out with quick insight and strong feeling. In
   general, the writer keeps very close to his authorities, but in some
   passages, where the heathen lays may have been recalled to his mind, he
   permits himself a more excursive description, and echoes of the old
   Scandinavian ballads float through his verse. The Sermon on the Mount
   specially attracts him, and he gives it with fulness and evident
   predilection.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Otfried of Weissenburg

   Otfried, on the other hand, continually betrays his acquaintance with
   classical models, and the self-consciousness of the educated barbarian
   in the presence of a higher culture. He is constantly lamenting his own
   incompetence and the barbarism of the German tongue; he gives fewer
   facts and less of the distinctly ethical discourses than his Saxon
   contemporary; but he much more frequently introduces episodes,
   sometimes similes or allegories from ecclesiastical works, sometimes
   mystical and moral reflections of his own. But there are passages where
   he rises to warmth and true poetry, as where, in describing the journey
   of the Magi, he speaks of the longing of the soul for its heavenly
   fatherland; and the very idea of thus endeavouring to make the grounds
   of their faith intelligible to the common people, marks him out as no
   common man.

   The following is a version of the passage just mentioned. The rhyme and
   metre of the original are very irregular, and here and there a rhyme is
   wanting altogether; still, as its structure constitutes a marked
   difference between this poem and its predecessors, it seemed best to
   imitate, as far as possible, its rhythm, while keeping close to the
   meaning; but in such a process somewhat of the poetical element is apt
   to vanish.

  MYSTICE DE REVERSIONE MAGORUM AD PATRIAM.

   Manot unsih thisu fart


   Now warneth us the Wise Men's fare

   That hereof we be well aware,

   How we should to ourselves take heed,

   And seek our native land with speed.


   Ye wot not what I say, I wis;

   That land is hight the Paradise:

   I verily could laud it sore,

   For wordès fail me nevermore.


   But if of all my members each

   Were gifted with the gift of speech,

   Yet could not any words avail

   To tell out all its wondrous tale.


   Never couldst thou believe it right

   Save thou shouldst see it with thy sight,

   Nor couldst thou well, not even then,

   Tell what thou saw'st to other men.


   For there is life withouten doom,

   And there is light withouten gloom;

   There wonneth the angelic race,

   And everlasting blessedness.


   We have forsaken it, alas!

   Well may we rue that came to pass;

   Well may we never stay to weep

   After the home we did not keep.


   We fared forth hastily from thence

   Misled by pride and arrogance,

   Lured in some fond and secret guise,

   By lusts that tempted us with lies.


   Ah! then we list not to obey,

   And bear the mark thereof alway!

   Now here as exiles we must stand

   Sore weeping in an alien land:


   Unused, alas! from age to age

   Lieth our proper heritage,

   Untasted what it hath of good,--

   So wrought for us our haughty mood.


   We now must suffer and be sad

   For lack of joy we might have had;

   We now must bear, as best we may,

   Sore want and many a bitter day.


   Now full of sorrow we bemoan

   Our lot in this land not our own,

   And bear the wounds that sin doth smite,

   And many griefs of our sad plight.


   Here many a trial night and day

   Lurketh in wait beside our way,

   And yet we orphans sad and weak

   Not yet our home are fain to seek.


   Ah, well-a-day, thou stranger land!

   Hard art thou truly to our band,

   Heavy art thou and hast no ruth,

   I tell thee this in very truth.


   Sore griefs do here the heart beset

   That for its home is pining yet:

   Well have I found this true in me,

   Nought joyous have I met in thee.


   The only gifts thou dost bestow

   Are a heart laden with its woe,

   A mood that aye is fain to weep,

   And sorrows manifold and deep.


   But if into our mind it come

   That we once more will seek our home,

   And if our hearts would swift return,

   And with a dolorous longing yearn:


   Then like the Wise Men shall we fare

   By a new road to bring us there,

   Seeking the true way that will lead

   Back to the home we sorely need.


   That path, I wot, is fair and sweet,

   But must be trod with washen feet:

   Such is the manner, well I ween,

   Of men that would thereon be seen.


   Kindness must in thy soul be bred,

   And great and willing lowlihead;

   And, most of all, within thy heart

   True love must live in every part.


   Learn thou to find thy joy in guise

   Of fair and ready sacrifice;

   Yield to the good thy will alway,

   And never thine own lusts obey.


   Within the love-shrine of thy heart,

   Let love of this world have no part;

   From things of passing time now flee,

   Their very loss shall profit thee.


   Remember what I erst did say,

   This is that new and other way;

   Choose thou to tread it, as I rede,

   And surely to thy home 'twill lead.


   And when thou dost that life possess,

   And knowest all its blessedness,

   To God Himself wilt thou be dear,

   And nevermore know harm or fear.

CHAPTER II.
A LONG TWILIGHT.
A.D. 900-1100.

  Barbarian Incursions

   The two centuries we have now reached are a very barren period for
   literature. Charlemagne had given an impulse to arts and letters of
   which the effects are traceable as long as there were any pupils left
   of the circle of learned men whom he gathered round his court. But
   these gradually died out, and his vast empire fell to pieces. Then came
   a time when men had something else to do than to read or write; had too
   often to fight or flee for their lives to have much leisure or thought
   for more peaceful tasks. The frontiers of Germany had to be secured,
   its lands brought under cultivation, its towns built, its social polity
   developed. It was not until the great defeat of the Normans in 891 by
   Arnulf, at Loven on the Dyle, that Germany was delivered from their
   attacks, and its eastern portion was kept in constant alarm by the
   incursions of the Hungarian and Slavonic tribes, until nearly the close
   of the eleventh century. Thus on one occasion, early in this century,
   the whole of Germany between the Elbe and the Oder was ravaged; the
   most horrible cruelties were practised, especially against monks and
   priests, and all the churches were burnt down. The cause of offence was
   that the chief had asked in marriage the daughter of the Duke of
   Saxony, and had received the scornful reply that it was not meet to
   give a Duke's daughter to a dog,--a play on the words Hun and Hund, or
   hound.

   A vivid description of one of these incursions is left us by Eckhard
   IV., a monk and chronicler of St. Gall. In the year 924, an invasion of
   the Hungarians took place, which lasted for two years. The wild hordes
   first burst into Bavaria, swept over all the south of Germany, and then
   vanish from our story as they pass down the Rhine. They carried with
   them cattle and carts containing their plunder. At night they placed
   their carts in a circle, lit watch-fires, and stationed watchmen
   outside the barrier, while within it they encamped on the ground. By
   day they ravaged the country, plundering and burning on all sides; so
   that their approach was heralded by the red glare of burning villages
   on the horizon. When the abbot of St. Gall heard of them, he assembled
   the brethren and all the dependants, and commanded that they should at
   once begin to make spears, and shields, and other weapons, and also
   prepare a fortified asylum in case of attack. He himself and the other
   monks put on their coats of steel, and drew over them the monk's cloak
   and cowl, and laid their own hands to the work of fortifying the point
   he had chosen, a spot at the junction of three streams, which could
   only be approached by a narrow way. The monks and servants would not
   believe in the coming danger, and so it was but just in time that they
   transported their valuables to this retreat. The very next day the Huns
   appeared. Only two persons had been left in the convent, a holy woman
   who had made a vow of seclusion and refused to leave her cell, and a
   half-witted monk who could not be induced to accompany his brethren
   into their fortress. The former was murdered, the latter was treated
   with a rough good-nature, and given as much wine and meat as he could
   take,--"though of a truth the discourteous people, when I had drunk
   enough, forced me to drink more with blows," he said afterwards. The
   Hungarians took all they could find, and observing that the highest
   point of the building, the vane, was crowned by a shining cock, they
   concluded this to be the god of the place, and supposed his image would
   be of gold. Two men therefore tried to ascend the tower and bring down
   the weathercock, but both fell and were killed. Their companions,
   enraged, next endeavoured to burn down the church, but its thick walls
   defied their efforts, on which they withdrew to the gardens, saying
   that the god was too strong for them. They then sent spies to examine
   the abbot's place of refuge, but these reported that its natural
   strength and the determination of its defenders seemed so great, that
   it would be best to leave it alone; and so, after a long and wild
   banquet in the convent gardens, the barbarians gradually drew off, and
   fell upon the neighbouring villages. For some weeks, however, the abbot
   could not venture to leave his fort, fearing their return, but every
   day he and some of the bolder monks stole down to the abbey, and said
   mass at its altar. At last he heard that the enemy was really gone. One
   of the suburbs of Constance had been burnt down, but the town itself
   and the abbey of Reichenau, which had been next attacked, had been
   successfully defended, and the barbarians were on their way to the
   Rhine.

   By very slow degrees these wild people were either subdued and
   converted to Christianity, or pressed back into the vast plains and
   thick forests and morasses of Central Europe, and the frontiers of
   Germany became at peace. But within them was constant fighting still.
   All the great nobles claimed the right of private war; there was no
   regular administration of justice; trial by ordeal was practised; and a
   revolt against the Emperor himself appeared to his powerful vassals the
   most natural thing to be undertaken when they had any grievance to
   avenge, or when his absence in Italy offered a fair opportunity. These
   early Othos and Henrys of the Saxon and Salic lines, were indeed, for
   the most part, men of ability and energy, who strove hard to establish
   order and promote civilization; but their power in the State depended
   almost entirely on their personal character and the wealth and
   consequence of their families, and was weakened by their frequent
   absences in Italy.

  The Truce of God

   In Germany itself, the clergy, on the whole, frequently sided with the
   Emperor as against the nobles, and to some extent thus constituted
   themselves protectors of the common people. They treated their
   dependants more mildly than other lords did, and their methods of
   agriculture were superior to any other; they gave employment, too, to
   many handicrafts, and thus it was not unnatural that towns gradually
   grew up or rapidly increased round the great abbeys and bishops' sees.
   It was to two assemblies of bishops, moreover, that the distracted
   world owed that Truce of God, proclaimed in the year 1032, which gave
   breathing-time to the poor down-trodden peasant or townsman, and was
   the beginning of a more settled state of society. It was an agreement
   that no violence or weapons of any kind should be used from sunset on
   Wednesday to sunrise on Monday, nor on any high festival of the Church,
   and whosoever violated this peace was to pay his fine or wehrgeld, or
   suffer excommunication. Many of the nobles at first refused to submit
   to this, and declared their intention of adhering to the good old
   customs of their forefathers, and fighting on every day in the week:
   but a succession of bad harvests and a great dearth which occurred
   about this time was pointed out to them by the bishops as a sign of
   God's anger with their conduct; and even the turbulent Normans of
   France yielded to this argument. Nor indeed was it untrue, for it is
   evident that the local scarcities of food, which were of terribly
   frequent occurrence at this period, were in great measure due to the
   evil passions and ignorance of men. From this time onwards, however, we
   can trace an increase in the extent of land brought under cultivation;
   mining was introduced in the Harz district, and the towns steadily grew
   in wealth and importance. But how much of heathen superstition still
   lingered in the most Christian and civilized places, is curiously shown
   by a Mirror of Confession written by a Bishop Burchardt of Worms, early
   in the eleventh century. There we find penances assigned for
   worshipping the sun, the moon, the starry heavens, the new moon, or an
   eclipse, and for trying to restore the moon's light when eclipsed, by
   wild outcries, "as though the elements could help thee, or thou couldst
   help them." So, too, offering prayers and sacrifices by a well, at a
   cross-road, or to stones is forbidden, and so is the old wives' custom
   at the birth of a child, of placing food and drink and three knives on
   the table to propitiate the Parcae or Three Sisters. The good old
   bishop believes in trial by ordeal, but we cannot but feel a great
   respect for him when we find the belief in the possibility of
   witchcraft and in divination classed among utterly vain and empty
   superstitions; and when we observe the heavy penalties affixed to
   slaying a bondsman even at the command or by the hand of his lord,
   unless he were a thief and a murderer; and to selling or entrapping any
   human being into slavery. To the former of these offences it seems no
   secular penalty was then attached, the lord possessing the power of
   life and death over his bondsman. Yet side by side with these
   superstitions there was a great deal of genuine Christian faith, among
   the laity as well as the clergy. The separation between these two
   classes was not indeed so marked as it afterwards became. Many of the
   secular clergy were married--Bishop Burchardt imposes a penance on any
   one who should despise or refuse the ministrations of a married
   priest,--and the monks often vied with the knights in field sports, as
   they did with the farmer in agriculture. When the need arose of
   defending land or faith by arms, the abbot raised his troops like the
   lord of any other fief, and could even on occasion, as we have seen at
   St. Gall, put on his own coat of mail and become general himself. On
   the other hand, many knights rivalled the monks in pious exercises, and
   the cloister was their natural refuge when pressed by conscience or the
   troubles of a restless life. It was in the secular school of the
   convent that their children were educated, and it was among the higher
   clergy that the princes sought for State-advisers and secretaries.

  Ezzo of Babingberg

   Throughout this period the literature of Germany remained exclusively
   in the hands of the clergy, and was written in Latin, the then
   universal medium of communication for the learned class. Even so truly
   popular a subject as the story of "Renard the Fox" was treated in
   Latin, for the earliest existing MS. of it is a Latin version, which it
   is, however, supposed was based on a Flemish original now lost. [4]
   This was indeed a sort of flowering time of mediaeval Latin poetry,
   while native German poetry was almost extinct. Only a very few German
   poems remain from these centuries, and these are not remarkable except
   for their date. The principal are two long poems, by Ezzo, a learned
   canon of Babingberg, on the miracles of Christ, and on the mysteries of
   redemption and creation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Early Hymns

   In the public services of the Church the people's share was confined to
   uttering the response, "Kyrie Eleison, Christe Eleison," at certain
   intervals during the singing of the Latin hymns and psalms. These words
   were frequently repeated, sometimes two or three hundred times in one
   service, and were apt to degenerate into a kind of scarcely articulate
   shout, as is proved by the early appearance, even in writing, of such
   forms as "Kyrieles." But soon after [17]Notker had created the Latin
   Sequence, the priests began to imitate it in German, in order to
   furnish the people with some intelligible words in place of the mere
   outcry to which they had become accustomed. They wrote irregular
   verses, every strophe of which ended with the words, "Kyrie Eleison,"
   from the last syllables of which these earliest German hymns were
   called Leisen. They were, however, never used in the service of the
   mass, but only on popular festivals, on pilgrimages, and such
   occasions. The most ancient that has been handed down to us is one on
   St. Peter, dating from the beginning of the tenth century, of which we
   give an imitation, as well as we can manage it, in English; and also of
   a prayer from the tenth century, which is found at the close of a copy
   of Otfried's work, inscribed, "The Bishop Waldo caused this Evangelium
   to be made, and Sigibart, an unworthy priest, wrote it." The language
   of both differs so widely from modern German, as to be unintelligible
   without a glossary; but both are written in irregular metre, and in
   rhyme, though the rhymes are very imperfect.

CHAPTER III.
THE MORNING.
A.D. 1100-1250

   A wonderful change came over Germany during the next two centuries.
   There was a great change in the mere external aspect of the country.
   The peasant who looked out from the door of his farmstead saw a very
   different landscape from that which greeted his forefather's eyes. The
   forest indeed still skirted the horizon, but the cleared spaces were
   wider, and the monotonous green of the broad stretches of pasture land
   was broken up by the more varied colouring of arable crops. The
   villages were far more thickly studded over the land, and nearly every
   one had its wooden church with its one tinkling bell; while farther
   off, by the river-side, stood some great abbey with its stone
   buildings, round which a busy town was rapidly growing up, where the
   village found a market for its produce and employment for its
   superfluous population. But one new feature would not please the
   peasant quite so well: on any neighbouring height which commanded the
   fertile meadows beneath, there was almost sure to be perched a new
   stone dwelling, inhabited by some armed follower of the prince or great
   lord of the country, and from these strongholds a lawless crew often
   issued to carry off the fruits of peaceful industry. During the next
   two hundred years, indeed, the most marked changes in the social aspect
   of the age were the growth of the great towns in size, wealth,
   political power, and all the arts of life; and the rise of a large
   class of armed and mounted followers of the great lords of the empire,
   whom the institution of chivalry placed, in a certain sense, on a level
   with their chiefs, while it constituted a barrier between them and the
   unknightly classes--an order which in after-times developed into the
   lesser nobility of the empire.

  Frederick Barbarossa

   But it was altogether an era of rapid growth, one of those times when
   men's minds are awake and alive, and full of energy to attempt new
   enterprises in any field. Germany was ruled by the Hohenstauffens, a
   vigorous, ambitious, warlike race, whose dream it was to prove
   themselves true heirs of Charlemagne by re-establishing the Empire of
   the West, and who fell at last in that struggle with the popes of which
   the real basis was the question whether the headship of Western
   Christendom was to belong to the State or the Church. The noblest of
   them, Frederick Barbarossa (1152-1189), had all the qualities that made
   him the darting hero of the people: brave, handsome, able in war and in
   council--a liberal patron of the singers and builders, whose arts were
   beginning everywhere to flourish on the German soil--the champion of
   his country against the Papal chair--the conqueror of the warlike
   Normans of Southern Italy,--he stirred the hearts of the people with an
   enthusiasm that was in itself an education. The very manner of his
   death threw a legendary halo round his memory. That their monarch
   should at last have taken the Cross in his old age, and far away in the
   Eastern land, when a river had to be crossed, should have plunged in on
   horseback before his whole army, to show the way, and perished in the
   attempt, seemed a fitting end for so brave a life; yet the mass of the
   people would not believe he was dead: in the popular imagination he
   became confounded with his great predecessor Charlemagne, and the
   legend was transferred to him, of the sleeping monarch in a hidden cave
   who was to start to life again in his country's utmost need.

  The Crusades

   But not only did the frequent expeditions of the Hohenstauffens into
   Italy bring the Germans into contact with the more refined culture of
   the Lombard cities and the southern Normans, yet wider fields were
   opened to them by the Crusades. It was at this period that one mighty
   impulse thrilled through Western Christendom, and drew men, women, and
   children even, nobles and peasants alike, to the service of the Cross.
   It was no wonder that men's hearts were attracted to a service which in
   this new form touched the springs of loyal allegiance to the invisible
   Lord, and of reverent compassion for His earthly sufferings, and also
   of worldly ambition and love of adventure, and opened to the soldier a
   means of securing as high a place in the heavenly kingdom by his own
   craft of fighting, as the monk could gain by prayer and mortification.
   And so for the next two hundred years there was a constant stream of
   Crusaders going to and returning from the East, and rendering the
   intercourse between the East and West almost as close as that between
   Europe and America in our own day. If these expeditions wrought much
   harm and misery by their terrible drain on the strongest part of the
   population, by the wild habits and unknown forms of disease (such as
   the Oriental leprosy and plague) which were brought home by returning
   bands of pilgrims, they also wrought much good. Many joined them from a
   true impulse of devotion, and came back trained and tempered knights
   and warriors who had learned letters and refinement from the Normans
   and Provençals; the priest and scholar brought back new ideas and new
   manuscripts from Greece; the merchant discovered new channels for
   commerce, and carried home new fruits and luxuries to his native fields
   and city. Germany, however, was less affected by the universal
   enthusiasm than the other European nations: it was longer before the
   fire was kindled in the slow hearts of the people: the struggles with
   the popes made enterprises patronised by them less popular; and there
   were never wanting men who looked on them with a disenchanted eye. "If
   it were of a truth so grievous to our Lord Christ," says one of the
   Minne-singers, "that the Saracens should rule over the spot of His
   entombment, could not He alone humble the power of the heathen nation,
   and would He need our hands to help Him?" An old monkish chronicle of
   Wurzburg begins its narration of the second crusade under the Emperor
   Conrad III., by declaring that in the year 1147, "there came into the
   country false prophets, sons of Belial, sworn servants of Antichrist,
   who by their empty words seduced Christians, and by their vain
   preaching impelled all kinds of men to go forth to deliver Jerusalem
   from the Saracens." It goes on to describe the mixed multitude that was
   gathered together for this purpose, and the very mixed motives that
   actuated them. "The one had this, the other that object. For many were
   curious after new things, and went forth to behold a strange land;
   others were constrained by poverty and the meanness of their
   circumstances at home, and these were ready to fight not only with the
   foes of the Cross of Christ, but with any good friends to Christendom,
   if thereby they might but get rid of this their poverty. Others again
   were burdened with debt, or hoped secretly to escape from the services
   they owed to their lord, or they feared the merited punishment of their
   misdeeds; all these simulated great zeal for God, but they were zealous
   only to throw down the heavy load of their own troubles. Scarce a few
   could be found who had not bowed the knee to Baal; who were guided by a
   pious and meritorious intention, and were so inflamed by the love of
   the Divine Majesty, that they were ready to shed their blood for the
   Most Holy Place. But we will leave this matter to Him who can read all
   hearts, only adding, that God best knoweth who are His." Similar
   judgments are expressed by many other writers throughout the twelfth
   century; and even where the poet or chronicler is filled with
   enthusiasm for the great idea embodied in these enterprises, we find a
   curiously frank and shrewd exposure of the defects in their execution.
   This mood of mind, a sort of slow practical good sense and perception
   of actual facts, may explain the circumstance noticed by many of their
   contemporaries, that the Germans were the last to join and the first to
   discontinue the Crusades. Still there is also a great capacity for
   enthusiasm in the German people, and they by no means stood apart
   altogether from what constituted the great life of Europe in those
   days. Four of their emperors took the Cross, and were followed to the
   East by immense armies, and many knights joined in other expeditions.

   The immediate fruit of this participation in the common life of
   Christendom was the rapid development of the institution of chivalry,
   and of a national literature--the first great outburst of German poetry
   and song. It came almost suddenly. We seem to pass at a bound from an
   age when literature was almost exclusively Latin and in the hands of
   the clergy, to one when it is German and chiefly in the hands of the
   knightly order. A few compositions indeed remain from the early part of
   the twelfth century which mark the period of transition; for though in
   language and subject they approach the new school, they are still the
   work of the clerical class. Such in religious poetry are the "Life of
   Jesus," by a nun who died in 1127, the version of the Pentateuch, and
   in secular poetry the Lays of Roland and of Alexander, &c., written by
   priests. But very soon a whole large [5] class of lyrical poets sprang
   up who are known to us as the Minne-singers; their works are in German,
   and show a wonderful mastery over the language. Instead of the
   imperfect rhymes and halting metre of the previous age, we have long
   poems in intricate metre and crowded with rhymes, which occur often in
   the middle as well as at the end of each line. It became the fashion to
   compose if possible, at least to learn and sing these poems. They flew
   over the country on the wings of the tunes attached to them; wandering
   knights and grooms taught them to each other; they were sung at
   village-wakes, and at courts and tournaments; and ladies had
   collections of them written on slips of parchment and tied together
   with bright-coloured ribbons. The subjects of this new poetry were,
   except in some rare cases, limited in range. It concerned itself almost
   entirely with ladies' love, with feats of arms, and with that contrast
   between the bright and dark side of human life which was so strongly
   felt throughout the mediaeval times, and never more so than at this
   period. It was, unlike that which had preceded it, an age when there
   was great enjoyment of life,--delight in adventure, in social
   intercourse, and knightly pastimes; delight in natural beauty, such as
   the glow of summer and the song of birds, in the beauty of women, of
   costume, of verse, of stately buildings. There is a strain of almost
   childlike gaiety to be heard in most of these old poets. But it was
   also a time when life was peculiarly uncertain; when long partings from
   home and friends, strange vicissitudes of fortune, or death, might
   overtake at any moment those in highest place; while the Christian
   faith had awakened in the thoughtful Teutonic race that sense of the
   incompleteness and inadequacy of all finite beauty, of remorse for sin,
   of mysterious awe in face of the eternal destinies of man, which once
   roused could never be wholly laid to sleep again. The very changes of
   the seasons came with a sharper contrast to those men in their rude
   uncomfortable abodes than we in our ceiled and glazed houses can well
   imagine. Winter was a time of darkness, discomfort, and isolation;
   spring brought life and hope, and was welcomed all over the country by
   symbolic festivals at which the prince and princess of May and their
   followers encountered and overcame the representative of savage Winter.
   Summer brought the happy out-of-doors toil to the husbandman; the
   tournament, or the real combat, or the wandering life to lady, and
   knight, and squire. No wonder then, that in the poetry of these days,
   the alternation of joy and sorrow, "Freud und Leid," meets us in every
   form; in the happiness of greeting and the pain of parting; in the
   gloom of winter and the joyousness of the May-time; in the praise of
   pleasure, and in meditations on penitence and death.
     __________________________________________________________________

  German Sequences

   In the Church, too, the voice of native song now made itself heard. The
   German Sequences, "Leisen," or "Leiche," [6] as they were also called,
   became much more common, and at the highest festivals were sung even at
   the service of the mass itself. One for Easter, which we meet with in
   many various forms, and another for Whitsuntide, were thus used, and
   have descended to the present day as the first verses of two of
   Luther's best-known hymns:--

   Christus ist erstanden

   [20]Luther


   "Christ the Lord is risen,

   Out of Death's dark prison,

   Let us all rejoice to-day,

   Christ shall be our hope and stay:

   Kyrie eleison.

   Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!

   Let us all rejoice to-day;

   Christ shall be our hope and stay.

   Kyrie eleison."

   Or in other forms--


   "Christ hath risen again,

   Broken every chain;"

   Or,


   "Christ is risen again,

   Out of all that pain."

   And for Whitsuntide, "here singeth the whole Church," as an old
   manuscript says,--

   Nu biten wir den heiligen geist

   [21]Spervogel. Twelfth century.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   "Now let us pray the Holy Ghost

   For that True Faith we need the most,

   And that He may keep us when death shall come,

   And from this ill world we travel home.

   Kyrie eleison."

   These are attributed to [22]Spervogel, a writer of the twelfth century,
   of whom we only know that he was a priest, of a burgher family, and a
   favourite sacred poet of that time. He composed many short didactic
   poems, almost epigrammatic in brevity and condensed thought, which were
   the beginning of a class of religious poetry that was much loved and
   practised in the next two or three centuries.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Another "Leich" or "Sequence" of his, which became extremely popular,
   is

THE PRAISE OF GOD.

   i

   Wurze des waldes

   [23]Spervogel. Twelfth century.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   All growth of the forest,

   The deep-hidden gold,

   All secret abysses,

   Thine eye doth behold;

   In Thy Hand all things lie.

   All the hosts of the heavens

   Cannot fill up the meed of Thy praises on high.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Another of his poems is called

HEAVEN AND HELL.

   i

   Er ist gewaltic unde Starc

   [24]Spervogel. Twelfth century.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   He is full of power and might

   Who was born on Christmas night,

   The holy Christ is He;

   Praised of all things that be,

   Save the devil, whose lothely pride

   Brooked not once to bow the knee,

   So must he in hell abide.


   In that hell is mickle woe,

   Well doth he who dwells there know;

   Shineth not the sun so bright,

   Helpeth not the moon by night,

   Not a star he there may see,

   Foul is all that meets his sight,

   Ah how fain in heaven were he!


   But in heaven there stands a Home,

   A golden way thereto doth come,

   The pillars are of marble fair,

   Set about with jewels rare,

   That our Lord for it doth win:

   But no man may enter there,

   Save that he be pure from sin.


   He who goeth to church full fain,

   Pure from envy and from stain,

   Gladsome life he well may have;

   Him await beyond the grave,

   Angel friends and blithesome morn,

   Heavenly life so fair and brave;

   Well for him that he was born!


   Alas! that I have served so long

   A lord that is both fell and strong;

   Evil wage from him I win,

   Ah I rue me of my sin!

   Holy Ghost, now succour me

   Ere my woes in hell begin,

   Break his bonds and set me free.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] The origin of this term is uncertain, but it is thought to have
   denoted at first a certain dance measure. It is often applied to very
   long poems of somewhat irregular structure.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Minne-Singers

   Several of the great Latin hymns were also translated into German at
   this time; and that these hymns and sequences were used in church is
   proved by a passage in a Life of St. Bernard by a contemporary and
   disciple, in which it is expressly mentioned that in the cathedral at
   Cologne the people broke out into hymns of praise in the German tongue
   at every miracle wrought by the saint; and the writer regrets that when
   they left the German soil this custom ceased, as the nations who spoke
   the Romanic languages did not possess native hymns after the manner of
   the others. Still undoubtedly their use in church was very restricted,
   and was always regarded with suspicion by the more papal of the clergy;
   but there were many other occasions in life on which they were
   employed: they seem to have been commonly sung at the saints' festivals
   and special services which were frequently held outside the church, and
   on pilgrimages. So St. Francis, in an address to his monks in the year
   1221, says: "There is a certain country called Germany, wherein dwell
   Christians, and of a truth very pious ones, who as you know often come
   as pilgrims into our land, with their long staves and great boots; and
   amid the most sultry heat and bathed in sweat, yet visit all the
   thresholds of the holy shrines, and sing hymns of praise to God and all
   His saints."

   It may give us some idea of the quantity of poetry written from this
   time onwards, that the great collection by M. Wackernagel of religious
   poetry prior to the Reformation, contains nearly 1500 pieces, and the
   names of 85 different poets, while many of the poems are anonymous, and
   much no doubt has perished. Among the names still left a large number
   are secular, others are those of monks and priests, and the vanity of
   the world forms not unnaturally their frequent theme. Here is a
   graceful little poem of this kind by a monk of the thirteenth century,
   entitled
     __________________________________________________________________

THE BEAUTY OF THIS WORLD.

   Diu rose ist die schoeneste under alle


   O Rose! of the flowers, I ween, thou art fairest,

   But thorny and worthless the stem that thou bearest,

   Fleeting thy beauty, unlovely thy fruit;

   World, I would liken thee unto the roses,

   Sweet are thy flatteries, sad are their closes,

   Virtue and goodness in thee have no root.


   Red is the berry, O Rose! on thy bushes,

   Harsh is its inside, though fairly it blushes;

   So, World, dost thou lure us and mock us with lies:

   Outside thy seeming is gracious and sunny,

   Outside thy greetings are sweet as the honey,

   Bitter thy kernel;--O man, then be wise!
     __________________________________________________________________

   But in the list we also find the greatest of the knightly
   Minne-singers, Hartmann von der Aue, Reinmar von Hagenau, Gottfried von
   Strasburg, Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the noble singer Walther von der
   Vogelweide.

   Hartmann "of the Meadow," as he calls himself has left us several
   crusaders' songs, and among them the following:--

CRUSADER'S HYMN.

   Min fröede wart nie sorgelos


   My joy was ne'er unmixed with care

   Until the day

   I took this sign that now I bear,

   Christ's flower of May:

   It tells us of a summer-time,

   That will not wither,

   A lovely, eye-delighting clime:

   God bring us thither!

   Up to the numerous choirs,

   From which to deepest fires,

   His falsehood hurled the Prince of Ill;

   But to the good stand open still.


   For so the world with me hath dealt,

   My mind no more

   Longs for her gifts; what once I felt,

   Thank God, is o'er!

   God hath been very good to me

   O'er many another,

   Since He from cares hath set me free

   That choke and smother

   Love in the heart, and bind to home

   The foot that fain afar would roam;

   While I exultant onward fare,

   The triumphs of Christ's hosts to share.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Another crusading song, which was very widely used on pilgrimages in
   these days, was sung to a melody which has been preserved to the
   present time, by its connexion with one of Luther's hymns; [7] it is
   this:--

PILGRIM'S SONG.

   In Gotes namen faren wir


   Now in the name of God we go,

   His grace be round us evermo;

   God's strength be with us every hour

   And fill us with His mighty power.

   Kyrie eleison.


   And may the Holy Cross be still

   Our shield from every ghostly ill,

   The Cross where Christ endured such woe;

   O thence shall all our gladness flow!

   Kyrie eleison.


   And also from the Holy Tomb,

   Where He Himself lay wrapped in gloom,

   With the five wounds He deigned to bear;

   Rejoicing, let us onward fare

   Toward thee, Jerusalem.


   Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison!

   O help us now, Thou Holy Ghost,

   O Thou most blessed Voice of God,

   To tread with joy the toilsome road

   Toward thee, Jerusalem!


   Kyrie eleison!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] That on the Ten Commandments.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Another crusader and Minne-singer of those days, Sir Reinmar of
   Hagenau, gives us a glimpse of the struggle that must have gone on in
   many minds between the love of pleasure and the self-control that
   befitted a soldier of the Cross, a struggle of which we may still use
   his own words, "full many another feels it too:--"

UNRULY THOUGHTS.

   Des tages do ich daz kriuze nam


   E'er since the day this Cross was mine,

   I set a guard upon my thought,

   As well beseems the Holy Sign,

   And as a faithful pilgrim ought;

   To God I raise my thoughts by night and day,

   That from His service ne'er my foot may stray

   But they would have their will, and roam

   Unchecked as they were wont to do;

   Nor is this trouble mine alone,

   Full many another feels it too.


   All other things were lightly borne,

   If but my thoughts would keep true ways;

   The God whom I to serve have sworn

   They help me not enough to praise,--

   Not as I ought, and for my soul were well.

   On the old stories they are fain to dwell,

   And lure me back to pleasures past

   That I was eager once to seek;

   Christ, Thou forbid them, turn them thence;

   For my own strength is all too weak.


   But I would not forbid them quite

   To seek by times their native land;

   Awhile I let them take their flight,

   Then want them swiftly here at hand;

   So there to greet our friends they oft are sent,

   Then back they come to help me to repent,

   To win forgiveness for us both,

   For sins that all my past beset

   Yet fear I their deceitfulness,

   Fear they may oft mislead me yet.


   Farewell then, Pleasure! well for him

   To whom thou comest harmlessly;

   Thou haunt'st me still in visions dim,

   Though of thy bondage I am free:

   The days, the nights, when once I shunned thee not,

   By many an effort have I now forgot,

   Closed are the paths that toward thee lead;

   Let no man point the way to thee

   Afresh,--I count him else a foe

   To my sworn service and to me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   A little anonymous poem of the same date, the last verse of which
   appears, from the metre, to be incomplete, surprises us by what seems
   to us the modern tone of its tender and passionate

LAMENT.

   O wê des smerzen


   Alas for my sorrow!

   My heart is in pain;

   Where is hope for the morrow

   To whom now complain?

   O God, take compassion

   On me lying low,

   And comfort, O comfort me,

   Through Thine own woe.


   Keenly regretful,

   I call to my mind

   How we are forgetful,

   How He is so kind!

   Who gladly, yet painfully,

   Yielded His breath,

   Only to ransom us

   Ever from death.


   Where shall I find Him,

   Him dearest to me,

   Who let His foes bind Him

   That we might be free?
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

  Walter von der Vogelweide

   But among all these singers, Walter von der Vogelweide (of the Birds'
   nests or the aviary) may be singled out as their highest type. He was
   the darling of his own times, and is constantly referred to by other
   poets as "their master in the lovely art of words and tones," "the
   sweetest of all nightingales," &c. It is not known what part of Germany
   was his birthplace, but he travelled all over it in the course of his
   life; he was a welcome guest at its courts, especially those of
   Thuringia and Austria, and he was a crusader. His poems give us the
   picture of a life such as we can well understand in these days, however
   different the circumstances may be,--a life full of travel, and of
   interest in questions of politics and religion, and even of literature.
   For the frequent reference to each other's works by these
   Minne-singers, with criticism or with praise, shows that those days too
   had their literary world. A large number of his poems are like those of
   the other Minne-singers, filled with praises of his lady, and of the
   May-time,--graceful, tender, often quaint and naive lyrics. So one
   begins:--
     __________________________________________________________________

   So die bluomen uz dem grase dringent


   "When the flowers out of the grass are springing,

   And seem to laugh at the glorious sun,

   On an early morning in May,

   And the little birds are all loudly singing

   Their very best, because summer's begun,

   'Tis half heaven itself in the May."
     __________________________________________________________________

   And again--

MAY MIRACLES.

   *     *     *     *

   Muget in schowen waz dem meien


   Would ye see the lovely wonder

   Wrought us by the May?

   See how all are laughing yonder,

   Whether priest or lay.

   Mighty magic doth she hold,

   Whence it cometh who shall tell?

   But so far as reigns her spell,

   No one feeleth old.


   We are full of joy and springing,

   Welcoming the May

   With our dancing, laughing, singing:

   No sad dumps to-day!

   Heavy looks were now to blame;

   Since the birds in happy throngs

   Carol forth their sweetest songs,

   Let us do the same!


   Gentle May, thou showerest fairly

   Gifts afar and near;

   Clothest all the woods so rarely

   And the meadows here:

   O'er the heath new colours glow;

   Flowers and clover on the plain,

   Merry rivals, strive amain

   Which can fastest grow.


   Lady! part me from my sadness,

   Love me while 'tis May:

   Mine is but a borrowed gladness

   If thou frown alway;

   Look around and smile anew!

   All the world is glad and free;

   Let a little joy from thee

   Fall to my lot too!
     __________________________________________________________________

   But others treat of higher and more serious themes, and show us a man
   deeply engaged in the political and religious life of his day. He was a
   warm lover of his country, but he does not hesitate to rebuke and
   satirize his countrymen, whether clergy or laity, for their faults and
   shortcomings. In the great struggle between the Pope and the Emperor,
   he is heart and soul on the national side, and writes such stern
   reproofs and bitter epigrams on the Head of the Church, as startle us
   from one of its sons. But he is an earnest Christian, sometimes
   lamenting his own sins with simple penitence, sometimes expressing a
   strong and manly faith. He preaches the Crusade, and so heartily that
   he refuses the meed of a poet's praises to the archangels themselves,
   if they come not to the succour of Christendom.

   We give first one of his famous patriotic songs, then three of his
   religious poems, and then a crusader's hymn.

THE PRAISE OF GERMANY.

   Ir sult sprechen willekomen


   Ye should raise the cry of "Welcome

   To the bearer of tidings"--for I am he!

   All that ye have heard aforetime

   Was merely a wind;--now ask of me!

   But my guerdon must not fail;

   If ye make me now good cheer,

   I have that to say ye will love to hear;

   Look, what bid ye for my tale?


   I will tell to German ladies

   Such gentle tidings in this fair land,

   As on earth may none be sweeter;--

   Nor great the guerdon I demand.

   Ah what could I from them require?

   They are too high for me, I trow;

   I am modest, nor ask them to bend so low,

   Fair greetings only I desire.


   I have seen full many a country,

   And sought out the best in every part,

   But if alien scene or customs

   Could ever like German please my heart,

   May evil hap that heart befall!

   I speak the truth, for of what avail

   To strive unfairly with words or in mail?

   German breeding surpasseth all.


   From the Elbe stream to the Rhine,

   And back to the far Hungarian ground,

   Dwell the best and sweetest women

   That I in all the world have found.

   If my skill be true and keen

   In noble breeding and beauty rare,

   Better the women are here, I swear,

   Than high dames I have elsewhere seen.


   German men are brave and modest,

   Like angels in truth their women seem;

   He who blames them is deluded,

   No otherwise of him I deem.

   Noble Virtue, constant Love,

   Let him come hither who seeks for these,

   They dwell in this land, with joy and ease:

   Long may I live there, no more to rove!
     __________________________________________________________________

A MORNING PRAYER.

   Mit saelden müeze ich hiute ûf steh


   In safety may I rise to-day;

   Lord God, defend Thou all my way,

   Where'er I go or ride throughout the land.

   O Christ, now suffer me to prove

   The mighty power of Thy dear love,

   And for Thy mother's sake guard me on every hand:

   As holy angels from on high

   Once guarded Thee when Thou didst lie,

   Thou ancient God, a babe of days,

   Before the ox and ass so meek and still;

   When Joseph ever good and true

   To Thee and them gave tendance due,

   With faithful care that still hath praise:

   So care Thou, Lord, for me, in me fulfil

   Thine own commands, and keep me in Thy ways.
     __________________________________________________________________

EQUALITY BEFORE GOD.

   Swer âne vorhte, herre Got


   Lord God, if one without due fear

   Repeat Thy ten commandments here,

   And break them then,--not true His love to Thee.

   So if one call Thee Father, yet

   His brethren own not, or forget,

   Sick is his heart, though sound his words may be.

   Thou madest us of self-same blood,

   We eat alike, and live by food;

   If one should find a heap of bones

   From which the worms have stripped the fleshly pall,

   How could he lord from servant tell,

   Though once he might have known them well?

   God sits above all earthly thrones,

   And feeds all living creatures great and small;

   Jews, Heathens, Christians, are His servants all.
     __________________________________________________________________

REPENTANCE.

   Vil wol gelobter Got wie selten ich dich prîse


   How seldom praise I Thee, to whom all lauds belong!

   Yet since from Thee I hold both speech and song,

   How dare thy vassal do Thy rule such wrong?

   Alas! nor rightful works, nor proper love is mine

   To Thee, my Father, nor my fellows here,

   None yet to me as my own self was dear:

   Father and Son, one God, Thy Spirit in me shine!

   How shall I love him who hath wrought me ill?

   He who hath done me good must aye be dearer still.

   Forgive my sins, I yet towards this will set my will!
     __________________________________________________________________

IN THE HOLY LAND.

   Nu alrest leb ich mir werde.


   Now at last is life worth living,

   Since my sinful eyes behold

   This pure land, where One forgiving

   Wrought such mighty deeds of old!

   What I prayed for now I have,

   I behold the soil, the grave,

   Where God dwelt as Man, to save.


   Lovely Land, so rich in story,

   Far above all I have seen

   Dost thou bear the palm of glory;

   Ah what wonders here have been!

   That a Virgin bare a Child

   Lord of angels, yet so mild,

   Sounds it not a wonder wild?


   Here baptized was He most holy,

   Purity for us to win,

   Stooped to bondage sore and lowly,

   To set free the slaves of sin.

   But for Him were we forlorn,

   His sharp spear and crown of thorn;

   Heathen, dare ye Him to scorn?


   Ah how far His pity stretches,

   Tasting death in very deed,

   He the rich for us poor wretches,

   But to save us in our need!

   That He shrank not from such woe,

   Willingly could bend so low,

   Greater wonder could one know?


   Here the Son to hell descended

   From the grave wherein He lay,

   By the Father still attended

   And the Spirit, whom none may

   Sever from Him. They are One,

   Sole and glorious as the sun;

   So it was ere time begun.


   There He hath the devil vanquished,

   Whom no Kaiser e'er could quell,

   Freed those who in prison languished;

   Then sore griefs the Jews befell,

   He whom they had wrought such woes

   Broke their strictest watch, and rose

   Living Conqu'ror o'er His foes.


   Forty days this land beholds Him,

   Forty days, and then He went

   Where the Father's light enfolds Him,

   Whence His Spirit He hath sent,--

   May He keep us in His grace!

   Holy is this land and place

   That hath seen God face to face!


   Here He told of that expected

   Day of terrors, long deferred,

   When the prayers, by men rejected,

   Of the widow shall be heard,

   And the oppressed shall find a friend,

   And the wise no arts defend;

   Chasten now, ere comes that end!


   Then that judge's righteous sentence

   No lament hath power to stay;

   Here, O here may be repentance,

   Wait not for the final day;

   Pledge nor hostage then avail,

   Thou must answer without fail,

   And thyself meet bliss or bale.


   But if what I now have spoken

   Seemeth not to you too long,

   List one moment yet, ere broken

   Fails the current of my song.

   All God's mightiest works for man

   Here in this fair land began,

   Here too ends the wondrous plan.


   Christians, Heathens, Jews assever

   Each that it is theirs of right;

   God alone, the bless'd for ever,

   Must decide it with His might.

   All the world is fighting here,

   Ours the rightful cause, no fear

   God will make its justice clear!

   The Minne-songs, which form a purely lyrical poetry, were soon followed
   by poems of the narrative and didactic class. Early in this same
   thirteenth century the Nibelungen-Lied received its present shape; and
   the old legends, some like this taken from the heathen times, others of
   purely Christian origin, became the favourite subjects of the poets.
   The stories of Tristram, Percival, and the quest of the Holy
   Grail--knightly romances and histories of saints that were half
   mystical and symbolical, half legendary--must have filled the
   imaginations of youths and ladies in those days as novels do in ours.
   Most of these stories were connected with that circle of legends of
   which King Arthur and his Round Table form the centre, and were thus
   derived from a foreign, generally from a French or Provençal source,
   but their treatment was entirely German. It soon betrays two opposite
   tendencies, one of which takes up the external side of these romances,
   that of love of adventure and worldly success; while the other brings
   into relief their religious element and the development of character,
   and anticipates in the latter respect somewhat of the characteristics
   of the modern novel. Of these schools the representative types are
   Gottfried von Strasburg and Wolfram von Eschenbach. The former chose
   for the subject of his longest poem the story of Tristram and Iseult,
   and makes it the vehicle of depicting the knightly life of his own
   times on its most stirring and fascinating side. The latter selects the
   quest of the Holy Grail by Sir Percival, and embodies in his poem those
   grave and high conceptions of knightly duty and religious faith, which
   characterise the more serious thought of his day. Wolfram von
   Eschenbach was a Bavarian by birth, of ancient and noble family, but
   being a younger son, he possessed but little worldly wealth, and seems
   to have led a wandering life, welcome as knight and poet alike at the
   German courts and castles. From the frequent allusions in his principal
   poem to the court of Thuringia, he no doubt formed one of the band of
   knights, poets, and adventurers, who gathered round the Landgrave
   Hermann of Thuringia, and made that little court at once brilliant and
   disturbed. Wolfram's lifetime coincided with the brightest period of
   the German Empire under the Hohenstauffens, for he was born under
   Frederick Barbarossa, and died under Frederick II. German chivalry was
   then at its highest point, and religious fervour was kindled to
   enthusiasm by the Crusades; thus it is but natural that these should
   form the moving springs of his romance.

Sir Percival

   It opens with the history of Gamuret, the father of Percival, a younger
   son of the noble house of Anjou, a knight of the adventure-loving
   order, who can never enjoy life but in stirring action. He takes
   service at one time under the Caliph of Bagdad, and wins the hand of a
   Saracen princess. But he soon leaves her to seek new conflicts, and
   after his departure she bears him a son, who grows up a heathen, but a
   very brave and noble knight. At last in Spain he obtains, as victor in
   a tournament, the hand of the queen and a large territory, and for a
   time lives happily with his wife; but hearing that his former sovereign
   is in need of his services, he sets out for the East, and is slain by
   the way. The queen almost dies of grief for his death, but lives at
   last for the sake of her little son Percival. Fearing, however, lest he
   should inherit his father's spirit and meet with his father's fate, she
   retires with him into a deep forest, where she brings him up in perfect
   seclusion, and forbids the few faithful attendants who had followed
   her, ever to name chivalry or knighthood in his presence:--

   But her precautions are unavailing. One day three shining knights come
   riding through the green forest. The boy thinks they must be gods, they
   are so bright, and kneels to them. They tell him they are knights, show
   him their weapons, and, when he wants to know how he may become like
   them, tell him to seek King Arthur's court. Now nothing can detain the
   boy, his mother finds her tears are useless, and gives permission for
   his departure; but hoping to drive him back to her through disgust with
   the world, she sends him forth in a fool's dress, bidding him to wear
   it for her sake, to honour old men, and to prize a woman's kiss and her
   ring. So he sets out, and meets with various adventures to which his
   simplicity and unknightly dress give a half-comic air; he makes his
   way, however, by dint of courage and straightforwardness, and comes at
   last to King Arthur's court. Here he undertakes a combat with a knight
   in red armour, Ither, and slays him; but though Arthur and Guinevere
   receive him kindly, touched by his beauty, his courage, and his
   simplicity, he finds himself an object of derision to the other knights
   and ladies, and makes his escape carrying with him the armour and horse
   of the Red Knight. After a while he reaches the castle of a grey-haired
   noble knight, and, remembering his mother's instructions to ask the
   counsel of old men, he goes up to the knight and requests from him
   shelter and advice. Here he remains for some time, and speedily becomes
   proficient in knightly exercises and demeanour, assisted partly by a
   flying fancy that he feels for his host's fair daughter, Liasse. But he
   knows that he has not yet earned the right to a lady's love, and
   moreover the longing for action is upon him, and so once more he
   departs:--

   In time he meets with a most beautiful princess, Konduiramir, who is
   besieged by cruel foes; he rescues her, falls deeply in love with her,
   and is at last rewarded by her hand and crown, and lives for a time
   happily with her. The land flourishes under his wise and mild sway, and
   all seems going well, till he remembers how long it is since he has had
   news of his mother, and sets forth to find her once more.

   Riding alone beside a lake in the deep forest, he meets with the sick
   king, Amfortas, disguised as a fisherman, who directs him to a wondrous
   castle, Monsalvas, which is in truth the abode of the Sangreal, or as
   it is always called in this poem, "the Holy Grail." The Holy Grail was
   said to be a vessel of pure emerald, belonging to Joseph of Arimathaea,
   from which our Lord had partaken of the Last Passover, and which had
   received the blood that flowed from His wounded Side. Since then it was
   said to dwell in a certain palace, guarded and served by knights and
   ladies. Wherever it appeared it bestowed what was needed for earthly
   wants, and for the soul's salvation; but none could see it except by
   special grace, and none were admitted to its service except the pure
   and devoted. Sir Percival is now put to the test, by being permitted to
   behold the Holy Grail. He is admitted to the splendid castle, and
   treated with hospitality; he sees the sick King Amfortas, who is
   suffering acute anguish from a poisoned wound. The Holy Vessel is borne
   through the banqueting hall by its train of beautiful virgins, but Sir
   Percival remains unmoved; he asks not the meaning of what he sees, he
   asks not why Amfortas is suffering thus. So he goes to rest; when he
   wakes the next morning, the castle is still and deserted; in the
   courtyard he finds his horse ready saddled and bridled, but no one is
   to be seen. As he leaves the castle a groom calls after him from one of
   the towers, bidding him depart as hateful to the sun. Percival turns in
   anger, but the window is closed, and not a creature is visible. A
   little further he meets his cousin Sigima, who is mourning in the
   forest over the death of her lover, and the story of whose faithful
   love and grief forms a touching episode. She hears where he has been,
   and explains to him all he has witnessed, but when she finds that
   neither pity nor wonder had moved him to speak, she cries woe upon him
   and drives him from her.

   Percival rides on "with a thorn in his heart," but without clearly
   seeing what he has done wrong, nor does he for some time experience any
   ill effects from it. On the contrary, after various successful
   adventures, he reaches King Arthur's court, where he is received with
   acclamations; a splendid banquet is prepared in his honour, and Gawain,
   the King's nephew, shows him especial friendship. But in the midst of
   the banquet, when the festivity is at its height, his fate overtakes
   him. Kundria the sorceress, a terrible messenger from the Sangreal,
   rides into the hall, tells the knights that they and their Round Table
   are dishonoured by the fellowship of Percival, relates the story of his
   visit to Monsalvas, then tells them of another quest of the Castle
   Merveilleux, in which also honour is to be won, and disappears. She is
   followed by a strange knight, who accuses Gawain of wrong, and
   challenges him fiercely. All the knights rise from table, and gather
   round Gawain and Percival to console them. But Percival is
   inconsolable:--

   *     *     *     *

   *     *     *     *

   He determines to start at once on the quest of the Holy Grail, and not
   to return until his honour is restored. Gawain undertakes the quest of
   the Castle Merveilleux, and so the two depart. From this point the
   story divides, sometimes following the fortunes of one, sometimes of
   the other hero. But the story of Gawain is not a mere episode: he
   represents the child of this world; brave, ready, untroubled by deeper
   thoughts, he meets with difficulties indeed, but with far more good
   luck and brilliant success than Percival, until the latter accomplishes
   his object at last. Percival, on the contrary, encounters life in a
   much more dreary and commonplace aspect; for five years he wanders on,
   never reconciled to God, taking no pleasure in anything, meeting with
   no brilliant adventures, but carrying in his heart an intense longing
   to behold once more the Holy Grail, repair his fault, and then to be
   reunited to his wife, whom he never forgets. At last he meets with a
   hermit, Trevizrent, a brother of Amfortas, to whom he tells all his
   sorrows, and whose instructions at last restore him to faith. Percival
   says:--

   Trevizrent replies by making Percival see bow his conduct at Monsalvas
   proved him unworthy of the honour that had been done him in admitting
   him to the vision of the Holy Grail; how his youthful impetuosity had
   been the cause of his mother's death, who had expired of grief for his
   long absence; and how his love of strife had led him to kill the Red
   Knight, who was his own cousin, a man of great virtue and purity, and
   would have been his friend. Towards God his sin is defined as
   disloyalty, the forsaking his rightful allegiance on the touch of
   trial. Throughout the poem we find that man's highest duty is conceived
   as loyalty to the various relations in which he may be placed, whether
   towards God or man. Doubt, fickleness, inconstancy are the deepest
   stains on a knight. Trevizrent thus vindicates the justice of God in
   punishing him, and then goes on to speak of the help he may yet expect
   from Him:--

   *     *     *     *

   *     *     *     *

   Percival now becomes reconciled to God; he remains fifteen days sharing
   the hermit's fare, and learning from him the true history of the Holy
   Grail, and the meaning of all he saw, and then once more sets out on
   his quest. In course of time he arrives at King Arthur's court, just at
   the moment when Gawain has returned from his successful expeditions,
   bringing with him the beautiful Duchess Orgueilleuse, who has consented
   to become his wife. Once she had attempted to lure Percival from his
   allegiance to Konduiramir, but in vain. Gawain has now invited the
   whole Round Table to witness his nuptials, and his combat with
   Gramoflanz. Early in the morning he rides out to try his powers, he
   meets with Percival, and, not recognising him, attacks him; they fight
   long. Just as Percival is about to win the victory an exclamation of
   the squire's betrays to him his opponent's name; he instantly flings
   away his sword, dismounts, and reproaches himself for having fought
   with his friend. The combat with Gramoflanz is postponed to the next
   day, to give Gawain time to recover. Percival however contrives at dawn
   to take it upon himself, in order to spare Gawain, and overthrows
   Gramoflanz. He gives him his life; Gawain and he are reconciled, and
   three marriages are arranged at once. Percival is restored to his place
   at the Round Table, and treated with the highest distinction. Many a
   lady would fain try to console the stately knight, who never smiles
   except in courtesy; but he cares for no one but Konduiramir, and all
   the happy love around him only quickens his longing after her. He lies
   awake till dawn, then

   But his time of trial is now nearly at an end. Not far from the camp he
   encounters his half-brother the heathen Feirefiss; they fight: Percival
   is almost overcome, but his strength is restored by prayer, and he is
   on the point of conquering, when his sword breaks in his hand. The
   relationship is now discovered; Percival returns to Arthur's camp with
   his brother, and in the midst of the rejoicings Kundria the sorceress
   appears once more to tell him that he is accepted as the monarch of the
   Holy Grail. He sets out for Monsalvas, heals Amfortas by the power of
   prayer, and then is suffered to meet with Konduiramir.

   *     *     *     *

   *     *     *     *

   They now all proceed to Monsalvas. Feirefiss receives baptism, which
   enables him to behold the Holy Grail; he marries the royal virgin who
   has hitherto borne it, and the two return to the far East to spread the
   true faith there. The younger of Percival's twin sons is sent back to
   the world to become the king of his temporal dominions, and Percival
   himself with Konduiramir and his elder son are left reigning at
   Monsalvas.

   Such is a slight sketch of the finest and most earnest of these early
   German romantic epics. The style is at times long-winded and
   prolix,--thus we have two pages full of all the remedies tried by
   Amfortas for his wounds,--but the poem is pervaded not only by a lofty
   tone of thought and feeling, but by much grace, tenderness, and
   imagination, with touches of humour, and half-sarcastic, half-courtly
   allusions to the life and the writings of his own times.


   "Each morn he bathes him in the stream;

   Of care or harm he does not dream;

   But when the birds' delicious song

   Held ear and heart in magic strong,

   His breast swells with a longing deep;

   The child runs to his mother's side;

   But when she asks, 'What makes thee weep?'

   He cannot tell and will not bide,

   As children wont at every tide.

   His mother, filled with wakeful care,

   Watches his footsteps everywhere,

   Till once, unseen, she sees her boy

   Lost in a dream of vaguest joy,

   Listening to that sweet song. Then she

   Swore the birds' enemy to be;

   She bade her squires to catch and kill

   All birds they found, the good and ill.

   But ah! the birds were craftier yet;

   They slipped away from bow and net,

   And sweeter still o'er copse and corn

   Rang their dear song at break of morn.

   The boy then asked her wherefore she

   To harmless birds was enemy,--

   'Dear mother, let these murders cease,

   And let us live with them at peace.'

   The mother kissed her lovely boy;

   'How could I thus break God's command,

   Who made them but for purest joy!'

   Awhile the boy doth musing stand;

   'Who is God? mother mine,' he saith.

   'My child, receive my words in faith:

   God dwells above us bright as day;

   Mercy and love are His alway:

   Cry to Him in the hour of need;

   He loves to help, and that with speed.

   But there is one, His direst foe,

   Faithless and cruel; far below

   That Black one dwells in darkest night:

   Heed not his lures, nor fear his might,

   But even in thought from him, O flee

   From him and Doubt, O keep thee free.'"


   "In dress and manners now need he

   Ne'er blush in noblest company;

   Yet had his master's teachings stirred

   Thoughts that till then had slept unheard,

   That made his heart beat restlessly.

   Too small his world seems now to him,

   Too strait its bounds, its light too dim;

   A mist before his eyes seemed spread,

   No charm was in the verdant mead,

   In him and round him twilight grey;--

   His ignorance had passed away."


   "There stunned and mute sits Percival,--

   Ah, what avails the manhood now

   Of that brave heart, its chastity,

   Its lofty aims and ardent glow?

   He is disgraced before them all.

   Yet innocent and pure is he,

   No vice can in his life be found,

   Ne'er have his steps transgressed the bound

   Of modesty, the soul's true prize

   And fairest crown in noble eyes.


   "Gawain embraced the valiant man,

   And strives to cheer him as he can,

   'O friend, thy journey well I know

   Will bring thee many a toil and woe:

   God give thee luck, and grant to me

   In time of need to succour thee.'

   But Percival cried, 'What is God?

   Would He have suffered such a load

   Of scorn to fall on thee and me

   Were He so good and great and free?

   The fountain of His might is dry.

   Him truly served my arm and heart,

   My recompense is this sore smart;

   Henceforth His service I resign,

   If He hath wrath, that wrath be mine.

   O friend, thou go'st to war and strife,

   Take for thy aid a faithful wife,

   A woman fair and chaste and good,

   Complete in tender womanhood;

   Be she thy guide, thy strength, and guard,

   Her love will be thy best reward.'"


   "Like to a dream my joy is fled,

   A weight of grief is on my head;

   Where church and minsters fairly rise,

   I ne'er am seen by mortal eyes;

   In strife and combat am I known,

   Yet hate I none but God alone;

   For He, revengeful, sends me scorn

   And sorrows scarcely to be borne.

   if God would give us help indeed,

   No anchor else my life would need,

   But jealous of my just renown,

   Fate all my deeds with thorns doth crown;

   And could God help it, could He right:--

   Let men praise as they will His might;--

   I cry aloud unjust is He

   Who leaves me bound by misery."


   "Eternally shall sound His praise

   Who showed to man such wealth of grace,

   His noble nature bowed to us

   And stooped to wear our likeness thus.

   God's name and nature is pure Truth,

   He hateth all disloyalty;

   Then think upon thy life with ruth,

   And let thy firm decision be

   Never from Him to turn aside,

   Who still is true whate'er betide.


   He is the Father far above,

   Whose essence is unfaltering Love;

   Yet love or wrath the world may choose;

   Ah woe! if thou that love refuse!


   But God is also radiant Light,

   Piercing the thickest walls with might;

   No secret impulse stirs the breast

   But stands before that eye confest;

   The swiftest thought He sees and tries

   Ere it from heart to lips can rise.

   If God so judge each thought that lurks

   Within thee, on thy own vain works

   How wilt thou dare to found a claim?

   Must thou not bend with inward shame

   Before that Perfect Purity,

   And ask His grace to succour thee?

   Thou hast thy choice, or love or wrath,

   But choose, oh choose, the better path;

   Changed be thy mind, then shalt thou prove

   That God can look on thee with love."


   "His eye dath on the armour rest

   That lies before him, and his breast

   Anew is filled with heavy sighs:

   'If Fate for aye to me denies

   What on her favourites she bestows,

   The joy of happy love, whose power

   Can put to flight the sorest woes,

   Nought else I ask that she can shower.

   But God wills not such happiness!

   If we had loved each other less,

   The tie might break, and I might find

   Some solace elsewhere to my mind.

   But her love hath such hold on me,

   Who never from my griefs am free,

   No love or joy can in me dwell,

   My sickness is incurable.

   Fate loves to give in lavish measure

   To those who strive for earthly pleasure!

   God give sweet joy to all men here!

   But from their host I disappear.'"


   "So Percival rode all night through

   To meet that lady sweet and true;

   Till with the earliest blush of day

   A host of tents before him lay,

   Pitched on the dewy flowery sward,

   Bright banners floating all abroad.


   He finds the tent where sleeps the Queen

   Among her women, and between

   Her beauteous twins;--Ah, now at last

   His joy is come, his griefs are past!

   There on the bed of whitest snow

   Three lovely heads like roses glow,

   Lit by the morning beam they sleep,

   Smiling in slumber calm and deep.


   Till the Queen wakened, opes her eyes,

   Beholds him there with glad surprise,

   And springs to her great hero's breast,

   By joy itself o'ercome, opprest,

   With kisses covers all his face,

   And holds him in a close embrace.

   She cries: 'Thee now my God doth send,

   My heart's delight, my only joy;

   At last, at last there is an end

   Of mournful days and long annoy;

   I have my heart's most fervent prayer,

   And fled is every thought of care.'"


   "So I, Wolfram von Eschenbach,

   Following the Master whom I trust,

   Have told the story true and just

   Of the great deeds of Percival,

   His noble race, his children all;

   I leave him in that lofty place

   Where he was called by Heaven's high grace,

   And he whose life shall end like this,

   Whose soul no guilt or bitterness

   From God above hath power to part,

   Whose valiant arm and noble heart

   Earth's homage too of right obtain,--

   I trow he hath not lived in vain."

CHAPTER IV.
DARK TIMES AND BRIGHT TIMES.
A.D.1253-1500

   But as dark days came over Germany, after the fall of the
   Hohenstauffens, the bloom of her knightly poetry faded, and another
   style, chiefly didactic or mystical, but of much lower poetic merit,
   took its place.

   Perplexed and troubled indeed must have been many hearts in the trials
   that now fell on Germany. Frederick II., the last of the
   Hohenstauffens, a wise and brave prince, a patron of the large cities
   and of learning, and a successful crusader, died in 1250; and for
   twenty-three years Germany was without a settled head, until the choice
   of the princes devolved on Rudolph of Hapsburg. To a great extent every
   man did that which was right in his own eyes; and as there existed a
   numerous class of returned crusaders and unemployed soldiers, the
   smaller castles all over the country were soon transformed into
   robber-strongholds, whose inhabitants lived by levying a sort of
   black-mail on the merchants and peasants whom they despised. The great
   cities alone were able to protect themselves; they purchased or assumed
   their freedom from the lords who still asserted manorial rights over
   them, and leagued together to defend it, forming the Swabian league in
   the South and the Hanseatic in the North; and from this time onwards we
   find them sending deputies to the diet, and recognised as an
   independent portion of the empire. Rudolph of Hapsburg did his best to
   restore order, and destroyed, it is said, in Thuringia alone seventy of
   the robber-castles, whose ruins still add to the picturesqueness of
   that region of wooded hills and romantic glens. But the twenty years of
   his reign were but an interval of peace amid a succession of storms.
   During the first half of the fourteenth century the distractions of
   Germany reached their height. There were rival emperors at home, rival
   popes abroad, and bitter conflicts between the civil and ecclesiastical
   powers. On the 25th November, 1314, two emperors, Frederick of Austria
   and Louis of Bavaria, were crowned at once; and for eight years, until
   the battle of Mühldorff in 1322, a desolating warfare between their
   respective partisans was carried on all over the country. While the
   struggle lasted the Pope declined to pronounce decisively in favour of
   either candidate, but was supposed to lean to the side of Louis of
   Bavaria. When, however, Louis was left master of the field, the Pope
   refused to acknowledge him, unless he consented in the fullest terms,
   to hold the empire as a fief of the Holy See. To this Louis would not
   accede, and he was supported by the diet, who gave him their undivided
   vote, and at last declared that the unanimous choice of the country was
   the true source of the imperial dignity, and sufficed to bestow it
   without any consent of the Pope. The Pope now laid Germany under an
   interdict, which was not removed from some districts for twenty-six
   years. During an interdict all the ordinary ministrations of religion
   were suspended; no church was open, no bell was heard, no sacrament but
   those of baptism and extreme unction was administered.

  The Flagellants

   To these social and spiritual calamities were added, as is often the
   case in times of political convulsion, natural ones. Germany was
   visited with earthquakes, plagues of grasshoppers or locusts, and bad
   harvests, in the train of which came that fearful pestilence known as
   the Black Death, which swept over Europe in the middle of this century,
   and the full extent of which we are only now beginning to appreciate.
   It passed over Germany in 1348, bringing the usual accompaniments of
   such terrible visitations, in lawlessness, outbursts of despair, and
   some scattered examples of heroic devotion. It was no wonder that men's
   minds grew unsettled. Some believed that the last times had come, and
   that the end of the world was at hand. Some looked for a Messiah in the
   person of the "Priest-hater," Frederick II., who was to rise from the
   dead, do justice, humble the clergy, and lay down his crown on the
   Mount of Olives. Some thought only of averting the wrath of God in the
   present, and so that strange epidemic of religious frenzy sprang up,
   which brought into all the highroads and market-places of Europe the
   ghastly processions of the Flagellants and the White Hoods. Hundreds of
   either sex wandered in bands from town to town, half-naked, or clothed
   in white shirts spotted with blood. On reaching a town they proceeded
   to the church, and after a service, if they could have one, formed into
   a circle, in which they paced round in pairs singing their wild chant:


   "Now raise your hands to God, and cry

   That this great death may pass us by:

   Now raise your arms to God, and call

   That He have mercy on us all."

   They then adjured the crowd of spectators to imitate their penance, and
   finally, casting themselves on the ground, scourged each other till
   they were weary. On their way from town to town they sang hymns and
   sequences in German, exhorting the people to repentance; and it is
   certainly a fact that the use of hymns in the vernacular becomes much
   more common from this time onwards, no doubt partly from their being
   thus introduced into many parts hitherto unacquainted with them. The
   mode of life of these Flagellants, however, led in some cases to acts
   of license, which by degrees turned the popular feeling strongly
   against them, and so they vanish from our sight.

  The Mystics

   In such times as these it must have been difficult for men not to be
   either fanatics, like these poor Flagellants, or altogether indifferent
   to the religion which presented itself in such a shape as it wore then,
   when rival Popes disputed the Headship of Christendom, and the Papacy
   appeared as the enemy of civil authority and political liberty; while
   the bishops and most of the richer monastic clergy lived lives of
   self-indulgence and worldly ambition. But, like the remnant in old days
   that had not bowed the knee to Baal, so now there grew up in various
   parts of the country a set of men who formed themselves into no sect,
   but who kept alive the flame of love and faith and hope in many hearts
   where it had else died out. The names best known to us (though many
   others are still preserved) are those of Eckhardt and [25]Tauler,
   especially the latter, and in the next century the same tone of thought
   and piety meets us again in the works attributed to the more famous
   Thomas à Kempis.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Tauler

   Tauler was a Dominican monk of Strasburg, a man of the deepest piety,
   and of great courage and ability, whose sermons were the delight of
   Luther, and are full of instruction to us now. The Dominicans and
   Franciscans had for some time availed themselves of the privilege early
   granted to their order of celebrating mass during a time of interdict,
   and had thus earned themselves a high place in the popular favour; but
   after the open breach between the Emperor and the Pope in 1338, they
   too, in many instances, refused to say mass. Tauler was one of the few
   who steadily adhered to the national side; and, believing that the Pope
   himself had no right to deny the guidance and consolations of religion
   to the people, considered it his duty to disregard the interdict.
   Throughout this period, therefore, and especially when the Black Death
   was raging, he laboured assiduously, not only in Strasburg, but in all
   the great cities along the Rhine to Cologne; and being a mighty
   preacher, he was followed by grateful crowds, his sermons were taken
   down by listening friends, and with his letters widely circulated over
   Germany.

   Tauler and those who thought like him were called Mystics, because they
   spoke often of a mystical or hidden life of God in the soul, and the
   worthlessness of the creature and outward things. But though there is
   much in their phraseology and turn of thought which belongs to their
   age, and seems at first alien to us now, the real core of their faith,
   which made them of such help and use in their day and the beginners of
   a work that has lasted to our own, was their strong grasp of the
   truths, that an immediate and personal relation may and ought to exist
   between each individual soul and the living God; and that since God is
   absolute goodness, the highest welfare and happiness of His creatures
   must lie in the voluntary blending of their will with His. Outward
   helps had indeed failed these men utterly, and so they fell back on
   that which no outward privation could take away, the presence of God
   himself in the heart as the ground of all belief, and held this faith
   with an intense realization proportioned to the difficulties and
   discouragements around them. What seems to us morbid and exaggerated in
   their depreciation of all outward things, and sometimes even of the
   affections of ordinary life, was but the result, partly of their being
   thus thrown in so absolutely on their own consciousness, partly of
   their circumstances; and when all this is eliminated, there remain in
   their writing some of the truest piety, and of the deepest and wisest
   thoughts on the relation of God and Christ to the human soul, on the
   nature of sin and of salvation, that we can meet with anywhere. [8]

   This school encouraged the study of the Scriptures, and the first
   complete German version of the Bible was made by Matthias of Beheim, as
   early as the fourteenth century. They also promoted both preaching and
   singing in German, and a large number of mystical and didactic poems
   were written by them. Tauler himself wrote several, which were widely
   known, and we give two of them:--
     __________________________________________________________________

WHAT I MUST DO.

   Ich müz die creaturen fliehen


   From outward creatures I must flee,

   And seek heart-oneness deep within,

   If I would draw my soul to Thee,

   O God, and keep it pure from sin.


   The senses I must all control,

   If I the Highest Good would know:

   For virtue strive with all my soul,

   If I would feel Love's living glow.


   And I my hasty tongue must bind,

   Must straighten what it's said amiss,

   If I true peace with God would find,

   Or ever hope to reach true bliss.
     __________________________________________________________________

ONLY JESUS.

   O Jesu Christ, ein lieblichz gut


   O Jesu Christ, most Good, most Fair,

   More fragrant than May's flowery air,

   Who Thee within his soul doth bear

   True cause for joy hath won!

   But would one have Thee in his heart

   From all self-will he must depart,

   God's bidding only, where Thou art,

   Must evermore be done.

   Where Jesus thus doth truly dwell,

   His presence doth all tumults quell,

   And transient cares of earth dispel

   Like mists before the sun.


   He who despiseth vanity,

   And dwells in free simplicity,

   So Jesus in his heart may be,

   No vexing cares need know.

   His comforter the Saviour is,

   Sole Comfort of the comfortless;

   A cross unstained and bright is his

   Whose patience conquers woe.

   Have inward oneness, Faith's clear sight

   Bid all distracting forms take flight,

   Gaze on Christ's image day and night,

   Then He is thine below.


   Give place to nought that can misguide,

   Be thine own self whate'er betide,

   What is not thine cast thou aside,

   So shalt thou freely stand.

   From hasty judgment, oh refrain,

   We weigh in balance false and vain;

   Christ and His love seek thou amain

   In all that thou hast planned:

   He who doth undertake too much,

   The goal of Truth will rarely touch;

   A ship o'erdone with sail is such,

   That scarce shall reach the land.


   But he who this world's solace leaves,

   Whose heart to God in secret cleaves,

   And all things as from Him receives,

   Shall find his griefs are o'er;

   He who hath conquered in the fight,

   Serves Christ alone with all his might,

   And follows where Christ leads aright,

   Hath a bright crown in store.

   God help us then to reach that bliss

   Christ hath prepared above for His!

   Thee, Triune God, we praise and bless,

   Oh help us evermore!

   probably written by his friend and teacher, Nicholas of Basle.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Master-Singers

   During the remainder of this century and the next, the political and
   social conditions of Germany became more tranquil as the constitution
   of the empire became more fixed. In the cities especially life grew
   settled and sheltered; it crystallized indeed into very rigid forms, in
   their internal polities and in the guilds which governed that large
   part of life occupied by industrial interests; even the domain of
   private life was invaded by the sumptuary laws which regulated the
   dress and the table of each class, but were probably never very
   strictly obeyed. But the sense of being a member of an important and
   politically free community made up for the loss of much of that
   personal liberty of action which the Teutonic race had so highly
   valued; and the activity of mind produced by constant association with
   their fellow-men, rendered the citizens now the great patrons of art
   and letters. Town schools became usual, and before the end of the
   fifteenth century as many as eight great universities had been founded.
   And so, too, poetry now passed into their hands from those of the
   knightly order. It did not at first profit by the change. It was
   enrolled among the crafts of which the guilds had the control, schools
   for verse and song-making were set up, and the Minnesingers were
   succeeded by the Master-singers. For the most part it was but poor
   mechanical work that they turned out, generally moral and didactic,
   often directly religious in tone, but very prosaic in quality. Yet
   there must have been a great deal of reading and reciting of this
   poetry such as it was, for the Master-singers are counted by hundreds,
   and their verses by thousands. By far the best of them are the first
   and last (of any note) in their ranks,--Heinrich Frauenlob and [26]Hans
   Sachs. The latter belongs to the period of the Reformation, and marks
   the transition to modern thought; the former (1250-1318) belongs to the
   close of the crusading age, and marks the transition of poetry from the
   knightly to the burgher order. In spirit and form he belongs to the
   Minne-singers, and is frequently counted among them; he is reckoned
   among the Master-singers because he was the first to found a sort of
   guild of poets. He was a very voluminous writer, greatly admired in his
   own day, and from his constant praise of women won for himself the
   title of Frauenlob (Praise-the-ladies), and the honour of being borne
   to his grave by them. A very large proportion of his poems are
   love-songs, but there are many more serious; many prayers and pious
   reflections, many lamentations over the degeneracy of the times, and
   praises of Brother Berthold, a famous Franciscan preacher, who
   travelled about the country, heard gladly by the common people, and was
   a sort of forerunner of [27]Tauler. From his religious poems we choose
   two, one evidently written when he was fighting with the fear of death;
   the other expressing the confidence that helped him through it. In
   style Frauenlob is graceful and fluent, but often too prolix and
   elaborate. The mode in which the following is rhymed is an instance of
   his love of an intricate arrangement of rhymes.
     __________________________________________________________________

DEATH WILL CONQUER.

   Min vreude ist gar zergangen


   My joy is wholly banished,

   Now listen to my sad complaint:

   The sins of days departed

   Weigh on me sore and I wax faint,

   For they are many well I know,

   And now dark Death will bring me all to nought.

   My life will soon have vanished,

   For bitter Death my end hath sworn,

   My gifts, my prayers sad-hearted,

   On him they are but all forlorn,

   When once he bids me with him go:

   Ah woful prospect with sore sorrow fraught!

   Now nought avails a generous mind,

   Nor skill, nor art, nor aught of pride,

   Nor that all dames to me were kind:

   All gifts and powers of heart and sense

   That once were mine are lost to me;

   I must seek other company,

   Death is my fellow, and he drives me hence.


   Grim Death the end is bringing

   Of joy to this poor heart in me;

   Ah sorely doth he grieve it!

   O Lord my God, I cry to Thee,

   Receive my soul for pity's sake;

   My body to the earth and worms I give.

   My lovely art, my singing,

   Grows dim within my bosom's shrine;

   To whom shall I now leave it?

   Ah God, it will no more be mine!

   'Twas Thou didst give it, who dost take.

   Grant me Thy mercy now while yet I live!

   Yes, I have done with sweetest song,

   This is the last, my sad complaint,

   Death comes and brings a silence long:

   Then list to me, my fellows all,

   Women and men alike, I mean,

   None can say aught 'gainst this, I ween,

   See that from righteousness ye never fall.


   O Mary, Mother purest,

   Now through the death of thy dear Son

   Remember all thy kindness,

   And all that He for us hath won

   Upon the cross, where once was seen

   A sharp spear bent against His holy side.

   Lord Christ! Thou this endurest

   And yet Thou canst the Jew forgive,

   For it was done in blindness!

   Pray Thou for me too then, while yet I live,

   Thou wilt be not less good to me, I ween;

   Show Thy dear grace to me at this sad tide.

   Farewell to all that glads mine eyes!

   Now, Death, dost thou thy work begin;

   Lend me, ye friends, your tears and sighs,

   And be not Frauenlob forgot,

   Whom Death alas! hath conquered here!

   Ah God, my latest hour is near,--

   Courage, my heart, and go:-- 'tis but the common lot!
     __________________________________________________________________

NO MORE DESPAIR.

   Nu wil ich nimmer mer verzwifeln


   Now will I nevermore despair of heaven,

   Since it is Thine, my Father, who hast given

   Thy glorious kingdom to the poor indeed.

   Yea, mighty God, since Father is Thy name,

   Christ for my brother I maydare to claim,

   And He for all my sins will help me plead.

   A brother's truth to us He swore

   When on Himself He took humanity,

   For us alone that form He wore,

   For us alone hung high upon the Tree.

   Look in what cruel sorrows there He pined!

   Dear Lord, I bid thee call those woes to mind,

   And, brother-like, entreat Thy Father, who is mine,

   To give me, too, my lot in that blest heritage of Thine.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Drama

   It was at this time that dramatic poetry made its appearance in
   Germany; and just as lyrical and narrative poetry had first been
   awakened to life by the religious sentiment which thus made for itself
   a voice, so our earliest examples of this style also are religious--the
   mystery and morality plays. It is curious that the first beginning of
   the drama should be in a convent, and the work of a nun, a certain
   Hrosvitha, who lived in the Abbey of Gandersheim, about 980. Her works,
   however, hardly concern our subject, as they were written in Latin,
   though one of them was afterwards translated into German for
   performance; and we do not encounter any further dramatic attempts till
   we reach the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when we meet with
   mysteries on the life of our Lord. No doubt these took their rise in
   the wish to set vividly before the people the chief incidents of
   Scripture history, and the mode of doing so is by some thought to have
   been derived from the symbolical games which ushered in the spring, or
   from the processions of returning crusaders, who often re-entered their
   homes in quaint and symbolical array. The Passion and Resurrection and
   the Lamentation of the Virgin form the subjects of the earliest
   mysteries, and to these ere long were added similar representations of
   scenes from the infancy of the Saviour, which were performed about
   Twelfth Night. At first they were written partly in Latin and partly in
   German, and a considerable portion consisted of action unaccompanied by
   words, while other parts were sung, not recited, but gradually the
   German element preponderates and the Latin disappears. Scenes from the
   Old Testament or the Apocrypha, which were held to typify events in our
   Lord's life, were introduced between the acts of the principal drama,
   and from the necessity of compression were generally given in a more
   vigorous and dramatic form than the original piece itself, which is
   often extremely prolix. The stories of Joseph and Samson, of David and
   Goliath, of Esther, of Susannah and the Elders, were the favourite
   subjects of these entr'actes. Next the comic element found its way into
   these pieces, especially into those which were performed about Twelfth
   Night, a time of merry-making and often of licence. The first example
   of it, however, that is now extant, is in an Easter mystery of the
   fifteenth century, where the merchant who sells precious ointment,
   first to Mary Magdalene, and afterwards to the three Maries on their
   way to the grave, quarrels with his servant and his wife, and ends with
   striking the latter, who repays him by a sound rating. This element of
   grotesque fun afterwards became much more developed, but it never in
   Germany attained anything like the proportions that it assumed in
   France and Italy. On the whole the representation of these dramas was a
   serious, and in its way a religious, act. A city or a village, or
   perhaps some great guild, or the students of a university, undertook to
   give one of these mysteries. The performance, in the summer, frequently
   took place out of doors, in the winter, in the church or the
   guild-hall; it often lasted for more than one day, and people came to
   see it from far and near. The performers who personated such characters
   as those of our Lord, His mother, or His disciples, were expected to
   prepare themselves by religious acts for their work, and to abstain
   from all licence while it was in progress. Of course a more secular
   tendency gradually showed itself; still on the whole the drama was a
   plant of very late growth in Germany, and it was long before it
   attained as much importance in its purely secular shape as it possessed
   in the Middle Ages in its religious form. The mystery has never quite
   died out there; many of us are probably aware that once in ten years a
   genuine ancient mystery is still performed in a little village of the
   Bavarian Tyrol.

  The Popular Song

   Another style of poetry sprang up in these centuries which had the most
   genuine life in it of any type that we have yet met with, and that has
   continued characteristic of the German people to this day. It is that
   of the "Volkslied," or popular song, and in these far-back days it
   holds somewhat the same place in German literature that the ballad does
   in our own. The narrative form of the ballad seems to have been less
   congenial to the German mind than to the English. We find, indeed, some
   poems on contemporary events--like that on the Battle of Sempach, by
   Halbsuten--but they are wanting in the life, terseness, and swing of
   the ballad. The German popular song, on the other hand, even in its
   rudest days, is full of freshness and vigour, often of sweetness and
   pathos, though lax and unpolished in form and marked by abrupt
   transitions and quaint similes. But it has the true breath of the
   people's life in it, which it deals with in its most varied forms--in
   songs of love, of dancing, of drinking, of wandering and parting, of
   spinning and weaving, and of the huntsman's and forester's crafts,
   which are some of the best of all. It furnished the type that, in
   Luther's hands, was refined and strengthened into the congregational
   hymn which became so powerful an instrument in the spread of the
   reformed religion; and at this period the best of its sacred poems are
   those which more or less partake of this character.

   It was natural that poetry of this simple and direct style should
   concern itself more with the great facts of the Christian faith than
   with the minor phases of spiritual experience; and, accordingly, we
   find most of the poems of this kind are composed for one or other of
   the chief festivals of the Church. That of Christmas was an especial
   favourite with the warm-hearted, child-loving Germans, and for it
   Tauler wrote the following symbolical little poem, which soon became
   one of these popular songs:--
     __________________________________________________________________

CHRISTMAS CAROL

   Es komt ein schif geladen


   A ship comes sailing onwards

   With a precious freight on board;

   It bears the only Son of God,

   It bears the Eternal Word.


   A precious freight it brings us,

   Glides gently on, yet fast;

   Its sails are filled with Holy Love,

   The Spirit is its mast.


   And now it casteth anchor,

   The ship hath touched the land;

   God's Word hath taken flesh, the Son

   Among us men doth stand.


   At Bethlehem, in the manger,

   He lies, a babe of days;

   For us He gives Himself to death,

   O give Him thanks and praise.


   Whoe'er would hope in gladness

   To kiss this Holy Child,

   Must suffer many a pain and woe

   Patient like Him and mild;


   Must die with Him to evil

   And rise to righteousness,

   That so with Christ he too may share

   Eternal life and bliss.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Another Christmas carol of this date is the following on

THE ROSE OF SHARON.

   7,6,7,6,8,7,6

   Es ist ein Ros entsprungen

   [28]Anon.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   A spotless Rose is blowing,

   Sprung from a tender root,

   Of ancient seers' foreshowing,

   Of Jesse promised fruit;

   Its fairest bud unfolds to light

   Amid the cold, cold winter,

   And in the dark midnight.


   The Rose which I am singing,

   Whereof Isaiah said,

   Is from its sweet root springing

   In Mary, purest Maid;

   For through our God's great love and might

   The Blessed Babe she bare us

   In a cold, cold winter's night.
     __________________________________________________________________

   A favourite song, or we might almost call it a ballad for Easter, was
   this one:--

THE THREE MARIES.

   Es giengen drî frewlîn also frü


   There went three damsels ere break of day,

   To the Holy Grave they took their way;

   They fain would anoint the Lord once more

   As Mary Magdalene did before.

   Alleluia.


   The damsels each to other made moan,

   "Who will roll us away the stone,

   That we may enter in amain

   To anoint the Lord as we are fain?


   Full precious spices and salve they brought,

   But when they came to the spot they sought,

   Behold the grave doth open stand,

   An angel sitteth on either hand.


   "Ye maidens, be not filled with fear,

   He whom ye seek, He is not here;

   Behold the raiment white and fair

   Which the Lord was wrapped in, lieth there.


   "Ye maidens, do not here delay,

   Ye must to Galilee away;

   To Galilee ye now must go,

   For there the Lord Himself will show."


   But Mary Magdalene could not depart,

   Seeking the Lord, she wept apart;

   What saw she in a little while?

   She saw our Lord upon her smile.


   In garb and wise He met her there

   As were He a gardener, and did bear

   A spade within His holy hand,

   As would He dig the garden land.


   "O tell me, gentle Gardener thou,

   Where hast thou laid my Master now?

   Where thou hast hidden Him bid me know,

   Or my heart must break beneath its woe."


   Scarce could He speak a single word,

   Ere she beheld it was the Lord;

   She kneeleth down on the cold bare stone,

   She hath found her Lord and she alone.


   "Touch me not, Mary Magdalene,

   But tell the brethren what thou hast seen;

   Touch me not now with human hand,

   Until I ascend to my Father's land."

   Alleluia.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Easter Sequence

   The Easter and Whitsuntide sequences which were introduced in the
   previous period were now expanded into longer hymns, of which many
   variations are still preserved. One of the best is this:--

AN OLD EASTER HYMN.

   8,6,8,6,8,8,8+4

   Nu frew dich liebe Christenheit

   [29]Anon.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Rejoice, dear Christendom, to-day,

   For Christ hath overcome,

   His bitter pains have passed away,

   And empty stands His tomb;

   Those bitter pains had been our lot,

   If Christ for us had borne them not,

   Great bliss hath risen on us to-day:

   Alleluia.


   O Easter Day, our voices ne'er

   Can praise thee fittingly,

   Since God, whose power all things declare,

   Such glory puts on thee;

   But let us keep thee as we can,

   Angels to-day rejoice with man,

   When rose that Sun so wondrous fair:

   Alleluia.


   O Jesus Christ, our blessed Lord,

   We share Thy joy to-day!

   All those who hear and keep Thy Word

   Are glad with Thee to-day!

   All Christian people now rejoice

   With freshened hearts and gladsome voice,

   Glory to Thee our Blessed Lord:

   Alleluia.


   Praise to the Father and the Son,

   And to the Holy Ghost;

   For all the sins that we have done,

   To-day forgive us most;

   And give us peace and unity,

   From now to all eternity,

   So sing we as the ages run:

   Alleluia.
     __________________________________________________________________

   A sequence found about the same date is called in old manuscripts

THE COMMON MAN'S PROCESSIONAL.

   i

   Also heilig ist der Tag

   [30]Anon.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   So holy is this day of days

   No man can fill its meed of praise,

   Since the Holy Son of God

   Now hath conquered Death and Hell,

   And bound the Devil who there doth dwell,

   So hath the Lord delivered Christendom;

   This was Christ Himself:

   Kyrie Eleison!
     __________________________________________________________________

   We have a testimony to the use of Easter hymns in church in the
   following poem by Conrad von Queinfurt, belonging to the fourteenth
   century (he died in 1382 in Silesia), which is quite in the style of
   the Minne-singers both in thought and the carefully varied metre.

EASTER SONG.

   *     *     *     *     *     *

   Du lenze gut, des jares teureste quarte


   Fair Spring, thou dearest season of the year,

   Thou art brimful of sweet delights;

   The creatures robbed of joy by winter drear

   Thou dost repay for cold and gloomy nights.

   I feel thy airs are soft and mild,

   Thy winds are balmy and not wild,

   O how unlike the wintry blast!

   What Frost had bound in fetters fast,

   Now feels the prison-time gone by,

   For 'tis unbound and free;

   Whether it climb or swim or fly,

   Whatever kind it be,

   Whether of water, earth, or sky,

   'Tis happy now we see.

   The sun smiles with his lovely rays,

   And sing, dear little birds, sing out your Maker's praise!


   So many joys hath Spring, but most of all

   She hath one day above the rest,

   That Christendom with one glad voice doth call

   Of all bright days the first and best.

   We hail thee, then, O chosen Day,

   With many a loud and gladsome lay,

   Thou art the day that God hath made

   Well may our joy be now displayed!

   Thou art the Pascha to the Greek,

   And still we hear the Jew

   Of thee as Passover doth speak,

   And Latins know thee too

   As Transitus, that crowns the Holy Week;

   But thou, where'er is heard the German tongue,

   Art holy Easter-tide, when life from Death hath sprung.


   We hail thee, blessed Day, we greet thee well,

   We praise thee ever, we adore

   The Christ who triumphed over death and hell,

   Whose death slew Death for evermore.

   O sweetest day, that saw'st Thee rise,

   Our Paschal Lamb, our Sacrifice,

   Our Brother who hath won for us

   A heritage most glorious!

   Forest and foliage, corn and grass and flowers,

   Would show their love to Thee!

   The birds sing in the greening bowers,

   Christ, they are praising Thee!

   Thou wouldst not lack, had they our powers,

   A song more worthy Thee!

   For Thou art Conqueror, O Christ, to-day,

   Who madest Death's great power itself give way.


   So Christians triumph as your heart desires

   In chorus sweet and clear and strong,

   Ye laymen in the church, ye priests in choirs,

   Answer each other in your song.

   Sing, "Christ the Lord is risen again,

   Christ hath broken every chain."

   The year of jubilee He bringeth in,

   True freedom for all faithful hearts to win;

   So to His table go thou solemnly,

   Where in His flesh and blood

   The Paschal Lamb itself is offered thee--

   The Lamb slain on the rood.

   Praise the true Christ with happy hearts and free,

   Praise Him, for He is good!

   Thus, Spring, thou well may'st speak of joy to man,

   Thou hast the Easter Day that ended Death's dark ban.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Many also of the popular songs were translated, if one may so call it,
   into a religious form, often in the most tasteless and absurd manner,
   but occasionally with so much success, that the religious entirely
   superseded the secular version. This was the case with the following
   little hymn, the idea of which was taken from the song of a wandering
   artisan, that begins, "Innsbruck, I must forsake thee." In its sacred
   form, however, it speedily became very popular, and many other hymns
   were afterwards written on its simple and pathetic melody.

FAREWELL.

   O Welt, ich muz dich lassen

   [31]Anon.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O World, I must forsake thee,

   And far away betake me,

   To seek my native shore;

   So long I've dwelt in sadness

   I wish not now for gladness,

   Earth's joys for me are o'er.


   Sore is my grief and lonely,

   And I can tell it only

   To Thee, my Friend most sure!

   God, let Thy hand uphold me,

   Thy pitying heart enfold me,

   For else I am most poor.


   My Refuge where I hide me,

   From Thee shall nought divide me,

   No pain, no poverty:

   Nought is too bad to bear it,

   If Thou art there to share it

   My heart asks only Thee.

  Henry of Loufenburg

   Henry of Loufenburg, who was a priest at Freiburg, and afterwards a
   monk in the convent of St. John in Strasburg, was the chief sacred poet
   of the fifteenth century in Germany, and furnished a large number of
   these transformations of secular into religious songs, and he also
   translated many of the great Latin hymns. He was himself a fertile
   composer, and some of his hymns are very graceful and sweet, but many
   are prolix and fantastic; and though they seem to have been liked in
   the religious world of his own day, they scarcely bear transplanting to
   ours. One of the best is

HOME-SICKNESS.

   8,8

   Ich wolt daz ich daheime wer

   [32]Henry of Loufenburg. Fifteenth Century.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   I would I were at last at home,

   And all earth's trials overcome:


   At home in that calm, happy place

   Where I shall see God face to face!


   Then thither, Heart, for refuge flee,

   Where angel-hosts are waiting thee.


   If earth for thee be only gloom,

   Thou wilt but get the sooner home.


   At home is Life that never dies,

   And perfect joy unmixed with sighs;


   And perfect health, untouched by pain,

   That perfect ever shall remain.


   A thousand years are as a day,

   For weariness hath there no sway.


   Rise thither, heart and soul of mine,

   And seek that blessedness divine.


   The treasure that is stored not there

   Will only bring thee woe and care.


   Thou hast no resting-place below,

   To-day, to-morrow, thou may'st go.


   Then since it may not other be,

   From earth's deluding phantoms flee:


   Repent thy sins, prepare for home,

   To-morrow may the Voice say, Come.


   Farewell, O World, now home I fare;

   God guide all true hearts safely there!

   Another tenderly-conceived little poem of his is this:--

CRADLE SONG.

   Ach, lieber herre Jesu Christ


   Ah Jesu Christ, my Lord most dear,

   As Thou wast once an infant here,

   So give this little child, I pray,

   Thy grace and blessing day by day:

   Ah Jesu, Lord Divine,

   Guard me this babe of mine!


   Since in Thy heavenly kingdom, Lord,

   All things obey Thy lightest word,

   Do Thou Thy mighty succour give,

   And shield my child by morn and eve:

   Ah Jesu, Lord Divine,

   Guard Thou this babe of mine!


   Thy watch let angels round it keep

   Where'er it be, awake, asleep;

   Thy holy Cross now let it bear

   That it Thy Crown with saints may wear:

   Ah Jesu, Lord Divine,

   Guard Thou this babe of mine!


   Now sleep, O sleep, my little child,

   Jesus will be thy playmate mild;

   Sweet dreams He sendeth thee, I trow,

   That full of goodness thou may'st grow:

   Ah Jesu, Lord Divine,

   Guard me this babe of mine!


   So He who hath all love and might,

   Bids thee good-morrow and good-night.

   Blest in His name thou daily art,

   My child, thou darling of my heart:

   Ah Jesu, Lord Divine,

   Guard me this babe of mine!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Henry of Loufenburg also wrote and widely introduced the use of many
   hymns in mixed Latin and German. Verses of this kind had long been a
   favourite amusement among the monks, and they seem now to have acquired
   a general popularity. The best-known of them all was a Christmas carol
   dating from the fourteenth century, which is found in many various
   versions, and of which the following is an imitation:--

  CAROL.

   i

   In dulci jubilo                In sweet Joy
   Sing and shout all below!
   He for whom we're pining
   Lies in praesepio;             In a manger;
   Like the sun is shining
   Matris in gremio.              In His mothers lap.
   Qui est A et O.                Who is Alpha and Omega.
   Qui est A et O.

   O Jesu parvule,                O infant Jesus,
   How my heart longs for thee!
   Soothe the sad and ailing,
   O Puer optime,                 Child most excellent,
   With Thy love unfailing!
   O Princeps gloriae,            O Prince of glory,
   Trahe me post Te,              Draw me after Thee!
   Trahe me post Te!

   Mater et filia,                Mother and daughter,
   O Mary, virgin aye,
   Hadst thou not gained for us
   Caelorum gaudia,               The joys of heaven,
   Death still had reigned o'er us
   Per nostra crimina.            For our sins.
   Quanta gratia!                 How great the grace!
   Quanta gratia!

   Ubi sunt gaudia?               Where are those joys?
   Only there where alway
   Stand the angels singing
   Nova cantica,                  New songs,
   Their sweet voices ringing
   In regis curia.                In the King's court.
   Would we were there to-day!
   Would we were there to-day!

   In dulci Jubilo, singet und seid froh

  Earliest Hymn-Books

   This latter class of mixed hymns has been commonly, but erroneously,
   attributed to Peter Dresdensis, who died in 1440, as rector of Zwickau.
   His real work with regard to hymnology lay in the strenuous efforts he
   made to introduce hymns in the vernacular more freely into public
   worship, especially into the service of the mass. No doubt he had been
   led to this by his acquaintance with Huss, whose assistant he had been
   at Prague. It was in 1467 that the followers of Huss formed themselves
   into a separate and organized Church, known as that of the Bohemian and
   Moravian Brethren, one of the distinctive peculiarities of which was
   the free use of hymns and prayers in their mother tongue. Many such
   hymns were already in existence, and others were soon written, and in
   1504 they were collected and published by their archbishop, Lucas--the
   first example of a hymn-book composed of original compositions in the
   vernacular to be found in any Western nation which had once owned the
   supremacy of Rome. Somewhat earlier than this book, however, towards
   the end of the fifteenth century, we find two or three collections of
   German versions of the Latin hymns and sequences. For the most part
   they are of such inferior merit that they quite lose the grandeur of
   the original, and so we need not linger over them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Hymns to the Virgin

   But there is one large class of sacred poems very characteristic of the
   mediaeval period, which has not yet been mentioned--the poems addressed
   to saints, and, above all, to the Virgin Mary. The former class is not
   very important, either as to number or quality; but not so the latter.
   "Marien-lieder," and, in a minor degree, "Annen-lieder," hymns to St.
   Mary and to St. Anne, constitute a very large and well-known class
   among the poems of the ante-Reformation times in Germany. It is in the
   age of the Crusades and the Minne-singers that they first assume a
   prominent place in its literature. The intercourse of Christians with
   Saracens tended to intensify the devotion paid to the Virgin, just
   because such a sentiment towards a woman was a most distinctive
   peculiarity of the Christian mind. Again, the chivalry which owed so
   much to the Christian idea of womanhood, had in its turn a reflex
   action on religious thought, favourable to the worship of a feminine
   ideal. The hymns addressed to the Virgin at this time form a sort of
   spiritual counterpart to the minne-songs or love-songs addressed to his
   earthly lady by the knight. It was easy to transfer the turn of
   expression and tone of thought from the earthly object to the heavenly
   one, and the degree to which this is done is to us often very
   startling. After this period, for a while these poems become less
   frequent, but in the fifteenth century they revive in the most
   extravagant forms. The honours and titles belonging to our Lord Jesus
   Christ are attributed to His mother; God is said to have created the
   world by her and to have rested in her on the seventh day; she is said
   to have risen from the grave on the third day and ascended into heaven;
   she is addressed, not only as a persuasive mediator with her Son, but
   as herself the chief source of mercy and help, especially in the hour
   of death and at the day of judgment. By degrees, her mother is invested
   with some of her own attributes; for it is said, if Christ would obey
   His own mother, ought not she much more to obey hers? And so a set of
   hymns to St. Anne sprung up, in which she is entreated to afford aid in
   death, and obtain pardon for the sinners from Christ and Mary, who will
   refuse her nothing. Some of the earlier hymns to the Virgin, especially
   those on her lamentation beneath the cross, are very sweet and
   touching; but the greater number of such as we have now been speaking
   of have not much poetical merit. They are often mere lists of titles,
   or word-play on her name or on the relation of the words "Ave" and
   "Eva." As Wackernagel says, "The existence of so many godless hymns
   addressed to the Virgin and the saints, or teaching the whole doctrine
   of indulgences, is a perfectly irrefragable testimony to that
   degeneracy of the nation which rendered the Reformation necessary; the
   existence of so many breathing an unstained Christianity is a witness
   to the preservation of so much true religion as made the Reformation
   possible."

CHAPTER V.
LUTHER AND HIS FRIENDS.
A.D. 1500-1580.

   The opening of the sixteenth century marks the commencement of one of
   the great transitional eras of history, and its changes were not in one
   direction only. Men's horizon on the physical earth had been suddenly
   widened by the discovery of a new world; their mental horizon by the
   re-discovery of an old one, in the revival of letters consequent on the
   fall of Constantinople and the invention of printing. An intellectual
   eagerness and a trust in the unbounded possibilities of the future had
   taken possession of their minds and they were not likely to be
   satisfied with such a present as they saw around them.

  Ulrich von Hutten

   Portrait of Ulrich von Hutten

   Ulrich von Hutten -- P. 98

   It was for the schools and universities that reformers first sprung up
   in Erasmus and Reuchlin; then, almost at the same time, an Ulrich von
   Hutten began to call on his countrymen to feel and to assert their
   national unity and their ancient rights against Italian priests and
   Spanish mercenaries, and to reform their own lives. His vigorous
   appeals, expressed, not in Latin, but in clear and trenchant German,
   made themselves heard by all classes, and helped to pave the way for
   the reformation that was coming. The following poem, written when he
   had been forced to seek an asylum in the castle of his friend Franz von
   Sickingen, was ere long circulated all over the country on broadsheets,
   and became a favourite song of the earliest adherents of the
   Reformation.
     __________________________________________________________________

ULRICH VON HUTTEN'S SONG.

   Ich hab's gewagt mit Sinnen


   I've ventured it [9] of purpose free,

   Nor yet my deed I rue;

   I may not win, but men will see

   My heart and life were true.

   'Tis not my own I seek alone,

   This they must know at least;

   'Tis good of all, though me they call

   A foe to Church and priest.


   But I will let them spread their lies

   And chatter as they will;

   If I would but the truth disguise,

   And tongue and pen keep still,

   Flatterers enow were mine, I trow,

   Now I'm a banished man;

   Yet think not I afar to fly,

   Time yet may change the ban.


   But nought of pardon will I pray,

   For nought of guilt I own;

   I would have bowed to Justice' sway,

   Here Passion reigns alone,

   Nor grants my cause by ancient laws

   A hearing fair and free;--

   But God ordains and need constrains

   That thus they deal with me.


   Yet oft ere now it hath been seen

   When rich men felt secure,

   They yet have lost the game, I ween,

   They deemed their own full sure.

   A mighty flame from sparks oft came;

   Who knows, my turn may come?

   I've played my stake, the risk I'll take,

   And here abide my doom.


   And 'midst it all my solace is

   A conscience void of spot;

   My direst foes must grant me this,

   My honour hath no blot.

   For there is nought I've said or sought,

   But it doth well appear,

   That all was done before the sun

   In honour bright and clear.


   Now if my nation's gallant youth

   Will not my warning take,

   And bravely stand for Right and Truth,

   It grieves me for her sake,

   I must depart, with heavy heart;

   Yet deem not all is o'er,

   Come foul or fair I'll not despair,

   But mix the cards once more.


   No courtiers' crafts shall me affright,

   Though deep the game they've played;

   An honest heart that loves the Right

   Can never be dismayed.

   Full many a name will join the game,

   Nor life nor wealth will cherish;

   Up! burghers grave, and horsemen brave,

   And let not Hutten perish!

  The Reformation

   But a far deeper ground of dissatisfaction lay behind than any
   discontent with the education or politics of the time; religion, which
   touches the life of all classes in its inmost springs, had fallen into
   a deep degeneracy. If the common man had a hard life of it in this
   world, compelled to incessant toil, subject to pestilence, bad
   harvests, and the exactions of his superiors, what was there to raise
   him above his troubles or give him hope for the future? That conception
   of an inward self-surrender to God which He would inspire, and to which
   He Himself would respond by His helping presence now, and heaven
   hereafter--the conception which had been the very kernel of religion to
   [33]Tauler and his school--was preserved but in few hearts. To most
   men, religion was an outside thing of rules and ceremonies; God was a
   harsh judge, whom all the sacrifices and merits of the saints could
   scarce propitiate while their appointed instructors, the clergy, were
   in popular estimation the very types of a proud, idle, often sinful
   life, led at the expense of other people. Once the clergy had been the
   preservers of learning, the protectors of the common people, and the
   assertors of justice against oppressive custom; now their luxury, their
   ignorance in many cases, their avarice, and their often impure lives,
   were the favourite themes of the satirical poems, which are the most
   important productions of the secular literature of this period. [10]
   The way in which such men adapted the consolations of religion to the
   wants of the common people, shows a state of mind which it is very
   difficult for us to realize at all. Pious brotherhoods were formed for
   accumulating a stock of spiritual treasures, the benefits of which were
   to secure to each member eternal salvation. Thus, for instance, [11]
   that of the Eleven Thousand Virgins, called St. Ursula's Ship, to which
   the Elector Frederick the Wise belonged, had a stock of 6,455 masses,
   3,550 whole psalters, 200,000 rosaries, 11,000 prayers to St. Ursula,
   630 times 11,000 Paternosters and Ave Marias, &c. &c. &c. All these
   were available to wipe out the sins of the individual members of the
   brotherhood. But in one respect this association was one of the best: a
   man could become a member by the mere repeating of a certain number of
   prayers, and it was therefore open to the poor; where payment of money
   was required, as was frequently the case, of course the poor man was
   excluded.

   It is easy to understand how in a country where such societies already
   existed, Tetzel, the German Dominican, to whom Leo X. had confided the
   sale of indulgences in Germany, should have found there a good market
   for his wares. He rode from town to town, everywhere received with
   great pomp and ceremony by the clergy. His great red cross was set up
   in the nave of the parish church, and day by day he preached and
   exhorted the people not to lose such an opportunity of securing heaven,
   resorting often to the coarsest and most profane expressions and
   devices. On his way he came to a village near Wittenberg, where the
   sale of indulgences was to begin on All Saints Day, the festival of the
   dedication of the church; but the night before, another monk of the
   Augustine order had affixed to the church-doors his famous "Ninety-five
   theses on the power of indulgences," and henceforward their sale was to
   be checked.

  Martin Luther

   [34]Luther, born in 1483 in the village of Eisleben, sprang from the
   people, for he was the son of a pious and honest, but stern peasant. He
   had known want and hardships in childhood, and terrible mental
   conflicts in later years. One of these drove him into a monastery, and
   there they did not cease. "Of a truth I was a pious monk, and kept the
   rule of my order more strictly than I can tell. If ever a monk got to
   heaven by monkery, I was determined to get there. I strained myself to
   the very utmost, and tormented and plagued my body with fastings,
   vigils, prayers, and other exercises, far more than my bitterest
   enemies can torment me now. I, and others too, have toiled to the
   utmost, with a deadly sincerity, to bring our hearts and consciences to
   rest and peace before God, and yet could never find that same peace
   amid such horrible darkness." "For I knew Christ no more, save as a
   severe judge, from whom I sought to escape, and yet could not." In this
   distress of mind he was comforted by an aged monk, who taught him that
   Christ was the atonement for all our sins, and that this was proclaimed
   by the Church in the Apostles' Creed, and directed him to the study of
   the Epistle to the Romans.

   From this time he was a zealous preacher and professor of theology, and
   he had always been an earnest Romanist. Even his visit to Rome in 1510,
   though he had been greatly shocked at the infidelity and immorality he
   met there, had not led him to think for a moment of such a thing as
   setting himself in opposition to the Papal authority. Nothing short of
   seeing that the authorities of the Roman Church in that day
   countenanced a practice so clearly contrary to the Gospel, and ruinous
   to men's souls, as this sale of indulgences, could have moved him to
   take a step of such tremendous import. Many years afterwards he said,
   "I entered on this affair with great fear and trembling. I was alone,
   and had entangled myself in the contest without forethought, and on
   many and weighty points I gave way to the Pope; not only because I
   could not draw back, but because I sincerely and earnestly worshipped
   him from the bottom of my soul . . . . How and what my heart suffered
   and underwent in those first two years, and in what a sense of
   unworthiness (not false and affected, but true and sincere), nay, in
   what sheer despair I was plunged, is little conceived by those who have
   since assailed the Pope's majesty with great pride and arrogance. But
   I, alone in the breach, was none so joyous and sure of my cause."

   It was in 1517 that he published his Theses, and during the next three
   years, while engaged in disputes with Cajetan and Eck, he wrote and
   brought out several of his most important works, among them his
   Commentary on the Galatians, his Address to the Christian Nobles of
   Germany, and his sermon on the Liberty of a Christian Man. In 1520 came
   his open breach with the Pope, when he burnt the Papal bull of
   excommunication. Then followed his appearance before the Diet of Worms
   in 1521; his concealment on the Wartburg, and return to Wittenberg in
   1522; his marriage in 1525; and his life at Wittenberg, until the year
   1546, when he died on a journey, at Eisleben, at the age of
   sixty-three.

   Luther was a true representative of the German people, in the depth and
   force and honesty of his nature, in his keenness of intellect and his
   occasional coarseness, in his love of art and humour and domestic life.
   Hence all he said and did was caught up by the people with an
   enthusiasm which can scarcely be conceived. "His Theses flew over
   Germany," says a contemporary, Myconius, "as if the angels of God had
   been his messengers, and carried them to all men's eyes." The works
   that so quickly followed them, seemed to utter the very words for which
   men's souls were thirsting. His great doctrine of justification by
   faith in Jesus Christ, the one Mediator between God and man, gave peace
   to the conscience by delivering it from the burden of past sins, and a
   new spring of life to the soul by showing men that their dependence was
   not on anything in themselves, no works of their own performance, but
   on the infinite love and mercy of God which He had manifested to all
   mankind in His Son. And again, his doctrine of the universal priesthood
   of all believers put a new spirit into the Church, by vindicating for
   every member of it his right and duty to offer for himself the
   sacrifice of praise and prayer, and to study for himself God's word in
   the Scriptures.

  Luther's Bible

   It was on the Wartburg that he began his translation of the Bible, the
   first part of which, the New Testament, was published in 1522, and the
   whole Bible in 1534. "In this work," says Grimm, "Luther has made use
   of his mother-tongue with such force, purity, and beauty, that his
   style, from its powerful influence on our whole language, must be
   considered to have been the germ and laid the basis of the modern high
   German language, from which, up to the present day, but few deviations
   have taken place, and those mostly to the detriment of its force and
   expressiveness."

  Luther's Hymns

   His next effort was to give the people the means of worshipping God in
   their own language. In 1523 he published a treatise "on the ordering of
   Divine Service in the Church;" and at Christmas 1525, service was
   celebrated in the parish church of Wittenberg according to this new
   German rendering of the mass. In 1526 came out a complete new German
   liturgy, and now was felt the want of German psalms and hymns to fill
   the place of the Latin hymns and sequences. Luther at once set to work
   to supply it. He was intensely fond of both music, and poetry, and was
   himself a master of vigorous and simple German. What he thought of
   music may be seen from the preface to this work; and long before
   Shakespeare he had said, "He who despises music, as all fanatics do,
   will never be my friend." He would have all children taught to sing:
   "For I would fain see all arts, specially music, in the service of Him
   who has given and created them."

   From this time onwards, throughout his life, he was an active reformer
   of church music and hymns, and enlisted in the same work the large
   circle of friends whom he gathered round him. At Wittenberg he kept
   open house, and many who came from a distance to see and consult with
   the great reformer, or poor students who came to attend his lectures,
   found a place at his table. After dinner, whether he dined at home or
   abroad, it was his custom to take a lute and sing and play for half an
   hour or more with his friends. In 1524 he invited Conrad Rupf,
   choir-master to the Elector of Saxony, and [35]Johann Walther, then
   choir-master to Frederick the Wise at Jorgau, to live with him until
   the work of reforming and readapting the liturgy for popular use should
   be completed. With this "house-choir," as he calls it, he studied the
   old stores of church music, with which he had already considerable
   acquaintance from his own education as chorister, and selected those
   tunes which lent themselves best to their new purpose. A large number
   of chorales belonging to the old Latin hymns, others of German
   origin--whether sacred, or, in some cases, secular--were thus
   appropriated; a still larger number of new tunes were composed. Luther
   himself composed several; [12] among others, the splendid [36]chorale
   to his own hymn, "[37]A sure stronghold our God is He," and [38]that to
   his Christmas carol, "[39]From heaven above to earth I come." But it
   was in the composition of the hymns that his own chief work lay. "It is
   my intention," he writes to his friend Spalatin, "after the example of
   the prophets and the ancient fathers, to make German psalms for the
   people; that is, spiritual songs, whereby the Word of God may be kept
   alive among them by singing. We seek, therefore, everywhere for poets.
   Now, as you are such a master of the German tongue, and are so mighty
   and eloquent therein, I entreat you to join hands with us in this work,
   and to turn one of the psalms into a hymn, according to the pattern
   (i.e. an attempt of my own) that I here send you. But I desire that all
   new-fangled words from the Court should be left out; that the words may
   be all quite plain and common, such as the common people may
   understand, yet pure, and skilfully handled; and next, that the meaning
   should be given clearly and graciously, according to the sense of the
   psalm itself." Luther himself had recourse to this most ancient
   treasury of sacred song, and wrote versions of various psalms, choosing
   them, as we may observe, from their adaptation to his own circumstances
   and feelings. He also translated afresh many of the Latin hymns, which
   he counted among the good things that God's power and wonderful working
   had kept alive amid so much corruption, and gave new versions of
   several of the early German hymns.

   Altogether he wrote certainly thirty-seven [40]hymns. More are
   frequently ascribed to him, but with doubtful accuracy. Of these,
   twelve were translations from the Latin, and four were new renderings
   of the old German Leisen; the remainder were purely original
   compositions. The intention with which they were written is clearly
   enough to be discerned. They were not so much outpourings of the
   individual soul, as the voice of the congregation meant for use in
   public worship, or to give the people a short, clear confession of
   faith, easily to be remembered. But they are not written from the
   outside; Luther throws into them all his own fervent faith and deep
   devotion. The style is plain, often rugged and quaint, but genuinely
   popular. So, too, was their cheerful trust and noble courage; their
   clear, vigorous spirit, that sprang from steadfast faith in a Redeemer.
   All the many conflicts, inward and outward, of Luther's life, had only
   deepened his experience; they had by no means damped his courage or his
   power of enjoyment. Since he himself had once found peace in Christ,
   and could trust in God, he was at leisure to feel all the
   delightfulness of music, of children, of birds and flowers, of the
   society of pleasant friends; he had, too, a strong sense of humour,
   which, in his polemical writings, shows itself in very downright, and
   often coarse forms, but which gives a peculiar raciness and life to his
   letters and sayings.

   In the years when he was composing most of his hymns, four printers in
   Erfurt alone were entirely occupied in printing and publishing them.
   Nor could they be prevented from penetrating where his printed works
   were carefully excluded; they were carried over the country by
   wandering students and pedlars, and here and there found their way even
   into Roman Catholic churches. "The whole people," writes a Romanist of
   that day, "is singing itself into this Lutheran doctrine." Collections
   of hymns sprang up at this time with astounding rapidity, and in
   several of these Luther took part. The four principal ones, which have
   prefaces written by him, and contain most of his hymns, passed through
   many editions, and are known by the names of their printers. [13] Of
   these, the earliest, the "Enchiridion," published at Erfurt in 1524,
   was at first placed in the people's hands for reading while the choir
   were singing, for the congregation was so unused to joining in the
   public service, that they could not at once adopt the new practice. It
   was some four or five years before Luther taught the people in his own
   parish church of Wittenberg to sing in church, but then the custom
   spread very swiftly.

   The best known of all Luther's hymns is that founded on the forty-sixth
   Psalm, which has been already mentioned. It is supposed to have been
   written on his way to the Diet of Worms, from the coincidence of the
   third verse with Luther's answer to Spalatin, who tried to dissuade him
   from the journey: "If there were as many devils in Worms as there are
   tiles on the roofs, I would go, and would not be afraid. If Huss was
   burnt to ashes, the truth was not burnt with him." Some, however, think
   that it was composed at the close of the Second Diet of Spires--that in
   1529, which revoked the religious liberty granted in the previous one
   of 1526, and against which five sovereign princes and fifteen free
   cities protested, and so earned the name of Protestants, a title which
   is, however, very rarely used in Germany, as "Evangelical" is the word
   used there in contradistinction to Roman Catholic.

THE STRONGHOLD

   [Psalm 46]

   [41]Luther. 1530.

   trans. by William Gaskell, 1855


   A sure stronghold our God is He,

   A trusty shield and weapon;

   Our help He'll be and set us free

   From every ill can happen.

   That old malicious foe

   Intends us deadly woe;

   Armed with the strength of hell,

   And deepest craft as well,

   On earth is not his fellow.


   Through our own force we nothing can,

   Straight were we lost for ever,

   But for us fights the proper Man,

   By God sent to deliver.

   Ask ye who this may be?

   Christ Jesus named is He,

   Of Sabaoth the Lord,

   Sole God to be adored,

   'Tis he must win the battle.


   And were the world with devils filled,

   All eager to devour us,

   Our souls to fear should little yield,

   They cannot overpower us.

   Their dreaded Prince no more

   Can harm us as of yore;

   Look grim as e'er he may,

   Doomed is his ancient sway;

   A word can overthrow him.


   Still shall they leave that Word its might,

   And yet no thanks shall merit;

   Still is He with us in the fight

   By His good gifts and Spirit.

   E'en should they take our life,

   Goods, honour, children, wife,

   Though all of these be gone,

   Yet nothing have they won--

   God's kingdom ours abideth!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Still more popular in its own day was the second hymn that Luther ever
   wrote; no doubt from its containing in short compass a complete
   epitome, at once of the reformed doctrine of salvation, and of the
   actual experience of those who had passed through the same conflicts as
   Luther himself. An eye-witness of the Reformation says: "Who doubts
   not, that many hundred Christians have been brought to the true faith
   by this one hymn alone, who before, perchance, could not so much as
   bear to hear Luther's name. But his sweet and noble words have so taken
   their hearts that they were constrained to come to the truth." A
   curious use was made of it in the year 1557, when a number of princes
   belonging to the reformed religion being assembled at Frankfort, they
   wished to have an evangelical service in the church of St. Bartholomew.
   A large congregation assembled, but the pulpit was occupied by a Roman
   Catholic priest, who proceeded to preach according to his own views.
   After listening for some time in indignant silence the whole
   congregation rose and began to sing this hymn, till they fairly sang
   the priest out of church. Its tune is that known in England as Luther's
   Hymn, and tradition says that Luther noted it down from the singing of
   a travelling artisan. Luther's own title to it is--

A THANKSGIVING FOR THE HIGHEST BENEFITS WHICH GOD HAS SHOWN US IN CHRIST.

   8,6,8,6,8,8,7

   Nun freut euch liebes Christen gemein

   [42]Martin Luther

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Dear Christian people, now rejoice!

   Our hearts within us leap,

   While we, as with one soul and voice,

   With love and gladness deep,

   Tell how our God beheld our need,

   And sing that sweet and wondrous deed,

   That hath so dearly cost Him.


   Captive to Satan once I lay,

   in inner death forlorn;

   My sins oppressed me night and day,

   Therein I had been born,

   And deeper fell howe'er I strove;

   My life had neither joy nor love,

   So sore had sin possessed me.


   My good works could avail me nought,

   For they with sin were stained;

   My will against God's justice fought,

   And dead to good remained;

   My anguish drove me to despair,

   For Death I knew was waiting there,

   And what but Hell was left me?


   Then God in His eternity

   Looked on my boundless woe,

   His deep compassions flowed toward me,

   True succour to bestow:

   His Father's heart did yearn and melt

   To heal the bitter pains I felt,

   Though it should cost His dearest.


   He spake to His beloved Son:

   "Go Thou, my heart's bright Crown,

   The time for pity is begun,

   Go Thou in mercy down

   To break for men Sin's heavy chain,

   To end for them Death's hopeless reign,

   And give them life eternal."


   The Son delighteth to obey,

   And born of virgin mother,

   Awhile on this low earth did stay,

   And thus became my Brother;

   His mighty power He hidden bore,

   A servant's form like mine He wore,

   My foe for me to vanquish.


   To me He spake: "Hold fast by Me,

   And thou shalt conquer now;

   Myself I wholly give for thee,

   For thee I wrestle now;

   For I am with thee, thou art Mine,

   Henceforth My place is also thine,

   The foe shall never part us.


   "I know that he will shed My blood,

   And take My life away;

   But I will bear it for thy good,

   Only believe alway;

   Death swallows up this life of Mine,

   My innocence all sins of thine,

   And so art thou delivered.


   "And when I rise to heaven above,

   Where is my Father's home,

   I still will be Thy Lord in love,

   And bid my Spirit come

   To solace thee in every woe,

   To teach thee Me aright to know,

   And into Truth to guide thee.


   "And even as I have done and said,

   So shalt thou say and do,

   That so God's kingdom may be spread,

   And He have honour due;

   And this last counsel give I thee,

   From men's additions keep thou free

   The treasure I have left thee."
     __________________________________________________________________

   We add Luther's version of the Song of Simeon:--

NUNC DIMITTIS.

   [Luke 2:29-33]

   8,6,8,6,7,8

   Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin

   [43]Martin Luther

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   In peace and joy I now depart,

   According to God's will;

   For full of comfort is my heart,

   So calm and still.

   So doth God His promise keep,

   And death to me is but a sleep.


   'Tis Christ has wrought this work for me;

   Thy dear and only Son,

   Whom Thou hast suffered me to see,

   And made Him known

   As our Help when woes are rife,

   And e'en in death itself our Life.


   For Thou in mercy unto all

   Hast set this Saviour forth,

   And to His kingdom Thou dost call

   The whole sad earth,

   Through Thy blessed, wholesome Word,

   That now in every place is heard.


   He is the Hope, the Saving Light,

   That heathen nations need,

   And those who know Thee not aright

   Will teach and lead;

   While His Israel's joy He is,

   His people's glory, praise, and bliss.

  Justus Jonas

   Portrait of Justus Jonas

   Justus Jonas -- P. 115

   Among the friends enlisted by [44]Luther as writers for the new
   hymn-books, the principal were [45]Justus Jonas, who was for many years
   his colleague in the professorship of theology at Wittenberg; and
   [46]Paul Eber, who stood in a similar relation to Melancthon.
   Melancthon himself wrote no hymns, for the one or two often attributed
   to him are really passages from his writings versified by friends. His
   work lay in the scholarship which produced what was long the standard
   edition in Germany of the Greek Testament, and in the theology that
   gave shape to the Confession of Augsburg. Justus Jonas was the son of
   the burgomaster of Nordhausen, a clever young lawyer, who very early
   became professor of jurisprudence at Erfurt and a friend of Erasmus and
   Luther. So close was his intimacy with the latter, that he accompanied
   him to Worms, an act for which he was deprived of his salary as
   professor. Luther then induced him to study divinity and take orders,
   and for many years the two men lived in constant association at
   Wittenberg; Justus Jonas accompanied his friend on his last journey,
   stood by his death-bed, and with many tears preached his funeral
   sermon. Luther's death was followed, as he had himself foretold, by
   troubles and strife. For six years (from 1546 to 1552) Germany was
   distracted by a civil war, of which the object was to obtain toleration
   for the reformed doctrine, an end achieved at last by Maurice of
   Saxony, in the treaty of Passau. Nor was this the only struggle that
   was going on. Differences of opinion on intricate theological questions
   had already begun to divide the Reformers themselves. Various sects
   arose, but the chief division was that between the followers of Luther
   who adhered to the Confession of Augsburg, and those of Zwinglius who
   adopted the more Calvinistic views of the Swiss reformers, with a lower
   sacramental theory. These called themselves distinctively the Reformed
   Church, while the Lutherans adopted the name of the Evangelical Church;
   but the latter were by far the most numerous body, and occupied in most
   States the position of the National Protestant Church of Germany, while
   the Reformed Church took up that of an important and tolerated sect.
   Justus Jonas, who was not merely a good theologian, but a skilful
   jurist, naturally had to take part in all the many discussions and
   conferences in which the evangelical doctrine gradually assumed
   definite form and consistency, and the legal and political rights of
   its adherents were ascertained and asserted; and of course he had to
   bear his share of the difficulties in which he was thus involved. On
   one occasion a Spanish officer quartered in his house received a large
   bribe to assassinate him, but was so much impressed by the piety,
   integrity, and kindness of his intended victim, that he confessed his
   purpose to him, and entreated forgiveness. Yet on his deathbed this
   well-proved servant of Christ suffered much from mental doubts and
   conflicts, until at last peace returned, and he fell asleep "as a tired
   soldier." What he did for hymnology was to help Luther in preparing
   [47]metrical German versions of the Psalms, choosing by preference, as
   one can well understand, those which speak of David's sufferings from
   his enemies, and his trust in God's deliverance. Some of these are very
   celebrated, especially the one here given:--

PSALM CXXIV.

   [Psalm 124]

   8,6,8,6,8,8,7

   Wo Gott der Herr nicht zu uns hält

   [48]Justus Jonas

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   If God were not upon our side

   When foes around us rage,

   Were not Himself our Help and Guide

   When bitter war they wage,

   Were He not Israel's mighty Shield,

   To whom their utmost crafts must yield,

   We surely must have perished.


   But now no human wit or might

   Should make us quail for fear,

   God sitteth in the highest height,

   And makes their counsels clear;

   When craftiest snares and nets they lay,

   God goes to work another way,

   And makes a path before us.


   In wrathful pride they rage and mock

   Against our souls in vain:

   As billows meet with angry shock

   Out on the stormy main,

   So they our lives with fury seek;

   But God hath pity on the weak,

   And Him they have forgotten.


   They call us heretics, and lie

   In wait to spill our blood;

   Yet flaunt their Christian name on high,

   And boast they worship God.

   Ah God! that precious name of Thine

   O'er many a wicked deed must shine,

   But Thou wilt once avenge it.


   They open wide their ravenous jaws

   To swallow us indeed,

   But thanks to God, who rules our cause,

   They shall not yet succeed:

   Their snares He yet will bring to nought,

   And overthrow what they have taught;

   God is too mighty for them.


   How richly He consoleth those

   Who have no other friend!

   The door of grace doth never close;

   Sense cannot comprehend

   How this may be, and deems all lost,

   When through this very cross a host

   Of champions God is raising.


   Our foes, O God, are in Thy hand,

   Thou knowest every plot;

   But only give us strength to stand,

   And let us waver not,

   Though Reason strive with Faith, and still

   She fear to wholly trust Thy will,

   And sees not Thy salvation.


   But heaven and earth, O Lord, are Thine,

   By Thee alone were made,

   Then let Thy light upon us shine,

   O Thou our only aid!

   Kindle our hearts to love and faith

   That shall be steadfast e'en to death,

   Howe'er the world may murmur!

  Paul Eber

   Portrait of Paul Eber

   Paul Eber -- P. 119

   As [49]Justus Jonas had somewhat of [50]Luther's talents and frank
   courage, so [51]Paul Eber was not unlike his great friend Melancthon.
   He was the son of a poor tailor, a small delicate child, whose love of
   books induced his father to stint himself even in food, in order to
   send the boy to the Grammar School of Nuremberg, one of the first
   schools into which the reformed doctrine had penetrated, Paul Eber at
   once imbibed its spirit, and as soon as he was old enough, went to
   Wittenberg to sit at Luther's feet. Attracted by his thoughtfulness and
   purity of manners, Luther invited him to his table, where he met
   Melancthon, and as the lad wrote a remarkably clear and delicate hand,
   while Melancthon wrote a particularly bad one, the latter took him for
   his amanuensis. From this time they lived on terms of the closest
   intimacy, so that Luther used to call him "Philip's familiar," and
   "Philip's treasury." He became professor of Hebrew at Wittenberg, and
   married a wife whom Melancthon chose for him, with whom he lived most
   happily. But in the theological disputes of those days he, like many
   others of Melancthon's special followers, was accused of concealed
   Calvinism, and bitterly attacked; and finally, at the conference of
   Altenburg, in 1569, he was named among those who were excluded on this
   ground from the Lord's Table and the privilege of becoming sponsors. He
   went home in cold March weather, wounded to the heart by this
   intolerance; his health gave way, and the death of his wife, which
   occurred unexpectedly about this time, was his own deathblow. He died
   in 1569.

   Eber's [52]hymns have a tone of tenderness and pathos about them, which
   is much less characteristic of this period than the grave, manly
   trustfulness of Luther and Jonas. But they soon became very widely
   known, and in the following age, that of the Thirty Years' War, few
   hymns were more constantly used both in public and private, than
   [53]one of his beginning:--


   "When in the hour of utmost need

   We know not where to look for aid,

   When days and nights of anxious thought

   Nor help nor comfort yet have brought;


   Then this our comfort is alone,

   That we may meet before Thy throne,

   And cry, O faithful God, to Thee,

   For rescue from our misery."

   This hymn was composed in 1547, when the Imperial armies were besieging
   Wittenberg, and Eber with two others were the only professors who
   remained in the university. Two of his hymns for the dying have been
   always very commonly used at deathbeds and funerals in the Roman
   Catholic as well as the Evangelical parts of Germany. The one is, [14]
   "[54]Lord Jesus Christ, true Man and God." the other is the following
   childlike expression of perfect trust:--
     __________________________________________________________________

DEATH IN THE LORD.

   8,8,8,8,8,8

   In Jesu Wunden schlaf ich ein

   [55]Paul Eber

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   I fall asleep in Jesu's arms, [15]

   Sin washed away, hushed all alarms,

   For His dear blood, His righteousness,

   My jewels are, my glorious dress,

   Wherein before my God I stand

   When I shall reach the heavenly land.


   With peace and joy I now depart,

   God's child I am with all my heart;

   I thank thee, Death, thou leadest me

   To that true life where I would be.

   So cleansed by Christ I fear not Death,

   Lord Jesu, strengthen Thou my faith!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [15] Literally, "I fall asleep in Jesu's wounds." Similar expressions
   are common in the mediaeval hymns, and in some of the later Roman
   Catholic ones. In the Evangelical hymns they occur much less
   frequently, and chiefly among the earlier Moravians.

CHAPTER VI.
HYMNS OF THE REFORMATION.
A.D. 1520-1600.

   Luther and his immediate friends were only the founders of the new
   German hymnology; it rapidly spread over a much wider field. The number
   of hymn-writers who suddenly sprang up at this time is indeed far too
   great to admit of any detailed account of them. It included not only
   clergymen and professors like those already mentioned, Erasmus Alber,
   whose secular writings especially his fables were also celebrated, and
   [56]Nicholas Decius, a converted monk, whose German version of the
   "Gloria in excelsis,"

   "[57]All glory be to God on high,"

   with its noble [58]chorale, soon came into use all over Germany; it
   also included men of all ranks--princes, like the Margraves of Hesse
   and [59]Brandenburg; soldiers and lawyers, like [60]Reissner, who was
   at the siege of Rome, and Spengler, the town-clerk of Nuremberg;
   artisans, like [61]Hans Sachs the shoemaker; and the unknown authors of
   those popular sacred songs which were on the lips of wandering
   craftsmen and maids at their work. But the ground-tones of this
   religious poetry were everywhere the same--on the doctrinal side a
   joyful assertion of God's free grace and goodwill towards men, as shown
   in our Lord Jesus Christ; and on the experimental side an ardent
   expression of hope in God for the future, and acceptance of His will in
   the present. These men felt that He had suffered a great new light of
   Truth to dawn on the world, and so though it might bring much conflict
   it filled them also with a new life and courage, and with a confident
   anticipation of a better future, which found its expression even in the
   services for the dying and the dead. Thus these hymns have a certain
   manliness, breadth, and fervour about them, which pre-eminently adapted
   them for use in the church as the common voice of praise and prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paul Speratus

   Even those which seem to us least adapted for such a purpose, the
   doctrinal ones, were more truly popular in those days, when this
   especial aspect of religion was the thing men were thinking about and
   fighting for, than we can well understand now. So a hymn by [62]Paul
   Speratus, the chaplain of the Duke of Prussia, which begins--

   Es ist das Heil uns kommen her


   "Salvation hath come down to us

   Of freest grace and love,

   Works cannot stand before God's law,

   A broken reed they prove;

   Faith looks to Jesus Christ alone,

   He must for all our sins atone,

   He is our one Redeemer"--

   goes on through several verses with a statement of the doctrine of
   justification by faith that sounds to us like a bit out of the Augsburg
   Confession done into rhyme. But in his own day it was as popular as
   Luther's hymns, and Luther himself is said to have given his last coin
   to a Prussian beggar from whom he heard it for the first time. Equally
   characteristic of the other class of hymns is such an one as that long
   attributed to the Elector John of Saxony, because he frequently used it
   during his imprisonment, but really written by [63]Ambrosius Blaurer, a
   monk from the Black Forest who joined the Reformed Church.

   "What pleaseth God, that pleaseth me,

   I will not fear nor tremble

   Though cares may fret, though I may see

   My bitterest foes assemble;

   Though all things in confusion seem,

   I know God's will is still supreme:

   What must be, let it be--I rest

   Firmly on this, His will is best.


   "What pleaseth God I frankly take,

   And only ask for patience;

   He yet will help me, nor forsake

   My soul amid temptations;

   Though pain or death itself may threat,

   His power I know can save me yet:

   What must be, let it be--my trust

   The end will show was right and just."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Or take the following hymn, which surely embodies a noble conception of
   the duty and the aspirations of a Christian sovereign, and was composed
   by the prince whose name it bears. [16]

MARGRAVE GEORGE OF BRANDENBURG'S SONG.

   Genad' mir Herr, Ewiger Gott


   Grant me, Eternal God, such grace

   That no distress

   May cause me e'er to flee from Thee;

   Let no false counsel me mislead,

   The heavenly Bread,

   My soul's true food, be ne'er withdrawn from me;

   But late and early let me hear

   Thy teachings clear,

   From teachers taught by Thee the faith;

   And yield me still up to Thy will,

   Until I yield my soul to Thee in death.


   Teach me to make true order, Lord,

   That so Thy Word

   The common man may understand;

   Convert my subjects to obey

   Thy gentle sway;

   Increase the Christian host within my land.

   But stirreth now full many a sect

   That doth neglect

   True Christian faith and foster strife,

   Save us from such, nor let them touch

   Thy Word, our guide alike in death and life.


   So grant us peace in these our days,

   Not strife that slays

   The brother's love Thou dost commend;

   Thou mak'st the welfare of my State,

   Envy and hate

   Keep far from me and all, till life shall end;

   Grant me Thy Spirit like a lamb,

   Thou know'st I am

   But flesh and blood, and apt to take offence;

   That mind of Thine be also mine,

   For this I pray with all my diligence.


   City and lands in every part,

   With earnest heart

   To Thee who gav'st them I commend;

   They are a charge that I must bear

   With faithful care;

   Thou with good counsellors my throne befriend,

   That all may see true justice done

   Clear as the sun,

   To rich and poor impartially;

   Not fraud and might, reason and right

   Rule here,--for this, for this, I cry to Thee!


   And let the nobles of our land

   Well understand

   The faith, and find the one true Ground,

   In all things earnest to fulfil

   Thy holy will;

   By all who seek Thee be Thou surely found;

   So every class within the State,

   Or small or great,

   Or young or old, may praise Thy name most high,

   Give honour due and try to do

   What Thou wouldst have, nor ever from Thee fly.


   Nor be my own needs, Lord, forgot,

   Forsake me not,

   But lead me ever in Thy way;

   Wisdom and judgment breathe in me,

   And ever be

   Close at my side whate'er I do to-day;

   In my affairs act Thou, nor let the foe,

   Who well I know

   With craft and wrath is working hour by hour,

   Me e'er deceive, or e'er bereave

   Of Thy dear Presence that benumbs his power.


   For burnt not once that heart of Thine

   With love divine

   Thinking on all our pain and loss?

   'Twas no light thing Thou didst for us,

   Accepting thus

   So willingly the anguish of the cross,

   Bearing the woes of death and sin

   For us to win

   The life the Father had decreed

   For sinful man, e'er time began:--

   Ah! let me reap the fruit of Thy sweet deed!


   Lord, I have chosen the true gate,

   Narrow and strait,

   And yet my footsteps often stray;

   Bid me of Thy sore sorrow think,

   Nor dare to shrink

   Whate'er befall, but still press on Thy way.

   Give me true faith to persevere

   Through doubt and fear

   Till soul and body part in death;

   Then let the foe strike no last blow,

   Grant me to yield to Thee in peace my breath.


   O may a burgher's right in heaven

   To us be given

   Of Thy free grace, we cannot purchase it.

   And listen yet to one more prayer,

   Spare Thou, O spare

   My brother's soul, which I to Thee commit;

   Thou know'st 'tis not in man to save,

   Wherefore I crave

   Mercy and grace for all my brother men;

   Thou, if Thou wilt, canst pardon guilt;

   Pardon and peace grant Thou, dear Lord. Amen.

  Hans Sachs

   It is curious also to note that now, for the first time, Northern
   Germany furnishes the largest proportion of singers; hitherto the
   southern half of Germany had claimed nearly all its literary and
   poetical activity,--now on the contrary, the North supplanted the
   Southern "Volkslied" on its own ground. But the South could still boast
   of possessing at Nuremberg the best poet of his day, the one who linked
   the times that were passing to the new period that was coming in, for
   he characteristically belonged to the Middle Ages, and yet was among
   the earliest and warmest adherents of the Reformation. Nuremberg itself
   was one of the most splendid results of those ages. It was a great free
   city, whose social polity was the pride of its citizens and the
   admiration of strangers, wealthy, and full of stirring and successful
   commercial enterprise; the home of the great mechanical and scientific
   inventions of the day; and rich in treasures of Gothic art in its
   streets and churches. Martin Schön was engraving, and Albert Durer was
   painting there, where, according to the old doggrel rhyme--


   "Hans Sachs, who was a shoe-

   Maker, and a poet too,"

   was winding up with his own name the long roll of her "Master-singers,"
   and opening the way to the new style of modern poetry. [65]Hans Sachs
   was the son of a tailor, and was born in 1494, during a fearful
   epidemic of the plague. His parents were industrious, God-fearing
   people, who early sent him to the grammar-school; but as his health was
   not strong, they thought it better he should be put to a trade than
   allowed to study as he wished. At fourteen, accordingly he was
   apprenticed to a shoemaker, but about the same time he made the
   acquaintance of Leonard Nunnenbeck, who was a weaver and also the most
   celebrated "Master-singer" of the day. Nunnenbeck remarked the boy's
   talent, and at once received him among his pupils; and when, at
   seventeen, Hans Sachs set out on his wanderings, his object was to
   perfect himself not only in the craft of shoemaking, but also in that
   of verse-making. He visited the great schools of his art in Mayence and
   Strasburg, and ere long made such progress that he himself acted as
   teacher in Frankfort and Munich. He was a favourite everywhere for his
   talent and his wit, but he led a singularly pure and abstemious life;
   and at twenty-two returned to his native city, presented his
   master-piecc as a shoemaker, and when admitted to the guild, married,
   and settled down in Nuremberg. Here he spent the rest of his long
   life,--for though he was a delicate child, he lived to be
   eighty-one,--working sometimes at his trade, sometimes giving
   instruction in the art of composition, more often engaged on his own
   compositions. These earned him in his own day great renown and a wide
   popularity, and he was the first author who lived to see a complete
   collected edition of his own works. It was published at Nuremberg in
   1558, in five folio volumes. He was indeed a most prolific writer,
   surpassed only by Lopes de Vega, for he published more than six
   thousand poems, of course of very varying excellence. Almost every
   style of poetry, except the dramatic which he but slightly attempted,
   is largely represented among them,--lyrical, narrative, satirical,
   humorous and earnest. His highest merit, which won for him the
   admiration of Goethe, lay in his short tales, many of which are comic,
   though all have some moral point, and which are told with a spirit and
   humour, a freshness and pathos that both render them attractive in
   themselves and valuable as a vivid picture of the life of his times.
   The greater number of his more humorous poems belong to his later
   years; most of his earlier ones are serious--first love-songs of a very
   pure and domestic character, then poems chiefly of the political and
   religious class. Such works, handling the most important topics of the
   day and circulated on broadsheets as fast as they were written, helped
   to form the public opinion of the times as powerfully as newspapers do
   now, and it was no slight gain to the cause of the Reformation that so
   ready and favourite a writer should from the first have taken that
   side. In 1523 he published a poem which soon spread all over Germany,
   called the "Nightingale of Wittenberg." It described the state of
   Christendom, by picturing the miseries of a poor flock of sheep which
   have fallen among wolves, and are especially exposed to the rapacity of
   a lion (Leo X.), who had craftily undertaken to defend them. Suddenly
   they hear the clear notes of a nightingale, foretelling the day-dawn,
   and the sheep who follow this voice are led out into a lovely sunny,
   safe meadow. His keen, shrewd rightmindedness made him appreciate how
   great an influence the new mode of thought would inevitably exercise on
   the domestic life, and also on the social and political condition of
   the nation; and hence many of his poems take up the questions of the
   honourableness of marriage, the necessity of concession on the part of
   the rulers, and of love of the commonwealth and readiness to make
   sacrifices for it on the part of the people of Germany. He saw, too,
   the dangers of discord and quarrels among the Reformers; and when
   Luther dies, he represents Theology as weeping over the coffin of the
   man of God, and mourning the treatment she receives at the hands of
   presumptuous sectaries. He comforts herby telling her that she has yet
   defenders left, and that Luther's doctrine has at least put an end for
   ever to all the monkey-tricks of relics and shrines, pretended miracles
   and indulgences. But he does not conceal his fears of the dissensions
   among Christians themselves, and exhorts them to hold fast by the pure
   Gospel: "Love God above all, and thy neighbour as thyself; against that
   doctrine ban and edict, clergy and laity, school and preaching, monks
   and old women, will alike be powerless."

   The most famous of his hymns is one that he wrote during the terrible
   siege of Nuremberg in 1561:-- "[66]Why art thou thus cast down, my
   heart?" [17] Of his others we give two; the first is called

A FAIR MELODY: TO BE SUNG BY GOOD CHRISTIANS.

   8,6,8,6,7,8,7

   Wach' auf meines Herzens Schöne

   [67]Hans Sachs

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Awake, my heart's delight, awake

   Thou Christian host, and hear

   These tones that lovely music make,

   God's Word most pure and clear,

   That now is sweetly sounding,

   While dawn is piercing through the night

   Through God's dear love abounding.


   The prophets' message now at last

   Our ears may hear again,

   Locked up therewith in silence fast

   Long had the Gospel lain;

   But now we hear their voices,

   And many an anxious burdened soul

   In freedom now rejoices.


   For conscience lay oppressed and bound

   By bans and men's commands,

   Soul-traps and nets were all around;

   But now our German lands,

   Behold the sun is risen,

   And those foul shapes were ghosts and lies,

   And dare to burst their prison.


   Christ sends us many messengers

   His gospel to proclaim,

   And all the realm of darkness stirs

   To work them death or shame,

   And quench the Truth in error;--

   O Christendom, thou Bride of God,

   Fear not for all their terror!


   Trust thou in flattering tongues no more,

   Though many they may be;

   All human teachings dread thou sore,

   Though good they seem to thee;

   But put thy whole affiance

   In God's good-will and holy Word,

   There is our one reliance.


   There yield thy heart and soul entire,

   What it commands is good;

   Where it forbids let no desire

   E'er stir within thy blood;

   Where it allows, maintain thou

   Thy Christian freedom as Paul saith,

   Yet from offence refrain thou.


   The Word will save thee from the smart

   Of sin and pains of hell,

   If thou believe it with thy heart

   No evil there can dwell;

   'Twill make thee pure and holy,

   And teach thee that in Jesus lies

   Our hope and comfort solely.


   Blest be the day and blest the hour

   When thou didst see revealed

   The Word of God in all its power,

   The soul's true strength and shield;

   Let nought to thee be dearer

   In heaven or earth, no creature-love

   E'er to thy heart be nearer.


   O Christendom, here give thou heed,

   By no false lore perplexed,

   Here seek and find true life indeed

   For this world and the next;

   For he who dies believing

   In Christ alone, shall live with Him,

   His heavenly joys receiving.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As this poem makes us understand what many men must have felt when the
   Gospel was once more made accessible to them in their own language, and
   without the intervention of "men's devices," so the next little song
   expresses that trust in Christ as the only Mediator and channel of
   salvation, which had been long obscured by teachings about the Virgin
   and the saints.

THE MEDIATOR.

   8,7,8,7,4,4,10,4,4,10

   Christe, wahrer Sohn Gottes frohn

   [68]Hans Sachs

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O Christ, true Son of God most high,

   Thy name we praise for ever;

   Whoe'er to Thee for help doth cry

   Shall find Thee fail him never;

   'Tis Thou wilt plead,

   Thou intercede

   With God, for us who need Thy prayers so sore:

   Thy bitter strife

   Hath wrought us life,

   And Thine be thanks and praise for evermore!


   To Thee the Father giveth now

   All power in earth and heaven;

   Sin, Satan, Death to Thee must bow,

   All fetters Thou hast riven,

   Bade fear to cease,

   And made our peace,

   That now to God we dare our hearts outpour:

   Thy bitter strife

   Hath wrought us life,

   And Thine be thanks and praise for evermore!


   Fulness of grace is in Thy Word;

   The Life, the Truth, the Way

   To life eternal art Thou, Lord;

   To Thee alone we pray,

   Who didst appear

   A servant here

   To bear the sin that crushed the world before:

   Thy bitter strife

   Hath wrought us life,

   And Thine be thanks and praise for evermore!

  Bohemian Brethren

   Another link between the religious poetry of the Reformation and of
   that preceding age, was the hymnology of the [69]Bohemian Brethren,
   which often reminds us in tone of the mediaeval Latin hymns. These
   Brethren were the remains of an ancient Slavonic Christianity, which
   owed its origin to the teaching of two Greek monks in the ninth
   century, and was in existence before the papal authority and Roman
   liturgy found their way to Bohemia. Throughout the Middle Ages a tacit
   struggle existed between these two elements; the Roman prevailed, but
   the earlier Greek still showed itself in the demand of the people for
   the possession of the Scriptures and the performance of worship in the
   vernacular; and it was in a great measure due to his meeting this want
   that the doctrines of Huss were so readily received. At last the
   smouldering conflict burst into open warfare, which raged at intervals
   throughout the fifteenth century. It was a terrible war, embittered by
   the animosities alike of religion and race--a history of virulent and
   unrelenting persecution on one side, and of cruel retaliations on the
   other. At last a peace was made; the Hussites withdrew to the borders
   of Bohemia and Moravia, and maintained a precarious existence, until
   the scanty remnants found a refuge in Saxony in 1725.

   When the Reformation began, the Bohemian Brethren were among the first
   to hail it; as early as 1522 they sent messengers to [70]Luther to wish
   him success, and confer with him on questions of church discipline. One
   of these was [71]Michael Weiss, who afterwards became the pastor of the
   German-speaking congregations of Landskron and Fulnek, and for their
   benefit translated into German the finest of the Bohemian hymns, adding
   some of his own. Luther greatly admired and highly recommended this
   hymn-book; it was republished with further additions by their Bishop,
   John Horn, in 1540, and passed through many editions both in Germany
   and Holland. Its contents are of various kinds: some are entitled
   "Hymns of Instruction," and were designed to put the great truths of
   Christianity and the chief events of the Gospel history, into a form in
   which they might be easily understood and retained by unlettered minds;
   others are liturgical, adapted to the festivals of the Church, or
   morning and evening prayer, and among these many are antiphons, often
   of very elaborate structure, intended to be sung alternately by priest
   and people; others again are simply hymns of Christian experience. The
   versification is fluent and musical, reminding us that the Bohemian
   race has always been distinguished by its musical gifts: the tone has
   no fierceness, but much tenderness and earnestness; and the frequent
   references to persecution only implore steadfastness and protection,
   never vengeance. The Christian sacrifice of entire self-surrender to
   God, the union of the Church in Christ, reliance on God in
   trouble,--these thoughts, which the circumstances of their own career
   must have brought very close to their hearts, meet us again and again
   in their [72]hymns. The following is

   Lob und Ehr mit stettem Danckopfer

   [73]Bohemian Brethren

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Praise, glory, thanks, be ever paid

   To God the Father who hath all things made,

   And to the Son,

   Who hath atoned for all that we have done;

   And to the Holy Ghost be honour due,

   Who the dead soul can with His gifts renew,

   And doth impart

   God's holy law to every chosen heart.


   To this one God, the Lord of Sabaoth,

   Be now and evermore

   Glory and praise from all the hosts of heaven,

   Resounding o'er and o'er;

   While all the realm of earth,

   All tribes of human birth,

   Sing of His greatness and His light,

   His mercy, holiness, and might.


   Who, Lord, by searching e'er shall find out Thee,

   Who fathom Thy dread Being's mystery?

   Resist Thy might,

   Or hide from Thee and Thine all-piercing sight?

   What is there that can live without Thy care,

   Of all that swim the waves and fly in air,

   Or man or beast?

   For all 'tis Thou must spread the constant feast.


   O God, Almighty Lord of Sabaoth!

   'Tis Thou dost reign;

   And the whole world in shape and order due

   Thou dost maintain;

   Beauty and fruitfulness are Thine,

   'Tis Thou dost bid the heavens to shine,

   Or sendest showers, or storm, or gloom;

   From Thee all life and motion come.


   Who, Lord, of us, with thought and tongue so weak,

   Shall rightly of the wondrous kindness speak

   Which Thy dear Son

   At Thy will doeth to us, and hath done?

   For didst Thou not to us Thy dearest give,

   And promise that in Him we all should live,

   From death set free,

   And sin and Satan,--and at peace with Thee?


   O God, how great to us, the sin-opprest,

   Hath been Thy love!

   In Christ Thy Son Thou leadest us to rest,

   Bidding us prove

   True conquerors o'er the world, the flesh,

   The sin that ever tempts afresh;

   Clothed in faith's armour, called to be

   Knights of a heavenly chivalry.


   Therefore, O Father, we Thy wisdom praise,

   And ever thankful songs to Thee will raise,

   Who through Thy Son

   For this Thy little flock so much hast done;

   O rule it by Thy Spirit from on high,

   And if with much temptation Thou dost try,

   Grant it to shine

   Here and hereafter as of gold most fine.


   Rejoice, ye Christ-believing host, fear nought,

   Your cause is won!

   For Christ, true Man and God, for you hath fought,

   And all is done.

   His is the Name o'er every name;

   He can of right all honour claim;

   To Him be praise and thanks again,

   Now and for evermore: Amen.

   Lord, to Thy chosen ones appear,

   Gladden weak hearts weighed down by fear,

   Let Thy Word's light, a guiding Star,

   Arise on those who dwell afar.


   Let none who seek Thee faint or tire,

   But still press on with warm desire,

   Shunning whate'er Thou dost condemn,

   That Satan have no part in them.


   Bid them Thy easy yoke to know,

   Patient alike in joy and woe;

   In spirit, soul, and body still

   Wholly surrendered to Thy will.


   We yield, O Thou true Life, to Thee,

   Wealth, honour, all things, utterly,

   Fixing our hearts on Thee alone;

   O God Supreme, be Thou our own!

   [75]Bohemian Brethren

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Now God be with us, for the night is closing,

   The light and darkness are of His disposing;

   And 'neath His shadow here to rest we yield us,

   For He will shield us.


   Let evil thoughts and spirits flee before us;

   Till morning cometh, watch, O Master, o'er us;

   In soul and body Thou from harm defend us,

   Thine angels send us.


   Let holy thoughts be ours when sleep o'ertakes us,

   Our earliest thoughts be Thine when morning wakes us;

   All day serve Thee, in all that we are doing,

   Thy praise pursuing.


   As Thy beloved, soothe the sick and weeping,

   And bid the prisoner lose his griefs in sleeping;

   Widows and orphans we to Thee commend them,

   Do Thou befriend them.


   We have no refuge, none on earth to aid us,

   Save Thee, O Father, who Thine own hast made us;

   But Thy dear presence will not leave them lonely

   Who seek Thee only.


   Father, Thy name be praised, Thy kingdom given,

   Thy will be done on earth as 'tis in heaven;

   Keep us in life, forgive our sins, deliver

   Us now and ever. Amen.

  Johann Matthesius

   Two more singers of this period must be named here, because they as
   distinctively connect this age with the coming one, as [76]Hans Sachs
   did with the past. They were fast friends and fellow-helpers,--the
   pastor and precentor of Joachimsthal, [77]Johann Matthesius and
   [78]Nicolas Hermann. Joachimsthal was a large village in the
   mountainous border-land between Saxony and Bohemia; mines had lately
   been discovered in its neigbbourhood, and it was rapidly growing into a
   prosperous little town; it had embraced the Reformed religion, and was
   distinguished by its good schools. Here for many years Matthesius and
   Hermann led such a life as, happily for Germany, has been
   characteristic of many of her secluded districts since the
   Reformation,--quiet as to outward tenor amid those eventful times,
   hardworking in the cause of religion and education, homely in its
   circumstances, yet linked to the wider world and the best life of its
   time by its religious thought and its culture of poetry and music. The
   two friends were very unlike. Matthesius had been converted by reading
   accidentally some of Luther's tracts, and left the grammar-school of
   Joachimsthal of which he was rector, to become again a student at
   Wittenberg, and hear the lectures of Melancthon and Luther. [79]Justus
   Jonas introduced him to [80]Luther, who invited him to become one of
   the regular guests at his table, and ere long admitted him to his most
   intimate friendship. Luther very soon urged him to take orders, for
   which indeed he was well qualified, for he was a man of ability, of
   great piety, and had a gift of singularly persuasive eloquence; but he
   was so self-distrustful, that on his first attempt to preach he
   ascended the pulpit three times without being able to bring out a
   single word; and it was only Luther's almost vehement insistance that
   induced him to make one more effort, when he gave "a capital glorious
   sermon," as Luther says. He sympathised with Luther too in his love and
   practice of music, and after Luther's death wrote a biography of him,
   which is still a standard work. From Wittenberg he returned as pastor
   to Joachimsthal, where he laboured for the rest of his life, greatly
   cherished by its somewhat rough and mixed population, who were very
   proud of their pastor's eloquence and singularly pious and charitable
   life. Yet though outwardly smooth, life was no easy thing for him: he
   suffered much from the cares of a large family, especially after the
   death of his helpful wife; and from mental and spiritual conflicts,
   which at times seriously affected his health. He died as he had often
   wished, in harness, being seized with a fit at the conclusion of a
   sermon. He wrote various devotional works, and some very good and sweet
   [81]hymns; of which several for the morning, for marriage, a cradle
   hymn, and [82]for the miners, became very popular.

   [The hymns most frequently to be met with, are of course those adapted
   to Church use. A morning hymn--


   "My inmost heart now raises,

   In this fair morning hour,

   A hymn of thankful praises

   To God's almighty power"--

   was the favourite morning hymn of Gustavus Adolphus.]

   But his influence on literature was not so great as that of his friend,
   who was precentor and organist of the church and master of the schools.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Nicolas Hermann

   The portrait of [83]Nicolas Hermann in the library at Nuremberg shows a
   handsome, genial, yet shrewd-looking old man, and such he seems to have
   been--a man who threw himself wholly into the life of the people around
   him, and found interest and happiness in it. Few of his hymns and poems
   are intended or adapted for the Church; they are meant for his school
   children; for the girls and young men to sing, instead of profane
   songs; for the occasions of domestic and daily life; or for the perils
   and varying fortunes of a miner's hazardous calling. But he had a fatal
   facility of versification, and many of his poems are spoilt by their
   length, while others are but rhymed versions of some of
   [84]Matthesius's sermons; yet his best show that he had in good measure
   the real gift of song, and mark a new style in German hymnology, not
   the grave and lofty tone that had been caught from the Psalms of David,
   but the simple, earnest, picturesque manner of the popular songs. He
   was a passionate lover of music, and when old and infirm could picture
   heaven to himself no otherwise than as a place of delicious and joyful
   harmony. He writes once: "Every organist or lutanist in that life too
   will take some holy text, and strike upon his organ or his lute; and
   every one will be able to sing at sight and by himself four or five
   different parts. There will be no more confusion and mistakes, which
   now often put many a good musician quite out of heart, especially when
   he has to begin again several times over." He died in 1561.

   The hymns of these authors most frequently to be met with, are of
   course those adapted to Church use. A morning hymn by [85]Matthesius--


   "My inmost heart now raises,

   In this fair morning hour,

   A hymn of thankful praises

   To God's almighty power"--

   was the favourite morning hymn of Gustavus Adolphus. Many of Nicolas
   Hermann's [86]hymns are to be found in all German hymn-books. One of
   these is the following
     __________________________________________________________________

HYMN FOR THE DYING.

   8,7,8,7,8,8,7

   Wenn mein Stündlein vorhanden ist

   [87]Nicolas Hermann

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   When my last hour is close at hand,

   And I must hence betake me,

   Lord Jesu Christ beside me stand,

   Nor let Thy help forsake me.

   To Thee my soul I now commit,

   And safely wilt Thou cherish it

   Until again Thou wake me.


   Conscience may sting my memory sore,

   And guilt my heart encumber;

   But though as sands upon the shore

   My sins may be in number,

   I will not quail, but think of Thee,

   Thy death, Thy sorrows, borne for me,

   And sink in peace to slumber.


   I have been grafted in the Vine,

   And hence my comfort borrow;

   For surely Thou wilt keep me Thine

   Through utmost pain and sorrow;

   Yea, though I die, I die in Thee,

   Who through Thy death hast won for me

   Heaven's bright eternal morrow.


   Since Thou from death didst rise again,

   In death Thou wilt not leave me;

   Thy life declares my fears are vain,

   And doubts no more shall grieve me,

   For Thou wilt have me where Thou art:

   And so with joy I can depart,

   And know Thou wilt receive me.


   And so I stretch mine arms to Thee,

   Now, O dear Jesu, take me!

   Peaceful and calm my sleep shall be,

   No human voice shall wake me,

   But Thou wilt ope the heavenly door

   To life and joy for evermore,

   Thou, who dost ne'er forsake me!

   And of [88]Matthesius we give this Miner's Song:

MINER'S SONG.

   8,8,8,8

   O Vater, Sohn, und Heil'ger Geist

   [89]Matthesius

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

   Thou God, dost fix the miner's post,

   Thy Word hath made the wondrous store

   Of rock, and earth, and precious ore.


   Good metal is a gift from Thee,

   'Tis ours to use it honestly

   For God and country, as 'tis fit,

   Not give it our hearts and worship it.


   Who sees God in the precious stone,

   Works truly, prays to Him alone,

   Believes in Christ with all his heart,

   He doth the Christian miner's part.


   God, who createdst quartz and sand,

   Change them to ore in this our land;

   Thy blessing guide us where to find,

   Thy Spirit give the wise clear mind.


   Who hath Thee, knows Thy word and love

   Better than much fine gold shall prove;

   Thy meanest gift is goods and gold,

   Christ is the mine of wealth untold.


   At Zarephath a smelter's wife

   Maintained of old the prophet's life,

   Believed his word, had peace and rest,

   And God's dear blessing with her guest.


   So we commend, Lord, to Thy grace

   Thy little Church within this place;

   It hath received and keeps Thy Word,

   Repay it with true prophets, Lord.

CHAPTER VII.
AN INTERVAL.
A.D. 1560-1616.

   The later years of the sixteenth and the opening of the seventeenth
   century are by no means so rich in hymn-writers as the era of the
   Reformation itself. Not that there was any diminution in the quantity
   of religious poetry, but the quality grew much poorer and thinner, and
   it fell chiefly into the hands of professional authors, instead of
   springing up all over the country out of the heart of the people. Still
   this period, too, has some very good and fine hymns, but a marked
   change of tone is perceptible in most of them; they are no longer
   filled with the joyful welcome of a new day, they more often lament the
   wickedness of the age, and anticipate coming evil times or the end of
   the world itself. And yet that age, so far from being at all
   particularly wicked or calamitous, was a time on the whole of peace and
   prosperity. Pestilences did indeed visit Germany at intervals, as in
   1563 and 1597, but this was no new thing; such outbreaks occur
   periodically throughout the previous centuries.

  Progress of Germany

   In other respects Germany was making rapid progress, both material and
   mental. In the course of a few years after the peace of Passau, the
   Reformed religion had spread over more than three-fourths of the
   country, including all the most populous and active regions; while in
   literature so great a change had taken place, that whereas a work of
   the fifteenth century seems far away from us both in thought and
   language, a work from the latter half of the sixteenth is written
   nearly in the same German that is used now, and breathes comparatively
   the spirit of modern life. The great idea that every man is personally
   responsible for his belief and his actions to God Himself, was making
   itself felt in every field, breaking up old organizations and the
   orderly but rigid routine of mediaeval life prompting to new
   enterprises, inspiring men with courage to bear imprisonment, exile, or
   death for their faith. But it had brought its dangers and difficulties
   too, not only in the actual persecutions and wars which, though on a
   very limited scale, existed throughout this period until they
   culminated in the great struggle of the Thirty Years' War; but still
   more in an excessive individualism which rendered common action almost
   impossible. For the new mode of thought gave rise to mental conflicts
   and doubts and scruples of conscience, for which there was no longer
   the easy resolution of an authoritative decision of Church or priest,
   and which saddened the lives of many whom we should not now call
   specially religious persons; and it brought endless disputes on
   doctrinal questions among the professors of the evangelical faith
   themselves. Over the temporary compromise between the Romanist and
   Protestant religions, known as "the Interim;" over every shade of more
   or less Calvinistic views of the Atonement and the Sacraments, they
   quarrelled, not in words only but deeds: men were deprived of their
   offices or salaries, banished from one State to another, or excluded
   from the Lord's Supper and from the privilege of sponsorship. The
   political circumstances of the day bore the same impress of lack of
   unity. Germany was broken up into a multitude of little States, without
   a real centre of authority, and with no clearly defined relations
   between the princes and people within each State. Against all this
   division was ranged the growing power of the Order of the Jesuits on
   the religious side, and of the House of Hapsburg on the political; two
   powers that indeed represented unity, but unity springing from and
   leading back to despotism, and which soon formed a close and mighty
   alliance. It might well be that to thoughtful men the future looked
   dark.

   Out of this time we choose [90]Ambrose Lobwasser, [91]Bartholomew
   Ringwaldt, [92]Selnecker, and [93]Helmboldt as the men who best
   represent its religious poetry. [18] Lobwasser was a professor of
   jurisprudence at Königsberg, and had strong leanings to the Calvinistic
   Church, though not actually belonging to it. He made a complete
   translation of the French Psalter of Marot and Beza, which was
   published with Goudimel's melodies in 1573, and went through many
   subsequent editions. It is noticeable chiefly because it long remained
   the recognised psalter, like Sternhold and Hopkins with us, and was the
   only hymn-book admitted to use in public worship by the Calvinistic
   churches. Otherwise its poetical merits are very small; it does not
   rise above the level of a sort of rhymed prose, and it furnished an
   unfortunate model for a flood of very prosaic rhymed paraphrases of
   doctrinal statements or passages of Scripture, which become wonderfully
   numerous at this time.

  Bartholomew Ringwaldt

   [94]Ringwaldt was the author of the hymn so well known in England under
   the mistaken title of "Luther's Hymn,"--


   "Great God, what do I see and hear,

   The end of things created,"--

   which is in fact a quotation rather freely handled from a celebrated
   hymn of his on the Second Advent to judgment. He was a native of
   Frankfort-on-the-Oder; a man of cheerful, courageous, genial spirit,
   whose life was passed as the pastor of a little place called Langfeldt,
   where he died in 1598. But his many hymns and religious works strongly
   illustrate what has been said of the tone of feeling at that time, for
   they are generally penitential, or filled with warnings of the coming
   judgment. Among the best of the former is the following:--
     __________________________________________________________________

PENITENCE.

   8,6,8,6,8,8,7

   Herr Jesu Christ, mein höchstes Gut

   [95]Ringwaldt

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Lord Jesu Christ, my Highest Good,

   Thou Fountain of all grace,

   Behold how heavy is my mood,

   As I my past retrace,

   How sore my conscience is beset

   With keenest arrows of regret,

   That never cease to pierce me.


   Alas! when I remember all

   The life I once held dear,

   A stone upon my heart doth fall,

   And I must quail for fear,

   I know not where to take my flight;

   Ah Lord! I must despair outright,

   But for Thy word of mercy.


   But when I hear it sweetly sing

   Of peace for evermore,

   My heart almost begins to spring,

   And laughs in me once more,

   To know how merciful Thou art

   To all who, with a contrite heart,

   Will come to Thee, O Jesus!


   So I, too, dare to come to Thee,

   And at Thy feet I lay

   My burden, while with bended knee

   And earnest heart I pray,

   Forgive me, heal my conscience' strife,

   For all the sins of all my life

   Forgive, dear Lord, forgive me!


   Yea, O my God, forgive me now

   For Thy Name's blessed sake;

   The heavy yoke 'neath which I bow

   Do Thou in mercy break.

   So shall my heart have peace at last,

   And to Thy praise my years be passed

   In childlike, glad obedience.


   Thy joyful Spirit give me strength,

   Thy wounds my healing be,

   When my last hour must come at length,

   Wash Thou my soul for me;

   And take me when it seems Thee best,

   In the true faith to heavenly rest

   For ever, Lord, with Thee. Amen.

  Nicholas Selnecker

   The career of [96]Nicholas Selnecker, on the other hand, affords an
   example of that discord and persecution among the Protestants of which
   we have spoken. He was a cultivated, agreeable, and very able man,
   springing from one of the oldest families of Nuremberg, who prided
   themselves on their culture. As a boy, his remarkable musical gifts and
   personal beauty attracted the notice of Ferdinand, King of Rome, and
   his Italian confessor; and they laid a plan for having the boy
   kidnapped and carried to Spain. Fortunately his father discovered it in
   time to have him secretly conveyed to Wittenberg, where he was boarded
   in the house of Melancthon. As a man, the highest offices in the
   Lutheran Church were open to him, and he was distinguished by several
   of the Evangelical sovereigns. But he had an acute, and singularly just
   and candid mind, which inclined him to decided but moderate views, and
   hence he became a constant mark for attack to the extreme partisans on
   both sides. He was incessantly involved in controversy; he was seven
   times banished from Saxony--whenever, in fact, the ultra-Calvinistic
   party got the upper hand--and was seven times implored to return; while
   he was turned out of Jena and Brunswick for being too lenient to the
   Calvinists. So the life that might have been rich in value and
   usefulness was almost wasted in fruitless disputes and struggles, which
   were full of suffering to a man who loved peace, and was keenly alive
   to the dangers of disunion. He died in 1592, at the age of sixty-two.
   Being a great lover of church-music, he devoted much time and attention
   to the improvement of the German liturgy, and himself wrote several
   hymns, of which only two short ones can be quoted here. The first is
   still commonly used at the close of evening worship:--
     __________________________________________________________________

EVENING-TIDE.

   8,8,8,8

   Ach bleib bei uns, Herr Jesu Christ

   [97]Nicholas Selnecker

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Lord Jesu Christ, with us abide,

   For round us falls the evening-tide;

   Nor let Thy Word, our glorious light,

   For us be ever quenched in night.


   In these dark days that yet remain

   May we Thy sacraments maintain,

   And keep Thy Word, still true and pure,

   And steadfast in the faith endure!
     __________________________________________________________________

   For his own daily prayer he wrote this:--

MORNING PRAYER.

   8,6,8,6

   Lass mich dein sein und bleiben

   [98]Nicholas Selnecker

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Make me Thine own and keep me Thine,

   Thou faithful God and Lord!

   Let nought seduce this heart of mine

   From Thee and Thy pure Word.


   Let me ne'er waver nor grow cold,

   But give me steadfastness;

   So shall I praise Thy grace untold

   In heaven's eternal bliss.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Louis Helmboldt

   [99]Louis Helmboldt belongs in age to this date, but in the tone and
   power of his compositions he is more nearly akin to Luther and his
   contemporaries. He was, like [100]Selnecker and [101]Ringwaldt, a
   native of one of the great free cities, Mulhausen, where his father, a
   wealthy woollen manufacturer, was a senator and had married into one of
   the neighbouring noble families. At fifteen the young Louis already
   went to the university of Erfurt, and at eighteen his native city made
   him head-master of one of its schools--a position, however, which he
   found it best to resign in about eighteen months. He then returned to
   Erfurt, obtained a professorship, and for seventeen years was Dean of
   the Philosophical Faculty. At this university there was at that time
   both a Romanist and an Evangelical party; and when the former from
   political circumstances for a while obtained the preponderance,
   Helmboldt, as a leader of the latter, was obliged to leave, to the
   great indignation of the town and the students. He went back to
   Mulhausen, and at the age of forty took orders, and was appointed by
   the town-council to one of their churches, and to the rectorship of a
   great school; and was finally made general-superintendent, an office
   answering to that of a bishop with us. He was one of the principal
   poets of his day, and published a number of Latin odes and elegies, for
   which the Emperor Maximilian, at the Diet of Augsburg, awarded him the
   honours and emoluments of poet-laureate. Of his German writings the
   odes are said to be very poor, but he was a fertile song-writer both
   for the school and home, after the manner of [102]Nicolas Hermann, and
   for the Church. One of his hymns is to be found in all German
   hymn-books, and has rooted itself among the people. It was written in
   1563, when a terrible pestilence attacked Erfurt, and in the course of
   a year destroyed 4,000 of its inhabitants, so that the university had
   to be broken up for some months. Helmboldt gave this hymn to the wife
   of one of his friends, as she was starting on a hasty flight from the
   city; and in most of the old hymn-books it is headed--

THE TRUE CHRISTIAN'S VADE-MECUM.

   7,6,7,6,6,7,7,6

   Von Gott will ich nicht lassen

   [103]Louis Helmboldt

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   From God shall nought divide me,

   For He is true alway,

   And on my path will guide me,

   Where else I oft should stray.

   His ever-bounteous hand

   At morn and eve is heedful

   To give me what is needful

   Where'er I go or stand.


   If sorrow comes, He sent it,

   In Him I put my trust;

   I never shall repent it,

   For He is true and just,

   And loves to bless us still.

   My life and soul, I owe them

   To Him who doth bestow them;

   Let Him do as He will.


   Whate'er may be His pleasure

   Is surely best for me;

   He gave His dearest treasure

   That our weak hearts might see

   How good His will toward us,

   And in His Son He gave us

   Whate'er could bless and save us:

   Praise Him who loveth thus!


   Yes, praise Him, for He never

   His needful help denies;

   Ah happy hour, whenever

   To Him our thoughts can rise!

   For all the time we spend

   Without Him is but wasted,

   Mere loss till we have tasted

   His joy that cannot end.


   The world around is passing

   With all its pomp and pride;

   What men are here amassing

   Can never long abide;

   We die--and it is gone.

   But fear not, Christian sleeper,

   God is our mighty Keeper,

   And we shall wake anon.


   Then though on earth I suffer

   Much trial, well I know

   I merit ways still rougher,

   And 'tis to heaven I go,

   For Christ I know and love;

   And every step leads thither,

   Where, safe from blasts that wither,

   Joy dwells with Him above.


   For 'tis our Father made us,

   And wills our good alone;

   The Son hath died to save us

   And make God's goodness known;

   The Spirit rules our ways,

   And dwells through faith within us,

   To God and Heaven to win us;

   To Him be thanks and praise!

  Weingartner

   Several of the classical hymns of Germany belong to this period, and
   resemble in spirit those of [104]Ringwaldt and [105]Helmboldt just
   quoted. The best are by [106]Schalling and [107]Herberger, both pastors
   in Silesia, and [108]Pappus, a professor at Strasburg.

   We give one of this style by [109]Weingartner, the pastor of Heilbronn,
   which became a great favourite during the Thirty Years' War, and also a
   little poem of a more personal character, which belongs to this date,
   but is of unknown authorship:--
     __________________________________________________________________

CONSOLATION.

   6,6,7,7,7,7

   Auf meinen treuen Gott

   [110]Weingartner

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   In God my faithful God

   I trust when dark my road;

   Though many woes o'ertake me,

   Yet He will not forsake me;

   His love it is doth send them,

   And when 'tis best will end them.


   My sins assail me sore,

   But I despair no more;

   I trust in Christ who loves me,

   From this Rock nothing moves me,

   Since I can all surrender

   To Him, my soul's Defender.


   If death my portion be,

   Then death is gain to me,

   And Christ my life for ever,

   From whom no death can sever;

   Come when it may, He'll shield me,

   To Him I wholly yield me.


   Ah Jesus Christ, my Lord!

   So meek in deed and word,

   Didst Thou not die to save us,

   Because Thou fain wouldst have us,

   After this life of sadness,

   Heirs of Thy heavenly gladness?


   "So be it" then I say

   Heartily day by day!

   Guide us while here we wander,

   Till safely landed yonder,

   We too, dear Lord, adore Thee,

   And sing with joy before Thee!

A THANKSGIVING.

   8,6,8,6

   Brennende Liebe, du heilige Flamme

   [111]Anon.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Thou burning Love, Thou holy Flame,

   O Thou my God and Lord,

   Thou hast preserved me by Thy Name,

   When terrors were abroad;

   Thou helpest us in worst distress,

   If we but cling to Thee,

   Wherefore, my God, no bitterness

   Shall ever make me flee.


   Ah! never can I praise enough

   The mercy Thou hast shown!

   When days were dark and storms were rough

   Thou mad'st Thy kindness known,

   Thy miracles of goodness then

   Thou sufferedst me to see;

   O Bread of Life! my heart again

   Cries, let me cling to Thee!


   Thee I desire, to Thee I cleave,

   To Thee will I be true;

   As opes the floweret to receive

   The May-time's quickening dew,

   So in the time of grief and woe

   Opens my heart to Thee,

   And feels anew a living glow,

   For Thou consolest me.


   Ah! though I lived a thousand years,

   And spake with thousand tongues,

   I could not tell with words nor tears

   What praise to Thee belongs.

   Ah no, it never can be told,

   Not even, my God, to Thee,

   How rich the gifts, how manifold,

   That Thou hast showered on me!


   This only, O my God, I pray,

   Thy Spirit may abide

   In me, and keep me in Thy way,

   My Comfort and my Guide;

   Let nothing evil reign within,

   Thine angels send to me,

   Let me escape all snares of sin,

   And lead me home to Thee.

  Philip Nicolai

   Hitherto the hymns of the Reformation had been distinguished by their
   simplicity and appropriateness to church use; their models had been
   found in the earlier Latin hymns, or in the Psalms of the Old Testament
   and the hymns handed down to us by St. Luke. Now, however, for the
   first time we encounter a new style, afterwards very prevalent, which
   reminds us of some of the later mediaeval hymns addressed to the Virgin
   and saints, and finds its scriptural ground in the Song of Solomon and
   the Apocalypse. As yet most hymns were addressed to God the Father
   through our Lord Jesus Christ, or to the Holy Trinity, or in the case
   of hymns of sorrow and penitence to the Saviour. But afterwards the
   mystical union of Christ with the soul became a favourite subject; more
   secular allusions and similes were admitted, and a class of hymns
   begins to grow up, called in Germany "Hymns of the Love of Jesus." Some
   of these are extremely beautiful, and express most vividly that sense
   of fellowship with Christ, of His presence and tender sympathy, of
   personal love and gratitude to Him, which are among the deepest and
   truest experiences of the Christian life; but it is a style which needs
   to be guarded, for it easily degenerates into sentimentality of a kind
   very injurious alike to true religion and poetical beauty.

   The earliest examples of this style are two celebrated hymns written by
   [112]Dr. Philip Nicolai in 1597, during a fearful pestilence in
   Westphalia, where he was pastor of the little town of Unna. More than
   1,400 persons died in a very short time, and from his window he saw all
   the funerals pass to the graveyard close at hand. From these scenes of
   death he turned to the study of St. Augustine's "City of God" and the
   contemplation of the eternal life, and so absorbed himself in them that
   he remained cheerful and well amid the surrounding distress. In 1599 he
   published the fruit of his meditations in a treatise called "The Joyous
   Mirror of Life Eternal," a book of pious and devout reflection, to
   which be affixed two hymns that speedily attained a remarkable
   popularity, and are indeed admirable for their fervour of emotion and
   mastery over difficult but musical rhythms. [113]One is--


   "Wake, awake, for night is flying,

   The watchmen on the heights are crying,

   Awake, Jerusalem, at last!"

   which is well known in England from the use of its splendid
   [114]chorale in Mendelssohn's "Elijah" to the words,

   "Sleepers, wake, a voice is calling."

   The other hymn, "[115]O Morning-Star," also possesses a very fine
   [116]chorale; and so popular did it soon become, that its tune was
   often chimed by city chimes, lines and verses from it were printed by
   way of ornament on the common earthenware of the country, and it was
   invariably used at weddings and certain festivals. It is still to be
   found in all German hymn-books, but in a very modified form to suit
   more modern tastes. A translation of the original hymn is here
   attempted. Nicolai's title for it is--

A SPIRITUAL BRIDAL SONG OF THE BELIEVING SOUL, CONCERNING HER HEAVENLY
BRIDEGROOM.

   8,8,7,8,8,7,8,4,4,8

   Wie schön leuecht't uns der Morgenstern

   [117]Philip Nicolai. 1597.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O Morning-Star, how fair and bright

   Thou beamest forth in truth and light!

   O Sovereign meek and lowly!

   Sweet Root of Jesse, David's Son,

   My King and Bridegroom, Thou hast won

   My heart to love Thee solely!

   Lovely art Thou, fair and glorious,

   All victorious,

   Rich in blessing,

   Rule and might o'er all possessing.


   O King high-born, Pearl hardly won,

   True Son of God and Mary's Son,

   Crown of exceeding glory!

   My heart calls Thee a Lily, Lord,

   Pure milk and honey is Thy Word,

   Thy sweetest Gospel-story.

   Rose of Sharon, hail! Hosanna!

   Heavenly Manna,

   Feed us ever;

   Lord, I can forget Thee never!


   Clear Jasper, Ruby fervent red,

   Deep deep within my heart now shed

   The glow of love's pure fire;

   Fill me with joy, grant me to be

   Thy member closely joined to Thee,

   Whom all my thoughts desire;

   Toward Thee longing doth possess me,

   Turn and bless me,

   For Thy gladness

   Eye and heart here pine in sadness.


   But if Thou look on me in love,

   There straightway falls from God above

   A ray of purest pleasure;

   Thy Word and Spirit, flesh and blood,

   Refresh my soul with heavenly food,

   Thou art my hidden treasure.

   Let Thy grace, Lord, warm and cheer me,

   O draw near me;

   Thou hast taught us

   Thee to seek, since Thou hast sought us.


   Lord God, my Father, mighty Shield,

   Thou in Thy Son art all revealed

   As Thou hast loved and known me;

   Thy Son hath me with Him betrothed,

   In His own whitest raiment clothed,

   He for His bride will own me.

   Hallelujah! Life in heaven

   Hath He given,

   With Him dwelling,

   Still shall I His praise be telling.


   Then touch the chords of harp and lute,

   Let no sweet music now be mute,

   But joyously resounding,

   Tell of the Marriage-feast, the Bride,

   The heavenly Bridegroom at her side,

   'Mid love and joy abounding;

   Shout for triumph, loudly sing ye,

   Praises bring ye,

   Fall before Him,

   King of kings, let all adore Him!


   Here my heart rests, and holds it fast,

   The Lord I love is First and Last,

   The End as the Beginning;

   Here I can die, for I shall rise

   Through Him, to His own Paradise

   Above all tears and sinning.

   Amen! Amen! Come, Lord Jesus,

   Soon release us,

   With deep yearning,

   Lord, we look for Thy returning.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Church Music

   It has been said that [118]Nicolai's hymns owed some of their
   popularity to the noble chorales he composed for them; and it may be
   observed in general that the rapid growth of sacred poetry in Germany
   at the era of the Reformation was partly due to an equally striking
   advance in church-music. The song-loving German people seized with
   avidity on this new opening for their art, and a very remarkable number
   of fine tunes were composed in this century, so that an old writer
   says, "Whensoever the Holy Ghost inspireth a new hymn, it is His wont
   to inspire some one with a good tune to fit it." Nearly all the
   collections of hymns also contained tunes, which were inseparably
   associated with certain hymns; and it became the custom in most towns,
   for the city musicians to ascend the tower of the church or town-hall
   at certain hours of the day, and blow these sacred melodies from their
   horns, so that the people learnt them by heart from childhood. A great
   improvement took place in the organ about the same time, and Eccard,
   who lived at Mulhausen, and composed melodies for many of
   [119]Helmboldt's hymns, introduced the practice of giving the air to
   the soprano instead of the tenor voice. Thus by the close of this
   century the chorale had assumed essentially its modern form, and the
   organ was universally used in Lutheran churches. The tune to
   [120]Helmboldt's hymn above quoted has always been a peculiar favourite
   in Germany, and though harmonized by Eccard, was based on a secular
   air, as Helmboldt tells us--


   "Because so sweet in every part,

   So tuneful is this air,

   That hearing it, a godly heart

   Swims in delight most rare

   Therefore have I set words to it,

   That every one may sing;

   Whate'er his case, this song will fit,

   And never harm can bring."

   The chorales are distinguished by breadth and simplicity, and are
   peculiarly adapted for large masses of voices or for organ
   accompaniment; while compared with the Gregorian music which had
   preceded them, they formed a congregational rhythmical song. Great
   skill may be shown in the arrangement of the inner voices, and in such
   skill [121]Luther took the keenest delight: he speaks of the wonderful
   wisdom of God as shown in music, "when the other parts play around the
   air, leading as it were a heavenly dance with it; meeting with
   pleasure, parting in pain, embracing and kissing each other again."
   "Whoever is not moved by such art as this, must of a truth be a coarse
   clod, not worthy to hear such lovely music, but only the waste wild
   bray of the old chanting, and the songs and music of the dogs and
   pigs."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [18] It should be remarked that it was during this period that two men
   wrote, whose prose works powerfully affected the religious life of
   Germany. One was the mystic, Jacob Böhme (died in 1624), whose
   influence becomes apparent in the literature of the period following
   the Thirty Years' War. The other was Johann Arndt (died 1621), whose
   works on the Christian Life--the "True Christianity," and "Garden of
   Paradise"--were the favourite devotional reading of all earnest
   Christians in Germany for more than a hundred years.

CHAPTER VIII.
THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR.
A.D. 1618-1650.

   The long peace of sixty years which had followed the treaty of Passau
   was drawing to an end; and to understand the difference that was made
   by the Thirty Years' War that followed it, we must remember that
   Germany was already an old country, in the van of European
   civilization, with a social order, literature, and arts of many
   centuries' growth.

   Some of the great cities, such as those of the Hanse League and
   Nuremberg for instance, were indeed beginning to lose a little of their
   pre-eminence, as the carrying trade of the world was finding new paths,
   and slipping into the hands of the English and the Netherlanders. But
   they were still the channel of communication between the east and west
   of Europe; and the great development of the internal trade of Germany,
   its mines and its manufactures, was supplying to some extent the place
   of what was lost. It was also calling into existence all over the
   country smaller towns, which were centres of vigorous and active life;
   while the country regions were thickly dotted with villages, and towns
   and villages alike had their local organization for self-government,
   their churches, and schools. The standard of comfort was substantially
   a high one, in food, in dress, and in furniture. Of course various
   articles of foreign production which are common now, and the lack of
   which we should sorely feel, were wholly unknown then; but, on the
   other hand, there was far more artistic effort and beauty bestowed on
   the houses themselves, and on their internal ornamentation and
   furniture, than in later times. Many of the churches were beautiful
   specimens of Gothic architecture, and even in country places they were
   generally handsome stone buildings, often possessing rich altar
   furniture, painted windows, and a peal of bells--forms of decoration in
   which the Germans took great delight, and for which their skill was
   famous all over Europe. The quick-witted townspeople were accustomed
   greatly to despise their rural neighbours, and no doubt the difference
   of manners in those days of infrequent communication was far more
   marked than it is now; but the peasant had no reason to be ashamed of
   his lot. During the previous century a change had gradually taken
   place, which leaving certain feudal dues and rights to the lords, had
   in most parts of Germany practically transformed the peasant into the
   proprietor of his land. Agriculture was practised with great skill and
   care, the crops seem to have been large, the culture of wool and of the
   vine was carried to a greater extent even than now, and the number of
   animals of all kinds, but especially horses, proved by old parish
   records to have existed on the land, is very surprising. The houses
   were usually of clay, but were plentifully furnished with linen,
   bedding, pewter, and such wooden furniture as is now eagerly bought up
   by connoisseurs, while the warm and abundant clothing of the people was
   a common subject of remark among travellers. Mentally, too, the country
   was full of life; education was carefully promoted, and just before the
   war broke out an association was formed, called "The Fruit-bearing
   Society," which aimed at fulfilling towards the German literature and
   language the functions of the Academy Della Crusca towards the Italian,
   and which counted among its members men of all ranks from the highest
   downward, and all the best writers of the day.

   Over such a country swept to and fro the pitiless ever-recurring
   tempest of war, for the lifetime of a whole generation; and when the
   great peace rejoicings took place at last in 1650, [19] it was a
   changed land which witnessed them. It is calculated by German writers
   who have been investigating recently the official records still left of
   the state of the country before and after the war, that over a
   considerable extent of it, four-fifths of the population and much more
   than four-fifths of the property were destroyed, [20] and taken as a
   whole, at least a half of both throughout Germany must have
   disappeared; while it is only within the last thirty or forty years
   that Germany at large has attained the same point, either as to
   population, trade, or the productiveness of the soil, at which it stood
   early in the seventeenth century. Two hundred years have been necessary
   merely to recover lost ground!

   Looked at broadly the conflict was a defensive war on the part of the
   Protestant against the Roman Catholic religion. During its earlier
   years the advantage inclined on the whole to the Imperial side; then
   came the "Lion of the North," Gustavus Adolphus, and swept back the
   tide of victory, and after his death it is hard to say which party had
   the advantage. Had either been strong enough to win a decided success,
   the war might have been sooner at an end; but the opponents were nearly
   matched, and the Evangelical party, princes and people alike, felt that
   they could not yield--for them it was a struggle of life and death. If
   the Imperialists had triumphed, despotism and Romanism under the
   Jesuits would have settled down over the whole land, as they did on the
   Austrian dominions.

   Such a war brought with it many evils besides itself; terrible
   disturbances of trade and currency, which perhaps most affected the
   cities; bands of marauders who infested country regions where the use
   of locks and bolts had been almost forgotten. Evangelical territories
   which fell into the hands of the Imperialists had to suffer a religious
   persecution, which cost many their lives, and drove hundreds of
   thousands into exile, so that the difficulties of the fortified cities
   of the north were much increased by the numbers of homeless fugitives
   who sought shelter there. Towards the close of the war came scarcity of
   food, and pestilences, one of which, in 1637, was of frightful
   severity, such as had not been known for a hundred years. But the worst
   was the actual devastation of the war itself. Gustavus Adolphus
   succeeded in introducing a higher discipline and tone into his army,
   and preventing the plundering and cruelties which were practised by the
   troops generally, but after his death no one else had the same power.
   As a rule, the soldiers plundered wherever they went, not only taking
   what they wanted, but often wantonly destroying what they could not
   carry off; the churches were robbed and battered down because they
   afforded a refuge to the poor villagers, and the bells were stolen to
   make guns; if a peasant was suspected of secreting any treasure, he was
   cruelly tortured; girls and lads were constantly carried away by force.
   In many parts of Germany spots are still pointed out where the
   peasantry made hiding-places for themselves in the woods, while their
   few possessions were concealed in graveyards, even in the very coffins
   of the dead. The towns suffered under forced contributions and the
   quartering of large bodies of troops, and sometimes had to endure the
   utmost horrors of siege and storm. Leipsic was besieged five, and
   Magdeburg six times. Towards the end of the war we are told of once
   flourishing towns reduced to forty inhabitants, who with their own
   hands unroofed their houses to avoid the taxation to which
   dwelling-houses were still liable, and dwelt in thatched hovels in the
   streets; and of villages wholly depopulated, or where a scanty remnant
   crept back to the familiar fields and cowered in clay huts without
   windows, lest the firelight should serve as a beacon to attract their
   enemies.

   When we read such a tale of disasters it seems wonderful that society
   should have survived, or the country recovered at all. We have to
   remember that after all there were intervals of rest, and some
   districts suffered less than others, were perhaps only once or twice
   visited by the armies. And certainly the immediate effect of the war on
   the mental activity of Germany was stimulating; it was not until the
   stillness of the peace had fully set in that the exhaustion which it
   had produced in this direction, as well as others, made itself felt.
   While the contest was going on, the call for exertion, the
   consciousness of fighting in a great cause, the enthusiasm excited all
   over evangelical Germany by the lofty character and splendid genius of
   Gustavus Adolphus, quickened men's love of their religion and their
   fatherland. This was especially true of the clergy at that time.
   Whether Romanist or Evangelical, the parish priests seem to have
   deserved well of their country by the way in which they stood by their
   flocks, comforting them in trouble, and encouraging the little
   community to re-organize itself and struggle on afresh after each new
   disaster. But the Evangelical clergy showed themselves particularly
   courageous in this way, for they were usually marked out for plunder
   and cruel ill-treatment by the Imperialist troops; yet when their
   churches were destroyed they assembled the people for prayer in the
   woods or on the hill-sides; when the school was broken up, they taught
   the children as long as it was possible to collect any; they obtained
   help for their people through the ecclesiastical organization from the
   more favoured regions; and they were the medium through which the
   higher intelligence of the country, and the sentiment of a common
   nationality and faith, penetrated to the mass of the people. Their
   influence is acknowledged to have been one of the most valuable in
   keeping society together, and preventing culture from dying out, even
   by those German writers who lament the character of pedantry and
   stiffness which they impressed on literature and thought. And so it
   came about that this period of suffering was one of literary and
   intellectual activity in many ways; and that once more especially a
   great outburst of religious song took place, in which the clergy bore
   the greatest share, but which was by no means confined to them. A very
   large proportion of the most famous hymns and hymn-writers of Germany
   belong to this century, and the only difficulty is to select from the
   number of its names.

  The Order of the Palm

   Many of them were also members of the [122]Fruit-bearing Society, which
   from its motto and badge--a palm-tree with the words "all for use"--is
   also known as the Order of the Palm. It was founded in 1617 by Ludwig,
   Prince of Anhalt-Cöthen, and, though meant for serious work, had its
   fanciful side in its imitation of an order of chivalry. Its head was
   always to be a German prince; no one was to be admitted to membership
   except persons of some distinction, either by birth or literary
   achievements or both, and of unblemished character; all its members
   were bound to promote in every possible way the purity and refinement
   of the German language and the enrichment of its literature, and to
   cultivate whatever was essentially national in language and manners. A
   very large number of the noble classes, among whom a high standard of
   cultivation was then common, joined it, as well as the principal
   writers of the time; and it certainly did good service in furnishing a
   centre for national feeling and for common action, as well as in its
   own proper department.

  Martin Opitz

   The most eminent member of this society was [123]Martin Opitz,
   afterwards ennobled as Opitz von Bobersfeld. He was a native of
   Bunzlau, in Silesia, and with him begins what is termed the Silesian
   era of German poetry--a time when this country held the first rank in
   learning and literature among the German States as markedly as Swabia
   had done in the days of the Minne-singers. Opitz died of the plague at
   Dantzic in 1639, at the early age of forty-two; but his short life had
   been rich in mental labour. He had travelled much, and was well known
   at all the chief German courts; he had taken part in one military
   expedition, and had acquitted himself creditably of a more congenial
   employment--a diplomatic mission to Paris. His great work, however, lay
   in his "Treatise on German Poetry," and in the practical
   exemplification of its principles which he gave in his own poems. He
   was, in fact, the first to lay down the laws of German prosody, and he
   may be said to have given its form to German verse, as Luther did to
   German prose. This service has obtained him a higher place in his
   country's literature than the merits of his poems would intrinsically
   justify. They are easy, correct, and elegant, but have scarcely a spark
   of originality or force, yet in his own day they procured him the
   highest possible eulogies from princes and scholars, and not empty
   praise alone, but money, friends, and rank. Opitz was essentially a
   clever, industrious literary man of the world, with the art of making
   himself everywhere agreeable, and he was petted and caressed
   accordingly, more than was good for his work. Such a man would probably
   never have written religious poetry at all in ordinary times; but
   living as he did when grave thoughts and terrible struggles were in all
   men's minds, he too was influenced by his age, and he wrote a good deal
   of this kind--versions of all the epistles for the Sundays of the year,
   of many of the Psalms, and of the Song of Solomon. Among his sacred
   poems, however, his hymns are by far the best, and some are really
   fine. We give one, a

MORNING HYMN.

   8,8,8,7,7,5,7,7,5

   O Licht geboren aus dem Lichte

   [124]Martin Opitz von Bobersfeld

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O Light, who out of Light wast born,

   O glorious Sun of Righteousness,

   Thou sendest us anew the morn

   With pleasant light and cheerfulness;

   Therefore it beseems us well

   Now with thankful lips to tell

   All we owe to Thee;

   Let our hearts to Thee arise,

   Open Thou our inner eyes

   All Thy love to see.


   O let Thy Spirit's clear-eyed day

   Break in upon our hearts' deep night,

   And with its glowing radiance slay

   Our self-trust's cold deluding light;

   See, we waver and are weak,

   Act and thought alike oft seek

   Paths that are not Thine!

   That our way may grow more clear,

   And our life more steadfast here,

   Bid Thy Sun to shine.


   Unite, Lord, in the bonds of peace

   Our Church's scattered band;

   Bid wars and persecutions cease

   Through our sad fatherland;

   Grant us, Lord, O grant us rest!

   That we, not too sore opprest,

   May our course fulfil

   Through this fleeting Time, till Thou

   Bring us where the angels now

   Praise Thy goodness still.

  Paul Flemming

   Next to [125]Opitz, the chief poet of the time was [126]Paul Flemming,
   and in real poetical genius, in truth and depth of feeling, he
   surpassed him; yet Flemming was but little known during his lifetime,
   and himself regarded Opitz with an almost idolatrous reverence. He was
   a Saxon by birth, the son of wealthy parents; and though he adopted
   medicine as his profession, he seems to have been independent of its
   exercise. He had an energetic and fervid temperament, and an
   enthusiastic love for his country and the cause of Evangelical
   religion, to which he often gives expression in his verse. The love of
   adventure, and the hope too of doing some good service to his country,
   induced him to join an embassy that was sent at first to Moscow, and
   afterwards by way of Astrachan to Ispahan, an expedition that in those
   days occupied seven years, and led him into an incredible number of
   dangers and hardships. He returned to Hamburg in 1639, and died the
   next year, like so many of his contemporaries, in the prime of his
   powers, for he was but thirty-one. Evidently he had a keen eye for
   natural beauty, and he writes charming descriptions of scenes that he
   beheld in his long journey, as well as sweet and tender songs of love
   and friendship; but a shade of sadness is thrown over them by his
   sorrow for his country, and the bitter regret he felt at having left it
   in its trouble, for travels which did not produce the expected results.
   [127]One of his hymns, written on this journey, is a classical one in
   Germany. It is--


   "Where'er I go, whate'er my task,

   The counsel of my God I ask."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The following little poem is inscribed

TO MYSELF.

   Lass dich nur nichts nicht dauern


   Let nothing make thee sad or fretful,

   Or too regretful,

   Be still;

   What God hath ordered must be right,

   Then find in it thine own delight,

   My will.


   Why shouldst thou fill to-day with sorrow

   About to-morrow,

   My heart?

   One watches all with care most true,

   Doubt not that He will give thee too

   Thy part.


   Only be steadfast, never waver,

   Nor seek earth's favour,

   But rest:

   Thou knowest what God wills must be

   For all His creatures, so for thee,

   The best.
     __________________________________________________________________

SO HATH GOD LOVED THE WORLD.

   Ist's möglich, dass der Hass auch kann geliebet sein?


   Can it then be that hate should e'er be loved?

   Yea, Love! 'Twas only on the world's cold heart,

   Cold, hard as iron, Thou couldst show Thine art,

   There only all Thy strength and fire be proved.

   'Tis on our ice Thy living radiance glows,

   Makes day of night, for evil gives us good,

   Riches for poverty, for hunger food,

   And heaven for earth. True Friend of bitterest foes,

   Thou Death of death, O Pain to nought but pain,

   O Master who Thy work dost ne'er disdain,

   Serving Thy servants who can merit nought,

   How can I fathom Thy abyss, O Love!

   By so much deeper than our hearts can prove,

   As God is higher than man's highest thought.

  Andreas Gryphius

   Another of these men who were the leaders of the secular literature of
   their age, and who also ranked themselves among its religious poets,
   was [128]Andreas Gryphius, a Silesian like [129]Opitz, and like him a
   member of the Order of the Palm. His great achievement was the revival
   of the drama, to which his tragedies gave its modern form in Germany,
   as the poems of Opitz did to lyrical verse. Thus they too mark an epoch
   in German literature, and they soon found imitators, but they have not
   kept his name alive among the people as some of his hymns have done. He
   translated several of the ancient Latin hymns very finely, and wrote
   many of his own, which were published at first in a small volume, under
   the title of "Tears for the Passion of Jesus." All his works are
   pervaded by a deep tone of melancholy; the transitoriness of all things
   is the thought that meets us again and again, and is rendered endurable
   only by a firm trust in God. "All flesh is grass . . . . but the Word
   of the Lord abideth for ever;"--this most ancient antithesis of sorrow
   and consolation is the text of most of his hymns and odes. His own life
   had been so darkened by sorrow that it was impossible his writings
   should not bear the same impress. Before the age of five-and-twenty he
   had lost his father by poison, his mother, brother, and sister by
   sickness; he had known poverty and hunger; he had been driven from one
   university by fire, from another by the plague; he and his brother had
   both suffered persecution for their religion, and the only gleam of
   sunshine in his life had been the kindness of the Count Palatine von
   Schönborn, to whose children he was tutor. Now his patron died, and he
   himself was brought to the very verge of the grave by a long and
   dangerous illness, from which indeed he at last recovered, but with
   broken health and spirits, and he died suddenly at the age of
   forty-seven, at a meeting of the Estates of the provinces of Glogau.
   Yet through all this he managed to become not only a distinguished poet
   and an earnest Christian, but an active man in public business, and a
   great scholar; he understood eleven languages; he travelled over a
   great part of Europe, lecturing on the most various scientific
   subjects, and receiving honours from the universities he visited; and
   after his return he was for many years the chief syndic of the
   principality of Glogau, and discharged the onerous duties of his post
   to the great satisfaction of the people. Of his "Spiritual Odes," the
   following is one of the most characteristic:--
     __________________________________________________________________

PASSING AWAY.

   *     *     *     *     *

   Die Herrlichkeit der Erden


   All glories of this earth decay,

   In smoke and ashes pass away,

   Nor rock nor steel can last;

   What here gives pleasure to our eyes,

   What we as most enduring prize,

   Is but an airy dream that fadeth fast.


   What are the things whereof we boast?

   What are they worth we value most?

   They are but simply naught.

   What is the very life of man,

   So brief, uncertain, void of plan?

   Time's passing fancy with no substance fraught.


   What is the fame we strive for sore,

   And deem will last for evermore,

   But an illusion mere?

   So soon as hence the mind is fled,

   The lips are pale, the man is dead,

   None asks what he achieved when dwelling here.


   No wisest knowledge here avails,

   O'er fools and wise men Death prevails,

   Nor lets them long abide.

   Castles nor wealth can help at all;

   He who hath found the world too small,

   Now finds at last a narrow grave too wide.


   There is no laughter here, no joy,

   But some heart-sorrow, some annoy,

   Will poison it ere long:

   Where wilt thou find unmixed delight,

   Where honour that is always bright,

   Undimmed by scorn and hate, unvexed by wrong?


   We reckon year to add to year,

   And while we count, behold! the bier

   Is standing at our door;

   With scarce the time to think or pray

   We must be gone, and leave the day,

   And say good-night to Earth for evermore.


   For even while Pleasure doth beguile,

   And Strength looks forward with a smile,

   And Youth feels safe and free,

   Death weaves his snares about our feet,

   And Pleasure ceases to be sweet,

   And Youth and Strength and Courage fail and flee,


   Up, heart, awake, as one who knows

   Of all the gifts that Time bestows

   But one belongs to thee--

   The Present; for the Past doth fly

   As a swift stream goes shooting by;

   The Future--ah! who knows whose that shall be?


   Laugh at the world, her honours vain,

   Her fears and hopes, her love disdain,

   Find refuge with the One

   Who is and ever shall be King,

   To whom no Time a change can bring,

   From whom eternal life can come alone.


   Ah well for him whose trust is here!

   Built on the rock, he need not fear

   Time's changes and decay:

   Though he may fall, he yet shall stand

   For ever in the unchanging land,

   For very Strength itself shall be his stay.
     __________________________________________________________________

SONNET.

   In meiner ersten Blüt'


   In life's fair spring, its earliest tender bloom,

   Fell Death hath orphaned me; and Sorrow's night

   Hath wrapped me round; and the relentless might

   Of Sickness bade my days in pain consume;

   My hours were shared with Want and Grief and Gloom.

   Supports, whereon as pillars firm I leant,

   Have all, alas! but failed me, broke or bent;

   Alone I bear as best I may my doom.

   Nay, not alone! My God forsakes me not,

   His Father-heart hath ne'er its truth forgot;

   His eye and hand still for His child must care:

   When man no help can find, then comes His hour,

   When human strength is spent He shows His power,

   When hid His presence seems; behold! our God is there.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Hymn Writers

   Other Silesians distinguished themselves both as secular and sacred
   poets: among them were Buchner, professor of poetry at Wittenberg, who
   was the most intimate friend of Opitz; Andreas Tscherning, a professor
   at Rostock, who wrote a little book of sacred poems called "The
   Spring-time of German Poetry," which had a very wide circulation in its
   own day; and David von Schweinitz, an upright, God-fearing statesman,
   whose "Spiritual Harp of the Heart" was also very popular. But from
   these minor poets, we must turn to the great hymn-writers of this
   period. In general their hymns have a more reflective tone than those
   of the Reformation: they are never doctrinal, but always experimental
   or devotional; more tender than the earlier hymns, they are not as yet
   deteriorated by exaggerated sentiment or self-introspection; they are
   simple, sweet, fervent expressions of trust in God's goodness and
   self-surrender to Him. Some of them breathe the very spirit of
   Christian courage, as that famous battle-song of Gustavus Adolphus,--

   "[130]Fear not, O little flock, the foe,"--

   which was long attributed to Altenburg, a pastor in Thuringia; recent
   researches, however seem to have made it clear that he only composed
   the chorale, and that the hymn itself was written down roughly by
   Gustavus Adolphus after his victory at Leipsic, and reduced to regular
   verse by his chaplain, Dr. Fabricius, for the use of the army. Such
   again are the hymns of [131]Apelles von Löwenstern, the saddler who
   rose to be a noble, a statesman, a poet, and a musician; and such
   especially is the hymn which has become the popular "Te Deum" of
   Germany, and is always chosen on any great public occasion to express
   the united gratitude and praise of the people.

PRAISE.

   Nun danket alle Gott

   [132]Martin Rinkart. 1644.

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Now thank we all our God

   With hearts and hands and voices,

   Who wondrous things hath done,

   In whom His world rejoices;

   Who from our mother's arms

   Hath blessed us on our way

   With countless gifts of love,

   And still is ours to-day.


   Oh may this bounteous God

   Through all our life be near us,

   With ever joyful hearts

   And blessed peace to cheer us,

   And keep us in His grace,

   And guide us when perplexed,

   And free us from all ills

   In this world and the next.


   All praise and thanks to God

   The Father now be given,

   The Son and Him who reigns

   With them in highest heaven,

   The one eternal God,

   Whom earth and heaven adore;

   For thus it was, is now,

   And shall be evermore.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Martin Rinkart

   This simple but noble expression of trust and praise, with its fine
   [133]chorale, was composed by [134]Martin Rinkart, in 1644, when the
   hope of a general peace was dawning on the country. He was one of those
   provincial clergymen to whom Germany had so much reason to be grateful.
   The son of a poor coppersmith, he made his way at the University of
   Leipsic by dint of industry and his musical gifts, took orders, and was
   precentor of the church at Eisleben, and at the age of thirty-one was
   offered the place of Archdeacon at his native town of Eilenburg in
   Saxony. He went there as the war broke out, and died just after the
   peace, and throughout these thirty-one years he stood by his flock, and
   helped them to the utmost under every kind of distress. Of course he
   had to endure the quartering of soldiers in his house, and frequent
   plunderings of his little stock of grain and household goods. But these
   were small things. The plague of 1637 visited Eilenburg with
   extraordinary severity; the town was overcrowded with fugitives from
   the country districts where the Swedes had been spreading devastation,
   and in this one year 8,000 persons died in it. The whole of the town
   council except three persons, a terrible number of school children, and
   the clergymen of the neighbouring parish, were all carried off; and
   Rinkart had to do the work of three men, and did it manfully at the
   beds of the sick and dying. He buried more than 4,000 persons, but
   through all his labours he himself remained perfectly well. The
   pestilence was followed by a famine so extreme that thirty or forty
   persons might be seen fighting in the streets for a dead cat or crow.
   Rinkart, with the burgomaster and one other citizen, did what could be
   done to organize assistance, and gave away everything but the barest
   rations for his own family, so that his door was surrounded by a crowd
   of poor starving wretches, who found it their only refuge. After all
   this suffering came the Swedes once more, and imposed upon the unhappy
   town a tribute of 30,000 dollars. Rinkart ventured to the camp to
   entreat the general for mercy, and when it was refused, turned to the
   citizens who followed him, saying, "Come, my children, we can find no
   hearing, no mercy with men, let us take refuge with God." He fell on
   his knees, and prayed with such touching earnestness that the Swedish
   general relented, and lowered his demand at last to 2,000 florins. So
   great were Rinkart's own losses and charities that he had the utmost
   difficulty in finding bread and clothes for his children, and was
   forced to mortgage his future income for several years. Yet how little
   his spirit was broken by all these calamities is shown by this hymn and
   others that he wrote; some indeed speaking of his country's sorrows,
   but all breathing the same spirit of unbounded trust and readiness to
   give thanks.
     __________________________________________________________________

  The Königsberg Circle

   Still more natural was it that at such a time the heavy sorrow, the
   ceaseless anxieties of earthly life, and the intense longing for the
   peace and joy of heaven, should find a voice in song; and of this class
   is the lovely hymn of [135]Meyfart, professor of theology at Erfurt,
   who died in 1642,

   "[136]Jerusalem, thou city fair and high," [21]

   and so are several of the hymns of Simon Dach of Königsberg. [22] At
   Königsberg in those stormy days lived a little knot of friends who by
   no means escaped their share of trouble, but found solace under it in
   their religion, their mutual friendship, and the practice of music and
   poetry. The eldest of them was [137]George Weissel, pastor of one of
   the churches; and next to him was [138]Robert Roberthin. Then came
   [139]Simon Dach professor of poetry, and [140]Thilo professor of
   rhetoric in the university, and [141]Heinrich Albert the organist of
   the cathedral. All these men wrote hymns or sacred poems, and Dach and
   Albert also composed chorales.

  Heinrich Albert

   [142]Albert especially was a very distinguished musician, [organist of
   the cathedral at Königsberg,] and he was the author both of the words
   and the flowing melody of that morning hymn,

   "[143]God, who madest earth and heaven," [23]

   which is still not infrequently played at early morning in some of the
   quiet little German country towns or baths. He composed airs to many of
   Dach's poems, and thus helped much in their rapid diffusion among the
   people; and the little band of friends often assembled in a garden he
   had purchased outside Königsberg to hear some new poem or melody in the
   summer-house.

  Simon Dach

   [144]Dach was however the most gifted of the group, [He was professor
   of poetry in the university of Königsberg, and also composed chorales]
   and ranks high among German poets for the sweetness of form and depth
   of tender contemplative emotion to be found in his verse. A little
   love-song of his, written when courting the daughter of a neigbbouring
   clergyman, has become one of the best known of the German popular
   songs, and is familiar to English readers in Mr. Longfellow's version
   of "Annie of Tharau."

   Of his [145]hymns, many of which are to be found in all German
   hymn-books, we give the following, written during the long and painful
   illness which preceded his death:--

HEAVEN.

   5,7,5,7,5,5

   Schöner Himmelssaal

   [146]Simon Dach

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O ye halls of Heaven,

   Where the holy have their home,

   They whose hearts were riven,

   But through faith have overcome;

   They who here on earth

   Knew not joy or mirth:


   Thee I greet, fair Home,

   Thee o'er all things else I seek;

   For o'er earth I roam

   Desolate, and sad, and weak,

   Never free below

   From some cross or woe.


   Only for thy sake

   Have I strength not to despair,

   But my heart's long ache

   Willingly, nay gladly, bear;

   Sweet when I look up

   Grows my bitter cup.


   Did not my poor heart

   Cherish yearning hope for thee,

   Long ago its smart

   Had been all too sore for me;

   Never can my breast

   Find elsewhere a rest.


   God, Thou knowest well

   What the pain that hurts me sore,

   Where my thoughts must dwell,

   Grieving hourly o'er and o'er;

   Thou and I alone

   Hear that inner moan.


   But if I not yet

   Bear a pilgrim's chastened soul,

   If I could forget,--

   Let fresh trials o'er me roll;

   Thou, my God, wilt bear

   More than half my care.


   Let this life to me

   Ever grow more waste and drear,

   If that so to Thee

   I may cling more firm and near,

   And no dread of death

   Shake or chill my faith.


   Ah! in that fair place

   Shall I not drink deep of joy,

   When I see Thy face,

   When I meet Thy loving eye,

   When, like angels bright,

   I am clothed in light!


   O ye halls of Heaven,

   Where the holy have their home!

   Be the signal given,

   End my griefs and bid me come;

   All I long for is

   Soon to see thy bliss.

  Robert Roberthin

   [Robert Roberthin was a layman high in office under the Elector of
   Brandenburg, and able from his position occasionally to protect and
   assist his friends. He was also a personal friend of [147]Opitz, and
   was the first to introduce the new Silesian style of verse into the
   more barbarous Prussia.]

   Of [148]Roberthin we give a specimen of a different style, earnest and
   sensible, but more commonplace in expression and less fervent than
   [149]Dach.

MAY-TIME IN WAR.

   Der Meister ist ja lobenswerth


   Worthy of praise the Master-hand

   That hath created all,

   And Father-like, by sea and land,

   Where'er our eye can fall,

   Preserves and feeds His creatures here,

   And sends us once again

   The lovely flower-time of the year

   To gladden hill and plain.


   'Tis May that brings to every sense

   A joy so keen and fit,

   Her name can please when she is hence

   Whene'er we think of it.

   The loveliest month of all the year

   Is round us everywhere;

   The winds blow soft, the sun is clear,

   And sweet and pure the air.


   The plains are rich with many a hue,

   The forests with young shoots;

   Heaven's blessing seems to stream anew

   O'er earth and all her fruits.

   The nightingale pours forth her lays

   From every little wood,

   Doing her best to sing God's praise

   And tell us He is good.


   The bees fly forth in busy swarm,

   Their honey home to bring,

   The swallow builds its nest so warm,

   The lark begins to sing;

   No creature but can now be glad,

   Its heart's desire can still;

   Man only is distraught and sad

   Through his own darkened will;


   Man who can ne'er with firmness wait,

   Nor to one aim be true,

   But must embitter his own fate,

   And his own death pursue;

   Whose life at best so swiftly past,

   A short, uncertain day,

   Himself in deeper gloom must cast,

   Shut from God's quickening ray.


   How like a child his pride he feeds

   With Reason;--would he prove

   His boasted Reason by his deeds

   Of faith, and peace, and love!

   Or learn from God, the Only Wise,

   To rule his actions well;

   Then earth might be a Paradise,

   Man makes it now a hell.

  Johann von Rist

   The two most famous hymn-writers of this time were, however,
   [150]Johann von Rist and [151]Johann Heermann. Rist was born in 1607,
   the son of a pastor at a village close to Hamburg, and was destined
   from the first by his father to the study of theology. As a youth he
   was distinguished by precocious and varied talent; he visited several
   universities, including Leipsic, Utrecht, and Leyden, and studied
   mathematics, chemistry, and medicine, as well as divinity. Still quite
   a young man, he returned to Hamburg with the reputation of a great
   traveller, scholar, and poet, and was at once appointed to a church
   just outside Hamburg, on the banks of the Elbe. Here he spent the
   remainder of his life, at first pleasantly enough, but in the later
   years of the war suffering like others severely under its scarcity,
   terror, and pestilence. He was an active pastor and a great preacher,
   and insisted much on a certain strictness of life; for instance, he
   persuaded his people to abolish the customary merrymakings at
   Candlemas. Though he was a very strict Lutheran in doctrine, he was
   accused by some of the bigoted Lutherans of preaching too little
   against heresy and on controverted questions. His reply was "that he
   believed there were not above a couple of strangers in his congregation
   who held false doctrine, but plenty of people who led sinful lives; and
   to accuse men of heresy never produced a living, fruitful faith in
   them, only pride and impulses of hatred." But if he wisely did not
   preach controversy, he had no objection to print it, and he became
   involved in many very acrimonious disputes, theological and literary.
   He was in correspondence with all the principal clergymen and authors
   of his time, "so that scarce a day passed on which he did not receive a
   letter," then a matter of great wonderment. But he was most celebrated
   for his religious poems and hymns, of which he published ten
   collections, containing between 600 and 700 pieces, intended to supply
   every possible requirement of public worship or private experience.
   That in such a mass of writings on a limited range of subjects there
   should be a great deal that is very watery and poor was inevitable;
   many of his poems are evidently manufactured to order; others in the
   attempt to attain a little individuality sink into depths of bombast
   and bad taste; the wonder is rather that so many are really good, and
   some belong to the first rank of hymns. In his own day they were all
   admired: he was the most fertile, and next to [152]Opitz certainly the
   most favourite, poet of the time. Honours poured in upon him: he
   attained the highest titles in Church and State open to a clergyman,
   and received from the Emperor the crown of poet-laureate, and a patent
   of nobility. He founded a society of "Swans of the Elbe," of which he
   was the head, as a sort of offshoot of the great [153]Fruit-bearing
   Society, and by the members of this order, and indeed by many others of
   his contemporaries, he is lauded as the Northern Apollo, the Cimbrian
   Swan, the God of the German Parnassus; a certain little hill near his
   residence, where he was accustomed to write his verses, being the
   Parnassus in question. His first volume of poems, "The Poetical
   Pleasure Garden," was partly secular, but his after-productions were
   almost exclusively sacred, they were caught up eagerly by the musicians
   of the day, and quickly found their way into congregational use in
   Evangelical Germany, while even among the Roman Catholics they were
   read with delight, and one Empress lamented, "that it were a great pity
   if the writer of such [154]hymns should be sent to hell." He died at
   the age of sixty, in 1667.

   In his youth Rist is said to have suffered much from mental conflicts,
   and one or two of his penitential hymns speak of such experience; but
   his general tone is rather one of unhesitating faith and courage, and
   fervid love to the Saviour, such as breathe through his hymns for
   Advent, and for the Holy Communion, of which two,

   "[155]O Living Bread from heaven,"

   and another,

   "O Jesu, Sun of gladness,"

   are still in constant use. Another hymn which, partly from its noble
   and pathetic melody, has become a universal favourite, and the pattern
   on which many others have been written, is the [156]following one on
   the Entombment. Rist himself says that he found the first verse in a
   collection of religious popular songs, and liked it so much that he
   wrote the others to it.

EASTER EVE.

   4,4,7,7,7

   O Traurigkeit, O Herzeleid

   [157]Johann von Rist

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O darkest woe!

   Ye tears, forth flow!

   Has earth so sad a wonder?

   God the Father's only Son

   Now lies buried yonder.


   O son of man,

   It was the ban

   Of death on thee that brought Him

   Down to suffer for thy sins,

   And such woe hath wrought Him.


   Behold thy Lord,

   The Lamb of God,

   Blood-sprinkled lies before thee,

   Pouring out His life that He

   May to life restore thee.


   O Ground of faith,

   Laid low in death;

   Sweet lips now silent sleeping!

   Surely all that live must mourn

   Here with bitter weeping.


   Yea, blest is he

   Whose heart shall be

   Fixed here, who apprehendeth

   Why the Lord of Glory thus

   To the grave descendeth.


   O Jesu blest,

   My help and rest!

   With tears I pray, Lord hear me,

   Make me love Thee to the last,

   And in death be near me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As many hymns of Rist's are accessible to the English reader, we choose
   one that is less known, but that strongly illustrates his character.

THE TRUE JOY.

   8,6,8,6,8,8,6

   Gott sei gelobet der allein

   [158]Johann von Rist

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Now God be praised, and God alone!

   The Source of joy Thou art;

   Thy love no stint or bound hath known,

   But loves a happy heart,

   And sends full many a bright clear day

   To cheer us on our mortal way,

   Bids many a cloud depart.


   Yea, Lord, I thank Thy gracious power

   That hath bestowed on me

   A mind that lives from hour to hour

   From sad foreboding free;

   A mouth that Thou hast made so glad,

   It smiles when other lips are sad,

   And fails the trembling knee.


   But Thou so oft hast blessings shed,

   So oft bade sorrow cease,

   That I with joy can eat my bread,

   And lay me down in peace;

   In Thy hands only lies my health,

   'Tis Thou my honour and my wealth

   Canst lessen or increase.


   And so with joy I drink my cup,

   And all this heart of mine,

   O faithful God, to Thee looks up,

   And sings when Thou dost shine;

   With joy its daily task doth greet,

   And doth its utmost, as is meet--

   But, Lord, success is Thine.


   Then take not, Lord, this joy away,

   But let me cleave to Thee

   Let pining melancholy stay

   For ever far from me,

   Nor sadness make me slow to hear

   When Thou, O Lord, art drawing near,

   And my heart's guest wouldst be.


   Thy strength and solace let me prove,

   And bid my soul to know

   Who loveth Thee with childlike love,

   No trial, fear, or woe,

   Nor Satan's self can harm, nor death;

   A friend of God, a man of faith,

   Can conquer every foe.


   Mere earthly pleasure cannot please,

   It were not to my mind

   To live in proud, luxurious ease,

   And leave much gold behind;

   My highest aim, while here I dwell,

   Is to live piously and well,

   To Thy will all resigned.


   And ever do I take delight,

   My Maker, to behold

   Thy flowery earth, Thy sun's dear light,

   All things Thy hand doth mould,

   All living creatures that by field,

   Or flood, or air, Thy praises yield,

   Who formed them from of old.


   So grant me then in weal and woe

   Joyful and true to be;

   And when life's lamp is burning low

   And death at hand I see,

   Then let this joy pierce through its pain,

   And turn my very death to gain

   Of endless joys with Thee.

  Johann Heermann

   Born in 1585 at Rauten in Silesia, the youth and early manhood of
   [159]Johann Heermann fell in the comparatively quiet times that
   preceded the great war, when people still had leisure for tranquil
   intellectual enjoyments. Even at school the talent displayed in young
   Heermann's Latin orations, and the grace of his manner, attracted the
   notice of some of the great noble families of Silesia; and from one he
   received the means of travel, from another, on his return, the living
   of Köben. Here he had six peaceful years, "the Sabbath of his life;"
   happy in his work, his marriage, his friendship with the family of Von
   Kottwitz, and his literary labours, which were already rendering him
   distinguished as a writer of Latin poems and epigrams. But in 1617 his
   troubles began: first came the death of his wife; then the failure of
   his own health, which henceforward caused him great suffering
   throughout his life; and then the war.

   No part of Germany suffered more in the war than Silesia. It was the
   constant battle-field of the contending parties, and its peculiar
   position entailed on it a fearful amount of religious persecution. The
   [160]Hussite tendencies among its people, who were partly of Slavonic
   race, opened the way for the Reformation, which was very soon embraced
   by many of the great noble families, as well as generally by the towns.
   But Silesia belonged to the House of Austria, and hence its central
   government and higher ecclesiastics remained attached to Rome. For some
   time it was happy in princes and bishops who respected the toleration
   secured by the Peace of Passau; but in 1609 a king succeeded who was
   the bitter foe of all Protestants, and was warmly supported by Bishop
   Charles of Breslau, a brother of the Emperor. Hence whenever in the
   course of the war a district fell into the hands of the Imperialists,
   the pastors were immediately turned out of their churches, mass was
   celebrated, and the people were forced by the greatest oppression to
   accept Jesuit priests. When the Swedes came, the Jesuits would be
   dispossessed and the Evangelical pastors restored, to be again banished
   at the next reverse of fortune. Finally, after the war was over and
   Silesia was left in the hands of Austria, the Evangelical religion was
   almost entirely suppressed, only three towns being permitted to erect
   outside their walls one small wooden building for the performance of
   evangelical worship. It was during the years 1623 to 1638--fifteen long
   years!--that the sufferings of Silesia were at their height. More than
   once it was devastated by regiments of wild Poles and Cossacks under
   General Dohna, who was commissioned to re-introduce the Romanist
   religion. He boasted that he performed greater miracles than St. Peter;
   for St. Peter converted thousands by a sermon, but he converted
   thousands without a sermon. His method of proselytism was to quarter
   his soldiers on the principal Evangelical inhabitants of the place, and
   allow them to exercise what licence they pleased, until the father of
   the household produced a certificate from the priest of having been to
   confession; then they would be removed to some other house, where the
   same process was repeated. So great was the terror inspired by these
   troops, that in some places the residents came out to meet them with
   protestations of their readiness to embrace Romanism; in others the
   population emigrated en masse at their approach. During this period
   Köben was plundered four times, on each of which occasions Heermann
   lost all his moveable possessions; he was frequently in danger of his
   life; was several times obliged to flee, and once had to remain a
   fugitive in concealment for seventeen weeks. But it was in the midst of
   all these troubles that he published, in 1630, his "Devoti Musica
   Cordis," a volume of original hymns which at once made a profound
   impression, and which was soon followed by two more. These [161]hymns
   were the first in which the correct and elegant versification of
   [162]Opitz was applied to religious subjects, but they possessed far
   higher merits than this; they are distinguished by great depth and
   tenderness of feeling, by an intense love of the Saviour, and earnest
   but not self-conscious humility, while in form they are sweet and
   musical, though the thought sometimes is too much expanded. A
   remarkably large number have made for themselves a permanent place in
   the hymnology of the German Church, and several of the most beautiful
   among them are becoming known in England through translations,
   especially those on the Passion. We give here two that touchingly refer
   to the sorrows of his country and church:--

A SONG OF TEARS.

   11,11,10,4

   Herr unser Gott, lass nicht zu Schanden werden

   [163]Johann Heermann

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Ah! Lord our God, let them not be confounded

   Who, though by want, and woe, and pain surrounded,

   Yet day and night still hope Thy help to see,

   And cry to Thee.


   But put to shame Thy foes, who breathe defiance,

   And make their own vain might their sole reliance,

   And turn, oh turn to those who trust Thy Word:

   Have pity, Lord!


   Against our foes some succour quickly send us;

   If Thou but speak the word they shall not end us,

   But change to friends, lay down their useless arms,

   And cease all harms.


   We stand bereft of help, and poor and lonely,

   'Twere vain to trust in man,--with Thee, Lord, only

   We yet may dare great deeds whoe'er oppose,

   And quell our foes.


   Thou art our Champion who canst overthrow them,

   And save the little flock now crushed below them,

   We trust in Thee; Helper, Thy help we claim

   In Jesu's name! Amen.

A SONG OF COMFORT.

   8,7,8,7,7,7,7,7

   Zion klagt mit Angst und Schmerzen

   [164]Johann Heermann

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Zion mourns in fear and anguish,

   Zion, city of our God:

   "Ah," she saith, "how sore I languish,

   Bowed beneath how hard a load;

   God hath sure forsook me quite,

   And forgot my evil plight;"--

   Nay, he chose thee, and thou art

   Safely borne within His heart.


   "Once," she mourns, "He promised plainly

   That His help should aye be near,

   Yet I now must seek Him vainly

   In my days of woe and fear.

   Will he then for evermore

   Keep His anger, and no more

   Look with pity on the poor,

   And behold what they endure?"


   "Zion, surely I have loved thee,"

   Thus to her the Highest saith,

   True, that many woes have proved thee,

   And thy soul is sad to death,

   Yet now cast thy griefs behind;

   Where wilt thou a mother find

   For her babe will not provide,

   Or can hate it, though she chide?


   "Nay, and couldst thou find a mother

   Who forgot her infant's claim,

   Or whose wrath her love could smother,

   Yet would I be still the same;

   For my truth is pledged to thee,

   Zion, thou art dear to me,

   Thou within my heart art set,

   And I never can forget.


   "Let not Satan make thee craven,

   He can fright but cannot harm,

   On My hands thy name is graven,

   And thy shield is still My arm.

   How then could it other be

   Than that I must think of thee,

   And must build again thy walls,

   And be true whate'er befalls?


   "Thou before my eyes art ever,

   In my bosom thou art laid

   As a nursing child, and never

   Shalt thou lack My timely aid.

   Thee and Me no time nor stress,

   War, nor danger, nor distress,

   No, nor Satan's self can part,--

   Only be thou strong of heart."
     __________________________________________________________________

   In 1638 [165]Heermann's health became so much worse that he was obliged
   to relinquish his charge at Köben altogether, and the last nine years
   of his life were spent in extreme distress from an affection resembling
   incessant catarrh and low fever of a very severe character. But he had
   a kind nurse in his second wife; whenever he rallied, study and writing
   were his recreations, and he published successively a number of
   devotional works. Another severe trial befell him during this period of
   sickness: his eldest son, a young man of much promise, fell under the
   influence of the Jesuits at Breslau, and was on the point of openly
   joining the Roman Catholic Church. The remonstrances and arguments of
   his father, however, recalled him to the evangelical faith in which he
   had been brought up; but his health gave way, and he died in 1643 of a
   slow fever, which was commonly supposed to be the effect of a powder
   given him by the Jesuits when he quitted them. At last, in 1647,
   Heermann himself died, after many weeks of the greatest prostration,
   which he bore with unwearied patience. It was in the course of this
   last illness that he wrote a large number of verses and short poems,
   from which we choose the following "Sighs" and "Lament," as he himself
   calls them:--
     __________________________________________________________________

IN DISTRESS OF MIND.

   Jesu, der du bist, mein Heil


   Jesu, Saviour, since that Thou

   Camest once from heaven,

   Come, oh come to aid me now,

   For I long have striven.

   Fear and pain assail me sore,

   I can bear and do no more;

   Save me from this bitterness

   Ere it slay me with distress.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Du süsser Jesu Christ

   [166]Johann Heermann


   "Thou loving Jesu Christ, who once as man wast born,

   I too am but a man, ah! leave me not forlorn;

   Fear hath overwhelmed my soul: O help me! Saviour, save!

   I sink, as sinks a ship beneath the engulphing wave."
     __________________________________________________________________

IN BODILY PAIN.

   Jesu der du tausend Schmerzen

   [167]Johann Heermann


   Jesu, who didst stoop to prove

   Many a thousand pains for me,

   When that heart so rich in love

   Bare our sins upon the tree,

   Ah! by all those woes of Thine,

   Soothe, oh soothe these pains of mine!


   Help, O Helper! Thou alone,

   None but Thou, canst still this pain,

   Hearken pitying to my moan,

   Look on me in love again;

   Praises from my lips shall flow

   If Thou now Thy grace wilt show!
     __________________________________________________________________

IN TEMPTATION.

   Jesu, Tilger meiner Süden.

   [168]Johann Heermann


   Jesu, Victor over sin,

   Help me now the fight to win.

   Thou didst vanquish once, I know,

   Him who seeks my overthrow;

   So to Thee my faith will cleave,

   And her hold will never leave,

   Till the weary battle's done

   And the final triumph won;

   For I too through Thee may win,

   Victor over death and sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

AT THE APPROACH OF DEATH.

   Der Tod klopft an bei mir, dass

   [169]Johann Heermann


   That Death is at my door, too well this anguish shows,

   Yet I will fear him not.   I bear Thee in my heart,

   Thou, O Lord Jesu Christ, with me, nay, in me, art,

   And if I die, Thou wilt the gates of heaven unclose.


   Why was Thy glorious form so marred, so sadly torn?

   Only that I with Thee may know the depths of joy

   Throughout etemity.   Thou dying didst destroy

   The sting of Death, and make our foe an empty scorn.


   Ah then forsake me not! Hast Thou not cleansed me

   From all the filth of sin wherewith I was defiled

   By th' arch-deceiver's arts?   Then let me as a child

   Now fall asleep in peace, and wake in joy with Thee.

CHAPTER IX.
PAUL GERHARDT AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES.
A.D. 1620-1680.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Paul Gerhardt

   As the seventeenth century passed on to its zenith, the promise of
   literary activity given by its earlier years was not fulfilled.
   [170]Opitz, [171]Flemming, and [172]Gryphius were certainly not stars
   of the first magnitude, but at least they shone with a certain steady
   radiance as the brightest points among a luminous cloud of smaller
   writers; but as they one by one went out no others took their place.
   Yet it was just at this time that the religious song of Germany found
   its purest and sweetest expression in the hymns of [173]Paul Gerhardt,
   who may be said to be the typical poet of the Lutheran Church, as
   Herbert is of the English. George Herbert's poems are meant to be read
   and meditated upon; they constantly remind us that the writer was a man
   of high breeding and culture, no less than an earnest Christian;
   Gerhardt's are intended to be set to music and sung in church, or
   learnt by heart by the children at home, and as constantly reveal the
   homeliness and simplicity, the deeply devout and quietly courageous
   spirit of the Lutheran pastor. Of his early life little is known. He
   was born in 1606, in a little town, Gräfinhainichen, in Saxony, where
   his father was burgomaster. The whole of his youth and early manhood
   fell in the time of war. That it must have been a period full of
   disappointment and hope deferred for him, is clear enough when we find
   a man of his powers at the age of forty-five still only a private tutor
   and candidate for holy orders. In 1651 he was living in this capacity
   in the family of an advocate named Berthold, in Berlin. He had already
   written many hymns, but was as yet unable to publish them; and he was
   in love with Berthold's daughter, but had no living to marry upon.
   About the close of that year however, the living of a country place
   called Mittenwalde was offered him: he was ordained, and in 1655 he at
   last married Anna Maria Berthold. At Mittenwalde he passed six quiet
   years, during which he began to publish his hymns, which immediately
   attracted great attention, and were quickly adopted into the hymn-books
   of Brandenburg and Saxony. His name thus became known, and in 1657 he
   was invited to the great church of St. Nicholas, in Berlin, where his
   life was soon both a busy and an honourable one. He worked most
   assiduously and successfully in his pastoral duties; he brought out
   many hymns, which were caught up by the people much as Luther's had
   been of old; and he was the favourite preacher of the city, whom crowds
   flocked to hear. He is described to us as a man of middle height, of
   quiet but firm and cheerful bearing; while his preaching is said to
   have been very earnest and persuasive, and full of Christian love and
   charity, which he practised as well as preached by never turning a
   beggar from his doors, and receiving widows and orphans who needed help
   and shelter into his own house. His religion and his temperament alike
   made him cheerful, and not all the many disappointments of his life
   seem ever to have embittered his mood; but he had a very tender and
   scrupulous conscience, and wherever a question of conscience seemed to
   him to be involved, he was liable to great mental conflict and an
   exaggerated estimate of trifles. In theology he was an ardent Lutheran,
   and ere long his zeal for his Church was put to the test.

   Prussia was at that time governed by Frederick William I., "the Great
   Elector," whose memory is still revered in the country as the founder
   of its greatness. The mass of his people were Lutherans, but he himself
   belonged to the Reformed Church, to which his grandfather, the Elector
   Sigismund, had seceded from political motives. At the Peace of
   Westphalia, he was the one important German prince who acted as
   spokesman for the Calvinistic churches, and it was through his efforts
   they obtained the same legal recognition as the Lutherans. His next
   endeavour was to make peace between the two Churches within his own
   dominions. He saw clearly enough the waste of strength and the evil
   passions caused by their disunion and perpetual controversies, and he
   is not accused of any unjust bias or partiality towards his own Church,
   but the times were not then ripe for such an attempt, and he met with
   little success. In 1662 and 1663 he summoned the leading men of both
   Churches to a series of conferences on the points of dispute between
   them, in the hopes of thus arriving at some approximation of opinion,
   or at least at a declaration that the points of difference were
   "non-essential." But the result was the precise reverse of the
   Elector's hopes; the more the doctors argued the farther apart they
   found themselves. The Calvinism of those days was not of the modified
   type to which we are accustomed, but advocated what would now be termed
   "extreme views," while the Lutherans, on the other hand, were very
   rigid in their own definitions of doctrine, and were in the habit of
   preaching against the Reformed Church with a scornful and bitter
   vehemence. Gerhardt, indeed, was not among those who did so; his
   sermons, as well as his writings, were so free from controversy that
   many Calvinists attended his services, and his hymns had no greater
   admirer than the pious [174]Electress Louisa, who herself belonged to
   the Reformed Church. But the whole cast of his thought was
   intrinsically anti-Calvinistic: that God is a loving Father over all
   His creatures, and that Christ died for all men, are the deepest,
   ever-recurring tones of his theology; and hence he found it impossible
   to allow that the points of difference between himself and the Reformed
   Church were "non-essential." From the conferences he at first hoped a
   great deal; he was diligent in attending them, and drew up most of the
   statements in explanation or defence of doctrine on the Lutheran side.
   But the Elector, wearied by the ill-success of these meetings, put a
   stop to them in 1664, and published an edict requiring the ministers of
   both communions to abstain from attacking each other's doctrines in the
   pulpit or elsewhere with harshness or want of charity; and in 1665 he
   announced his intention of demanding from every beneficed Lutheran
   clergyman his subscription to a document pledging himself to observe
   the terms of this edict. This demand at once created the greatest
   excitement throughout the country, and in many places caused
   disturbances; for the stricter Lutherans, priests and people alike,
   regarded it as prohibiting the use of one of the recognised standards
   of the Lutheran faith, the "Formula Concordia," in which the doctrines
   of the Reformed Church were condemned in strong terms, and considered
   it therefore to be an infringement on their legal rights, and an
   unwarrantable interference on the part of the civil power with the
   liberty of preaching. Accordingly a great number of the clergy refused
   to sign, and were deposed; and these were in general strongly supported
   by their flocks. Nearly the whole of the Berlin clergy took this part,
   and one of the most resolute among them was Paul Gerhardt, who being
   very ill at the time, assembled his brethren around his sick-bed, and
   entreated them to be steadfast in asserting their right to freedom of
   speech. Such a man's refusal could not be passed over, and early in
   1666 he was deprived of his appointment; and when it appeared that many
   of his congregation were in the habit of resorting to his private house
   for religious counsel and worship, he was interdicted from performing
   any function of his office even in private. Of his deprivation he had
   said to some condoling friends "that it was but a small Berlin sort of
   martyrdom;" but this last prohibition wounded him deeply, and he had
   much private sorrow at the same time. Three of his five children had
   already died in infancy, and now he lost one of his two remaining sons,
   the child on whose death he wrote his touching hymn,

   "[175]Thou'rt mine, yes, still Thou art mine own,"

   while his wife, worn out by sorrow and anxiety, fell into a long and
   slow decline. Many of his most beautiful [176]hymns were written at
   this time, and among others,

   "[177]If God be on my side."

   Meanwhile the city of Berlin did not take the loss of its favourite
   preacher quietly. Meetings were held and petitions addressed to the
   Elector--first by the burghers and guilds of trade, then by the Town
   Council, and finally by the Estates of Brandenburg, whose entreaty was
   said to have the support in private of the Electress herself. Then the
   Elector gave way, and declared that considering the tender conscience
   of the preacher Paul Gerhardt, and that he had never been guilty of
   bitterness and uncharitableness in the pulpit, an exception should be
   made in his case, and he should be permitted to resume his office
   without subscription. The whole city was rejoiced, but now a new
   difficulty arose. The Elector had sent word by one of his secretaries
   to Paul Gerhardt of his re-appointment, but had said also that he
   relied on Gerhardt's well-known moderation and loyalty, that even
   without subscription he would act in conformity with the spirit of the
   edict. This message perplexed Gerhardt's conscience once more; an
   implied undertaking was, he said, to a Christian man as binding as any
   subscription could be, and he therefore felt himself still unable to
   accept office on these terms. A long period of fruitless negotiations
   ensued, and much mental distress on Gerhardt's part; for these new
   scruples appeared even to many of his friends exaggerated. But how real
   they were to himself, is shown by his persistency, and his letters to
   the Town Council and Elector. "It was only the most urgent necessity,"
   he writes to the latter, "which induced me to retire from my pastoral
   office, and should I now accept it again on these terms, I should do
   myself a great wrong; and, so to speak, with my own hands inflict on my
   soul that wound which I had formerly, with such deep anguish of heart,
   striven to avert. I fear that God, in whose presence I walk on earth,
   and before whose judgment-seat I must one day appear; and as my
   conscience hath spoken from my youth up, and yet speaks, I can see it
   no otherwise than that if I should accept my office I should draw on
   myself God's wrath and punishment." The Elector now commanded the
   Council to choose some one in Gerhardt's place; and Gerhardt accepted
   the post of Archdeacon of Lübben, in Saxony. His removal there was,
   however, delayed by the long sickness and death of his wife; and it was
   not till 1669 that he entered on his new duties. Here he spent the last
   seven years of his life; but they were years of sadness, for his wife
   was gone, his only child had more than one dangerous illness, and he
   was living in a land of strangers. Lübben was a small place, and the
   Town Council was composed of rough and half-educated people, who
   subjected their clergyman to many annoyances. His refuge and
   refreshment was in his gift of song, "under circumstances which," says
   one of his contemporaries, "would have made most men cry rather than
   sing." He died in 1676, in his seventieth year, and his last words were
   a line from one of his own hymns--

   [178]"Us no death has power to kill."

   Compared with most authors of his time, Paul Gerhardt wrote but little.
   He composed altogether one hundred and twenty-three hymns, which
   appeared at intervals from the year 1649 onwards, many of them for the
   first time in the "Praxis Pietatis Melica," a collection of hymns and
   tunes by Johann Crüger, the famous organist and composer of chorales.
   After Gerhardt's death they were republished separately, revised from
   his own MSS. by his son. As a poet he undoubtedly holds the highest
   place among the hymn-writers of Germany. His hymns seem to be the
   spontaneous outpouring of a heart that overflows with love, trust, and
   praise; his language is simple and pure; if it has sometimes a touch of
   homeliness, it has no vulgarism, [24] and at times it rises to a beauty
   and grace, which always give the impression of being unstudied, yet
   could hardly have been improved by art. His tenderness and fervour
   never degenerate into the sentimentality and petty conceits which were
   already becoming fashionable in his days; nor his penitence and sorrow
   into that morbid despondency which we find in Gryphius, and for which
   the disappointments of his own life might have furnished some excuse.
   If he is not altogether free from the long-windedness and repetition
   which are the besetting sins of so many German writers, and especially
   hymn-writers, he at least more rarely succumbs to them: and in his days
   they were not considered a blemish. One of his contemporaries, a
   certain Andreas Bucholz, who wrote a great deal of religious poetry
   which was then highly esteemed formally announces in his preface that
   he has spun out his poems as long as he could, for he observed that
   when people were reading sacred poems at home, they preferred long
   ones. Gervinus, a severe judge of sacred poetry in general, says of
   Gerhardt: "If one man among the poets of the seventeenth century makes
   an attractive impression on us, it is Gerhardt. He recurred, as no one
   else had done, to [179]Luther's genuine type of the popular religious
   song, only with such modifications as the altered circumstances
   demanded. In Luther's time the old wrathful, implacable God of the
   Romanists had assumed the heavenly aspect of grace and compassion; with
   Gerhardt the Merciful and just One is a loving and benignant Man, whom
   he addresses with reverential intimacy. With Luther, it was the belief
   in free grace and the work of Atonement, in the Redemption which had
   burst the gates of hell, which inspired the Christian singer with his
   joyous confidence; with Gerhardt it is his faith in the love of God.
   Like the old poets of the people, he is pious, naive, earnest, without
   effort or affectation; his style is as simple as refreshing, and
   attractive as his tone of thought."

   Many of his [180]hymns are already well known to English readers by
   translations from the time of Wesley downwards. We give here three of
   those less frequently to be met with: [25] --

THE HOPE OF THE CONTRITE.

   Weg mein Herz mit dem Gedanken

   [181]Paul Gerhardt

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Hence, my heart, with such a thought

   As that thou art cast away!

   Is not God's Word promise-fraught?

   Heed not then what others say.

   Art thou evil and unjust?

   God is good, be He Thy trust.

   Art thou death-struck, sin-defiled?

   Faint not, God is reconciled.


   Thou art sick, like other men,

   Of that sore disease within,

   That began with Adam, when

   First he learned to yield to sin.

   But despair not, God can cure,

   Only make repentance sure;

   Fear not that thy prayers and cries,

   Even thine, He will despise.


   His no bear's or lion's heart,

   Only thirsting after blood;

   His compassions swiftly start,

   He but seeks thy highest good.

   In thy Father's heart believe;

   O'er our griefs He too doth grieve,

   Is afflicted in our woe,

   Sorrow for our death doth know.


   "As I live," He surely saith,

   "I would have the sinner turn,

   Never do I will his death,

   But that he should yield, and learn

   'Tis my joy whene'er a child

   Back is won from wanderings wild,

   Of My flock I would not spare

   E'en the least and lowest there."


   Ah! no shepherd e'er, as He,

   Watched for every sheep that errs!

   If His heart thou couldst but see,

   How with sorrowing love it stirs,

   How it thirsts and aches and yearns

   Over one who heedless turns,

   And from God and good doth rove,--

   Thou must weep for very love.


   For God loves not only those

   Who are safe within His fold;

   Nay, He loves His very foes,

   Whom that Enemy of old

   Hath seduced with lies too well,

   Till weak man hath dared rebel

   Against Him, whose lightest word

   Through the universe is heard.


   Yet God seeks them by His care,

   And through all the hosts of heaven

   Joy grows brighter even there,

   When the bonds of sin are riven;

   Then God's pardon covers o'er

   All the evil done before,

   Every dark and sinful spot,

   All is buried and forgot.


   For no ocean's mighty force,

   And no fathomless abyss,

   And no stream's resistless course,

   Match a love so vast as His;

   Nought are they to what He pours

   Daily through this life of ours,

   That with sin we daily fill

   Striving with His perfect will.


   Rest, O heart, then, be content!

   Why shouldst thou go mourning on?

   Why thy strength in toil be spent?

   More than thou canst need is won.

   Though thy guilt may seem to thee

   Deep and mighty as the sea,

   'Tis to God and to His love

   What a finger's strength might move.


   Open, O my God, the gates

   Whence such tender mercies flow;

   Here my heart with longing waits,

   Let me all Thy sweetness know,

   Everywhere and every hour

   Own Thy love's constraining power;

   And this one thing I implore,

   Never let me grieve Thee more!

THE TRUST OF THE TRIED.

   8,6,8,6

   Ich hab' ergeben Herz und Sinn

   [182]Paul Gerhardt

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   To God's all-gracious heart and mind

   My heart and mind I yield;

   In seeming loss my gain I find,

   In death, life stands revealed.

   I am His own whose glorious throne

   In highest heaven is set;

   Beneath His stroke or sorrow's yoke

   His heart upholds me yet.


   There is but one thing cannot fail,

   That is my Father's love;

   A sea of troubles may assail

   My soul,--'tis but to prove

   And train my mind, by warnings kind,

   To love the Good through pain;

   When firm I stand, full soon His hand

   Can raise me up again.


   Yet oft we think, is aught withdrawn

   That flesh and blood desire,

   Our joy is lost, o'ercast our dawn,

   And faith and courage tire;

   With toil and care our hearts we wear,

   O'er our lost hope we brood;

   Nor think that all that doth befall

   Is meant to work our good.


   But where God rules it must be so,

   It must bring joy again;

   What now we deem but cross and woe

   Shall turn to comfort then.

   Have patience still, His gracious will

   Through thickest clouds shall gleam;

   Then torturing fears, and hopeless tears,

   Shall vanish like a dream.


   The field can never bear its fruits,

   Save winter storm and freeze;

   Man's goodness withers at its roots

   In days of constant ease;

   The bitter draught of aloes quaffed,

   Health tints the cheeks once more;

   So to our heart can sorrow's smart

   New energy restore.


   Then, O my God, with joy I cast

   My load of care on Thee;

   Take me, and while this life shall last

   Do as Thou wilt with me.

   Send weal or woe, as Thou shalt know

   Will teach me their true worth,

   And fit me best to stand their test,

   And show Thy glory forth.


   If happy sunshine be Thy gift,

   With joy I take it, Lord;

   If o'er dark stormy seas I drift,

   I hear Thy guiding word;

   If lengthened life, with blessings rife,

   Before my feet be spread,

   So Thou my Guide wilt still abide,

   With joy that path I tread.


   But must I walk the vale of death

   Through sad and sunless ways,

   I pass along in quiet faith,

   Thy glance my fear allays;

   Through the dark land my Shepherd's hand

   Leads to an end so bright,

   That I shall there with praise declare

   That all God's ways are right!

THE MARRIAGE OF CHRISTIAN HEARTS.

   7,7,7,7,7,7

   Voller Wunder, voller kunst

   [183]Paul Gerhardt

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Full of wonder, full of art,

   Full of wisdom, full of power,

   Full of grace to charm the heart,

   Full of solace hour by hour,

   Full of wonders, ye shall prove

   Is the bond of wedded love.


   Two who ne'er upon this earth

   Have each other's faces seen,

   Never from their hour of birth

   In each other's thoughts have been,

   Find their hearts and hands shall meet

   In a bond God maketh sweet.


   Here a father trains his child,

   There another watches his:

   Driven by winds uncertain, wild,

   Sure their paths through life must miss;

   Nay, but when the time is there,

   See a well-consorted pair.


   Here a prudent son has grown,

   There a maid in virtue drest;

   Each one is the other's crown,

   Each the other's sweetest rest,

   Each the other's joy and light,

   But they know it not aright;


   Till it pleaseth Him who holds

   All the world within His hand,

   Then the fated hour unfolds

   All the joy that He hath planned,

   And in act and deed we see

   The long-hidden mystery.


   Each one finds and each one takes

   What the Highest for him chose;

   For where Heaven the union makes

   Vainly Earth would interpose;

   And what Heaven hath bid befall

   Wisely is ordained for all.


   "This or that were otherwise

   Better ordered," oft we say;

   But as darkness fondly tries

   E'er to match the glorious day,

   So must fail our human sense

   Scanning God's omnipotence.


   Where He joins, Man, place no bar!

   Well He knows who best should meet;

   All our schemes blind errors mar,

   His thought only is complete;

   Only His work standeth fast,

   When nought else endures the blast.


   See the children of His love

   Who in holy marriage dwell,

   In what tranquil joy they move,

   How their Father prospers well

   All their work to happy ends,

   And His blessing daily sends:


   How their love ne'er fades away,

   But in freshest beauty blooms,

   When all other loves decay,

   Other light is lost in glooms,

   Other truth no more is true,

   Still their constancy is new.


   For that love hath hidden springs,

   Where its youth is aye renewed;

   Through their daily talk it sings,

   Sweetens all their daily food,

   Gives their hearts a quiet rest,

   E'en when toil and care-opprest.


   Comes there aught of pain and loss,

   Yet this love is calm and still,

   Cheerfully accepts the cross,

   Thinks it is our Father's will,

   Trusts the future time will bring

   Brighter days upon its wing.


   Thus through all their lifetime rolls

   God's rich blessing like a stream,

   Feeds their bodies, heals their souls,

   Strengthens every prop and beam,

   Makes the house once poor and small,

   Rich and great and loved by all.


   And at last, when all fulfilled

   Are His purposes of love

   Here on earth, He yet doth build

   Fairer homes in heaven above,

   Where enwrapt in His embrace

   They shall know His depths of grace.


   Full of grace to charm the heart,

   Full of solace hour by hour,

   Full of wonder, full of art,

   Full of wisdom, full of power,

   Full of wonders, ye shall prove,

   Is the bond of wedded love.

  Electress Louisa

   Among the admirers of [184]Paul Gerhardt we have named the wife of the
   Great Elector, [185]Louisa Henrietta of Brandenburg. This princess, who
   was herself a hymn-writer of no mean ability, shines out upon us from
   among the confused and tragic scenes of that seventeenth century, as
   almost the ideal of a noble Christian lady. She was the daughter of the
   Prince of Orange, and grand-daughter on her mother's side of the
   Admiral Coligny who fell in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. Her
   mother, herself a woman of unusual intelligence and piety, educated her
   with the greatest care; at her wish the princess was instructed in
   graver studies than were common with the women of those days, and also
   in practical household management, and all kinds of feminine
   handicrafts. She grew up tall, fair-haired, and graceful, and at
   nineteen was married, at the Hague, to the Elector of Brandenburg. As
   her father was then very ill with a protracted and fatal malady, she
   did not however at once leave home, but nursed her father till his
   death, and then awaited the birth of her first child. In 1649 she set
   out on her way to Berlin in late autumn weather, and through a country
   devastated by war and famine. Under the hardships of the journey her
   own health suffered, and her little son sickened; and when she arrived
   in Berlin, it was not to bring her husband and people an heir to the
   throne, but with empty arms and an aching heart, for the poor infant
   had died by the way. But she found consolation in the devoted
   attachment of her husband; he could not bear to be separated from her,
   and it soon became her custom to accompany him in all the numerous
   journeys he was constantly making, even in more than one winter
   campaign against the Swedes and Poles. He consulted her on all affairs
   of state, and she entered warmly into his plans for restoring
   prosperity to the land which had suffered so much from war. She sent to
   Holland for skilful agriculturists, and established model farms in
   various parts of Prussia; she introduced the culture of the potato,
   which was before unknown there; and she founded primary schools all
   over the country, where they had been almost entirely swept away. So
   deep was the gratitude she won from the common people that the name
   "Louisa" became the favourite name for girls, and as lately as thirty
   or forty years ago her portrait was still to be found on cottage walls.
   When at home her favourite residence was her country house Oranienburg,
   near Berlin. She had neither inclination nor time for gaiety, beyond
   what her position required; for, besides all these serious occupations,
   she took part in works of charity, and was strict in the performance of
   her religious duties. She was always present at divine service, where
   she appeared in a very simple dress, and made it a rule never to look
   in her mirror before going to church. In religion she belonged to the
   Reformed Church, but she was in the habit of friendly intercourse with
   Lutherans, and earnestly desired to see peace between the two
   communions. But one source of sorrow weighed secretly on the princess's
   heart: she had no second child; and if the Elector had no son, his race
   became extinct, and at his death a war of succession might be
   apprehended. Long she brooded over this grief; at last she resolved to
   make the greatest sacrifice in her power, and to demand a divorce for
   the sake of the country. She acknowledged afterwards that she found it
   very hard to come to this resolution, and it cost her many hours of
   tears and prayers, but it was done; she appeared before the Elector,
   and formally announced to him her intention of applying for a divorce,
   that might enable him for the sake of his people to marry again. But
   the Elector refused to listen to her proposal; had she forgotten the
   command that man should not sever what God had joined? If it pleased
   God to punish them and their country by childlessness, let them submit;
   but never would he consent to break an oath he had sworn in God's
   sight. No doubt it was with a lightened heart that she went back to
   Oranienburg, where a few months of tranquillity so far restored her
   health, that at length her wishes were fulfilled, and she bore another
   son. He was born on a Tuesday; and in memory of this great blessing she
   kept every Tuesday with its own religious observances for the rest of
   her life, and also founded an orphan-house at Oranienburg for
   fatherless children. Two more sons followed in due time, one of whom
   became afterwards the first king of Prussia. The last of the three was
   born in 1666 at Cleves, and then her health failed, worn out by the
   great exertions which her life had demanded, and she died, after many
   months of slow decline, in 1667, at the age of thirty-nine.

   One of her last acts is said to have been to induce the Elector to give
   up his demand on the Lutheran clergy, and to grant them freedom from
   the obnoxious subscription, an act [26] which put an end to the
   discontent and resistance to the government then so widely spread.
   Among her favourite recreations, especially in times of toil and
   anxiety, was the reading and singing of hymns, and at her request Otto
   von Schwerin, the great friend of herself and her husband, made a
   collection of them which was afterwards published and widely
   circulated. To this he contributed one or two, and the Electress four
   hymns, two of which have become classical in Germany; one is the
   celebrated Easter hymn,

   "[186]Jesus, my Redeemer lives," [27]

   which, with its beautiful [187]chorale, is now in various versions
   becoming familiar to us in England. It is probable that the Electress
   composed both the words and the melody of this hymn, but that Schwerin
   polished the former and Crüger harmonized the latter for her. To this
   day it ranks among the most popular of German hymns. We give another as
   being less known, which contains an affecting expression of the
   consciousness of sin and ingratitude in a life, in which those around
   her could scarce discern a failing.

PENITENCE.

   8,6,8,6,8,8,6

   Ich will von meiner Missethat

   [188]Louisa Henrietta, Electress of Brandenburg

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   I will return unto the Lord

   From all my evil ways;

   O God, do Thou Thy help afford,

   Teach me to seek Thy face,

   Thy Holy Spirit's strength impart

   Who can anew create my heart,

   Deny me not this grace.


   For man sees not his wretched plight

   Till Thy touch make him see;

   Without Thy Spirit's inner light

   All blind and dead is he,

   Biassed in sense and will and deed;

   O Father, let me now be freed

   From this great misery!


   Lord, knock in mercy at my door,

   And all that I have done

   Against Thee, do Thou set before

   This heart, till it is won

   To mourn that it was e'er so weak,

   And in my grief adown this cheek

   Hot tears of sorrow run.


   For of thy gifts, ah! what a wealth

   Hast Thou on me bestowed;

   To Thee I owe my life and health,

   My cup hath overflowed;

   Than food and raiment Thou dost grant

   So much besides, that no real want

   Hath darkened my abode.


   And Thou in Christ hast rescued me

   From out of death's dark flood,

   Thou dost not leave my soul to be

   In lack of any good;

   And lest I dwell in careless ease,

   Forgetting Him who gave me these,

   Betimes I feel Thy rod.


   Have I then striven as sure I ought,

   To love Thee and obey?

   Ah no! this heart and conscience fraught

   With grief, full truly say

   I have forgot Thee, and they mourn

   With deep remorse and anguish torn

   For Sin's long easy sway.


   Till now in false security

   My conscience slept, and said,

   "There yet is time enough for thee;

   God is not stern," it said;

   "So strict account He doth not keep,

   The Shepherd's patience with His sheep

   Not soon is spent and fled."


   But suddenly that sleep was broke,

   And now my heart will break;

   Thy voice in mighty thunders spoke,

   Thy lightnings made me quake;

   I see the realms of death and hell

   Advance in power I cannot quell

   My soul their prey to make.


   Ah Jesu Christ! our mighty Rock,

   I flee alone to Thee,

   Within Thy clefts from every shock

   O hide and shelter me!

   O Lamb of God, didst Thou not bear

   All sins of men and e'en my share

   Upon the fatal tree?


   Then with Thy Father intercede,

   That He no more should think

   Of all my sins, each evil deed

   That makes me quail and shrink.

   Ah let the burden of my guilt,

   For which such precious blood was spilt,

   Beneath the ocean sink!


   And henceforth will I day by day,

   With strenuous ceaseless care,

   From all false pleasures turn away,

   And rather all things bear

   Than willingly to sin give place:

   Dear Lord, give Thou Thy strength and grace

   To do as I declare!

  George Neumarck

   The Court of Prussia was not the only one at which religious poetry was
   cultivated. At that of Weimar, the [189]duke who had been a famous
   general in the Thirty Years' War was a good hymn-writer, and so was his
   librarian, [190]George Neumarck, the author of one of the best known
   and finest of the German hymns, "[191]Leave God to order all thy ways."

  Anton Ulrich

   At that of Brunswick not only the Duke, [192]Anton Ulrich, but nearly
   all the members of his family cultivated both poetry and music with
   considerable success. Anton Ulrich himself was a very learned man,
   pupil of two of the most distinguished scholars of the day, and a good
   and pious sovereign. The stain on his career is that in extreme old age
   he embraced the Roman Catholic religion avowedly from political
   motives, and then again reverted to Lutheranism on his death-bed; but
   except for this inconsistency he deserved and enjoyed the esteem of his
   people. His [193]hymns are extremely good, graceful in form, and deep
   in feeling, and have become very well known. The following little song
   is among those less commonly to be met with:--
     __________________________________________________________________

PATIENCE AND HUMILITY.

   Wer Geduld und Demuth liebet

   [194]Anton Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick.


   Patience and Humility!

   Where these two companions be,

   On their lover they bestow

   Quiet calm through weal and woe.


   He unmoved meets Fortune's frown,

   Sees her wheel go up and down,

   Ready stands to face alike

   Or her smiles or her dislike.


   If she frown like blackest night,

   Threatening to o'erwhelm him quite,

   Patience still will stand his friend,

   Bidding him await the end.


   If she smile and all restore,

   And he grow elate once more,

   Safe through snares of wealth and pride

   Soft Humility can glide.


   If his plans and wishes fail,

   Nor his best-laid schemes avail,

   Patience helps him still to hope,

   And with disappointment cope.


   If his efforts all succeed,

   And he earn the hero's meed,

   Still Humility will say,

   "This shall also pass away."


   If unkind the world shall prove,

   And no heart give love for love,

   Patience comforts, "Sad thy lot,

   But thou hast deserved it not."


   If he sit in highest state,

   Friends around him, rich and great,

   From all cares and burdens free;

   Safe is still Humility.


   Patience is for days of gloom,

   Pining grief to overcome;

   But Humility for joy,

   Lest it cheat us and destroy.


   So until my journey ends

   These I choose for daily friends,

   For Humility is blest,

   And sweet Patience giveth rest.

  Albinus

   Only two more names can be mentioned from this circle of writers. The
   first is that of [195]Albinus, a clergyman of Naumberg, and member of
   the Order of the Palm, who wrote several very sweet and popular hymns
   on the joys of heaven, something in the style of [196]Simon Dach.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Johann Frank

   The other is that of [197]Johann Frank (1618-1677), who ranks only
   second to [198]Gerhardt as a hymn-writer, and with him marks the
   transition from the earlier to the later school of German religious
   poetry. In the former, the congregational hymn--"the church-song" as
   Germans call it--had furnished the type for all compositions of this
   class, even for those, like the [199]"Ode" of Gryphius given above,
   which were not meant for church use. Hence it was required that the
   poem should be capable of being set to music, and should embody such
   phases of feeling and experience as might fairly be attributed to any
   large gathering of sincere Christians. These conditions necessitated a
   certain compression and finish in form, and a certain breadth and
   vigour in thought; but they also excluded much both in rhythm and
   sentiment which might legitimately claim a place in Christian poetry.
   From this time onwards a more personal and individual tone is to be
   remarked even in congregational hymns, and with it a tendency to
   reproduce special forms of Christian experience, often of a mystical
   character. Gerhardt stands precisely on the culminating point between
   the two schools. His whole tone and style of thought belong to the
   elder school, but the distinct individuality and expression of personal
   sentiment which are impressed on his poems already point to the newer.
   Frank stands near him, but on the side of the newer school; his leading
   thought is the union of the soul with its Redeemer; "that Christ be in
   you the hope of glory" is the keynote of his hymns. The style both of
   his religious and secular poetry is curiously unlike what we should
   have anticipated from the little we know of his life. He was the son of
   an advocate in the little town of Güben in Saxony. Having lost his
   father early, he was brought up by relations, who sent him to the
   university of Königsberg when [200]Simon Dach and his friends were
   living there; he travelled a little, and then settled down as an
   advocate in Güben, and became successively councillor, burgomaster of
   the town, and representative of the province. It sounds like the career
   of a diligent, sensible, quiet German citizen, but he was also one of
   the principal poets of the day, and a very voluminous one. His secular
   poems, like those of his contemporary [201]George Neumarck, belong to
   the pastoral school, and are long-winded and affected to an
   extraordinary degree. His [202]religious songs, on the other hand,
   published in 1674 under the title of the "Spiritual Zion," are
   remarkably fine; condensed, and polished in style, with a fervid and
   impassioned movement of thought. The following is one of his most
   celebrated hymns, but from its peculiar metre it loses much in
   translation:--

TO THE SAVIOUR.

   6,6,5,6,6,5,7,8,6

   Jesu meine Freude

   [203]Johann Franck

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Jesu, priceless treasure,

   Source of purest pleasure,

   Truest friend to me!

   Long my heart hath panted,

   Till it well-nigh fainted,

   Thirsting after Thee!

   Thine I am, O spotless Lamb!

   I will suffer nought to hide Thee,

   Ask for nought beside Thee.


   In Thine arm I rest me,

   Foes who would molest me

   Cannot reach me here;

   Though the earth be shaking,

   Every heart be quaking,

   Jesus calms my fear;

   Sin and hell in conflict fell

   With their heaviest storms assail me,

   Jesus will not fail me.


   Satan, I defy thee;

   Death, I need not fly thee;

   Fear, I bid thee cease!

   Rage, O world, thy noises

   Cannot drown our voices

   Singing still of peace;

   For God's power guards every hour,

   Earth and all the depths adore Him,

   Silent bow before Him.


   Wealth, I will not heed thee,

   Wherefore should I need thee,

   Jesus is my joy!

   Honours, ye may glisten,

   But I will not listen,

   Ye the soul destroy!

   Want or loss or shame or cross

   Ne'er to leave my Lord shall move me,

   Since He deigns to love me.


   Farewell, thou who choosest

   Earth, and heaven refusest,

   Thou wilt tempt in vain;

   Farewell, sins, nor blind me,

   Get ye far behind me,

   Come not forth again;

   Past your hour, O pomp and power;

   Godless life, thy bonds I sever,

   Farewell now for ever!


   Hence all thoughts of sadness,

   For the Lord of gladness,

   Jesus, enters in!

   Those who love the Father,

   Though the storms may gather,

   Still have peace within;

   Yea, whate'er I here must bear

   Still in Thee lies purest pleasure,

   Jesu, priceless treasure!

CHAPTER X.
THE NEW SCHOOL.
A.D. 1635-1700.

   Though the middle of the seventeenth century marks an epoch in the
   literature of Germany, different tendencies of thought are never really
   parted by so sharp a line of demarcation: the new school first grows up
   by the side of the old one; and so in this instance too we must go back
   to the days of the great war for the men who first introduced the new
   style. In an unpoetical age like the one that was now
   approaching--empty of the great interests and vivid sentiment of a
   common life that furnish the soil on which true poetry springs--the art
   is apt to degenerate into an artificial sort of composition of either a
   didactic or a sentimental kind, which here and there rises a little
   above the dead level of mere verse-making, where some real gift of song
   has been bestowed. But it also often happens that the originators of
   even these styles are very superior to their successors.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Friedrich von Logau

   Certainly Friedrich von Logau, who may be regarded as the beginner of
   the epigrammatic and didactic poetry, which continued to be so popular
   in Germany for the next hundred years, has far more thought and vigour
   of expression than most who followed in his footsteps.

   He was born in 1604, of one of the most ancient and noble families in
   Silesia; his estates lay in that province; he was privy councillor to
   the Duke of Brieg and Liegnitz; he was a member of the
   [204]Fruit-bearing Society, and died in 1655. Few as these facts are,
   they at least make us understand how closely all the tumults of the war
   must have touched him, and how he nevertheless found time and thought
   for literary work. And his poems give the same picture,--of a man of
   strong and original genius, honest and downright, deeply interested in
   the questions of the day; loving his country, hating foreigners, and
   the war which benefited none but the foreign mercenaries; longing for a
   domestic country-life, and mourning over the desolation of his own
   paternal inheritance. He is distinguished in satire and epigram, and
   his principal work is a collection of more than three thousand epigrams
   and aphorisms in verse which were published first in 1639, and
   afterwards in 1654 under the title of "Three Thousand German Proverbs
   and Poems, by Solomon of Golaw." Some of these are rough and unpolished
   in form, but most have force and clear strong sense, and his influence
   on the writers of his own time was marked. In the next century Lessing
   again drew attention to his works, and he has ever since ranked among
   the most important writers of this period.

   Logau's poems are chiefly secular, but he also composed a number of
   religious aphorisms, which were printed in a separate volume in 1704,
   and all his writings are imbued with a spirit of unaffected manly
   piety. it is to him we owe those sayings which Mr. Longfellow has made
   familiar to us, especially that profound one:
     __________________________________________________________________

RETRIBUTION.

SIN.

THE HIGHEST GOOD.

TOLERANCE.

DARKNESS.


   Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small;

   Though with patience He stands waiting, with exactness grinds He all.


   Manlike is it to fall into sin;

   Fiendlike is it to dwell therein;

   Christlike is it for sin to grieve;

   Godlike is it all sin to leave. [29]


   In this world every man will deem

   What pleases him, is good supreme;

   But he who gains by his good hap

   These four things, sits in Fortune's lap:

   A gracious God, a loving wife,

   Calm death to end a healthful life.


   What force is there on earth can faith compel?

   Force can produce denial, not faith as well.


   Whene'er between the human heart and God's love from on high

   Earth's shadow falls,--our day grows dark, eclipse o'erspreads our sky;

   The sun of God's dear solace gone, whence true delight we gain,

   Only the world is left the heart--that meaneth only pain,
     __________________________________________________________________

EPITAPH ON HIS WIFE.

   Leser, möchtest du erkennen


   Reader, dost thou seek to know

   What it is that lies below?

   Ah! a gift, Mortality

   Left too short a time with me.

   'Twas a pearl of virtue true,

   And a rose of freshest hue,

   Gold of faultless purity,

   Crimson of shy modesty,

   Crystal clear of self-control,

   Emerald of the chastest soul,

   Ruby of a wedded heart,

   Opal of sweet household art,

   Sun among all women bright,

   To one man his heart's delight,

   To her home a fence secure,

   In distress its pillar sure,

   Busy hand in daily toil,

   Cooling breeze in life's turmoil,

   Sugar in the bitter day,

   Medicine charming pain away,

   Friendship in the hour of need,

   Truth till death in very deed.


   Gentle reader, ah! how much,

   More than art of mine can touch,

   Have I here resigned to fill

   This deep grave: so God doth will!

   Stand and ponder o'er in thought

   What sore mischief Death has wrought;

   Then if one that marks thee say,

   Why dost linger by the way?

   Answer, that there lieth near

   Virtue's self encoffined here!

  Johann Valentin Andrea

   Another celebrated writer of this period, whose works belong to the
   newer school, is [205]Johann Valentin Andrea. He was born in 1586, of a
   family already eminent for learning; he distinguished himself at the
   universities, and then for some years travelled all over Europe as
   tutor to various pupils of noble families. Returning to Wurtemberg he
   came under the influence of the pious and venerable [206]Arndt, became
   an earnestly religious man and took orders. For many years he was the
   chief clergyman at Calw, where during the earlier period of the war,
   when Wurtemberg was as yet untouched, he organized a system of relief
   and succour to the sufferers elsewhere, which was so energetically
   carried out, that within five years 11,000 persons had received from it
   essential assistance. But Calw's own turn came ere long: in 1634 it was
   stormed and given up to plunder, and Andrea, who was particularly
   obnoxious to the Imperialists for the part he had taken, fled into the
   forests with some of his friends. They were hunted for days with
   bloodhounds, but finally, after undergoing fearful hardships, escaped
   by the aid of friendly country-people. As soon as the way was open he
   returned to his charge, where he was received with tears of joy; but in
   the next two years there followed the usual list of disasters which
   marked the course of the war,--famine, pestilence, and the passage of
   troops, until more than two-thirds of the inhabitants had perished, and
   the small remainder owed to the eloquent exertions of Andrea the scanty
   support which reached them from other cities. When the storm rolled
   away from that region of Germany, Andrea consented to leave Calw and
   accept the post of court preacher at Stuttgardt. Here he had to cope
   with difficulties of another and less congenial type. He was a man of
   fervid and strict piety, with high ideas of church discipline, and the
   court of Wurtemberg was given up to luxury and amusement as if the
   country were not bleeding at every pore. He did contrive to make his
   own house a refuge for the poor, especially those of his own order, to
   found a theological college, and to inspire new life and better order
   into the churches more immediately under his influence. But the court
   disliked him and he had many annoyances and failures to endure, and at
   last his weakened health furnished a good excuse for getting rid of him
   by an honourable promotion. He died in 1654 as prelate of Adelberg. His
   greatest influence was as a Church reformer and a prose writer; he
   wrote many theological, controversial, and satirical works, both in
   Latin and German, which earned for him an important place in the prose
   literature of his day, and admission into the [207]Fruit-bearing
   Society. But he also published in 1619 avolume of sacred poems called
   "Spiritual Pastime" (Geistliche Kurzweil), which have the merit of
   deep, pregnant thought in trenchant but often harsh and abrupt
   expression. We give one called
     __________________________________________________________________

FORGOTTEN LOVE.

   Edele Lieb, wie bist du hier so gar verborgen


   Generous Love! why art thou hidden so on earth

   That scarce a heart now knows the truth of thy exalted birth?

   In God Himself there lies thy spring,

   Whence thou in grace dost flow,

   To make all creatures, everything

   Work man's true good below.


   Loveliest Love! why art thou now so all-concealed,

   We cannot taste thy sweetness, nor see thy power revealed?

   Yet thou the bitter world canst fill

   With honey sweet and pure,

   The sorest pain thy touch can still,

   The heaviest sorrow cure.


   Heart-uniting Love! why art thou shut from us so close,

   We fail to find thy constancy, we cannot bless our foes?

   Yet thou in one canst all men bind

   Now scattered far apart,

   In thee may all their solace find,

   And peace and joy of heart.


   Constant, true Love! why art thou lost to us, alas!

   That never doth thy steadfastness before our vision pass?

   Thou dost all covenants uphold,

   Thy promise all may trust,

   For Love can nevermore grow old,

   And Truth can never rust.


   Candid, bright Love! why art thou now so covered o'er with lies,

   That we thy light and righteousness can neither see nor prize?

   Yet thou dost teach us what is true,

   And dost command the right;

   In honour giving earth its due,

   While heavenward guides thy light.


   Humble, sweet Love! ah why so far from thee we drift,

   No more we seek or value thy fair and costly gift?

   To seek our neighbour's welfare most

   Thou teachest, as Christ says,

   Nor sufferest us of aught to boast

   Since all is Jesu's grace.


   Glowing, warm Love! why do we scorn thee and disown,

   Till o'er the land, in field or town, thy fervour is unknown?

   Thou teachest us with all our powers

   To hold the Gospel fast,

   That so Christ's kingdom may be ours

   In spite of fiercest blast.


   Comforting Love! why art thou chased away so far,

   Thy courage cannot strengthen us, who dwell in strife and war?

   Thou takest from the cross its weight,

   And from the cup its gall,

   So Christian men can face their fate,

   For they are brethren all.


   Holiest Love! how we forget thy very name,

   So that thy heavenly nature on earth wins only blame!

   While lip-religion fills the land,

   Nay, worldly talk is heard

   Till Christian souls in peril stand

   To lose the living Word.


   God-fearing Love! why do thy foes, alas! prevail?

   For many boast the Christian name, yet at thy service quail.

   They bear nought, shun nought, love their pelf,

   Fast not and run no race,

   Nor pray, nor rest, nor die to self,

   Yet trust they shall find grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Among the leaders of this didactic school may be mentioned a whole
   family of the name of [208]Olearius, who throughout this century were
   clergymen and hymn-writers, and the last of whom publishcd, in 1707,
   one of the earliest works on German hymnology. In the next century it
   included [209]Hiller and [210]Rambach, two of the chief hymn-writers of
   that time, and a more famous author in [211]Gellert, whose hymns and
   odes mark at once its zenith and its close.

   The founders of the sentimental school were Harsdörffer and Sigismund
   von Birken, both belonging to Southern Germany, where this school
   flourished more than in the north. Harsdörffer (born in 1607) was a
   wealthy magistrate and merchant of Nuremberg, belonging to one of the
   oldest families of its ancient mercantile aristocracy, and in spite of
   wars and hard times he lived an easy, prosperous life. His prudence in
   affairs was so highly esteemed that princes and private persons alike
   applied to him for advice, while in literature he was an active member
   of the [212]Fruit-bearing Society, and wrote a great deal of poetry
   both sacred and secular, with some prose works; among the latter is one
   which he avers would enable any man who followed its rules to master
   the whole art of poetry in six hours. In 1644 we find this respected
   magistrate, then thirty-seven years of age, engaged in a poetical
   contest, like those of the old troubadours, with a rival poet named
   Klai, in which the prize was to be a garland of flowers. The judges
   could not decide which of the two was entitled to the wreath, and so a
   flower from it was given to each, and they agreed in memory of the
   occasion to found a new order, that of the "Flowers," and send the
   remaining blossoms to those friendly poets whom they invited to join
   them. This order has maintained its existence up to the present day,
   and celebrated its two hundredth anniversary in 1844. Its members
   especially devoted themselves to pastoral poetry; and as their usual
   place of meeting was Pegnitz, near Nuremberg, they were christened by
   the public "the shepherds and shepherdesses of Pegnitz." Among
   themselves each was designated by some pastoral name, and in their
   religious poetry they glorified the pastoral life as peculiarly
   pleasing to God. Were not all the patriarchs shepherds? Did not our
   Lord use the same title for Himself and His ministers? Was not the Song
   of Solomon a pastoral idyll? And thus, as this style became
   fashionable, it coloured even the hymns of the day, and brought about a
   change in the whole tone of its religious poetry. It was at this time
   that the hymn of Nicolai's, quoted above, became so popular, that not
   only were hundreds of imitations of it composed, but in a secularised
   form it was widely circulated as a popular love-song. Harsdörffer died
   in 1658, and was succeeded as head of the order by Sigismund von
   Birken, a more famous poet than himself, and at one time tutor of the
   Duke [213]Anton Ulrich. It was under Von Birken that a work was
   published in 1673, which with his own poems forms a repertory of the
   productions of this school. It consists of poetical versions of the
   "Meditations" of a celebrated divine, Dr. Müller of Rostock, thrown
   into a pastoral form by twenty-nine of these Pegnitz shepherds and
   shepherdesses. This is now unreadable, but a few of Birken's own poems
   have found their way into recent collections, and so have some by his
   friend and follower, Erasmus Finx of Nuremberg. The last great
   representative of this school was Gessner, [30] who lived in the middle
   of the next century (1730-1787), and whose "Death of Abel" is said to
   have been translated into more languages than any other German work,
   and to have been the first that attracted the attention of Europe to
   modern German literature. In these days, however, it is difficult to
   understand what was the charm of those high-flown and wordy
   compositions, of which the "Death of Abel" is by far the best.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [30] Gessner, and some others of this school, wrote their so-called
   poems chiefly in prose.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Friedrich von Spee

   But the earliest poet of this school deserves notice both for his own
   sake, and because he is the first Roman Catholic poet of any note since
   the Reformation. Hitherto the intellectual activity of Germany had been
   all on the side of the Reformed doctrine; it was so still to a great
   degree, but the order of the Jesuits was beginning in Southern Germany
   to push back the advancing tide of Lutheranism, and it is among them
   that we meet with the first Roman Catholic writers who made a mark on
   the literature of their time. These were Johann Jacob Balde and
   Friedrich von Spee. Balde (1603-1668) wrote almost exclusively in
   Latin, but his "Carmina Lyrica" are said to possess remarkable power
   and fire, and were very much read and imitated in his own day.
   Friedrich von Spee, on the contrary, wrote in German, expressly as he
   says, because "it is not only in the Latin tongue, but in the German no
   less, that men can speak and compose good poetry; if this have been
   wanting, 'tis the fault not of the tongue, but of the persons who use
   it." He himself belonged to a noble family of Bavaria, and was born
   either in 1591 or 1595, at Kaiserswerth. He entered the order of
   Jesuits as a youth, and taught moral philosophy at Cologne until 1627,
   when he was transferred to Wurzburg. Here it was part of his duty to
   act as confessor to the poor creatures who were victims of the popular
   mania about witchcraft, and he is said to have witnessed the last hours
   of no fewer than two hundred of these unfortunate persons. The distress
   of mind thus caused him injured his health, and prematurely whitened
   his hair, but he did not merely pity, he acted; to him belongs the
   great distinction of being the first man in Europe to write openly
   against trials for witchcraft. It was no slight effort of courage to do
   so then, but he had the reward of making at once at least one convert,
   the Count of Schönborn, who afterwards as Archbishop of Mayence was the
   first prince who prohibited such trials within his dominions. Spee's
   work, "De Processu contra sagas liber" (Treatise concerning the Trial
   of Witches), attracted much attention, and was translated into several
   languages. He died in 1635 at Trèves, of a fever caught while attending
   on sick and wounded soldiers--an honourable end to so honourable a
   life. His principal work, "The Nightingale's Rival Trutz-Nachtigall"),
   was not published till 1649, and in 1666 his "Golden Book of Virtue."
   Selections from them, somewhat abridged and modified, have appeared
   from time to time ever since; one, edited in 1849 by W. Smets, a canon
   of Cologne cathedral, has now a wide circulation.

   As a poet, Spee reminds us not a little of the Minne-singers; he has
   all their love of nature, their delight in spring-time and the song of
   birds, and much of their fluency and mastery over rhyme and metre.
   There is great beauty and grace in his poems, though many of them are
   too much spun out, and overloaded with quaint conceits. But their chief
   defect to us is that the pastoral tone, which he had caught from the
   Italians, seems unbefitting such serious themes as those to which it is
   here often applied. In one poem, for instance, the moon as the shepherd
   of the stars gathers her flock around her, and bids them look down with
   pity and wonder on the sorrows of Daphnis, which are then described
   through several stanzas, and prove to be the Agony of our Lord in the
   Garden. Or again, the poet wanders into the woods: near a waterfall he
   utters the name of Jesus; it is repeated; at first he thinks it is some
   kindred heart responding to his own, then that it may be Jesus Himself
   condescending thus to sport with him, then he finds it is the echo, and
   from that time his delight is to play at ball with the echo, tossing
   the name of the Beloved to and fro, till all the woods ring with the
   sweet sound. All this is told in flowing verses, in which the answers
   of the echo are introduced with great skill; and were the subject an
   earthly love, it would be a charming little poem. The following is one
   of his best-known poems, and very characteristic of his style:--
     __________________________________________________________________

A LOVE-SONG OF THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, IN EARLY SUMMERTIDE.

   Der trübe Winter ist vorbei


   The gloomy winter now is o'er,

   The storks are back again,

   The song of birds is heard once more,

   And nests are built amain.

   The leaves so fair

   Steal forth to air,

   The flowers give promise good;

   The brooks awake,

   And like a snake

   Wind glittering through the wood.


   The streams are smiling in the light,

   And all the tiny rills,

   The little daughters silver-white

   Of mighty rocks and hills,

   In rapid throng

   Now shoot along

   Like arrows on their way;

   Nor lack they voice

   That can rejoice

   As with the stones they play.


   Diana, huntress pure and proud,

   And wave and wood-nymphs all,

   Now laugh and sport, a merry crowd,

   Where greenwood shadows fall;

   The sun shines down

   To gild her crown

   And fills with darts her quiver;

   Her swiftest steed

   Runs loose with speed

   By smoothest road and river.


   The summer winds, those youths so fair

   On whispering wings who glide,

   Sport with the nymphs in ambient air

   As on light clouds they ride.

   Each tree and bough

   Its utmost now

   Of wealth has all displayed,

   That bird and beast

   When heat-oppressed

   May hide in cooling shade.


   The birds' sweet minstrelsy anew

   Its "tirra-lirra" sings,

   And many a branch makes music too

   As on the breeze it swings;

   Each slender spray

   Doth bend and sway

   In time to that sweet tune,

   And many a lute

   And warbling flute

   Is heard beneath the moon.


   Where'er one gazes, far and near,

   The world is gay and bright,

   All hearts are filled with gladsome cheer,

   With hope and quick delight;

   'Tis I alone

   Still grieve and moan,

   No end my sorrow finds,

   Since Thee to me,

   And me to Thee,

   Thy troth, O Jesu, binds.


   O Jesu, it is only I

   In constant grief must be,

   'Tis I alone must mourn and sigh,

   For I am not with Thee!

   Ah constant grief

   Without relief

   If we must dwell apart!

   O bitter lot

   To see Thee not,

   How sore it wounds my heart!


   Nought in the world can give me joy

   But only Jesu's love,

   All sport and pleasure but annoy

   Till He the veil remove:

   With many a cry

   I call Him nigh

   For many a weary hour,

   Yet never hear

   His step draw near;

   Ah well these tears may shower!


   For what avails the lovely spring,

   The sunshine and the light,

   The silver brooklet's joyous ring,

   The trees so fair bedight,

   The balmy wind

   With breath so kind,

   The soft meandering stream,

   The birds' clear song,

   The May-day long,

   The meadow's emerald gleam?


   What all the joy, the sport, the play,

   The happy earth can show?

   Without Him grief is mine alway,

   And pain and pining woe.

   So sore this smart

   It breaks my heart,

   If Him I may not find;

   For Him I weep,

   And reft of sleep

   Breathe sighs on every wind.


   Farewell, O spring-time, rosy dawns,

   Fields, forests decked anew,

   Foliage and flowers and grassy lawns

   All wet with sweetest dew,

   Streams flowing by,

   Clear azure sky,

   Darts of the golden sun!

   Full well I know

   That grief and woe

   O'er me have triumph won.


   O Jesu, Jesu, faithful Lord,

   Why grieve this heart so sore?

   Wilt Thou not now Thy help afford?

   Look on me, I implore,

   For penitence

   And pain would hence

   In one swift moment flee,

   If but these eyes

   With sweet surprise

   Might rest, dear Lord, on Thee!

  Johann Scheffler (Angelus Silesius)

   A far greater poet than [214]Spee, and one who curiously combines the
   characteristics of all the various tendencies of thought just
   mentioned, is [215]Angelus Silesius. Like Spee he employs pastoral
   titles and imagery to express the love of the soul for her heavenly
   Bridegroom, and he delights in the beauty of the natural world; like
   Logau, he gives us a book full of aphorisms; and, like [216]Johann
   Frank, he is imbued with a certain profound and ardent mysticism. His
   real name was Johann Scheffler, and he was born at Breslau in 1624 of
   Lutheran parents, and educated at the university of his native place
   for the profession of medicine. From very early years he showed a
   strong predilection for metaphysical and theological researches, and
   was greatly attracted by the writings of Jacob Böhme. When he grew up
   he visited the universities of Holland, then famous as medical schools,
   and sought the acquaintance of men who were remarkable for piety,
   especially the members of a certain society which had been formed in
   Amsterdam by the disciples of Böhme. On his return to Silesia he was
   made private physician to the Duke of Wurtemberg-Ols, and here again
   was brought into contact with the same kind of thought, for his most
   intimate friend at Ols was Abraham von Frankenberg, a personal disciple
   of Böhme, who had written a life of his master. Frankenberg introduced
   him to the works of many other mystics, especially those of
   [217]Tauler, Ruysbroeck, and Schwenkfeld, and at his death bequeathed
   to Scheffler a large library of such works, including many important
   manuscripts. The tone of piety thus nourished in Scheffler found no
   congenial air in his native church at Ols. To him the all-important
   thing was union with Christ, the life of God in the soul; to the
   Lutheran clergy of Ols this sounded unmeaning, or even a little
   heretical; what they cared for were certain definitions of dogma and
   external rules of conduct. They began to attack Scheffler; he replied,
   and they succeeded only too well in driving him out of the Lutheran and
   into the Roman Catholic Church. He was received into the latter in
   1653, when he was twenty-eight years old; and from this time devoted
   himself to its service with all the zeal of a proselyte. He was now
   made private physician to the Emperor Ferdinand III.; but ere long he
   renounced his profession entirely, took orders, and returned to
   Breslau, where he died in the Jesuit convent in 1677. By his exertions
   the Roman Catholics of Breslau obtained permission to celebrate the
   festival of Corpus Christi by a public procession through the streets,
   which had been prohibited since the Reformation. The first time that
   the practice was resumed was in 1662, on which occasion Scheffler (who
   had now adopted the name of Angelus) bore the monstrance containing the
   consecrated Host.

   Throughout these years Angelus was constantly engaged in fierce
   controversy with the church he had left, especially with his old enemy
   Herr Freitag, the court preacher at Ols; but it is not by his polemical
   writings that he is remembered. They do not display any extraordinary
   ability, and they are marked by a bitterness and vehemence which is in
   strange contrast with the tone of his poems. So strong is this contrast
   that, coupled with the absence of any peculiarly Romanist doctrine
   (except in nine hymns addressed to the Virgin and the saints, which are
   appended to one of the later editions), it has led to the assumption
   that his hymns were written before his conversion; at any rate they
   were quickly adopted into the hymn-books of the Evangelical Church, and
   are always counted among the precious treasures of its devotional
   poetry. The principal work in which they appeared was published first
   in 1657, and afterwards went through many editions. Its title and
   preface show the influence of the taste of the times; it is called,
   "Sacred joys of the Soul, or the Enamoured Psyche," and was followed by
   another collection entitled "The Mourning Psyche." [31] In the preface
   the "Enamoured Psyche" is admonished to forsake all earthly affections
   and love the Redeemer alone; for in Christ is the kindest grace, the
   most graceful loveliness, the loveliest attractiveness, the most
   attractive beauty; He is the charming Daphnis, the careful Corydon, the
   faithful Damon, the crown of all virtuous shepherds and shepberdesses;
   with Him are the beneficent Galathea (kindness), the noble Sophia
   (wisdom), the fair Callisto (beauty), &c. Some of the hymns of Angelus
   bear traces of the same style, and have a strong likeness to the one of
   Spee's already quoted. But a large proportion of them are in quite a
   different tone, earnest, grave and noble, with a peculiar intensity
   both of feeling and expression. Such are his well-known hymns: "[218]O
   Love, who formedst me to wear;" "[219]Thee will I love, my Strength, my
   Tower;" "[220]O holiest Love, whom most I love," and [221]many others,
   which breathe a profound love to God in Christ, as the Source and
   Manifestation of an inexpressible Beauty and Love, with an ardent
   longing for entire self-surrender to Him. The two following little
   poems are chosen from those less commonly quoted.

THE HIGHEST SEEKS THE LOWEST.

   6,6,8,6,8,8

   Du unvergleichlich Gut

   [222]Johann Scheffler

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O Good beyond compare!

   Who would not worship Thee?

   What heart that would not long to bear

   Some grief or smart for Thee?

   Who would not that his soul and mind

   Were wholly unto Thee inclined?


   Thou art that Radiance keen,

   For angel-eyes too pure,

   Which mortal man hath never seen;

   Yet in this land obscure,

   More common than the light of day

   Thou shinest round our path alway.


   Thou art the Majesty

   Whom nature bows before,

   From whom not hell itself can flee,

   Whom earth and heaven adore;

   And yet Thou bendest down to show

   How Thou canst care for one so low!


   Reason's deep primal Source,

   Pure Wisdom art Thou still,

   Whose sway with mild resistless force

   Works everywhere its will;

   And yet so great Thy grace to me

   That Thou wouldst have me reign with Thee.


   Thou art the Good Supreme,

   No good canst Thou receive,

   The joy whence only joy can stream,

   To Thee we nought can give;

   And yet Thou askest for my heart,

   That in Thy joy it may have part.


   All Beauty is Thine own,

   Nought fairer canst Thou find,

   'Tis Thy own loveliness alone

   Can please Thy Perfect Mind;

   And yet Thy love hath chosen me

   The shadow, to be sought by Thee.


   Thy Throne is fixed on high,

   The depths before it quake,

   Vainly would earth's poor kingdoms try

   Th' eternal rule to shake;

   And yet a sinning child to save

   Thou stoopest to the cross and grave.


   O Good beyond compare!

   Who would not worship Thee?

   What heart so cold it would not bear

   Some pain and smart for Thee?

   Oh would that all my soul and mind

   Longed but for this, my God to find!

A SONG AT DAY-BREAK.

   7,7,3,3,7

   Morgenstern in finst'rer Nacht

   [223]Johann Scheffler

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Morning Star in darksome night,

   Who the sad earth makest bright,

   I am Thine!

   In me shine,

   Fill me with Thy light divine!


   Lo, Thy heaven is in me here,

   Longs to see its Star appear;

   Break of Day,

   No more delay,

   Come and chase these mists away!


   For Thy brightness, O my Star,

   Earth's poor sun surpasseth far;

   From Thy sight,

   Lovely Light,

   Other suns must hide in night.


   All things stand revealed by Thee,

   Past and Present and To-Be,

   And Thy smile

   Can erewhile

   Night itself of gloom beguile.


   Where Thy joyous splendours dart

   Faith soon follows in the heart,

   Star most clear,

   Far and near

   Thou as Lord art worshipped here!


   Come then, Golden Light of souls,

   Ere fresh darkness o'er me rolls,

   Be Thou mine,

   In me shine,

   Fill me with Thy Light divine!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Aphorisms

   His other most important work was a collection of spiritual aphorisms,
   after the manner of Logau, published in 1674 under the title of "The
   Cherubinical Wanderer" ("Der cherubinische Wandersmann"). After having
   fallen into oblivion, this work was brought forward and re-edited by
   Friedrich von Schlegel, and has since then been several times
   republished. It consists of a series of short sayings, generally
   comprised in a single couplet, at most in two or three, on the deepest
   relations of the human soul to God. Many of these sayings are pearls of
   wisdom, lustrous with a wealth of meaning which grows upon the reader
   the more he ponders them; but it is no less true that others pass the
   bounds of deep but sober thought into a mystical pantheism, of which
   the expression is often extremely and even wilfully jarring. Angelus
   defends himself against the charge of pantheism by an appeal to the
   writings of other mystics, especially [224]Tauler; but Tauler, if at
   times he seems to merge the personality of the human soul in the abyss
   of the Divine Nature, is practically guarded by his clear, unflinching
   recognition of duty, and at least he never loses the Divine in the
   human. It is this last tendency which strikes at times an insoluble
   discord in these aphorisms. We can only give a very few of them:--

   "Th'Unspeakable, that men use God to call,

   Utters and shows itself in the One Word to all.


   God is all virtue's aim, its impulse and its prize,

   In Him its sole reward, its only 'wherefore' lies.


   The nobler aught, the commoner 'twill be,

   God and His sunshine to the world are free.


   My God, how oft do I Thy gifts implore,

   Yet know I crave Thyself, Oh, how much more!

   Give what Thou wilt, eternal life or aught,

   If Thou withhold Thyself, Thou giv'st me nought.


   All goodness flows from God, therefore 'tis His alone;

   Evil springs up in thee, that may'st thou call thy own.


   Is aught of good in thee? Give God the praise of all

   To claim it for thine own, is ever man's true Fall.


   The noblest prayer is, when one evermore

   Grows inly liker that he kneels before.


   Faith by itself is dead, it cannot live and move

   Till into it is breathed the living soul of Love.


   The rose demands no reasons, she blooms and scents the air,

   Nor asks if any see her, nor knows that she is fair.


   How fairly shines the snow, whene'er the sun's bright beams

   Illume and colour it with heavenly gleams;

   So shines thy soul, white, dazzling as the snow,

   When o'er it plays the Day-spring's radiant glow."

  The Second Silesian School

   [225]Angelus was the founder of what is termed the second Silesian
   school of poetry, as that founded by [226]Opitz is called the first.
   The secular productions of this school are singularly trivial in
   thought, and trite and bombastic in expression; but its religious
   poems, though not free from grave defects, never fell quite so low, and
   some among them were really good. These had a strong influence on the
   pietistic hymnwriters of the next period; and where their ardent
   mysticism was tempered with a scriptural and practical tone of piety,
   as in [227]Tersteegen, [228]Arnold, [229]Schmolke, &c., the results are
   often very beautiful. Among the best of the school were [230]Knorr von
   Rosenroth, author of the lovely little hymn, "[231]Day-spring of
   Eternity," and some others--a friend of Henry Moie and Lightfoot, and a
   student of alchemy and the Talmud, who knew almost the entire Bible by
   heart; Christian Scriver, a clergyman at Magdeburg; [232]Homburg, a
   lawyer of Naumburg; and two countesses of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, [32]
   who wrote very sweet and graceful verses.

  Popular Songs

   Although the Roman Catholic Church had produced only two or three
   original poets, it had not been unaffected by the great spread of
   vernacular hymns since the Reformation. Their use was still prohibited
   in church at the ordinary services, but they were commonly employed at
   certain festivals, and collections of them were placed in the hands of
   the people. These consisted partly of translations from the Latin,
   partly of modified versions of the Lutheran hymns, partly of the old
   popular religious songs. It is indeed to the activity of the priests
   during the seventeenth century that we owe most of the collections of
   these ancient songs. Only a few were actually composed in this century,
   and the eighteenth was utterly barren of any good ones. Their great
   flowering time was in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and again
   in the early part of the present century. But of those found in
   collections of this period, though themselves probably of earlier date,
   we give two:--

   Why is it that life is no longer sad,

   And my soul within me is now so glad?

   Because with repentance earnest and meet

   I cast me at Christ my Saviour's feet.


   The light of my eyes had waxen dim

   Because my heart had forsaken Him,

   My heart was aching and pined away,

   Long and weary seemed night and day:


   Then to make me love Him still more and more

   He forgave the sin I had done before,

   And this is the reason, and only this,

   That this soul of mine hath found her bliss.


   Dear soul, then keep thee now pure and free,

   That nought of error be found in thee,

   And so prepare thee, through gladness here,

   For a heaven of joy without a tear.

CHAPTER XI.
THE PIETISTS.
A.D. 1660-1750.

   A hundred years elapsed between the close of the great struggle which
   determined the boundaries and relations of Romanism and Protestantism
   in Germany, and the opening of that Seven Years' War in which Prussia
   first asserted her rivalry with Austria for the leadership of their
   common race. It was a dreary period in German story. Politically the
   empire had fallen asunder into a number of separate despotic little
   states; and the sentiment of national unity had become so nearly
   extinct, that the loss of the fertile and beautiful Alsace to France
   seems to have been viewed with wonderful indifference, and the
   achievements of a general like Prince Eugene only roused a little
   personal admiration for himself. Socially the life of the people had
   greatly deteriorated. The rural population was terribly diminished in
   numbers and wealth; their means of communication were restricted by the
   destruction of their horses and the neglect of the roads; their schools
   had disappeared, and were but very slowly replaced; their new houses
   and churches were bare and barn-like compared to the old ones; their
   periodical gatherings for certain purposes of local self-government or
   for festivities had fallen into disuse. It was a vegetating sort of
   existence, and the writers of the following age bear testimony to the
   illiterateness and coarseness of manners which prevailed towards the
   end of the seventeenth century, even among the gentry of the country
   districts. In the towns things were but little better. The commerce of
   Germany had received a serious check; her merchant princes had sunk to
   the level of petty traders, and adopted the manners and culture of the
   latter class. Her old free cities were decaying; only a few of the
   newer ones were growing, and what intellectual life then existed,
   centred in them, as at Hamburg or Berlin, or at the court of any
   sovereign who specially protected letters, or still more at the
   universities. But throughout this period Germany contributes only one
   really great name to literature--that of Leibnitz; while in France it
   was the age of Louis XIV. and XV., of military glory and social
   brilliancy, of Racine and Molière, of Fénélon and Bossuet, of Bayle and
   Voltaire. And so German men and women found their own life mean and
   tiresome, and were carried away by admiration of their splendid
   neighbour, till it became the fashion to imitate whatever was French in
   manners, dress, or tone of thought, and the very language was
   wretchedly corrupted by the intermixture of French phrases. Frederick
   the Great was the first hero to the German people at large who roused
   in them anew a pride in their own country, yet he himself
   ostentatiously despised it, and preferred France. Of course there was
   another class, of which his father may be taken as the type, who hated
   foreign ways and upheld whatever was most antiquated and unrefined as
   peculiarly German; but in general the tide set in favour of the
   foreigners. The pastoral school was an imitation of the Italians; the
   French were now the great models, and very unfortunate ones for a
   people whose natural genius was so totally different. German literature
   reached its lowest ebb under these influences, and one of the earliest
   signs of its revival was a rebellion against French classicism, and an
   admiration for our Shakespeare and Milton.

  Old Lutheranism

   Religion suffered under the same depression. On the one hand was a
   rigid Lutheranism, which had petrified what had once been living
   convictions into dead dogmas, and which gave its whole attention to
   controversies about definitions of doctrines in which the people had
   ceased to feel a genuine interest. On the other was a genteel
   indifference, which idolized "enlightenment" (the favourite watchword
   of the eighteenth century), and indemnified itself for its compliance
   with certain outward observances by laughing at the whole affair in
   private. Rabener, a satirist of this period, when characterising the
   earlier part of the eighteenth century, says, "There was a time in
   Germany when no satire could be witty at the expense of anything but
   the Bible, and there were lively heads which had, so to speak, a
   complete satirical concordance in readiness, that their wit might never
   run dry. . . . If a groom is conscious of possessing a more cultivated
   mind than the dairymaid, he startles her by a jest on some text or
   hymn. All the servants scream with laughter, all admire him, down to
   the very cowboy, and the poor dairymaid, who is not so witty, stands
   there abashed."

  Early Pietism

   It was against all this formalism and indifference that the reaction
   towards a more spiritual and living faith took place, which is known by
   the name of Pietism. In many points this movement resembled that of
   Methodism in England, but it preceded it by seventy years. Like
   Methodism, it laid great stress on the necessity of the new birth; it
   prohibited certain amusements and modes of life which had been hitherto
   considered as at least harmless; and it encouraged private assemblies
   of Christian persons for purposes of edification, such as the study of
   the Scriptures or the interchange of spiritual experiences. Like
   Methodism, too, it encountered at first no little ridicule, and even
   persecution. It was accused of being an attempt to found a new sect,
   and vehemently opposed on this ground; but, unlike Methodism, though it
   might here and there give rise to some insignificant bodies of
   separatists, it never did break off from the national church of the
   country, but remained as a whole a movement within, not outside of it.
   For nearly a hundred years Pietism exerted a most powerful influence
   both on the religious and social life of Germany, then it almost
   entirely disappeared in the new world of thought that opened on that
   country towards the close of the eighteenth century, and it is only in
   recent times that traces of its characteristic style of piety are again
   to be discovered there.

   The type of character that we meet with in its earlier followers has
   something peculiarly attractive about it,--a cordial, active, sincere
   piety, marked at once by deep and earnest emotion, and by a certain
   simplicity and sobriety. [235]Ernst Moritz Arndt says of such men: "I
   can still remember having seen in my early boyhood old men of
   [236]Spener and [237]Franke's school in pulpits and in houses; and the
   blessedness of their strong and strengthening faith, the serene, quiet
   cheerfulness of a life which no sorrows, no storms of the world
   without, no unreasonableness of men, could disturb or lay waste, still
   floats like a lovely flower before the eye of memory." Spener, and
   through him his immediate disciples, had been led to see a truth which
   might well produce this result. For what their favourite theme of the
   insufficiency of a dead faith, and the necessity of a change in the
   heart and life, really meant was this: that no mere intellectual
   acceptance of certain doctrines, however true, would save a man, but a
   heart and will set right towards God and his neighbour, which must
   manifest themselves in a life of prayer and charity. Thus they had
   learnt that Christianity was not primarily a system of doctrine, but a
   life; for them religion had been brought back from the sphere of mere
   reasoning and controversy to that of affection and practical conduct.
   In after years the negations and limitations of Pietism also bore their
   appropriate fruit, and of a very different kind; but as yet we have to
   do only with its true and nobler side.

  Philip Jacob Spener

   Its founder was [238]Philip Jacob Spener, who was born in 1635 in a
   little village of Alsace. His parents were pious persons, who dedicated
   their little son from his birth to the ministry, and rejoiced to see
   that even as a child he showed signs of unusual seriousness. He seems
   indeed through life to have possessed one of those sweet and harmonious
   characters which, when strengthened and ennobled by an earnest
   religion, pass untouched through temptation, and attract affection and
   admiration from all sides. As a child, it is said those who had charge
   of him could not remember that he ever committed any actual fault;
   once, at the age of thirteen, he joined in a dance, but remorse for
   what he thought a worldly compliance made him rush away from it in
   tears of bitter sorrow. He went through school and more than one
   university with distinction, and blameless as to the ordinary errors of
   youth; travelled for some years; was tutor to two princes of the
   Palatinate; then took orders, married, and was appointed, at the age of
   thirty-one, first preacher and pastor of Frankfort-on-the-Maine. Here
   his sermons, so unlike the dry controversial disquisitions stuffed with
   Greek and Latin quotations which the people were accustomed to hear,
   soon drew crowds to his church, and many persons came to him in private
   for further counsel. Thus grew up certain meetings for conversation on
   religious subjects, which afterwards became celebrated under the name
   of "collegia pietatis." They were held at first in his house, and when
   the numbers became too great, in his church; both men and women were
   present, but as a rule the men only spoke. He also wrote a book on the
   necessity of a complete reformation in the Church, which excited great
   attention; and he took up warmly the cause of education, especially of
   the very lowest classes. For twenty years he laboured in Frankfort,
   doing much good, but virulently attacked by the old orthodox party, who
   saw no use in these new lights, and wished to expel him from the
   Church; and not a little, embarrassed at times by the zeal of some of
   his own converts, who began to declare that the Lutheran Church was
   Babylon, and it was a duty to come out of her. About this time, in
   1686, the Elector of Saxony, who in passing through Frankfort had heard
   him preach, invited him to accept the post of first preacher to the
   Court at Dresden, a place which was then considered to be the highest
   dignity in the whole Lutheran Church, and carried with it great
   influence on ecclesiastical affairs in general. Spener accepted it, and
   at once began to enlarge his sphere of labour. Besides his directly
   pastoral duties, he now received into his house a number of young men
   who wished to become clergymen, one of whom, [239]August Herrmann
   Franke, was in after years his own chief coadjutor and successor in the
   new movement. He also carried through various reforms in the Church and
   education which he had much at heart, among others, that the study of
   the Scriptures in the original languages should be made an imperative
   part of the theological course at the University of Leipsic. Of course
   all this energy raised up enemies as well as friends, but for some time
   the Elector and the mass of the people were in his favour, and nothing
   could be done against him. Ere long, however, he himself destroyed his
   favour with the Elector by addressing to him a private but very earnest
   remonstrance against one of his personal vices, that of intoxication.
   The Elector was enraged; Spener's enemies of course represented that he
   was wanting in loyalty and proper respect, and he was obliged to
   resign. He was next, in 1689, invited to occupy the church at Berlin
   where [240]Paul Gerhardt had preached, and the remainder of his life
   was spent in that city. The Elector (son of the great Elector and
   afterwards King of Prussia) was his friend, and, when in 1694 he
   founded a new university at Halle, he appointed to its faculty of
   theology the pupils and friends whom Spener recommended to him.
   Spener's influence had now spread over a wide extent of Germany. He had
   raised up a whole school of energetic men, who were carrying out his
   ideas in the pulpit, in the new university, and in schemes of active
   benevolence such as had been hitherto unknown. In Halle, Franke was
   establishing the first Orphan-house; in Berlin, Baron von Canstein was
   setting on foot the first Bible Society. Throughout Germany people
   applied to him for advice or assistance, so that he received more than
   six hundred letters in a year asking for spiritual counsel, besides all
   the personal visits for a similar purpose which were of daily
   occurrence. Acute, gentle, dignified, quick in reading character, and
   ready in sympathy, he seems to have been remarkably fitted for this
   position of a sort of universal confessor, and numbers of persons whom
   he had never seen were earnest in their expressions of gratitude to him
   for his aid. He had a gentle, clever wife and eleven children, and his
   house was then considered to be the model of an orderly, cheerful,
   Christian household. It was not till he was close on seventy that his
   strength gave way, and after a short illness he died in 1705.

   [Spener wrote eleven [241]hymns, including "[242]Shall I o'er the
   future fret."]

   Of his immediate disciples, the most noted were [243]Franke,
   [244]Joachim Lange, and Breithaupt: the first as a spiritual teacher
   and leader; the second as the most learned representative of the order,
   and its champion in the controversies of the day; the third as a
   hard-working working professor of theology among the students of Halle.
     __________________________________________________________________

  August Herrmann Franke

   [245]Franke was a man of the same type of piety as [246]Spener, but
   more ardent and passionate in temperament. [33] He belonged to a
   respectable family of Lubeck, where his father was Syndic; and in 1684,
   at the age of twenty-one, was sent to the university of Leipsic. The
   fame of Spener soon attracted him over to Dresden, and the young Franke
   speedily enrolled himself among the master's most attached disciples.
   At Spener's instigation in 1686, as a private tutor, he opened classes
   for the study of the Bible, and though when he began them not a single
   Bible or New Testament was to be found in any bookseller's shop in
   Leipsic, within a few months he had from 300 to 400 pupils, many of
   whom were converted to the new mode of life. It was at this time that
   the name of Pietists was given to this party in contempt, and in 1690
   their opponents in the university succeeded in having these lectures
   prohibited. On this Franke joined Spener at Dresden, who procured him
   an appointment with Breithaupt to a church at Erfurt. There his private
   meetings, the great number of books that were sent to him, and above
   all the startling effect produced by his sermons, awakened the envy and
   hostility of the old orthodox and the Romanist parties, who united in
   accusing him to the Roman Catholic prince as "one of the men who are
   turning the world upside down." One of his packets of books was seized,
   and he was summoned before the council, but when, on opening it, it was
   found to contain nothing but Bibles, the council was fain to let him go
   again. Presently, however, a decree from the prince deprived him of his
   post, and commanded him to leave Erfurt within two days, and it was on
   his journey to Gotha on this occasion that he wrote his celebrated
   hymn, "[247]Thank God that towards eternity." A few months later,
   through Spener's recommendation, he received the incumbency of one of
   the suburban churches of Halle, with a promise of the professorship of
   Greek and Oriental languages in the university about to be founded
   there. He accordingly went to Halle in December 1691, and it remained
   his residence for thirty-five years, until his death in 1727. Shortly
   after his own removal there, Breithaupt, [248]Lange, Anton, and other
   friends of the same way of thinking, also received professorships and
   pulpits in Halle, and for many years Halle continued to be the
   head-quarters of the Pietistic movement. Spener had given to it its
   first spiritual impulse, Franke gave it its practical organization and
   utility. Numbers of students flocked to the new university; nothing
   like the concourse had been seen since the days of Luther at
   Wittenberg. Within thirty years it had sent out more than 6,000
   graduates in theology, besides some thousands who had been trained in
   the theological schools founded by Franke. These men spread themselves
   all over evangelical Germany; early in the eighteenth century they had
   made their way into other universities than Halle, and occupied the
   majority of the pulpits in all the States, while even the old orthodox
   party had been gradually modified by their example, and had adopted
   many of their innovations. But Franke's great work, for which his name
   must always be held in grateful remembrance, was that he first in his
   times set on foot schemes of organized Christian benevolence, and
   recalled Christian people to the duty of personal effort for the most
   degraded classes of society. The suburb of Glaucha, where his church
   was situated, was one of the worst parts of Halle, in which all the low
   beer-houses and dancing saloons were to be found. Its population was
   excessively poor and totally uncared for; he laboured as their pastor,
   gave relief to the poor in a systematic manner, sought out employment
   for them, founded free schools, and finally his famous Orphan-house. In
   these undertakings he obtained personal help from his students; money
   was another matter. He began his schools with four dollars and sixteen
   groschen, his Orphan-house with seven dollars; it was, as he himself
   says, "founded in faith and prayer;" he had no lists of subscribers,
   and he was more than once reduced to his last shilling. But help always
   came at the right moment; the work grew and prospered as more people
   came to know of it, and at last he had the happiness of seeing his
   great schools built on what had been the site of the very worst houses
   in Glaucha. At the time of his death the establishment contained 145
   orphans who were entirely provided for there, 2,200 scholars who were
   receiving a free education, and it gave daily dinners to nearly 400
   poor students at the university, while it also included a printing and
   publishing house, and a dispensary. Similar institutions were founded
   in imitation of it in many other German towns, and it is not too much
   to say that Germany owes to the Pietists the resuscitation of her
   educational system after the war, the introduction of systematic
   provision for the poor, and the revival of a purer and more refined
   domestic life.

   [33] [He wrote only three hymns, "Thank God that towards eternity",
   "What within me and without," and a third, better known in Bogatzky's
   version, "Awake, thou Spirit, who of old."]
     __________________________________________________________________

  Freylinghausen

   During all this period the hymnology of Germany was almost entirely in
   their [the Pietists'] hands. Their chief singer was [249]Anastasius
   Freylinghausen, who was married to [250]Franke's only daughter, and was
   his father-in-law's successor in the pulpit and the management of the
   Orphan-house. He was a man of gentle, retiring disposition, liable to
   severe attacks of nervous pain, but of unwearied activity and a most
   loving and disinterested spirit. Franke used to say that his own
   sermons were like a waterspout, which drenched the land but soon ran
   off again, Freylinghausen's like a gentle steady shower, which
   penetrated to the depths of the soil. He wrote forty-four [251]hymns of
   his own, and in 1704 published a hymn-book containing both old and new
   hymns, which remained for some generations the favourite collection for
   private reading among pious persons in Germany. It went through
   numberless editions, and was frequently enriched by new additions. One
   of Freylinghausen's best known hymns is the following. Several others
   have been already translated into English, and one or two have found
   their way into our hymn-books:--

JESUS IS ALL IN ALL.

   5,5,8,8,5,5

   Wer ist wohl wie du, Jesu süsse Ruh

   [252]Anastasius Freylinghausen

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Thou art First and Best,

   Jesu, sweetest Rest!

   Life of those who else were dying,

   Light of those in darkness lying,

   Ever be Thou blest,

   Jesu, sweetest Rest.


   Life, that stooped to be

   Slain for such as me,

   Who to save us death hast tasted,

   Pardon life and blessings wasted,

   Take away our load,

   Lead us back to God!


   Brightness of His Face!

   To redeem our race,

   Ere time was, Thou wast appointed,

   Thou didst veil Thee, God's Anointed,

   In our human race:

   Brightness of His Face!


   Conqueror, Thou alone

   Hast the powers o'erthrown

   Of the world, the flesh, the devil;

   Souls that once were slaves to evil,

   Thou hast made Thine own,

   Conqueror, Thou alone!


   Highest Majesty!

   King and Prophet! see

   To Thy gentle rule submitting,

   At Thy feet like Mary sitting,

   I would learn from Thee,

   Highest Majesty!


   O Thou Light Divine!

   Make me wholly Thine.

   Wisdom by Thy Spirit knowing,

   With Thy love and ardour glowing,

   Thou within me shine,

   O Thou Light Divine!


   Thy humility

   And Thy kindness be

   In my heart for ever dwelling,

   Pride and anger thence dispelling,

   Till Thyself Thou see

   Mirrored, Lord, in me.


   Is my foolish mind

   To the world inclined?

   Strengthen it no more to waver,

   But to seek alone Thy favour,

   Wealth in Thee to find;

   Grant me, Lord, Thy mind.


   In the darksome night,

   When the billows' might

   Roars around my little vessel,

   And with bitter fears I wrestle,

   Let Thy arm of might

   Save me in the night.


   Let my soul be strong,

   Bold to suffer wrong

   For Thy sake though I should perish;

   Life nor earthly wealth to cherish,

   All to Thee belong;

   Only make me strong.


   And when I must die

   Let me feel Thee nigh;

   Through the valley walk beside me,

   To the heavenly glory guide me,

   Till I find me nigh

   To Thy throne on high.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Almost all the leading men of this school occasionally composed hymns,
   but there were many among them who did not write more than two or
   three. [253]Franke himself wrote only three hymns, which were all good:
   the one already named, "[254]What within me and without," and a third,
   better known in Bogatzky's version, "[255]Awake, thou Spirit, who of
   old." [256]Spener wrote eleven, from which we choose the following:--

QUIETNESS OF HEART.

   7,7,7,7

   Sollt' ich mich denn täglich kränken

   [257]Philip Jacob Spener

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Shall I o'er the future fret,

   And the past for aye regret?

   Shall I ne'er at evening close

   Smiling eyes in calm repose?

   Shall the thought be ne'er forgot,

   What may be my future lot?

   Since these torturing cares are vain,

   And their end can ne'er attain.


   God hath kept me hitherto;

   Can He cease, then, to be true?

   Why should I just now despair,

   Can He weary of His care?

   Hence, tormenting terrors, hence!

   God shall be my confidence;

   Let Him lead me as He will,

   O my soul, and be thou still.


   Whatsoe'er my heart hath planned,

   He alone can understand

   What is good and well for me,

   What will really hurtful be;

   If I will but let Him choose,

   No true good I e'er shall lose,

   But self-will and busy thought

   Oft mistaken paths have sought


   If obscure my place and low,

   I will bid my proud heart know

   'Tis the safer from a fall,

   Free from cares that vex and thrall.

   Or if God would have me great,

   I accept my high estate,

   He the needful powers will give

   Worthily to Him to live.


   If He send within my door

   Worldly wealth unknown before,

   May He also let me find

   Wealth of soul and heart and mind;

   Or if poverty be sent,

   I can still be well content,

   For a rich eternity

   Well I know is waiting me.


   If my God should health bestow,

   Zealously I strive to show

   How I thank Him, how my aim

   Is to spread His glorious Name;

   And when sickness comes again,

   May His Spirit 'mid my pain

   Whisper, "There is blessing true

   In this bitter medicine too."


   If I number many a year

   In life's ever-vexed career,

   Oft my heart will find a day

   When awhile it may be gay;

   Or if soon the end shall come,

   I am but the sooner home,

   Freed from all my sorrows' load,

   Happy with my Lord and God.


   So to God I leave it all;

   Whatsoe'er may here befall,

   Joy or trial, life or death,

   I receive it all in faith,

   And this anxious heart of mine

   Learns to trust its Guide Divine,

   Since it well hath understood

   All things work the Christian good.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Later Pietists

   The number of hymn-writers among the Pietists is thus very large: among
   the principal of the older school are [258]Lange; [259]Winkler and
   [260]Schade, two of [261]Spener's curates in Berlin; the [262]Freiherr
   von Canitz, one of his carliest noble converts, and an author of merit
   in general literature; [263]Richter, the physician of the Orphan-house
   at Halle; and [264]Laurentius Laurenti, precentor of the cathedral at
   Bremen. Two of the best hymns of this period were written by men who,
   as far as we know, never wrote any others. One is "[265]All praise and
   thanks to God Most High," which was composed in 1673 by [266]Johann
   Schutz, a man of high standing in the Town Council of Frankfort, who
   was Spener's most intimate friend during his residence in that city:
   the other is, "[267]Whate'er my God ordains is right," of which the
   author was [268]Samuel Rodigast, head-master of the principal gymnasium
   of Berlin, and also a friend of Spener's, He wrote it in 1675 for a
   sick friend.

   Of the younger Pietists who had grown up under the influence rather of
   Franke and Freylinghausen than of Spener, the chief hymn-writers are
   [269]Allendorf, pastor of St. Ulrich's Church in Halle, Woltersdorf,
   [270]Rambach, and [271]Bogatzky, whose name is still known among us as
   the author of the "Golden Treasury," a work which has been translated
   into most European languages, and from fifty to a hundred years ago was
   the favourite book for daily devotional reading of pious people in
   England.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Carl Heinrich von Bogatsky

   [272]Bogatzky belonged to a worldly and ambitious family; he began life
   as a page at court, and his father was bent on his entering the army.
   He himself was even then more inclined to study; and a certain friend
   of his family, an old Count Reuss, a religious and clever man, induced
   his father to let him go to Halle and see [273]Franke. The result was
   his determination to study theology, and to cast in his lot with the
   Pietists. His delicate health prevented him from ever taking the
   regular charge of a church, and he devoted himself through life to
   authorship, assistance in charitable undertakings, and speaking in
   private assemblies. His noble birth procured him admittance to the
   higher circles of society, and he counted many converts among the
   nobility of Silesia, Bohemia, and Saxony. [274]Freylinghausen, and
   afterwards Franke's son Gottlieb Franke, were his most intimate
   friends; and the latter invited him, after his wife's death, to occupy
   apartments in the Orphan-house, where the last twenty-eight years of
   his life were spent, until his death in 1774, at the age of
   eighty-four. He lived long enough to see the tide of feeling in Halle
   turned against the Pietists who had so long swayed it, and in favour of
   the scepticism which was then spreading from France into Germany; and
   this experience darkened his later years, for in place of the
   veneration with which he had been once regarded, he was frequently the
   subject of ridicule and of attacks from the younger students. Bogatzky,
   with the other writers just named, were the chief authors of a certain
   collection of hymns, called from its place of publication the "Cöthen
   Hymns." Both in character, and in the position it occupied in the
   religious history of the time, this book strongly resembled the
   "[275]Olney Hymns" of Newton and Cowper; but comparatively few of its
   original productions are now ranked among the classical hymns of
   Germany. Those of Bogatzky are among the best; he composed about four
   hundred [276]hymns in all for this and other collections, some of which
   have great thoughtfulness and dignity, but not the simplicity or melody
   which would adapt them for congregational use. The following was
   composed after witnessing a storm among the mountains of the
   Riesengebirge:--
     __________________________________________________________________

THE ALMIGHTY GOD.

   10,10,10,10

   Jehovah, hoher Gott, von Macht und Stärke

   [277]Bogatzky

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Jehovah, God of boundless strength and might,

   How great Thy glory, Lord, in all the earth!

   How wondrously Thy wisdom guides aright

   The creatures all to whom Thy Word gave birth!

   Thou only art the Lord for evermore,

   Perfection absolute alone art Thou,

   Worthy alone that heaven and earth should bow

   Before Thy throne, and awe-struck Thee adore.


   The hosts of heaven proclaim Thee wise and just,

   And every flower that blooms beside our ways,

   Each tiny worm that creeps along the dust,

   Or murmuring forest-bough, declares Thy praise!

   Alas! that man for whom these all were made,

   Himself his Maker's master-piece,--that he

   So slow to praise and gratitude should be,

   So apt to rest in what must pass and fade!


   Ah who would dare rebel against Thee here?

   Who pride himself on gifts that are not his?

   Who fail to worship Thee in lowly fear?

   Nor trust the care that cannot guide amiss?

   Hath man once owned Thy great Omnipotence,

   Mistrust and doubt he then can cast aside

   And in humility and hope abide,

   Though clouds may veil Thy ways from sight and sense.


   Before Thy power the hills and valleys shake,

   The winds and waves are silent at Thy word;

   The devils hear it, and with fear they quake,

   While all the heavens to quicker joy are stirred.

   O'er countless worlds Thou, mighty King, dost reign!

   And yet in me dost condescend to dwell;

   Must not Thy presence every fear dispel,

   Or could I trust Thy power, my God, in vain?


   Eternal Being! Perfect Purity!

   Exalted evermore, Thou triune God!

   What am I, Lord of Hosts, compared to Thee?

   How canst Thou choose my heart for Thine abode?

   I cast me down before Thee in the dust,

   Low at Thy feet a withered leaf I lie,

   Yet Thou dost bid me with Thy hosts on high

   Sing of Thy praise, look up to Thee and trust.


   Would I could praise Thee with an angel's tongue!

   By all that lives and breathes below, above,

   In earth and heaven, O be Thy praises sung,

   And teach my heart Thee, only Thee, to love!

   O Lord of Hosts, fill Thou my every thought,

   In all things let me seek Thy glory first,

   All idol-worship be to me accurst,

   For Thou art God alone, and I am nought.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Benjamin Schmolck

   By the end of the century, the influence of Pietism was perceptible in
   many quarters where it was not formally accepted. The old orthodox
   party, as it was called, changed its character, and the best of its
   hymns are henceforward scarcely to be distinguished from those of the
   Pietists. Little of real merit was produced at this time, though two of
   the writers of this school, Neumeister, a pastor in Hamburg (died
   1756), and [278]Schmolke, wrote an enormous quantity. The latter
   (1672-1737) was called in his own day the "Silesian Rist," and had
   really much in common with [279]Rist--his extraordinary facility, his
   tendency to wordiness, and his occasional excellence. Schmolke composed
   altogether 1188 poems and hymns of a religious character, and it may
   well be imagined that a large number of them are poor enough; yet
   [280]a few are really very good, with an easy flow, a heartiness, and a
   simplicity that are rarely found among the hymns of this period. He was
   for many years the pastor of Schweidnitz, in Silesia, and was a man of
   great personal piety, which was proved by the patience and cheerfulness
   with which he bore seven years of illness following a paralytic stroke.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Wolfgang Christoph Dessler

   A good many of Schmolke's best hymns have been translated into English
   already; we therefore give one from another writer of the so-called
   "orthodox party," whose hymns are among the most thoughtful and
   poetical of this period. This is [281]Wolfgang C. Dessler (1660-1722),
   a pupil of Erasmus Finx of Nuremberg, and head-master of the
   grammar-school of that city.

A SONG OF THE CROSS.

   8,6,8,6,6,6,8,8

   Frisch, frisch hindurch, mein Geist und Herz

   [282]Wolfgang Dessler

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Courage, my heart, press cheerly on

   Along the thorny way,

   For joy shall come with victory won,

   Though pain be ours to-day:

   Nor shrink the load to take

   Which love shall easy make;

   Can these light transient woes compare

   With glory that awaits us there?


   'Twas by a path of sorrows drear

   Christ entered into rest;

   And shall I look for roses here

   Or think that earth is blest?

   Heaven's whitest lilies blow

   From earth's sharp crown of woe,

   Who here his cross can meekly bear

   Shall wear the kingly purple there.


   Where would the garden's splendour be

   If north and south winds slept?

   Its spices flow most fragrantly

   When long the clouds have wept.

   Only do Thou remain

   My Rest in every pain,

   My Sun that cheers me still with light,

   When storms of grief would else affright.


   For Thou, my God, art Sun and Shield

   To every faithful heart,

   That to be made like Thee would yield

   To trial's fiercest smart,

   Would bear earth's darkest woe

   If Heaven may but bestow

   On patient love the martyr's palm,

   For vanquished grief, Thy perfect calm.


   And yet, dear Lord, this shrinking heart

   Still trembles as of yore:

   Come, Cross beloved, nor e'er depart

   Till I have learnt Thy lore!

   Here, scorned with Him I love,

   There, crowned with Him above;

   Here to the cross with Jesus pressed,

   There comforted with Him and blest.


   Then I will meekly yield me up

   To suffer all Thy will;

   I know the seeming bitter cup

   O'erflows with mercy still;

   In every cross I'll see

   The crown that waits for me,

   Thy patience shines and beckons on

   Until the starry heights are won.

  Albert Bengel

   In Southern Germany Pietism found its most congenial soil in
   Wurtemberg, where the ground had already been prepared by the labours
   of [283]Andrea. At first it showed itself in small fanatical sects,
   which drew down on themselves not a little contempt and even
   persecution, and a prohibition of all private meetings for any
   religious purpose whatever. But it soon found an excellent leader in
   Albert Bengel (1687-1732), one of the brightest examples of this
   school. He was a man of earnest piety, and of a remarkably powerful and
   sagacious mind, whose position as head of the important theological
   seminary of Denkendorf, and afterwards as prelate and member of the
   consistory, gave him great influence over the whole development of
   religious thought in Wurtemberg, and enabled him among other things to
   procure the repeal of the law against religious meetings. He was the
   author of many prose works on theology, of which those on Biblical
   criticism, especially his "Gnomon," held a high place in the estimation
   of theologians; and he also wrote a few good hymns. [34]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] He was a student of prophecy, and fixed on the year 1836 as the
   close of the present dispensation, candidly adding, however, "Should
   that year pass over without some wonderful change, there must be a
   fundamental error in my system."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Philip Frederick Hiller

   But the chief poet of this part of Germany was [284]Philip Frederick
   Hiller. He was the son of a pastor in Wurtemberg (1699-1769), a pupil
   and afterwards a friend of [285]Bengel's, and himself a pastor in two
   or three villages of his native country, and finally for many years at
   a small place called Steinheim. In his early manhood he was a small,
   fair, active man, cheerful and alert, with a fine resonant voice, and
   great skill in music, and he was happily married. But life brought him
   many depressing trials; he had a large family, and an extremely small
   income; the part of the country where he lived was one in which the
   sectarian spirit was strongest, and the principal families in his
   parish were infected by it, and either rejected his ministrations or
   received them in an unfriendly and critical spirit. He fell into ill
   health, and after a long struggle with it he was obliged to succumb in
   his fifty-second year, and give up preaching. With rest he recovered to
   some extent, but he entirely lost his voice, so that for the rest of
   his life he could only speak in a husky whisper. Still he continued to
   hold the living of Steinheim; he had a curate to preach for him, and he
   was able after a time to resume most of his pastoral duties, while the
   enforced leisure which his illness brought him was occupied with
   writing religious works, Among them was a collection of short poems in
   alexandrines called "Sacred Morning Hours," and a "Life of Jesus" in
   the same metre; but his best known were two volumes of hymns: one,
   called the "Little Paradise," consisted chiefly of poetical versions of
   prayers from [286]Arndt's "Garden of Paradise;" the other, "The Casket
   of Spiritual Songs," was entirely original. This last soon obtained a
   very wide popularity throughout Southern Germany; it is still the
   commonest book in Wurtemberg next to the Bible itself; and German
   emigrants, of whom a very large proportion belong to these regions,
   have carried it to the backwoods of America and the mountains of the
   Caucasus. We are told that some thirty years ago a German colony in the
   latter country was attacked by a hostile tribe of Circassians, and the
   sons and daughters carried into slavery. As they were torn from their
   parents' arms, some of the latter hastily cut up two copies of Hiller's
   "Casket," and distributed the leaves among their children that they
   might not forget their religion among the barbarians.

   Hiller's model was [287]Paul Gerhardt; he has indeed less poetical
   power than Gerhardt, and his style is more purely didactic, but his
   [288]hymns are never in bad taste, never irreverent or extravagant;
   they are written in modest scriptural language, and their predominant
   tones are those experiences of penitence, of gratitude to the Saviour,
   of trust in the compassionate love of God, which are common to all
   Christians. Many too are appropriate to special conditions of life,
   such as health or sickness, marriage, childhood or old age, and thus
   his "Casket" forms a useful manual of daily devotion. Well is it for
   any people that hymns of such deep, thoughtful, practical piety should
   be their daily spiritual food. We give two of the best known: the first
   is more reflective and less simply popular than many of Hiller's; the
   latter is a very favourite hymn in sickness.

THE GROUND OF ALL THINGS.

   8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8

   Abgrund wesentlicher Liebe

   [289]Philip Frederick Hiller

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Thou fathomless Abyss of Love,

   O God, Eternal highest Good!

   Whom doth some wondrous impulse move

   To pour Thy mercies like a flood

   Around our life; Thou Sea of Grace,

   Fountain of comfort ever nigh,

   Healer of souls that wounded lie;

   Hearken, my spirit cries to Thee,

   O very Love, caust Thou love me?


   O bounteous Being! let me praise

   And thank Thee from my spirit's ground;

   Thy wisdom far transcends our gaze,

   Thy loving-kindness hath no bound;

   How tender to the sin-defiled,

   How great to us who are so small,

   How fatherly and true to all,

   Deigning to count the least thy child:

   Hearken, my spirit cries to Thee,

   O mighty Love, wilt Thou love me?


   My prayers, my longings Thou dost hear,

   And for my wants dost Thou provide,

   Thou countest every sigh and tear,

   No sorrow from Thine eye can hide,

   Thou sendest it, and know'st it well;

   From Thee comes pain and its relief,

   Thou triest me with care and grief,

   That faith and love may in me dwell;

   And so my spirit cries to Thee,

   O tender Love, now love Thou me!


   And Thou dost all our sins forgive,

   Thy Word hath promised grace and aid,

   Solace and light, that we should live

   Of death and sin no more afraid;

   Thou givest us Thy dearest Son,

   Made of our race, through love supreme,

   To bear our burden and redeem

   The souls that so much ill had done;

   And so my spirit cries to Thee,

   O wondrous Love, canst Thou love me?


   The love of Christ shall bid me feel

   That He hath made me all His own;

   I hear that pleading love's appeal

   Whene'er His gospel is made known;

   And His example here on earth

   Shall be my rule in all I do,

   In utmost pain my pattern true,

   My Guide in time of wealth or dearth;

   Hearken, my spirit cries to Thee,

   O holy Love, dwell Thou in me!


   That Love hath suffered and was slain

   To make my death a thing of nought;

   And rose to glorious life again,

   That I might rise in heart and thought

   And hath ascended up on high,

   To make for me an open way

   To heaven itself, where day by day

   Our faith and hope may upwards fly;

   Hearken, my spirit cries to Thee,

   O Son of Love, now love Thou me!


   And Thou Thy Spirit dost bestow

   To hallow all our life to Thee,

   To pour clear light on all below,

   And give the blinded power to see;

   Thou Comforter from age to age

   Of all the weary, all who weep;

   Whose peace within us true and deep

   Is earnest of our heritage:

   Hearken, my spirit cries to Thee,

   Spirit of Love, O love Thou me!


   So doth Thy boundless Love embrace

   My life, my death, and life to come;

   O let me know it in that place

   Where only is our proper home!

   Thy Love is life and endless rest:

   There is no good to add to this,

   In earth or heaven our only bliss

   Is by Thy Love to be possest:

   Therefore my spirit cries to Thee,

   O Blessed Love, dwell Thou in me!

HE MAKETH ALL OUR BED IN OUR SICKNESS.

   Angenehmes Alrankenbette

   [290]Philip Frederick Hiller

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Bed of sickness! thou art sweet,

   If I lie at Jesu's feet;

   Only there true health I find,

   Health of body and of mind;

   Only there is living life,

   When His voice ends fear and strife,

   "Lo thy sins are all forgot;"

   Then can Death affright me not.


   Lord, I thank Thy ceaseless care

   All my suffering Thou dost share,

   Thou true penitence hast sent

   Whereof needs not to repent;

   Breathest longing through my pain,

   Thy salvation to attain,

   Breathest faith within my breast,

   On Thy grace alone to rest.


   Great Physician of the soul,

   Thou canst fear and pain control,

   Thine the power is to forgive,

   Thine to make faith truly live;

   ls this sickness for me meet?

   Lay me only at Thy feet,

   I shall live there on Thy grace,

   Live to thank Thee and to praise.

  Joachim Neander

   It was under the impulse received from the Pietists that the Reformed
   Church first produced any hymnwriters of mark; but from this time
   onwards it can show a succession of such authors, though it was never
   nearly so rich in them as the Lutheran. Its first poet too was, with
   the exception of [291]Tersteegen, by far its best, [292]Joachim
   Neander. He belonged to a family of Bremen in easy circumstances, and
   in his youth was a wild and careless student. One day he and two of his
   comrades went into St. Martin's Church at Bremen, with the intention of
   making a jest of the whole affair. But the sermon touched him so deeply
   that he determined to visit the preacher in private; and from this time
   he began to draw back from many of the coarser pleasures in which he
   had formerly indulged. But he was still a passionate lover of the
   chase, and once followed his game on foot so far that night came on,
   and he utterly lost his way among rocky and wooded hills, where the
   climbing was difficult even in daylight. He wandered about for some
   time, and then suddenly discovered that he was in a most dangerous
   position, and that one step forward, which he had been on the point of
   making, would have thrown him over a precipice. A horror came over him
   that almost deprived him of the power of motion, and in this extremity
   he prayed earnestly to God for help, vowing an entire devotion of
   himself to His service in the future. All at once his courage returned;
   he felt as though a hand were leading him, and following the path thus
   indicated, he at length reached his home in safety. From this day he
   kept his vow, and a complete change took place in his mode of life.
   After completing his university course he accompanied some rich
   merchants' sons to Frankfort, and here he made the acquaintance of
   [293]Spener, [294]Schütz, and the little clique of religious persons,
   of whom Spener was the centre in that city, and a warm friendship grew
   up between them which lasted through life.

   In 1674 he was made head-master of the grammar-school at Dusseldorf,
   belonging to the Reformed Church. It flourished exceedingly under his
   rule; but he also set on foot private religious meetings after the
   pattern of Spener's, and these gave great offence. He was accused of
   heresy; and one day the elders of the church made their way into the
   school, and before the pupils charged him in an abusive manner with
   various errors of doctrine, ending with the announcement that he was
   deposed from his mastership, forbidden to preach, and banished from the
   town. His pupils would have liked to fight for him, but he forbade
   them, and submitted. It was summertime, and feeling himself utterly
   friendless there, he wandered out to a deep and beautiful glen near
   Mettmann on the Rhine, where for some months he lived in a cavern,
   which is still known by the name of "Neander's Cave." In this retreat
   he composed many [295]hymns, and among them the following:--

SONG OF SUMMER.

   6,10,6,6,6,10

   Unbegreiflich Gut, wahrer Gott alleine

   [296]Joachim Neander

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   O Thou true God alone,

   Thou Good no creature-soul can comprehend,

   Thou great and Holy One,

   The Lord of Hosts most strong,

   To Thee I raise my song,

   Thou art the Lord, whose wonders never end!


   A deep and holy awe

   Put Thou, my God, within my inmost soul,

   While near Thy feet I draw,

   And my heart sings in me,

   And my voice praises Thee;

   Do Thou all wandering sense and thought control.


   Let all things join with me

   To tell Thy praises and Thy fame abroad;

   Let earth and sky and sea,

   With voices pure and clear,

   Resounding far and near,

   Proclaim how great the glory of the Lord!


   O God, the crystal light

   Of Thy most stainless sunshine here is mine,

   It floods my outer sight;

   Ah let me well discern

   Thyself where'er I turn,

   And see Thy power through all Thy creatures' shine.


   Lo, how the cloudless dome

   Like to a clear and dazzling mirror gleams,

   Of light the very home;

   O Thou, transform my heart,

   Till pure in every part

   It mirrors back undimmed Thy golden beams.


   Hark, how the air is sweet

   With music from a thousand warbling throats,

   Which Echo doth repeat;

   To Thee I also sing,

   Keep me beneath Thy wing,

   Disdain not Thou to list my harsher notes.


   Ah! Lord, the universe

   Is bright and laughing, full of pomp and mirth;

   Each summer doth rehearse

   A tale for ever new,

   Of wonders Thou canst do

   In sunny skies and on the fruitful earth.


   Thee all the mountains praise,

   The rocks and glens are full of song to Thee;

   They bid me join my lays

   And laud the Almighty Rock,

   Who safe from every shock

   Beneath Thy shadow here dost shelter me.


   I hear the waters rush

   Far down beneath me in the hidden glen,

   They break the quiet hush,

   And quicken all my mind

   With keen desire to find

   The Fountain whence all gladness flows to men.


   How various and how fair

   I find Thy works where'er I turn my sight;

   Beauty is everywhere

   Without or stint or bound,

   And Wonder all around;

   Would that all hearts would ponder this aright!


   Wisdom hath made them all,

   Its order reigns through all these wondrous things!

   Earth's brightness doth recall

   Thy brighter Love to mind,

   So endless and so kind;

   Sing, O my soul, as now all nature sings.

   In 1679 he as called to the very church in Bremen which he had once
   entered in mockery, but he only preached there one year; he died at
   Easter, 1680, not quite forty years old. Neander's style is unequal;
   occasional harshnesses contrast with very musical lines, but there is a
   glow, a sweetness, and a depth about his hymns which have made many of
   them justly and lastingly popular among the German people.

CHAPTER XII.
THE MYSTICS AND SEPARATISTS.
A.D. 1690-1760.

   The impulse given to religious life by the Pietistic movement
   coincided, to a certain extent, with that received from the study of
   [Jacob] Böhme and similar writers, and under the combined action of the
   two a number of preachers and writers, and even of small sects sprang
   up in various parts of Germany, who seceded from the national Church,
   and claimed a greater strictness both of life and doctrine. The general
   characteristic of these, as is frequently the case, was an exaggerated
   individualism; because religion is an inward life in the individual
   soul, therefore to them it was nothing else. The outward aids, the
   guiding principles and defined sphere of action presented by the
   written Word and the Church, were valueless, or positive
   stumbling-blocks if they interfered with the movements of the inspired
   soul. Some of these men lost themselves in wild vagaries of belief and
   even of morals; as the followers of a man named Eller and a woman named
   Eva Butler, who made many converts in Southern Germany: others of purer
   life still believed themselves to enjoy immediate revelations, like a
   certain Fraülein von Asseburg, whose visions were widely talked of and
   believed in by many good and educated persons; indeed a whole sect grew
   up, which asserted the continuance of direct revelation and miraculous
   gifts in the believers, and was known by the name of Inspirationists.
   To this belonged an iron-master's apprentice named Rosenbach, and a
   wig-maker of Nuremberg named Tennhart, who roamed all over Germany
   calling themselves the prophet and chancellor of God, and made many
   proselytes. In Silesia there was a community of inspired children, who
   built a little church for themselves, preached and prayed in it, and
   whose prayers were supposed to have a wonder-working power. But there
   were not wanting among these Separatists men of a far higher type, of
   unmistakeable piety and no little ability, much of whose conduct and
   teachings awaken admiration, though marred by want of breadth and
   judgment. Such men were Petersen, a leader of the Chiliasts, or those
   who were looking for a speedy advent of the Lord; Dippel, a
   controversial writer and great preacher,--he was the chemist who
   discovered Prussian blue and an oil that bears his name; and Hochmann,
   a friend of [297]Tersteegen, who used to travel about the country
   attacking the lukewarmness of the established clergy, and would rise up
   in church when the sermon was over and preach another from his own
   point of view. The influence of these Separatists on hymnology was for
   the most part simply mischievous, and their hymn-books contain about
   the worst specimens to be found, poor as poetry, fiercely intolerant
   towards their fellow-Christians, and full of a fantastic and irreverent
   adoration of the Redeemer. On the other hand, two of the nobler minds
   among them produced some of the very best hymns which the newer school
   has to show, and which were at once adopted with delight by the whole
   Evangelical church of Germany. These were [298]Gottfried Arnold and
   [299]Gerhard Tersteegen, men in whom we see two well-marked and
   differing types of the mystic. Arnold, of a passionate impetuous
   temperament, has a soul with the dusky glow of a repressed fire, that
   at times breaks forth into a clear, ardent flame; Tersteegen's mind,
   naturally humble and peace-loving, is like a profound crystal lake,
   that cares only to reflect the heavens above and nothing of the earth
   around. It must be observed, however, that both these men, though they
   held much intercourse with the Separatists, and were frequently in
   antagonism with preachers and members of the established churches, yet
   never actually joined any sect.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Gottfried Arnold

   [300]Gottfried Arnold, born in 1666 at a small village in Saxony, was
   the son of a poor schoolmaster, and lost his mother while he was yet
   quite a child, Thus his early years were marked by struggle and
   hardship, and an absence of that home-tenderness which might have
   softened his naturally rugged and overbearing disposition. In 1689 he
   came to Dresden, at the age of two-and-twenty, as tutor in a noble
   family. Here he met with [301]Spener, was strongly attracted by him,
   and considered that he owed his conversion to Spener's meetings for
   religious conversation. Their friendship continued through life. Spener
   had a great admiration for Arnold's genius and entire
   conscientiousness, and frequently employed his influence with success
   on his behalf Arnold was deeply attached to Spener, but he thought him
   too gentle, too much inclined to balance between the opposite sides of
   a question, and not unfrequently censured his practical conduct. At
   Dresden, as soon as he was converted, he at once began to express in
   the most open and severe manner, his disapprobation of the life that
   was going on around him, a proceeding which of course led to an abrupt
   dismissal from his situation. For the next sixteen years he led an
   unsettled life. He received various appointments, among them a
   professorship at Giessen, and wherever he went, his energy,
   earnestness, and eloquence were sure to produce an effect and to win
   him followers. But he always made enemies too by his fierce attacks on
   whatever seemed to him wrong, especially on the old orthodox party; and
   as he was in the habit of familiar intercourse with sectarians such as
   Dippel, and of abstaining from divine service and the Holy Communion
   where he was not satisfied with the minister, it was easy to find
   charges against him which generally ensured his removal after a time.
   In his earlier years he strongly advocatcd an ascetic life, and spoke
   much in praise of celibacy, but at the age of thirty-four he married;
   and though he himself testified that this marriage, which was in every
   respect a suitable one, had been of great assistance to him in the
   spiritual life, it gave offence to many of the more zealous of his
   admirers. Yet amid all these distractions he was a man of truly German
   industry in the way of authorship, his greatest work being "An
   Impartial History of the Church and all Heresies," which earned him
   from his adversaries the reproach of being the arch-heretic himself.
   But he is now best remembered by his [302]hymns, of which he wrote 130,
   and among them several of very great beauty. Many are rather poems than
   hymns, and he also composed a number of religious madrigals and
   poetical aphorisms, but these are somewhat sentimental and exaggerated
   in style, and have not maintained their place like the hymns. The
   latter first appeared in 1697, under the title "Sparks of Divine Love,"
   and the volume was frequently reprinted with additions.

   In 1707 Arnold was appointed pastor of Perleberg in Brandenburg, and
   here he spent the last seven years of his life in unwearied activity,
   but in peace, for his congregation were of his own way of thinking, and
   he was protected by the King. In 1713 his health began to fail, and at
   Easter 1714, while he was celebrating the Holy Communion, a Prussian
   recruiting party burst into the church and dragged away a number of
   young men from the very steps of the altar. This outrage and his
   unavailing efforts to save the members of his flock, so affected him
   that he took to his bed two days afterwards and died within a few
   weeks.

   Perhaps the best of Arnold's hymns is his deeply thoughtful

   "[303]How blest to all Thy followers, Lord, the road;"

   but many others are very fine. We give the following:--

THE KINGDOM OF GOD.

   Salb' uns mit deiner Liebe

   Anoint us with Thy blessed love,

   O Wisdom, through and through,

   Till Thy sweet impulses remove

   All dread and fear undue,

   And we behold ourselves in Thee

   A purified Humanity,

   And live Thy risen life.


   O Perfect Manhood, once again

   Descend Thou in our race,

   Be all its lower nature slain,

   Transform us of Thy grace,

   Till pure and holy as Thou art

   Thine image shine from every heart,

   And Thou within us live.


   Prepare the Church, O Lord, Thy Bride,

   With glory and with strength,

   Let life flow from her far and wide,

   Till she may see at length

   New members given her day by day,

   That shall not wither nor decay,

   Wherein Thyself hast joy.


   Redeemer, Thine the power alone,

   Ah yield Thee to us, Lord!

   Let God's fair temple once o'erthrown

   Be in our race restored;

   Thou, Man of men, didst take our flesh

   Only to give us life afresh,

   And render all things new.


   Then all the glory shall return

   That we had lost of yore,

   Long severed souls shall homewards yearn

   And cleave to Thee once more;

   Then shall the Father and the Son

   Through their one Spirit make us one;

   Christ's prayer at last fulfilled!

LIFE'S VOYAGE

   Gar mancher Weg, gar manche Bahn

   Full many a way, full many a path,

   The all-encircling Ocean hath,

   Let each man only see to this,

   That his own course he do not miss.


   Or long or devious be thy way,

   What matter, if thou do not stray?

   Or lead it thee by east or west,

   What matter, if thou reach thy rest?


   The ways are countless, none the same,

   Yet each one hath its proper aim,

   Only forget not aye to heed

   If to the haven thine will lead.


   For there are currents undiscerned,

   As many a ship too late hath learned,

   That deemed itself full safe to be,

   Yet sank upon the open sea.


   Another's course may not be thine,

   But Christ on all alike will shine;

   Leave thou thy brother where he is,

   Pursue thy way in quietness.


   One is the haven;--let there be

   In us who seek it, unity;

   Vast is the ocean, surely there

   Is room for all men and to spare.


   Then heedfully go on thy way,

   Care only that on that great Day,

   Whether thy course be long or short,

   Thy vessel may be found in port.

   I leave Him not, who came to save

   When I had trifled hope away;

   He must be mine until the grave

   Since once He deigned to be my stay;

   O world, I put thy offers by,

   My loyal love hath one reply,

   I leave Him not.


   I leave Him not;--for since He chose

   Me for His own, I choose Him too;

   Since He for me faced all my foes,

   In death itself will I be true;

   Why tempt me, Earth, with false delight?

   Why seek, O Hell, my soul t'affright?

   I leave Him not.


   I leave Him not; He leaves not me,

   The Saviour evermore the same,

   Who since He suffered on the tree,

   Beareth that high and glorious Name;

   Whate'er the storms that on me fall,

   His Godhead's glory streams through all;

   I leave Him not.


   I leave Him not; Earth I can leave,

   With all her glory and her power,

   But He, to whom my soul must cleave,

   Is caring for me every hour,

   Leading me through the tedious night,

   Up to the very Source of Light;

   I leave Him not.


   I leave Him not; what wouldst thou, Sin?

   Thou hast been buried in the sea.

   What would ye, depths of Hell, begin?

   Ye have no part or power in me!

   Thy sting, O Death, I shall not feel,

   Christ will His life in me reveal;

   I leave Him not.

  Gerhard Tersteegen

   [307]Gerhard Tersteegen, born at Mors in Westphalia in 1697, was the
   son of a respectable tradesman; he was educated at the grammar-school
   of his native place, and then bound apprentice to an elder brother, a
   shopkeeper at Mülheim. From his childhood he was delicate in health,
   thoughtful, and of scrupulous conscience. At Mülheim he became
   acquainted with a tradesman, a very religious man, who took much notice
   of him, and under his influence he was converted, and resolved to
   devote himself entirely to the service of God. His days were busy, but
   he used to pass whole nights in prayer and fasting, and as soon as his
   time was out he declared his intention of leaving his brother, and
   choosing some more retired and less disturbing mode of life. He
   accordingly removed to a little cottage near Mülheim, where for some
   years he supported himself by weaving silk ribbons, and lived quite
   alone, except for the presence during the day of a little girl who
   wound his silk for him. His habits were very simple; he usually took
   nothing but milk, water, and meal, never touching tea or coffee, and
   giving away in charity to the poor the money thus saved. His relations,
   who seem to have been a thriving and money-getting set of people, were
   so ashamed of this poor and peculiar member of the family, that they
   refused even to hear his name mentioned, and when he was sick he
   suffered great privations for want of proper care. Yet he was very
   happy in his solitude, with its opportunities for uninterrupted
   meditation and communion with God, until that searching trial of
   spiritual deadness fell upon him, which so many of God's saints have
   had to endure for a time. For five years he was in a "state of
   darkness;" he had no sensible impression of the love of God, nay, there
   were hours when he began to doubt whether there was a God at all. It
   was at this time he sang--

   Jesu, mein Erbarmer, höre

   [308]Gerhard Tersteegen

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   "Lost in darkness, girt with dangers,

   Round me strangers,

   Through an alien land I roam;

   Outward trials, bitter losses,

   Inward crosses,

   Lord, Thou know'st have sought me home.


   Sin of courage hath bereft me,

   And hath left me

   Scarce a spark of faith or hope;

   Bitter tears my heart oft sheddeth,

   As it dreadeth

   I am past Thy mercy's scope.


   Peace I cannot find; O take me,

   Lord, and make me

   From this yoke of evil free;

   Calm this longing never sleeping,

   Still my weeping,

   Give me hope once more in Thee."
     __________________________________________________________________

   He could obtain no help from outside; but at last one day, when he was
   on a journey to a neighbouring city, he received such an internal
   manifestation of the goodness of God and the sufficiency of the
   Saviour, that all doubts and troubles vanished in a moment. [35]
   Henceforward he had peace and joy, and an intense power of realizing
   the unseen which, combined with the experience he had lately gone
   through, gave him a wonderful faculty of touching and strengthening
   other hearts. He now (in 1725) admitted a young friend, named Heinrich
   Sommer, to live with him. The two worked ten hours daily at the loom,
   two hours Tersteegen devoted to private prayer, and the rest of his
   time to writing devotional works, and addressing private meetings of
   friends on religion. This last occupation, which he had begun
   reluctantly and in the quietest manner, soon became his principal one.
   So many persons were impressed by him, so many more urgently sought the
   opportunity of hearing him, that he was at last induced to give up his
   weaving altogether, and devote himself to this informal but real kind
   of ministry. Considerable sums of money had been already offered him by
   friends, which he had invariably declined; now he accepted a small
   regular income, but in order that he might not be entirely without
   manual occupation, he set up a dispensary for the poor in his house,
   and compounded the medicines himself, employing an assistant as the
   work increased. The thirty years of his life, from thirty to sixty
   years of age, were spent in the most incessant exertion for the good of
   others, though his own health was always delicate, and from time to
   time he had severe attacks of illness and of neuralgic pain. From
   morning to night he never had a moment to himself; the number of those
   who flocked to him for counsel was so great that there were frequently
   twenty or thirty persons waiting in his outer room for a chance of
   speaking to him, while his meetings were always attended by as many as
   could crowd into the rooms on the ground-floor of his little house,
   about four hundred persons. People came to him from England, Holland,
   Sweden, and Switzerland; sick persons would send for him, and he would
   pass hours or whole nights by their bedside; if he went into the
   neighbouring country for rest, people would watch for him by the
   roadside, and carry him off to the nearest barn, where a congregation
   would immediately assemble. He had an immense correspondence, and new
   editions of his hymns and other religious works were constantly
   demanded. To his quiet temperament this incessant labour and absence of
   solitude was most uncongenial, but he accepted it willingly as his
   appointed task. "I love most to be with the Father, but I am glad to be
   with the children," he said. His intercourse with those who came to him
   seems to have been marked by a most searching insight into character,
   yet by a gentleness and affectionateness, an anxiety to cherish even
   the faintest sparks of spiritual life, which nothing could tire out.
   Some attempts were made to hinder his irregular ministerial activity,
   but he demanded an interview with the superior clergy of his native
   place, and so entirely justified himself in their eyes that they never
   allowed him to be interfered with. Nor did he ever join any sect,
   though many, especially the [309]Moravians, made advances to him. When
   he was sixty-one, the exertion of so much speaking brought on an
   internal injury which was almost fatal; he recovered and lived to the
   age of seventy, but he is said to have looked like a corpse, and he was
   obliged to give up all travelling, and addressing large assemblies. But
   he toiled as assiduously as ever in private conversation and
   correspondence, and was able to revise his various books, of which the
   principal were "[310]The Spiritual Flower Garden," a volume of hymns
   and poems; and "Spiritual Crumbs," a collection of sermons and
   addresses which had been taken down in short-hand. He died in 1769.

   Tersteegen was a mystic of the purest type. In his earlier days, as he
   himself tells us, he laid too much stress on bodily exercises and
   violent emotions, but in later life he was singularly free from
   extravagance or intolerance. "My religion is this," he says: "that as
   one reconciled to God by the blood of Christ, I suffer myself to be led
   by the Spirit of Jesus, through daily dying, suffering, and prayer, out
   of myself and all created things, that I may live alone to God in
   Christ; and clinging to this my God by faith and love I hope to become
   one spirit with Him, and through His free mercy in Christ to attain
   eternal salvation. And I feel myself to be of the same faith with every
   one who believes thus, of whatever class or nation or creed he may be."
   Again, in the preface to his poems, he says: "In that sweet name of
   Jesus, Immanuel, God with us, the tender and overflowing love of God
   has made for itself a new way into the very depths of our hearts, and
   has come unspeakably close to us poor fallen children of Adam. Since
   then the kingdom of God is so near at hand, nay, has come within us, we
   need make no wide circuit through much knowledge and laborious effort
   to get thither; but we may enter at once by this new, open, and living
   Way into the sanctuary of inward and eternal communion with God. We
   have but to let this deep, mysterious, intimate Divine Love lead us out
   from the cheating pleasures of this world and the tormenting life of
   egotism; and for this end to give our heart and will captive to this
   inward Love, that it may become our All in all, and guide us of its
   free pleasure. Behold this is the whole kernel of the matter."

   Many of [311]Tersteegen's hymns have already been rendered into
   English, and two of them, translated by Wesley, are to be found in
   nearly all our hymn-books. These are, "[312]Lo, God is here, let us
   adore," and "[313]Thou hidden Love of God." The following little poems
   are taken from the first part of "The Flower Garden."

THE MOTE IN THE SUNBEAM.

   Wo find ich mich


   I lose me in the thought!

   How great is God,--and I how merely nought!

   What doth that Sun whence clearest splendours stream

   Know of the mote that dances in his beam?

   Nay, if I may but ever live and move

   In the One Being who is perfect Love,

   Th' Eternal and the Infinite alone,

   Let me forget all else, and all I deemed my own!

   Closer than my own self art Thou to me,

   So let me wholly yield myself to Thee;

   Be Thou my Sun, my selfishness destroy,

   Thy atmosphere of Love be all my joy,

   Thy Presence be my Sunshine ever bright,

   My soul the little mote that lives but in Thy light!
     __________________________________________________________________

WITHIN AND WITHOUT.

   Aus, aus, hinaus


   Out! out, away!

   Soul, in this alien house thou hast no stay!

   Seek thou thy dwelling in Eternity,

   'Tis there shall be

   Thy hiding-place, thy nest,

   Where nor the world nor self can break thy rest.

   Within the heart of God,

   There is thy still abode,

   There mayst thou dwell at rest and be at home,

   Howe'er the body here may toil and roam.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Hinein, hinein


   Within! within, O turn

   Thy spirit's eyes, and learn

   Thy wand'ring senses gently to control;

   Thy dearest Friend dwells deep within thy soul,

   And asks thyself of thee,

   That heart, and mind, and sense He may make whole

   In perfect harmony.

   Doth not thy inmost spirit yield

   And sink where Love stands thus revealed?

   Be still and veil thy face,

   The Lord is here, this is His holy place!

   Then back to earth, and 'mid its toil and throng

   One glance within will keep thee calm and strong;

   And when the toil is o'er, how sweet, O God, to flee

   Within, to Thee!
     __________________________________________________________________

AT EVENING.

   Lieblich, dunkel, sanft und stille


   Lovely, shadowy, soft, and still

   Is the eventide,

   Ah! if but my heart and will

   Evermore might so abide!

   God, Thy presence can alone

   Make this lovely calm my own.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE CROSS.

   Das Kreuz zu rühmen weun es fern.


   To praise the Cross while yet untried,

   Comes oft of self-conceit and pride;

   But when it presses, to embrace

   And love it, only comes of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Nein, das Kreuz hat keine Last


   Nay! not sore the Cross's weight,

   Save to souls the Cross that hate;

   Souls that can with love receive it,

   Childlike to their Father leave it,

   May be still 'mid all its woe,

   And a strange deep gladness know.

   Only Self-love murmurs yet,

   Only Sense and Nature fret,

   They repine, for they must perish

   If the soul true life will cherish;

   Light and dear the Cross shall prove,

   For it is the gift of Love.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE TIRED CHILD.

   Ach, Gott, es taugt doch draussen nicht


   Ah God! The world hath nought to please;

   One loses strength and light and peace

   In needful toil of sense and brain:

   Would I might here with Thee remain!


   I am sated with these things of nought,

   Wearied with hearing, sight, and thought;

   O Mother-Heart, to Thee I turn,

   Comfort Thy child, for Thee I yearn:


   Thy love, most gentle-innocent!

   Would that each hour might there be spent,

   That I absorbed in Thee might live,

   And child-like to my Father cleave.


   Like a parched field my soul doth lie

   Pining beneath a sultry sky;

   O Heavenly Dew, O gentle Rain,

   Descend and bid it bloom again.

  The Moravians

   By far the most important new sect that was founded at this time was
   that of the Moravians. Properly speaking, indeed, the Moravian Church
   is the living representative of that ancient [314]Bohemian Church whose
   hymns were the delight of Luther; but practically, its transplantation
   to German soil about the year 1722, and its rapid growth under the care
   of [315]Count Zinzendorf, constitute a new foundation of the society.

  Nicolaus von Zinzendorf

   Zinzendorf grew up in the very bosom of Pietism. Born at Dresden in
   1700 of a noble, wealthy, and religious family, he had [316]Spener for
   his godfather, and [317]Franke for his tutor; while his maternal,
   grandmother, the Baroness von Gersdorff, whose house was his home in
   childhood, was herself a woman of strict piety and a writer of hymns.
   From his carliest years he had strong religious impressions; as a child
   his favourite amusement was playing at preaching; as a boy at school
   under Franke, he founded among his schoolfellows the "Order of the
   Mustard-seed," the members of which bound themselves in an especial
   manner to the service of Christ, and above all to promote the
   conversion of the heathen. Some of his non-pietistic relatives insisted
   on his acquiring the accomplishments proper to his station in life,
   such as dancing, fencing, shooting, &c., and on his being sent to the
   orthodox university of Wittenberg to study law. He complied with their
   wishes, though he himself would have much preferred studying theology;
   and after his university course travelled for some years. Once, in
   passing through Dusseldorf, he saw in a gallery a picture of the
   Saviour crowned with thorns, over which was written, "All this have I
   done for thee; what dost thou for Me?" These words struck so deep into
   his heart that he never lost the impression; "from this time I had but
   one passion, and that was He, only He." At the age of twenty-one he
   returned to Saxony, accepted office under the government, married and
   settled down to the usual life of men of his order. He was a remarkably
   handsome man, tall, and exactly of what is termed aristocratic bearing
   and, manners; he was also a ready speaker, with a clear ringing voice
   and graceful and imposing action. In private he was energetic and
   impetuous, but obliging in trifles, and full of vivacity and humour.
   Fortunately for him he had found a wife who entered heart and soul into
   all his plans, who travelled with him wherever he went, and managed his
   pecuniary affairs and the details of daily arrangements with a skill
   and prudence which he did not himself possess in such matters. It was
   just after his marriage that he first met with Christian David, a
   carpenter, thirty years of age, who had been born a Roman Catholic in
   Moravia; but reading by chance an evangelical book, had been converted
   and joined the Moravian Brethren. Since that time he had travelled in
   Hungary and Silesia, working at his trade; and observing how much peace
   and profitable instruction other evangelical Christians enjoyed, he had
   determined to urge his fellow-believers to emigrate into Protestant
   Germany. Just at this time he fell in with Count Zinzendorf and told
   him his wishes, and the Count immediately offered an asylum on one of
   his own estates near Dresden. Here in 1722 David felled the first tree
   and began to build the first house of what was afterwards the great
   Moravian settlement of Herrnhut. It increased rapidly; for not only did
   a number of emigrants come thither from Moravia, but many other persons
   were attracted to it, and in 1727 Zinzendorf resigned his office and
   went to live there himself, in order to superintend the growing
   community. After a time he saw that it would be necessary for him to
   take orders--an unheard-of thing then in a man of his rank--and he was
   entreated to do so by his friend [318]Spangenberg, one of the leaders
   of the new body. He accordingly travelled incognito to Stralsund,
   passed the necessary examinations, and received ordination there. It
   was on his journey home that he learnt that his opponents, who viewed
   with extreme disgust the progress of the Brethren, had procured from
   the king an edict banishing him from Saxony on a charge of spreading
   false doctrine. It was ten years before he could return home, an
   interval employed by him in incessant journeyings and preachings, from
   St. Petersburg to the West Indies. He was twice in America, and founded
   various missions there, especially among the then wholly neglected
   negro slaves; and he planted settlements of the Brethren in other parts
   of Germany, in Holland, and in England. From 1747, when the edict was
   recalled, he made Herrnhut his head-quarters, but he once spent nearly
   four years in England organizing his communities here, and he obtained
   for them the recognition of Parliament. His private life was not
   without its trials; he devoted the whole of his large fortune to the
   service of the cause, and himself died poor; he lost all his sons, and
   finally his excellent wife; but his courage never abated. He died in
   1760, and by that time the United Brethren had not only spread within
   Europe, but had developed that remarkable missionary activity by which
   they have always been honourably distinguished, and the little Church
   had already its stations in Greenland, Lapland, Guinea, the Cape of
   Good Hope, Persia, and various parts of America.

   In presence of a life of such self-devotion, achieving such results, we
   must acknowledge Zinzendorf to have been a noble apostle of the Lord;
   but it is also true that he had, as he himself says, "a genius inclined
   to extravagances," and that these sometimes hindered his usefulness.
   His watchword was, "Christ and Him Crucified," but he carried this so
   far that he saw literally nothing else in Christianity but the one fact
   of the atoning sufferings of the Saviour. The life of Christ, the
   fatherhood of God, the morality of the Gospel, were all obscured to him
   behind this one central doctrine; nay, he allowed himself to speak of
   them in a way that is most jarring, and that drew down on him severe
   censure from so warmly religious a man as Bengel. But it is to his
   credit that he profited by Bengel's attack, and modified his most
   extreme views, and the formal dogmatic expression of the Brethren's
   faith was left by him to his calmer and more sagacious friend
   Spangenberg. On hymnology the Moravians have had a powerful influence;
   Zinzendorf himself, all the members of his family, and most of the
   early leaders of the Brethren wrote hymns; singing was a prominent part
   of their worship, and they early began publishing hymn-books. These
   contained some of the old classical hymns, much abridged and altered to
   meet the taste of the new Church, and a large proportion of what are
   called "Brethren-hymns." The characteristics of the latter are a fervid
   affection and gratitude to the Saviour, a spirit of happy, childlike
   confidence, and a strong sentiment of Christian fellowship; but in many
   cases their poetical merit is not great, and they sometimes degenerate
   into a mere dwelling on physical sufferings, and a childish and
   extravagant style of expression. This was especially the case with many
   of the older hymns, which were afterwards rejected from their later
   collections; some by Zinzendorf himself were among the worst offenders.
   [36] His [319]hymns, of which he wrote more than two thousand, are of
   exceedingly different value; some are fantastic and irreverent, some
   mere rhymed prose, others again have a real sweetness, fervour, and
   song in them. Among the best are the following; the first is taught in
   almost every religious German household to its children:--

   Jesu, day by day

   Lead us on life's way:

   Nought of dangers will we reckon,

   Simply haste where Thou dost beckon;

   Lead us by the hand

   To our fatherland.


   Hard should seem our lot,

   Let us waver not:

   Never murmur at our crosses

   In dark days of grief and losses;

   'Tis through trial here

   We must reach Thy sphere.


   When the heart must know

   Pain for others' woe,

   When beneath its own 'tis sinking,

   Give us patience, hope unshrinking,

   Fix our eyes, O Friend,

   On our journey's end.


   Thus our path shall be

   Daily traced by Thee;

   Draw Thou nearer when 'tis rougher,

   Help us most when most we suffer,

   And when all is o'er

   Such the King will stoop to and embrace,

   Who when they no hope or path can trace,

   Sink at His feet,

   And grace and guidance from His hand entreat.


   Such the King with blessing will secure,

   Who when they behold one scorned and poor,

   Who is Christ's own,

   Revere him more than princes on a throne.


   Such the King will evermore defend,

   Who accept the burden He doth send,

   And calmly sit,

   Trusting to Him to raise it when 'tis fit.


   Such the King will ever deign to teach,

   Who can profit e'en by children's speech,

   And gladly know

   That they are only learners here below.

   [36] Many of these hymns speak of the blood and wounds of Jesus, or
   making a bed in His wounded side, &c. in a way of which it is really
   impossible to give instances.

  Albertini

   Of the Moravian hymn-writers, the best are [322]Louisa von Hayn, a
   convert of [323]Zinzendorf's, and for many years the superintendent of
   the Unmarried Sisters' House at Herrnhut; [324]Christian Gregor, the
   next bishop of the Church after [325]Spangenberg, who wrote that
   touching hymn, "[326]Ah, dearest Lord! to feel that Thou art near;"
   [327]Albertini, his successor in the episcopal office, who died in
   1831; and [328]Garve, who died in 1842. Of these Albertini ranks the
   highest as a poet; he was a man of great and varied learning, and a
   friend of Schleiermacher's, who asked to have [329]Albertini's hymns
   read to him on his death-bed. We give one:--

THE VIRGIN'S LAMP.

   Brenne hell du Lampe meiner Seele

   [330]Albertini

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Lamp within me! brightly burn and glow,

   Draw thy flame from Jesu's heart,

   Whence a living fire doth ever flow,

   Clearer flaming 'mid the sorest smart;

   I will guard thy flame in stillness meek,

   Nought so eagerly shall bid me seek

   Him who can my wants supply,

   As the fear thy light should die.


   He will quench it not, but haste to pour

   Oil from His exhaustless cruse;

   Then the soul is filled with light once more

   And the twilight's terrors she doth lose;

   Safe she walks on her illumined way

   Through the midnight, till the Voice shall say,

   "Lo! the Bridegroom and the feast are near;

   Virgins, haste to meet Him, He is here."


   Well for those who in His strength have lived,

   Pure as He is pure within;

   Who with deep abhorrence aye have grieved

   O'er the slightest taint of sin,

   Hearts that trembled at the smallest spot,

   And till cleansed and pardoned, rested not;

   Theirs the light that hath no shade,

   Theirs the wreath that cannot fade.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Pietism in its original shape had done its work. Its defects had become
   much more apparent in the second and third generation than they were at
   first; its tendency to fix the attention of the Christian within, on
   his own states of feeling and chances of salvation, produced in some
   cases, when Pietism had become fashionable and profitable, a
   hypocritical simulation of such feelings; in others a timid anxious
   tone of mind, inclined to morbid self-scrutiny and religious
   melancholy. Its discouragement of many legitimate forms of occupation
   as well as of recreation, which it stigmatized as worldly,
   incapacitated it from keeping abreast of the new tide of intellectual
   activity which rolled through Germany towards the end of the eighteenth
   century; it had no place in its scheme of life for the new learning,
   and art, and science. And for a time it seemed swept aside, but it had
   in it a germ of true and deep spiritual life, and this never died out;
   it was handed down through a Lavater, a [331]Claudius, a Jung Stilling,
   an [332]Arndt, a Falk, till in our own days it is blossoming again in
   vast works of Christian charity, which can spring only from a life
   rooted through Christ in God.

CHAPTER XIII.
MODERN TIMES.
1750-1850.

   The religious poetry of Germany underwent a change in the course of
   this eighteenth century; it ceased to consist primarily of
   congregational hymns, and assumed the forms of the irregular lyric, the
   ode, and the epic. We have seen something of this change in the poems
   of [333]Tersteegen and [334]Arnold; it meets us more strongly in those
   of [335]Gellert, [336]Cramer, and [337]Klopstock. The spirit of that
   age was not favourable to hymn-writing; for really good hymns must have
   in them something of the nature of the popular song; they must have its
   warmth, movement and melody; they must spring from a cordial,
   unquestioning faith, which has no misgivings about the response it will
   evoke from other hearts. The critical doubting religion of the
   eighteenth century, which even in its more earnest forms felt itself
   continually obliged to stand on the defensive, could not produce such
   hymns; nor could its stiff and artificial style furnish them with a
   fitting expression. The poetical diction of this time is indeed
   remarkably deficient in variety of rhythm and in musical flow; the
   traditional forms of metre and rhyme itself were despised, and great
   efforts were made to introduce new measures, of which but one, the
   hexameter, took any root. But the old mastery over lyrical forms which
   distinguished German poetry in the days of its Minne-singers, the
   ringing melody which marked its popular songs, were quite lost; and we
   meet with nothing like them till we reach the days of Goethe. Even the
   classical hymns, though consecrated by association, could no longer
   satisfy the more pedantic taste of the age, and there sprang up a
   perfect mania for altering them, and for making new collections of such
   modernised versions for the various States. These alterations generally
   consisted in watering down the old vigour,--substituting "virtue" for
   "holiness" or "faith," "the Supreme Being" for "our faithful God," and
   so on;--and in planing away little unevennesses of metre so as to
   reduce hymns and tunes alike to a correct and tiresome flatness. A
   large proportion of the State hymn-books still in use date from this
   period.

  Roman Catholic Hymns

   The one great step that was made in German hymnology at this time was
   the official introduction of vernacular hymns into the Roman Catholic
   churches of Southern Germany and Austria. Many collections of hymns had
   already been made for private use; but now under the Emperor Joseph II.
   portions of the service of the mass itself were translated into German
   verse, and sung by the people while the priest was officiating; and
   even where the "Vienna Mass," as it was called, was not used, hymns in
   the mother-tongue were assigned to the various services and festivals.
   The collections of hymns thus called into existence contain naturally a
   large proportion of translations from the Latin; they also possess a
   smaller number of original compositions, of which some have great
   sweetness and devotional feeling, while others are weak and
   overwrought; and they include a good many of the Evangelical hymns,
   modified where necessary to suit their new position.

   The antagonism between the Roman Catholic and Protestant Churches which
   had been so fierce during the previous age, and which in another form
   has revived in our own, had in fact almost died out. The difference was
   regarded as one rather of birth and geographical position than of
   conviction; conversions from one Church to the other were generally
   censured as acts of disloyalty, but mixed marriages were common; while
   really serious Christians in either communion felt themselves strongly
   drawn together by the possession of a common faith in a time of
   scepticism. Thus a cordial and intimate correspondence on religious
   subjects was maintained between a circle of pious Protestants in
   Hamburg, of which [338]Claudius and the Stolbergs were members, and
   similar circles on the Rhine and in Bavaria, which were composed of
   distinguished Roman Catholics, such as the Prince-Primate Dalberg, the
   Princess Galitzin, and others. During the latter half of this century,
   Southern Germany possessed several Roman Catholics of high position and
   great abilities, who were also men of deep evangelical piety and strong
   national feeling, anxious to reform abuses within their own Church.
   Such men were Sailer, long a professor at Dillingen and Landshut and
   finally Bishop of Ratisbon, his great friend Feneberg, pastor of Seeg
   in Bavaria, and Von Wessenberg, the friend and coadjutor of Dalberg,
   and his successor in the bishopric of Constance. All three wrote hymns,
   which, if not of the first order, are yet good, earnest, and
   thoughtful; and all warmly promoted the use of such hymns in their own
   language among the people, both at home and in public worship.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Christian Fürchtegott Gellert

   Among the writers whose hymns were thus used by both Churches was
   [339]Christian Fürchtegott Gellert, the immense popularity of whose
   writings in their own age shows how exactly they must have fulfilled
   its requirements. His life was uneventful enough. Born in 1715 in
   Saxony, the son of a country clergyman, he studied at the university of
   Leipsic, became a private tutor, and afterwards professor of poetry and
   moral philosophy there; and never left the city except for occasional
   visits to the baths and once to Berlin, until his death in 1769, at the
   age of fifty-four. In 1742, when he was a young man of
   seven-and-twenty, he joined with a number of his friends in bringing
   out a periodical called the "Contributions from Bremen" (Bremer
   Beiträge) which created a great sensation as being the first successful
   rebellion against the domination of Gottsched and the French school.
   Most of the men engaged in it were of some note in their day, but only
   two or three are now remembered, and among these [340]Klopstock towers
   far above the rest. Gellert's contributions consisted of fables told
   with a spirit and fluency which made their humour and point all the
   more penetrating. He also wrote comedies, and his lectures at the
   university were famed for their charm of style and manner no less than
   for their clearness of thought and moral influence. Yet his life was
   not a joyous one: he suffered incessantly from ill health and from
   attacks of hypochondria that was held in check only by his real piety
   and excellence of conduct. For Gellert was a deeply religious man,
   though rather of the old orthodox than of the pietistic type; he was a
   most regular attendant on religious services, and a great reader of
   devotional works. In 1757 he published a volume of fifty-four poems
   under the title of "Spiritual Odes and Songs," which were received with
   an enthusiasm almost like that which greeted Luther's hymns on their
   first appearance. His lectures also, and his habit of interesting
   himself warmly in the personal conduct and welfare of his students,
   gave him a remarkable influence over young men, who afterwards carried
   the impression received in his class-room into every part of Germany.
   Lessing and Goethe were each in turn among his pupils, but his tendency
   to melancholy and sentimentality, and his somewhat formal and precise
   genius, were to them very uncongenial. Yet Goethe, much the more kindly
   critic of the two, says: "The reverence and affection which Gellert
   received from all the young men was extraordinary. His lecture-room was
   always crowded to the utmost; and Gellert's beautiful soul, purity of
   will, his admonitions, warnings and entreaties, delivered in a somewhat
   hollow and sad voice, produced a deep impression. A figure not tall,
   but slender without being thin, soft rather mournful eyes, a very
   beautiful brow, all rendered his presence agreeable." Nor was his
   influence confined to his class-room: a peasant one day laid a load of
   firewood at his door as a thank-offering for the pleasure derived from
   his fables; a young Prussian officer sent him a sum of money,
   entreating him to accept the gift from one whose heart had been raised
   by his writings; and these were but instances of innumerable similar
   presents which Gellert used generally to bestow on the poor. Princes
   and great people of all kinds made pilgrimages to see him; even
   Frederick the Great had an interview with him, and pronounced him the
   most reasonable German professor he had ever come across. The general
   tone of his writings is that of a sincere Christian morality, kindly
   and a little formal, not very elevated or enthusiastic, but pure and
   honest, and coloured by a rather sentimental and pathetic view of life
   in general. His [341]hymns, for the composition of which he always
   prepared himself by prayer, are correct and moderate, yet with a
   certain earnestness and pathos; and though it is now the fashion to
   depreciate them as much as they were once admired, there is a merit not
   to be ignored in their rational piety and quiet good taste.

THE SOLACE OF THE LIFE TO COME.

   Nach einer Prüfung kurzer Tage

   [342]Christian Fürchtegott Gellert

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   When these brief trial-days are spent,

   There dawns a glad eternity;

   There, lost in measureless content,

   Our tears and sorrows cease to be;

   Here Virtue toils with earnest care,

   Her glorious crown awaits her there.


   True that the godly man may know

   Some happy moments e'en on earth;

   But joy is transient here below,

   Imperfect all and little worth;

   He is a man, and in his breast

   Peace will but ebb and flow at best:


   Now marred by sickness or by pain,

   Now by the world's incessant noise,

   Now by the foes that yet remain

   Within him, whom no care destroys;

   Now others from without impose

   The burden of their faults and woes.


   For here, where virtue oft is sad,

   And vice as oft in splendour shines,

   Where envy still pursues the glad,

   And sorrow in oblivion pines,

   Here man can nevermore be free

   From grief, nor from infirmity.


   Here I must seek, there I shall find;

   For there shall Virtue all unfold

   Before my holier purer mind

   Her worth so great, so manifold;

   The God of Love, whom I adore,

   I there shall worship more and more.


   There shall His wise, foreseeing will

   Be all my joy, my choice alone;

   And loveliness and rapture fill

   My happy soul before His throne;

   While ever-new delights are given,

   To bid me feel that this is heaven.


   There in that light shall I discern

   What here on earth I dimly saw,

   Those deep and wondrous counsels learn

   Whose mystery filled me here with awe;

   There trace with gratitude intense

   The hidden links of Providence.


   There at the footstool of my King,

   Where glimpses of His Face I gain,

   Shall I the "Holy, Holy," sing,

   Unto the Lamb that once was slain,

   While Cherubim and Seraphim

   And all the heavens are praising Him.


   Amid the holy angels placed,

   Like them in holy happy mood,

   Shall I the unmixed pleasure taste

   Of godly converse with the good,

   When each the other's rapture shares,

   Their joy is mine, my gladness theirs.


   And there shall I at last repay

   With million blessings on his head,

   The guide who taught me first God's way

   And bade me boldly in it tread;

   There shall I find the friend once more

   I found and treasured here of yore.


   Perchance,--ah would that this might be!--

   Will some blest soul in that abode

   Cry, "Hail! for thou hast rescued me

   And won my heart to heaven and God!"

   O God, what exquisite delight

   To save a soul from sin and night!


   Then what are ye, brief woes of Time,

   When weighed with glory such as this,

   Destined to be our lot sublime

   From age to age of endless bliss?

   How nought, how merely nought appears

   This moment full of cares and fears!
     __________________________________________________________________

  Cramer

   Another favourite religious poet of this time was [343]Johann Andreas
   Cramer, who was a friend of both [344]Gellert and [345]Klopstock. He
   was a man of high character and considerable ability, who was
   considered in his day to be the greatest pulpit orator in Germany; for
   many years he was court-preacher at Copenhagen when Count Bernstorff
   was in power, and he died as chancellor of the university of Kiel in
   1788 at the age of sixty-five. As a poet he does not hold a very high
   place; his [346]poems resemble those of [347]Gellert, but have less
   sweetness and feeling, and are more definitely didactic; they are,
   however, characteristic as embodying one type of the religion of this
   period, a type strongly contrasting with that of [348]Zinzendorf,
   somewhat frigid and Deistic rather than Christian in its aspect, yet
   retaining a sincere attachment to Christianity and accepting it as an
   authoritative revelation from God. Cramer's favourite themes are the
   wisdom and goodness of God in nature and providence; the immortality of
   the soul,--not heaven, for he does not picture the future life to
   himself, but brings forward very good arguments for a belief in its
   existence; and the inculcation of specific Christian duties, such as
   cheerfulness, purity, usefulness, &c., in poems which at least have the
   merit of very good sense and sound morality. From the latter we choose
   the following poem on
     __________________________________________________________________

THE DUTY OF THE SCHOLAR.

   Die ihr, des Lebens edle zeit


   O ye, who from your earliest youth

   Seek wisdom and would learn the truth,

   Happy are ye if ye discern

   Falsehood from Truth in all ye learn!


   If ye with bold and eager mind

   Cast prejudice and fear behind,

   That so the Truth may set you free

   From dreams and Error's slavery!


   If to your comprehensive thought,

   The lore that ancient sages taught

   Is but the stepping-stone to more

   And deeper truths unknown before!


   Nor suffer fame to be your goal,

   Still less to break the wise control

   Of law and duty; seek aright

   To grow more perfect through more light.


   Whoe'er on God's great works can cast

   A clearer light than in the past,

   And teach new eyes with awe to see

   Their wonders,--ah, how happy he!


   Learn ever clearer what adorns,

   Ennobles life, and blunts its thorns

   What in each nation, every State,

   Has brought it low or made it great.


   Learn too what shames us, what is base,

   Virtue's whole worth and beauty trace,

   Here and hereafter what the source

   Of joys that cannot bring remorse.


   And never deign to make for Vice

   A league with Error, or with lies;

   Nor speak of Truth with careless scorn,

   For every truth of God is born.


   Whate'er ye learn, rejoice to share

   With others, show them every snare

   On learning's path where men have tript,

   Be honest where yourselves have slipt.


   Forget not ye must live for aye,

   Study not only for to-day,

   Think of the reckoning ye must give,

   And wisely, virtuously live.


   All truth is God's as He is true,

   Whate'er ye know He shows it you,

   So let your knowledge as it grows

   Draw you to Him more near and close.


   Happy indeed is such a sage,

   He shall be lionoured in his age,

   And fame shall follow where he trod,

   For he, he is a light from God.

  Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock

   Portrait of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock

   KLOPSTOCK

   [349]Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock was born at Quedlinburg in 1724. His
   father was an official under the Government--a clever, upright,
   crotchety man, given to a belief in ghosts and the devil, with whom he
   considered himself to have had many personal encounters, but a man who
   brought up his ten children to be honest and hardy, religious and
   patriotic. Klopstock was educated at a celebrated school at
   Schulpforta, where he remained till he was twenty-one, and where he
   already conceived the idea of his great epic the "Messiah." The thought
   that France and England had so far surpassed Germany in literature,
   filled him even as a boy with indignation, and he solemnly resolved
   that he would produce some great work which should do his country
   honour. Various subjects, such as the story of King Arthur, or of the
   early German hero, Henry the Fowler, floated before his mind, but at
   last it flashed on him that the work of Redemption was the noblest
   subject on which the human pen could be employed. Not long afterwards
   Milton's "Paradise Lost" fell into his hands; he read it with rapture,
   and was more than ever confirmed in his choice of a theme. From
   Schulpforta he went to Leipsic, where he soon became intimate with the
   set of young men who were bringing out the "Contributions from Bremen."
   They urged him to join them, but he declined from modesty, until one
   day one of his friends named Schmidt drew out of a chest full of linen
   a manuscript, which proved to be the first three cantos of the
   "Messiah." Schmidt instantly carried them off to [350]Cramer; the
   friends read them with delight, and insisted on publishing them in the
   "Contributions" for 1748. Several of his odes also appeared in the same
   volume, and the young Klopstock found himself suddenly famous all over
   Germany. In 1750 he was invited to Zurich, and was honoured and
   caressed to the utmost in what was then the most literary town in
   Switzerland. Throughout life he was a man of singularly pure and
   amiable character, and at this time he had much wit and liveliness,
   with a keen enjoyment of athletic sports, especially of skating, which
   from his example and praises became quite a rage in Germany during the
   next twenty years. The consciousness of the great work in which he was
   engaged gave him however, as Goethe tells us, a certain dignity and
   self-control of manner which in later years, when the vivacity of youth
   was gone, increased to a sort of measured diplomatic courtliness. It
   was about this time that he wrote most of his love poems and odes,
   inspired by a hopeless passion for Fanny, the sister of his friend
   Schmidt. But ere long he consoled himself. It was in 1751 that Count
   Bernstorff, then prime minister to the King of Denmark, invited him to
   reside at Copenhagen, and offered him a pension, which should enable
   him to complete the "Messiah" undisturbed by pecuniary cares. Klopstock
   accepted it, and on his way northwards made the acquaintance at Hamburg
   of a certain Meta Moller, the daughter of a merchant, a clever,
   ardent-minded girl, who was a correspondent of Richardson and Young,
   and had already conceived a great admiration for the author of the
   "Messiah." A correspondence ensued, which terminated in 1754 in a
   marriage. Nothing could be happier than this union, but it lasted
   little more than four years, when Meta died in childbirth. Her death
   was a terrible blow to Klopstock, and for a time seems to have diverted
   his thoughts altogether from his great work. Ten cantos had already
   been given to the world, but during the next nine years, when Klopstock
   was a man between thirty and forty, only minor poems appeared, chiefly
   of a religious character.

   After Meta's death he lived in Count Bernstorff's house, but he was in
   the habit of spending long periods of time among his friends in or near
   Hamburg; and on the retirement of Bernstorff in 1770, he removed there
   altogether, and took up his abode in the house of a Herr von Winthem,
   who had married Meta's niece. Hamburg was at this time a sort of
   literary capital of Germany, and more particularly of its northern
   half, as Weimar became some years later. Lessing and Klopstock, then
   the greatest names in German literature, made it their residence;
   Herder visited it occasionally; and a number of lesser lights, such as
   Voss, [351]Claudius, Reimarus, the Stolbergs, &c. gathered round the
   chief luminaries. Klopstock enjoyed a sort of reverence not unlike that
   paid to Dr. Johnson in England, but in some respects more flattering,
   as he was a man of whom it was much easier to make a popular, and
   especially a ladies' hero. Here the "Messiah" was at last completed in
   1773; a complete edition of his odes and lyrics was brought out; and
   here he devoted the autumn of his long life to the study and
   purification of the German language and its grammar. He had always been
   a passionate lover of his country, but this did not prevent him from
   taking the keenest interest in the American War of Independence and the
   opening of the French Revolution. He was among those who, like our own
   Wordsworth, hailed its earlier years with eager sympathy and the hope
   of a coming brighter era for humanity, and who afterwards underwent the
   bitterness of profound disappointment. The National Assembly had marked
   their recognition of his friendship for the French people by according
   him the rights of a French citizen; but when the terrible massacres of
   1793 took place he sent back to them his diploma.

   In his sixty-seventh year he married for the second time, choosing the
   Frau von Winthem, who had meanwhile become a widow, and who survived
   him. He died in 1803, in his seventy-ninth year, retaining all the
   vigour of his faculties to the last, and was buried by Hamburg with
   royal honours.

  The Messiah

   The "Messiah," which as we have seen occupied twenty-seven years in its
   composition, is a poem in twenty cantos, written in hexameters except
   where certain choral songs occur in the unrhymed lyrical measures
   employed by Klopstock for his odes. The action opens after the
   triumphal entry into Jerusalem, when the Messiah withdraws from the
   people, and alone on the Mount of Olives renews His solemn vow to the
   Almighty Father to undertake the work of Redemption; it closes when
   that work is completed, and He sits down at the right hand of God.
   Around the central figure of the God-man are grouped an infinite
   variety of spectators and actors: angels and seraphs, among whom Eloa
   and Gabriel are especially appointed to attend on the Divine Sufferer;
   evil spirits who conspire against Him, but one of whom, Abbadonna,
   repents and at last obtains mercy; Adam and Eve and the patriarchs, who
   watch with profound interest and gratitude the reparation of the Fall;
   and the inhabitants of another world, like in nature to man, but
   unfallen, who are permitted to know what is taking place among their
   sinful kindred. Even the Father himself is introduced as speaking, and
   the scene is sometimes laid in the highest heaven. The earthly actors
   are the mother and disciples of Jesus, the Jews and the Romans who lead
   Him to death, and a number of those who have come in contact with Him
   in His ministrations, among whom the most clearly drawn are two female
   figures, both named Cidli: one, the wife of Gedor, is a reminiscence of
   Meta, and her death is an exact transcript of Meta's deathbed; the
   other is the daughter of Jairus, between whom and Semida, the youth of
   Nain, there exists a pure but ardent attachment, which at last finds
   satisfaction in heaven. The immense number of personages thus
   introduced produces a confusing impression; everything is described by
   one or other of them, and talked over at length; scarcely anything
   actually takes place before the reader; there is an absence of local
   colouring and of character, and very few of the actors have any
   distinct individuality at all; while the effort to keep the whole tone
   of the poem at the highest possible pitch of intensity and awe gives
   rise to an overstrained inflation of both thought and style, which
   becomes in the long-run inexpressibly fatiguing. Yet Klopstock's poem
   has made for itself and for him a place in the literature of his
   country which does not depend on the number of readers it now attracts.
   Its subject is linked by a thousand invisible fibres to the whole
   Christian thought of centuries past, while its spirit of mercy,
   forgiveness, and tolerance, of Redemption in a word, is essentially
   characteristic of the later developments of Christianity. To treat such
   a theme worthily at all--to embody it in a form which, however full of
   defects, yet possesses a certain dignity and real genius--marks its
   author as a great poet, if not one of the greatest, and gives him a
   place historically even higher perhaps than he has a right to command
   as an artist.

   Klopstock also wrote scriptural dramas, which, however, speedily fell
   into oblivion. Much finer are his odes, which indeed show the most fire
   and originality of any of his works; though some of these too suffer
   from their length and elaboration. He also recast, not always very
   successfully, many of the older hymns, and composed a number of his
   own, of which a good many are adopted into the hymn-books, though in
   general their style is too stilted and declamatory to be genuinely
   popular. As specimens we give one of his odes, one of his psalms, and a
   hymn: it is impossible within a short compass to give extracts from the
   "Messiah" which could really convey any idea of the work. [37]

THE VISION OF GOD.

   Zitternd freu' ich mich


   Trembling I rejoice

   Nor should dare to believe,

   Were not the Promiser

   God the Eternal!

   For I know it, I feel it,

   I am a sinner!

   I must know it, and feel it,

   E'en had not light from God

   Streamed on my conscience, and shown

   My soul to herself,

   Clearly unveiling

   Her form that sin hath wounded and defaced.


   With low-bended knee,

   With deep adoring amazement,

   I rejoice:

   I shall behold Him!

   Soul, ever drawing nearer the body's grave,

   Thyself immortal,

   Pursue this all-divinest thought

   Which thy thought can conceive.

   Not that thou darest

   To enter yet into the holiest place!

   Within that sanctuary dwell

   Joys unconceived, unpraised, unsung as yet.

   Only from far I hail one mild and softened beam,

   Softened to let me live;

   One gleam that earthly darkness tempers here,

   Of glory I may see.


   How great the Prophet was who dared implore,

   "If I have found grace in Thy sight, now let me

   Behold Thy glory!"

   So to the Infinite might pray, and find a hearing!

   To the land of Golgotha came he not,

   An earlier death avenged the fault

   That once, but once, his God he trusted not;

   How great the Prophet shows this very doom!

   Him the Father concealed in a deep gloom of the mountain,

   When before a mortal passed the Glory of the Son;

   When the trumpet was silent on Sinai

   And the voice of the thunder, as God spake of God.

   No longer wrapt in night,

   But in a daylight's splendour

   That needs no shadows to enhance its brightness,

   He now beholds, so we believe, for ages already

   Far o'er the limits of Time,

   Unconscious of moments that ever

   Are followed by moments,--he gazes

   On Thee, O Holy, Holy, Holy Lord!


   Most nameless delight of my soul,

   Thought of the Vision to come,

   Thou art my mighty Reliance,

   Thou art the Rock, whereon I stand and gaze up to heaven,

   When the terrors of Sin

   And the terrors of Death

   Fearfully threaten

   To whelm me below!

   Upon this Rock, O Thou

   Whom now the dead in God behold,

   Let me stand when the power

   Of Death irresistibly hems me around!


   Arise, O my soul, above this mortality,

   Look up and gaze, and thou wilt behold

   The Father's Brightness

   Beam from the Face of Jesus Christ.

   Hosanna! Hosanna! the fulness of the Godhead

   Dwells in the Man Jesus Christ!

   Scarce ringeth the Cherubims' harp here, it quivers,

   Scarce sound on their voices, they tremble, they tremble!

   Hosanna! Hosanna!

   The Godhead in fulness

   Dwells in the Man

   Jesus Christ.

   Even then, when one of the beams from God to our world

   Illumined more clearly the prophecy, when 'twas fulfilled,

   When He was despised and afflicted

   As no son of man had been despised and afflicted before,

   E'en then, mortals could not discern,

   But the Cherubim saw

   The Father's Brightness

   In the countenance of the Son.


   I see, I see him, that witness,

   Seven long appalling midnights

   Hath he doubted, and painfully wrestled

   With the saddest of sorrows.

   I see him!

   To him appeareth the Risen One,

   He layeth his hands in the print of the wounds,

   Heaven and earth are vanishing round him:

   He beholds the Father's Brightness in the Face of the Son,

   I hear, I hear him! he cries--

   Heaven and earth are vanishing round him--he cries:

   My Lord and my God!

PSALM. [38]

   [Matt 6:9-14]

   Um Erden wandeln Monde


   Round their planets roll the moons,

   Planets round their sun,

   All the hosts of suns revolve

   Round one mighty Sun,

   Thee "Our Father," Thee "who art in heaven!"


   On all these worlds, light-beaming, light-receiving,

   Are dwelling souls of diverse powers and forms,

   But all contemplate God, rejoice in God:

   "Hallowed be Thy name!"


   But He the Highest who alone

   Can wholly know Himself,

   Wholly rejoice in God, 'twas He conceived

   The scheme profound to bless all creature-minds:

   "Thy kingdom come!"


   O well for them that He, and not themselves,

   Orders their Present, and their Future too;

   O well for them, and well for us! "Thy will

   Be done on earth, as 'tis in heaven," O God!


   He lifts the ear upon its golden stalk,

   Matures the blushing apple, purple grape;

   Pastures the lamb upon the field,

   The wild-deer in the woods:

   But His thunder rolleth around,

   And its bolts may beat down the corn and the bough,

   May destroy in the fields and the woods!

   Then, "Give us to-day our daily bread!"


   Perchance that high above the thunder's course

   Sinners and mortals dwell like those on earth?

   There too the friend may change to foe?

   There too the dearest part in death?

   "Forgive us," Lord, "our debts

   As we forgive our debtors."


   Various the paths to one exalted goal,

   To endless happiness:

   Through lonely wastes there are that wind their course,

   Yet e'en on these, some joys beside the way

   Will blossom and refresh the fainting soul:

   "Lead us not," then, "into temptation," Lord,

   "But deliver us from evil."


   Thee we adore, who hath the central Sun

   Compassed with suns and planets and their moons;

   Who didst create all souls intelligent,

   And plan their blessedness;

   Raisest the fruitful ear, and dost command

   Or stay the bolt of death:

   Who leadest to the goal through deserts lone,

   And cheerest weary wanderers on their way

   Thee we adore!

   "For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory,

   For ever and ever! Amen!"

THE RESURRECTION.

   9,6,5,7+4

   Aufterstehn, ja aufterstehn wirst du

   [352]Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   Rise again! yes, rise again wilt thou

   My dust, though buried now!

   To life immortal

   Is this brief rest the portal:

   Hallelujah!


   For the seed is sown again to bloom

   Whene'er the Lord shall come,

   His harvest reaping

   In us who now are sleeping:

   Hallelujah!


   Day of praise, of joyful tears the Day,

   Thou of my God the Day,

   When I shall number

   My destined years of slumber,

   Thou wakenest me!


   Then shall we be like to those that dream,

   When on us breaks the beam

   Of that blest morrow;

   The weary pilgrim's sorrow

   Is then no more.


   Then the Saviour leads us of His grace

   Into the Holiest Place,

   Where we for ever

   Shall praise His Name who doth deliver!

   Hallelujah!

   taken, as the original has also a more condensed and regular rhythm.

  Modern Hymns

   With Klopstock this short survey of the course of German religious
   poetry must end. He has brought us within the entrance of that modern
   revival of literature which rendered the close of the eighteenth
   century as remarkable for its brilliancy as the opening of it had been
   for its barrenness. Germany had once more woke up to life; and perhaps
   because political and practical life offered no career to attract her
   ablest minds, their energies were all the more thrown into the field of
   thought, of literature and philosophy, criticism and research. To a
   great extent this new intellectual activity made for itself other
   channels quite apart from that peculiarly Christian form of literature
   which we have been following; yet not wholly so. Klopstock marked the
   opening of the new era by the greatest religious epic that Germany
   possesses; Herder not only wrote religious poems of merit himself, but
   did better service by his works on ancient national poetry, and
   especially that of the Hebrews, which taught men afresh what they ought
   to seek and care for in this kind of literature. The writers of the
   so-called Romantic school, and of the patriotic songs which flew over
   Germany during the wars with Napoleon, furnished a few really fine
   religious poems and hymns, such as those of [353]Novalis, [354]Ernst
   Moritz Arndt, Schenkendorf, and [355]Fouqué, whose name is best known
   to us by his lovely little romance of "Undine." Then followed a time
   which produced very little of this kind. With the exception of a few
   illustrious names--such as those of [356]Neander, [357]Rothe, Bunsen,
   or Nitzsch--the two tendencies most easily recognisable in the
   religious thought of Germany of later years have been an aggressive or
   a quietly contemptuous scepticism, confronted by a narrow and arrogant
   orthodoxy which has allied itself to whatever was least progressive in
   the political world. But by the side of these there has also been an
   undergrowth of a genuine religious life which has not as yet asserted
   itself in the field of thought, but has shown itself almost exclusively
   in that of active Christian charity and devotional feeling. It is to
   this spirit that the country owes that remarkable development of
   philanthropic agencies which find their bond of common work in the
   "Inner Mission," and no less the reform of its hymn-books, and the rise
   of a large new school of hymn-writers. Within the last thirty years the
   hymnology of Germany, both before and since the Reformation, has been
   the subject of the most careful research; several important historical
   works on the subject have been written, and many thoroughly good
   collections of hymns have been published; while even the authorized
   State hymn-books are by slow degrees sharing in the improvement. At
   present the best is that of Wurtemberg. The original religious poetry
   of the present day is very considerable in quantity, but varies much in
   character. Among the Roman Catholic writers, [358]Spee, with all the
   defects no less than the beauties of his style, affords the most
   frequent model, while the most usual theme is the praise of Mary. The
   Evangelical authors, on the other hand, take the earlier Lutheran
   school for their pattern in congregational "church-songs," and if they
   do not attain quite the force and condensed pregnancy of the classical
   hymns, they have at least much sweetness, earnestness, and simplicity;
   while their poems not intended for congregational use are often
   graceful and touching. The best among them are those of [359]Spitta,
   [360]Knapp, [361]Victor Strauss, and Gerok, [362]Louise Hensel and Meta
   Haüszer.

  Friedrich Rückert

   Of the recent lyrical poets of Germany, one of the most distinguished,
   Friedrich Rückert, [39] is a religious as well as a secular poet, and
   with two of his poems we will wind up this long series of Christian
   singers. It began, a thousand years ago, with the monk whose great work
   was to present the Life of Christ to the German people in their own
   tongue; it ends with the modern lyric poet and scholar whose favourite
   study has been the wisdom of the Brahmins and Persians, and who yet
   finds that all these centuries have not exhausted the meaning that lies
   in Bethlehem and Calvary.

MIDNIGHT.

   Um Mitternacht bin ich erwacht

   [363]Friedrich Rückert

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   At dead of night

   Sleep took her flight.

   I gazed abroad, no star of all the crowds the clouds

   That people heaven, was smiling through

   To cheer my sight

   That dreary night.


   At dead of night

   I scaled the height

   Of giddy question o'er our mortal lot;

   My searchings found no answer, brought me not

   One ray of light

   In that deep night.


   At dead of night

   In still affright

   I turned and listened to my throbbing heart;

   One pulse of pain alone, whose ancient smart

   Had dimmed sweet light,

   Beat there that night.


   At dead of night

   I fought the fight

   Humanity, of all thy pain and woes;

   My strength could not decide it, and my foes

   O'erwhelmed me quite

   At dead of night.


   At dead of night

   All power and might

   I yielded, Lord of life and death, to Thee,

   And learnt Thou watchedst with me, and that we

   Are in Thy sight

   In deepest night!

BETHLEHEM AND CALVARY.

   Er ist in Bethlehem geboren

   [364]Friedrich Rückert

   trans. by Catherine Winkworth, 1869


   In Bethlehem the Lord was born

   Whose birth has brought us life and light,

   On Calvary that death of scorn

   He died, that broke Death's cruel might:

   I wandered from a western strand

   And sought through many an eastern land,

   Yet found I greater nought than ye,

   O Bethlehem and Calvary!


   Ye wonders of the ancient world,

   How hath your pomp been swept away,

   And earthly strength to ruin hurled

   By power that knows not of decay!

   I saw them scattered far and wide,

   The ruined heaps on every side;

   But lowly glory still I see

   Round Bethlehem and Calvary.


   Ye Pyramids are but a tomb

   Wherein did toiling mortals build

   Death's utter darkness; 'tis his gloom,

   Not peace, wherewith your depths are filled.

   Ye Sphinxes, to the world of old

   Could Life's enigma ne'er unfold;

   'Tis solved for ages yet to be

   In Bethlehem and Calvary!


   O Syria's earthly Paradise,

   Fair Schiraz' gardens of the rose,

   Ye palmy plains 'neath Indian skies,

   Ye shores where soft the spice-wind blows,

   Death stalks through all that looks so fair,

   I trace his shadow everywhere;

   Look up, and Life's true Fountain see

   In Bethlehem and Calvary!


   Thou Kaaba, black desert-stone,

   Against which half the world to-day

   Still stumbles, strive to keep thy throne

   Lit by Thy Crescent's pallid ray;

   The moon before the sun must pale,

   That brighter Sign shall yet prevail,

   Of Him whose cry of victory

   Is Bethlehem and Calvary!


   O Thou, who didst not once disdain

   The childish form, the Manger poor;

   Who once to take from us our pain

   All pain didst on the Cross endure;

   Pride to Thy Manger cannot bend,

   Thy Cross doth haughty minds offend,

   But lowly hearts draw close to Thee

   In Bethlehem and Calvary!


   The Kings approach, to worship there

   The Paschal Lamb, the Shepherd race;

   And thitherwards the nations fare

   As pilgrims to the Holy Place;

   The storm of warfare on them breaks,

   The World but not the Cross it shakes,

   When East and West in strife ye see

   For Bethlehem and Calvary.


   O not like those, with weaponed hand,

   But with the Spirit let us go

   To conquer back the Holy Land,

   As Christ is conquering still below;

   Let beams of light on ev'ry side

   Speed as Apostles far and wide,

   Till all the Earth draws light from thee,

   O Bethlehem, O Calvary!


   With pilgrim hat and staff I went

   Afar through Orient lands to roam,

   My years of pilgrimage are spent,

   And this the word I bring you home;

   The pilgrim's staff ye need not crave

   To seek God's Cradle or His Grave,

   But seek within you, there shall be

   His Bethlehem and Calvary!


   O Heart, what helps it to adore

   His Cradle where the sunrise glows?

   Or what avail to kneel before

   The Grave whence long ago He rose?

   That He should find in thee a birth,

   That thou shouldst seek to die to earth

   And live to Him;--this, this must be

   Thy Bethlehem and Calvary!
