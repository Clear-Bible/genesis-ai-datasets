SERMON CLXXVI.

  OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, AS DISCOVERED BY NATURE AND BY REVELATION.

   But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
   who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to
   light through the gospel.--2 Tim. i. 10.

   HAVING in my three former discourses shewed what arguments natural
   reason doth furnish us with, for the immortality of our souls; I come
   now to the second thing I propounded, which is to shew what assurance
   the world had de facto, of this great principle of religion, the soul's
   immortality, before the revelation of the gospel.

   Before our Saviour's coming into the world, there were but two
   different religions; that of the heathens, and that of the Jews. The
   religion of the heathens was natural religion, corrupted and
   degenerated into idolatry: the religion of the Jews was revealed and
   instituted by God; but did suppose natural religion, and was superadded
   to it. Therefore I shall consider the heathens and the Jews distinctly.
   And,

   First, Shew what assurance the heathens had of this principle, of the
   soul's immortality.

   Secondly, What the Jews had of it.

   First, What assurance the heathens had of the soul's immortality.

   1. It is evident that there was a general inclination in mankind, even
   after its greatest corruption and degeneracy, to the belief of this
   principle; which appeal's, in that all people and nations of the world,
   after they were sunk into the greatest degeneracy, and all (except only
   the Jews) became idolaters, did universally agree in this apprehension,
   that their souls did remain after their bodies, and pass into a state
   of happiness or misery, according as they had demeaned themselves in
   this life. Not that they did generally reason themselves into this
   apprehension, by any convincing arguments, but did herein follow the
   bent and tendency of their natures, which did incline them thus to
   think. For no other reason can be given of the universal consent, even
   of the most rude and barbarous nations, in this principle, besides the
   inclination of human nature to this opinion; that is, either men come
   into the world with this notion imprinted upon their minds, or else
   (which comes all to one) the understanding of man is naturally of such
   a frame and make, that, left to itself, and the free exercise of its
   own thoughts, it will fall into this apprehension.

   2. The unlearned and common people among the heathen, seem to have had
   the truest and least wavering apprehensions in this matter; the reason
   of which seems to be plain, because their belief followed the bias and
   inclination of their nature, and they had not their natural notions
   embroiled and disordered by obscure and uncertain reasonings about it,
   as the philosophers had, whose under standings were perplexed with
   infinite niceties and objections, which never troubled the heads of the
   common people. By which means the vulgar had this advantage, that the
   natural dictates of their minds had their free course; and as they did
   not argue themselves into this principle, so neither were their natural
   hopes and fears checked and controlled by any objections to the
   contrary.

   But then this principle being only a kind of natural instinct in them,
   which did not awaken their minds by any deep consideration and
   reasoning about it, it had no great influence upon their lives.

   For as they were not much troubled with doubts concerning it, so
   neither did they deeply attend to the consequences of it: but as they
   followed the inclination of nature in the entertaining of this notion;
   so, because it was not entertained upon deep consideration, it had no
   great effect upon them.

   3. The learned among the heathen did not so generally agree in this
   principle, and those who did consent in it, were many of them more
   wavering and unsettled than the common people. Epicurus and his
   followers were peremptory in the denial of it: but, by their own
   acknowledgment, they did herein offer great violence to their natures,
   and had much ado to divest themselves of the contrary apprehension and
   fears. Therefore the poet, in the person of the Epicurean, represents
   it as a rare piece of happiness, and that which few attained to, to
   quit themselves of the notions of another state after this life:--


   Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,

   Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum

   Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.

   The stoics were very inclinable to the belief of a future state; but
   yet they almost every where speak very doubtfully of it. Seneca and
   Antoninus often speak to this purpose--that if the soul remain after
   this life, there is no doubt but that good men shall be happy, and bad
   men miserable: but whether the soul outlive the body or not, that they
   could not positively determine. Aristotle hath some express passages
   for the soul's immortality; but it seems he was not constant to himself
   in this matter, or else they have done him a great deal of wrong, who
   have wrote so many books on both sides concerning his opinion in this
   point. Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato, and many others of the most
   eminent philosophers, as Tully tells us, were full, not of assurance,
   but of very good hopes of the soul's immortality and a future state.
   Socrates, who was one of the best and wisest of all the heathens, does,
   in his discourses before his death, (as Plato relates them) support and
   bear up himself against the terrors of death, only with this
   consideration--that he was full of hopes, that when he left this world,
   he should pass into a far happier and more perfect state; that he
   should go to God, and live with him, and keep company with the spirits
   of good men: and that he is not positive and peremptory in it, is no
   argument that he doubted of this more than any thing else; for that was
   his fashion in all his discourses, to speak modestly, and with some
   show of doubting, even concerning those things whereof he had the
   greatest assurance: but this is plain, that he was so well assured of
   it, as to die cheerfully, and to leave the world without any kind of
   disturbance, upon the hopes that he had conceived of another life; and
   surely they must be pretty confident hopes, that will bear up a man's
   spirit to such a height when he comes to die. In short, he told his
   friends the morning before he died, that he had as good assurance of
   the soul's immortality as human reason could give, and that nothing but
   a Divine revelation could give him greater satisfaction. And to mention
   no more, Tully, the chief philosopher among the Romans, expresseth
   himself with a good degree of confidence in this matter. He argues
   excellently for it in several parts of his works; but particularly in
   his book De Senectute, he declares his own opinion of it, where,
   speaking to Scipio and Lælius, he says, "I do not see why I may not
   adventure to declare freely to you, what my thoughts are concerning
   death; and perhaps I may discern better than others what it is, because
   I am now by reason of my age not far from it. I believe (says he) that
   the fathers, those eminent persons, and my particular friends, are
   still alive, and that they live the life which only deserves the name
   of life." And afterward, Nec me solum ratio ac disputatio impulit ut
   ita crederem, sed nobilitas etiam summorum philosophorum et auctoritas;
   "Nor has reason only and disputation brought me to this belief, but the
   famous judgment and authority of the chief philosophers." And having
   mentioned Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato, he breaks out into this
   rapture, Oh præclarum diem quum in illud animorum concilium cetumque
   proficiscar, et cum hac turba et colluvione discedam! "Oh glorious day,
   when I shall go unto the great council and assembly of spirits, when I
   shall go out of this tumult and confusion, and quit the sink of this
   world, when I shall be gathered to all those brave spirits who have
   left this world, and meet with Cato, the greatest and best of mankind!"
   What could a Christian almost say with more extacy? And he concludes,
   Quod si in hoc erro, quod animos hominum immortales esse credam,
   libenter erro, nec mihi hunc errorem quo delector, dum vivo, extorqueri
   volo; sin mortuus, ut quidam minuti philosophi censent, nihil sentiam,
   non vereor ne hunc errorem meum mortui philosophi irrideant. "But if,
   after all, I am mistaken herein, I am pleased with my error, which I
   would not willingly part with whilst I live: and if after my death (as
   some little philosophers sup pose) I shall be deprived of all sense, I
   have no fear of being exposed and laughed at by them, for this my
   mistake, in the other world."

   Thus you see what assurance the heathens had of this principle, and
   that there was a general inclination and propension in them to the
   belief of it: and as it was not firmly and upon good grounds believed
   among the common people; so neither was it doubted of or called in
   question among them. Among the philosophers it was a matter of great
   uncertainty, being stiffly denied by some, doubted of by others; and
   those who were most inclinable to the entertainment of it, do rather
   express their desires and hopes of it, than their full assurance
   concerning it. I come therefore,

   Secondly, To the other inquiry, what assurance the Jews had of the
   soul's immortality and a future state. And of this, I shall give you an
   account in these following particulars:

   1. They had all the assurance which natural light, and the common
   reason of mankind, does ordinarily afford men concerning this matter;
   they had common to them with the, heathens, all the advantage that
   nature gives men to come to the knowledge of this truth. But that which
   I chiefly design to inquire into, is, what singular advantage they had
   above the heathens, by means of those special revelations which were
   made to them from God. Therefore,

   2. They had by Divine revelation a fuller assurance of those truths
   which have a nearer connexion with this principle, and which do very
   much tend to facilitate the belief of it; as, namely, concerning the
   providence of God, and his interesting himself particularly in the
   affairs of the world. In the history of Moses they had a satisfactory
   account of the original of the world; that God made it, and that he had
   eminently interposed in the government of it; and had given several
   eminent testimonies of his providence, in the general deluge which was
   brought upon the world, and in the dreadful particular judgment from
   heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbouring cities; in his
   special providence towards Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; in that
   series of miracles whereby their deliverance was wrought out of Egypt,
   and they were carried through the wilderness to the promised land; and
   in those two standing miracles of the fruitfulness of every sixth year,
   because the land was to rest the seventh; and preserving the land from
   the invasion of enemies, when they came up to Jerusalem three times a
   year; by which God did testify a very particular and immediate
   providence toward them. Now, whatever gives assurance of God's
   providence, does very much facilitate the belief of a future state.
   Epicurus was well aware of the connexion of these principles, and
   therefore, in order to the freeing of the minds of men from the fears
   of a future state, he makes way for it by removing the providence of
   God, and denying that he either made the world, or concerned himself in
   the government of it.

   And then, besides this, the Jews had assurance of the existence of
   spirits by the more immediate ministry of angels among them. And this
   does directly make way for the belief of an immaterial principle, and
   consequently of the soul's immortality. And this the Sadducees, who
   were a kind of Epicureans among the Jews, were sensible of; and,
   therefore, as they said that there was no resurrection, and no future
   state after this life, so they denied that there was either angel or
   spirit, as the apostle tells us. (Acts xxiii. 7.) From whence by the
   way we may take notice of the great mistake of those, who, from the
   opinion of the Sadducees, argue that eternal life was not at all
   believed under the Old Testament; because, if it had been so, it is not
   credible that it would have been disowned by those who acknowledged the
   authority of those books; whereas we see that they denied, to serve
   their hypo thesis, other things which were most expressly revealed in
   the Old Testament--as, the doctrine of angels and spirits.

   .3. There were some remarkable instances of the Old Testament, which
   did tend very much to persuade men to this truth: I mean the instances
   of Enoch and Elias, who did not die like other men, but were
   translated, and taken up into heaven in an extraordinary manner. From
   which instances it was obvious to considerate men, to reason, that God
   did intend by these examples to encourage good men with the hopes of
   another state after this life. And accordingly the apostle to the
   Hebrews makes the belief of future rewards, a necessary consequence
   from this instance of Enoch's translation. (Heb. xi. 5, 6.) "By faith
   Enoch was translated, that he should not see death, and was not found,
   because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this
   testimony, that he pleased God. But without faith it is impossible to
   please him: for he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and
   that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."

   4. This was typified and shadowed forth to them by the legal
   administrations. The whole economy of their worship and temple, of
   their rites and ceremonies, and sabbaths, did shadow out some farther
   thing to them, though in a very obscure manner: the land of Canaan, and
   their coming to the possession of it, after so many years travail in
   the wilderness, did represent that heavenly inheritance which good men
   should be possessed of after the troubles of this life. And these were
   intended by God to signify those greater and better things to them, and
   so understood by those who were more devout and knowing among them;
   else the apostle, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, had gone upon a very
   ill ground, when he all along takes it for granted, that the
   dispensation of the law, and all the ceremonies of it, were of a
   farther signification: (Heb. x. 1.) "The law having a shadow of good
   things to come."

   5. This was in general, and by good consequence, though not obvious to
   all, yet sufficiently to prudent and discerning men, revealed in the
   book of the law taken precisely: I mean the five books of Moses. It is
   said of Abel, that God was pleased with his sacrifice, though with
   Cain's he was not well-pleased. (Gen. iv.) Upon this Cain was angry at
   his brother, and slew him. Now if the immortality of the soul and a
   future state, be not supposed and taken for granted in this story, this
   very passage is enough to cut the sinews, and pluck up the roots, of
   all religion. For if there were no rewards after this life, it were
   obvious for every man to argue from this story, that it was a dangerous
   thing to please God; if this were all that Abel got by it, to be
   knocked on the head by his brother, who offended God.

   But I shall chiefly insist on the general promises which we find in
   these books of Moses, of God's blessing good men, and declaring that he
   was their God, even after their death. Now I shall shew that these
   promises did involve the happiness of another life, and were intended
   by God to signify thus much, and were so understood by good men under
   that dispensation. That these general promises did contain this sense
   under them, and were intended by God to signify thus much, is evident
   from our Saviour's citation of that text, to confute the Sadducees, "I
   am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;" from
   whence he reasons thus, "Now God is not the God of the dead, but of the
   living; for all live to him:" the force of which argument was directly
   and immediately levelled against the main error of the Sadducees, which
   was the denial of a future state. This our Saviour immediately proves
   from this text, and by consequence the resurrection, which the
   Sadducees did not deny upon any other account, but because they did not
   [1] believe a future state.

   6. Toward the expiration of the legal dispensation, there was yet a
   clearer revelation of a future state. The text in Daniel seems to be
   much plainer than any in the Old Testament: (Dan. xii. 2.) "And many of
   them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake; some to
   everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." And to
   this text the seven brethren, who were cruelly put to death under the
   persecution of Antiochus, seem to refer when they comfort themselves
   with the hopes of another life: (2 Mac. vii. 9.) where one of them,
   ready to die, says thus to Antiochus, "Thou like a fury takest us out
   of this present life, but the King of the world shall raise us up, who
   have died for his laws, unto everlasting life." To the same purpose,
   another of them, (ver. 14.) when he was tormented, expresseth his
   confidence thus: "It is good, being put to death by men, to look for
   hope from God, to be raised up again by him; but as for thee (speaking
   of Antiochus) thou shalt have no resurrection to life." Where he seems
   to allude to the twofold resurrection mentioned by Daniel. And though
   this history of the Maccabees be not canonical, yet the apostle hath
   warranted the truth of it to us, at least in this particular, for he
   plainly refers to this story: (Heb. xi. 35.) "Others were tortured, not
   accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection."

   7. Notwithstanding this, I say, that the immortality of the soul, and a
   future state, was not expressly and clearly revealed in the Old
   Testament, at least not in Moses's law. The special and particular
   promises of that dispensation, were of temporal good things; and the
   great blessing of eternal life, was but somewhat obscurely involved and
   signified in the types and general promises: for considering that the
   particular promises were plainly of temporal things, it was very
   obvious to those who were not so prudent and discerning, to interpret
   the general promises so as to comprehend only that kind of blessings
   which were expressed in the special and particular promises, and so
   likewise to under stand the general threatenings. And upon this
   account, the apostle to the Hebrews principally advanceth the new
   covenant of the gospel above the old dispensation: because the gospel
   had clear, and express, and special promises of eternal life, which the
   law had not: (Heb. viii. 6.) "But now hath he obtained a more excellent
   ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant,
   which was established upon better promises." For the same reason Christ
   is said here in the text, "by his appearance to have abolished death,
   and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel." And so I
   proceed to the

   Second thing I propounded, which is to shew, what farther evidence and
   assurance the gospel gives us of it, than the world had before: what
   clearer discoveries we have by Christ's coming, than the heathens or
   Jews had before.

   That the gospel hath brought to us a clearer discovery of this than
   they had, is here expressly said; that God's gracious purpose
   concerning our salvation, which was before the world began decreed to
   be accomplished in Christ, is now made manifest by his corning into the
   world; (ver. 9.) "Who hath saved and called us with a holy calling, not
   according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
   which was given us in Jesus Christ before the world began, but is now
   made manifest/ &c. Which is emphatically spoken, now, and not till now,
   importing that, before the appearing of our Saviour, it was, in great
   measure, hid from the world, and that men had very dark and obscure
   apprehensions of it, till it was "brought to light by the gospel." And
   this is not only affirmed in this place, but very frequently all over
   the New Testament. I will mention some of the most express places to
   this purpose. (John vi. 6, 8.) When many of Christ's followers left
   him, he asks the twelve, "Will ye also go away?" To whom Peter answers,
   "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life." As if
   he had said, What master should we choose to follow rather than thee,
   who bringest to the world the glad tidings of eternal life? What
   discipline or institution is there in the world, that gives such
   encouragement to its followers? Others may promise great things in this
   world; but in the declarations and promises of another life, we cannot
   rely upon any one but him that comes from God, as we are fully
   persuaded thou dost: for it follows in the next verse, "And we believe,
   and are sure, that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."

   (Tit. ii. 11. &c.) "The grace of God which brings salvation hath
   appeared to all men," &c. Where the revelation of the gospel is called
   "the grace of God which brings salvation," that is, which disco vers to
   the world that eternal happiness, which was in a great measure hid from
   it before, and encourageth men by the hopes of that blessing to live a
   holy life. The apostle to the Hebrews doth all along in his Epistle use
   this as an argument to the Jews, to take them oft from the Mosaical
   institution, and to persuade them to entertain the doctrine of the
   gospel, as making clearer discoveries, and giving greater assurance of
   eternal life and salvation, than the law did. (Heb. ii. 2-5.) "For if
   the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and
   disobedience received a just recompence of reward; how shall we escape,
   if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to be spoken
   by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also
   bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers
   miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? For
   unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come,
   whereof we speak." That is, if the promises and threatenings of the
   law, which was delivered but by the ministry of angels, were made good,
   and the offenders under that dispensation were severely punished, what
   shall become of us, if we neglect the dispensation of the gospel, which
   reveals to us greater things, even eternal life and salvation, and
   which receiveth so great a confirmation, both from Christ himself, by
   whom it was first delivered, and also from his apostles, who published
   it to the world, and gave testimony to it by so many miracles? And it
   follows, (ver. 5.) "For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection
   the world to come, whereof we now speak." The meaning of which is this:
   the promises and threatenings of the law, which was delivered by
   angels, were temporal, and such as respected this world; but now God
   has sent his Son, he hath in him made promises of a greater salvation,
   he hath put into his hands the great things of another world, and hath
   given him power to promise eternal life, and to give it to as many as
   he pleases. So the danger of contemning the gospel, must needs be much
   greater than that of the law, because the happiness which the gospel
   promises is so much greater: for unto the angels Mho delivered the law,
   God gave no power and commission to make clear and express promises of
   the rewards of another world. "Unto the angels did he not put in
   subjection the world to come;" but so hath he done to his Son. "He hath
   committed all judgment to him, and hath given him power to raise up
   those who have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and those that
   have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation;" as our Saviour
   himself speaks, (John v. 22.) And thus "he hath put the world to come
   in subjection unto his Son," having empowered him to encourage and
   argue men to the obedience of his laws, by the rewards and punishments
   of another world: whereas the law delivered by angels, had only the
   sanction of temporal threatenings and promises. (Heb. vii. 16.) The
   gospel is called "the power of an eternal life," in opposition to the
   law, which is called "a carnal commandment;" not only because the
   precepts of it respected the body, but because the promises of it were
   of temporal good things which belong to this life; and at the 19th
   verse, the gospel, in opposition to the Mosaical dispensation, is
   called "the bringing in of a better hope:"--"the law made nothing
   perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did;" epeisagoee`, the
   superinduction of a better hope; by which the apostle plainly
   signifies, that this was the imperfection of the Mosaical dispensation,
   that it did not give men firm hopes and assurance of eternal life; but
   the gospel hath superinduced this hope, and thereby supplied the great
   defect of the former administration. To the same purpose he tells us,
   (chap. viii. 6.) that Christ "hath now obtained a more excellent
   ministry, forasmuch as he is the mediator of a better covenant,
   established upon better promises." How better promises? Why, instead of
   the promises of a temporal Canaan and earthly blessings, Christ hath
   given us promises of eternal life and happiness. Therefore, in the next
   chapter, he is called "a high-priest of good things to come;" and,
   (ver. 15.) "For this cause" he is said to be "the mediator of the new
   testament, that they which are called might receive the promise of the
   eternal inheritance." Once more the apostle, (chap. x. ver. 1.) makes
   this the great imperfection of the law, in opposition to the gospel,
   that it "had only a shadow of good things to come, but not the very
   image of the things;" that is, it did but darkly typify and shadow
   forth the things of another life, not give us so express an image, and
   lively representation of the rewards of another world, as the gospel
   does. Therefore St. John makes eternal life to be the great promise of
   the gospel, the great blessing which Christ hath revealed to the world:
   (1 John ii. 25.) "This is the promise which he hath promised, even
   eternal life." So that you see, that the full and clear discovery of
   eternal life, is every where in the New Testament attributed to Christ,
   and to the revelation which by him was made to the world.

   It remains now, that I shew more particularly wherein the gospel hath
   given the world greater evidence and assurance of a future state, than
   they had before.

   1. The rewards of another life are most clearly revealed in the gospel.
   That God hath made a revelation of this by Christ, is an advantage
   which the heathen wanted, who were destitute of Divine revelation.
   There are many truths which men may be well inclined to believe, and
   for the proof of which, the wiser and more knowing sort of men may be
   able to offer very fair and plausible arguments; and yet for all this
   they may have no confident assurance of them, or at least may be very
   far from a well-grounded certainty, such as will give rest and
   satisfaction to the mind of a considerate and inquisitive man. All men
   are not capable of the force of a reason; nay, there are very few who
   can truly judge of the weakness or strength of an argument. There are
   many things which admit of very plausible arguments on both sides; and
   the generality of men are very apt to be imposed upon by very slight
   arguments, to be moved any way with some little show and appearance of
   reason. So that, when this principle of the soul's immortality came to
   be disputed in the world, and the sects of the philosophers, the
   learned men of those times, came to be divided in opinion about it,
   some disputing directly against it, others doubting very much of it,
   and scarce any pretending to any great assurance of it, it was no
   wonder, if by this means many came to be in suspense about it; but now
   Divine revelation, when that comes, it takes away all doubting, and
   gives men assurance of that, concerning which they were uncertain
   before. For every man that believes a God, does firmly believe this
   principle--that whatever is revealed by him is true: but especially if
   the revelation be clear and express, then it gives full satisfaction to
   the mind of man, and removes all jealousy and suspicions of the
   contrary. And this is a great advantage which the gospel gives us in
   this matter, above what the Jews had. They had some kind of revelation
   and discovery of this under the dispensation of the law; but very
   darkly, in types and shadows: but the gospel gives us a most express
   revelation of it, is full of special promises to this purpose, made in
   clear words, free from all ambiguity, or liableness to be interpreted
   to another sense. So that, if we compare the law and the gospel
   together, we shall see a vast difference as to this matter. Under the
   law, the promise of eternal life was only comprehended in some general
   words, from which a man, that had true notions of God and religion,
   might be able to infer, that God intended some reward for good men, and
   punishment for wicked, men beyond this life: but the promises of
   temporal good things were special and express, and their law was full
   of them. Contrariwise in the New Testament, the most special and
   express promise is that of eternal life, and this the books of the New
   Testament are full of; as for temporal blessings, they are but
   sparingly and obscurely promised, in comparison of the other.

   2. The rewards of another life, as they are clearly and expressly
   revealed by the gospel, so that they may have the greater power and
   influence upon us, and we may have the greater assurance of them, they
   are revealed with very particular circumstances. And herein the gospel
   gives us a great advantage, both above the heathens and Jews. For
   though a man was satisfied in general of a state after this life, that
   men's souls should survive their bodies, and pass into another world,
   where it shall be well with them that have done well in this world, and
   ill to those that have done ill; yet no man, without a revelation,
   could conjecture the particular circumstances of that state. What wild
   descriptions do the heathen poets, who were their most ancient divines,
   make of heaven and hell, of the Elysian fields and the infernal
   regions! But now the gospel, for our greater assurance and
   satisfaction, hath revealed many particular circumstances of the future
   state to us; as, that all men at the end of the world shall be summoned
   to make a solemn appearance before the Lord Jesus Christ, whom God hath
   made judge of the world as a reward of his patience and sufferings;
   that the bodies of men shall, in order to that appearance, be raised up
   by the mighty power of God, and united to their souls, that as they
   have been instruments of the soul in acts of holiness and sin, so they
   may take part likewise in the happiness and torments of it. There are
   several other circumstances the gospel hath revealed to us concerning
   our future state, which, had they not been revealed, we could never
   have known, hardly have conjectured; in all which, besides the
   assurance that they are revealed, it is a great satisfaction to us,
   that there is nothing in them that is unworthy of God, or that savours
   of the weakness and vanity of human imagination.

   3. The gospel gives us yet farther assurance of these things, by such
   an argument as is like to be the most convincing and satisfactory to
   common capacities; and that is, by a lively instance of the thing to be
   proved, in raising Christ from the dead, (Acts xvii. 30, 31.)

   It is true, indeed, under the Old Testament, there were two instances
   somewhat of this nature; Enoch and Elias were immediately translated,
   and taken up alive into heaven; but these two instances do in many
   respects fall short of the other. For after Christ was raised from the
   dead, he conversed forty days with his disciples, and satisfied them
   that he was risen; after which he was in their sight visibly taken up
   into heaven: and as an evidence that he was possessed of his glorious
   kingdom, he sent flown, according to his promise, his Holy Spirit in
   miraculous gifts, to assure them by those testimonies of his royalty,
   that he was in heaven, and to qualify them by those miraculous powers
   to convince the world of the truth of their doctrine.

   Now, what argument more proper to convince them of another life after
   this, than to see a man raised from the dead, and restored to a new
   life? What titter to satisfy a man concerning heaven, and the happy
   estate of those there, than to see one visibly taken up into heaven?
   And what more fit to assure us, that the promises of the gospel are
   real, and shall be made good to us, than to see him who made these
   promises to us raise himself from the dead, and go up into heaven, and
   from thence to dispense miraculous gifts and powers abroad in the
   world, as evidences of the power and authority which he was invested
   withal? All the philosophical arguments that a man can bring for the
   soul's immortality and another life, will have no force upon vulgar
   apprehensions, in comparison of these sensible demonstrations, which
   give an experiment of the thing, and furnish us with an instance of
   something of the same kind, and of equal difficulty with that which is
   propounded to our belief,

   4. And lastly, The effects which the clear disco very of this truth had
   upon the world, are such, as the world never saw before, and are a
   farther inducement to persuade us of the truth and reality of it. After
   the gospel was entertained in the world, to shew that those who
   embraced it did fully believe this principle, and were abundantly
   satisfied concerning the rewards and happiness of another life; they
   did, for the sake of their religion, despise this life and all the
   enjoyments of it, from a thorough persuasion of a far greater happiness
   than this world could afford remaining in the next life. With what
   cheerfulness did they suffer persecutions, with what joy and triumph
   did they welcome torments, and embrace death, "knowing in themselves
   that they had in heaven a better and more enduring substance!" Thus,
   when "life and immortality was brought to light by the gospel, death
   was as it were quite abolished;" those of the weakest age and sex,
   women and children, did familiarly encounter it with as great a
   bravery, and bore up against the terrors of it with as much courage, as
   any of the greatest spirits among the Romans ever did: and this not in
   few instances, but in vast numbers. No emperor in the world ever had so
   numerous an army of persons resolved to light for him, as this Captain
   of our salvation, this Prince of life and glory had of persons
   courageously resolved, and cheer fully contented to die for him.

   Now this wonderful effect, the like of which the world never saw
   before, was very suitable to the nature of this doctrine. Suppose that
   God from heaven should have given men assurance of another life after
   this, in which good men should be unspeakably happy: what more
   reasonable to imagine, than that persons so assured should despise this
   life, and all the enjoyments of it, in comparison of the eternal and
   unconceivable happiness, which they were persuaded they should be made
   partakers of in another world? So that, whatever assurance an express
   and clear revelation from God of the soul's immortality and another
   life, together with the particular circumstances of that state;
   whatever assurance a lively instance and example of the thing, in the
   person of him who brings this doctrine to the world; whatever
   consequent miracles, and suitable effects upon the minds of men to such
   a principle; I say, whatever assurance and satisfaction these can give
   of this principle, all this the gospel hath given us, beyond whatever
   the heathen or Jews had before.

   The inference I shall make from this discourse, shall be only this:
   that if there be such a state after this life, then how does it concern
   every man to provide for it? Every action that we do in this life will
   have a good or bad influence upon our everlasting condition, and the
   consequences of it will extend themselves to eternity. Did men
   seriously consider this, that they carry about them immortal souls that
   shall live for ever, they would not trifle away the opportunities of
   this life, bend all their thoughts, and employ their designs, in the
   present gratification of their senses, and the satisfaction of their
   fleshly part, which shall shortly die and moulder into dust: but they
   would make provision for the state which is beyond the grave, and lay
   designs for eternity, which is infinitely the most considerable
   duration; they would not, like children, take care for the present,
   without any prospect to the future, and lay out all they have to please
   themselves for a day, without any regard to the remaining part of their
   lives. Nothing can be more unbecoming Christians, whose whole religion
   pretends to be built upon the firm belief of another world, than to be
   intent upon the things of this present life, to the neglect of their
   souls and all eternity.

   Seeing then we pretend to be assured of immortal life, and to have
   clear discoveries of everlasting happiness and glory, as we hope to be
   made partakers of this portion, let us live as it becomes the
   candidates of heaven, those that are heirs of another world, and "the
   children of the resurrection," that this grace of God, which hath
   brought salvation, may "teach us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,
   and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present life,
   looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
   God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ."

SERMON CLXXVII.

  OF THE CERTAINTY OF A FUTURE JUDGMENT.

   For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every
   one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
   done, whether it be good or bad.--2 Cor. v. 10.

   THE apostle, in the beginning of this chapter, expresseth his earnest
   desire, if God saw it fit, to quit "this earthly tabernacle, for a
   house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, to be absent from
   the body, and present with the Lord." But, however God should dispose
   of him, he tells us that he made it his constant endeavour so to behave
   himself, that both in this present state, whilst he continued in the
   body, and when he should quit it, and appear before God, he might be
   approved and accepted of him. And that which made him so careful was,
   because there was a day certainly corning, wherein every man must give
   an account of himself to the great Judge of the world, and receive the
   just recompence of his actions done in this life: (ver. 9, 10.)
   "Wherefore we labour, that whether present or absent, we may be
   accepted of him. For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of
   Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body,
   according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."

   Which words are so plain and powerful, so easy to be understood, and of
   such a mighty force and influence, if thoroughly believed, that the
   very repeating of them is sufficient to awaken men to a serious care of
   their lives and actions, and a powerful consideration to persuade them
   to do every thing with respect to that solemn account they must one day
   make to God of all the actions done in this life.

   But, that the truth contained in them may make the greater impression
   upon us, I shall distinctly consider the words, and handle, as briefly
   as I can, the several propositions contained in them.

   The general and principal proposition contained in these words is, the
   certainty of a future judgment.

   But, besides this principal proposition, which comprehends the general
   meaning and intention of these words, there are four other more
   particular propositions contained in them.

   First, That the administration of this judgment will be committed to
   the Lord Jesus Christ, for which reason the tribunal before which we
   must appear, is called the judgment-seat of Christ. "We must all appear
   before the judgment-seat of Christ."

   Secondly, That all men are liable to this judgment; no person, of what
   condition soever, shall be exempted from it. "We must all appear."

   Thirdly, That all the actions which men have done in this life shall
   then come to account, and they shall be judged for them. "That every
   one may receive the things done in the body."

   Fourthly, That sentence will then be passed according to the quality of
   men's actions, whether good or bad: "every one shall receive according
   to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil."

   But I shall at present only speak to the principal proposition
   contained in the words concerning the certainty of a future and general
   judgment; viz. that at the end of the world there shall be a general
   and public assize, when all persons that have lived in this world
   (except only the Judge himself, our blessed Saviour, who is "the man
   ordained by God to judge the world") shall come upon their trial, and
   all the actions which they have done shall come under a strict
   examination; and according as men have demeaned themselves in this
   world towards God and man, they shall receive sentence, and rewards
   shall be distributed to them, according to the nature and quality of
   their actions. And though all these particulars be not expressed in the
   text, yet they are virtually contained in the general expressions of
   it, and fully and clearly delivered in other texts of Scripture.

   The truth and certainty of a future and general judgment, I shall
   endeavour to confirm from these three heads of arguments:

   I. From the acknowledgments of natural light.

   II. From the notions which men generally have of God and his
   providence.

   III. From express and clear revelation of Holy Scripture.

   I. From the acknowledgments of natural light. And I might shew the
   general consent of mankind in this matter by all sorts of human
   testimonies, and from all kinds of writers in all ages: but this would
   be almost endless, and not so proper for a plain and practical
   discourse upon this subject. And, there fore, passing by testimonies, I
   shall mainly insist upon this that the consciences of men do secretly
   acknowledge a difference between good and evil. Hence it is that men
   find great peace and quiet and satisfaction of mind in the doing of
   good and virtuous actions, and have secret and comfortable hopes, that
   this kind of actions will some time or other be considered and
   rewarded; and they are apt to maintain these hopes, and to support
   themselves with them, even when they despair to meet with any reward of
   their good and honest actions in this world.

   And, on the other hand, men find a secret fear and horror, and are
   inwardly ashamed and confounded in their own minds, when they are about
   a wicked enterprise, and engaged in an ill design; their consciences
   check them and terrify them, and their own minds bode ill to them, as
   if mischief and vengeance would overtake them one time or other, and
   this when no eye sees them, and what they are a-doing does not fall
   under the cognizance of any human court or tribunal, nor is liable to
   any censure or punishment from any human authority; yet, for all that,
   they have many stings and lashes from their own minds, feel many checks
   and rebukes from their own consciences, when they do any thing which
   they ought not to do, though no man can charge them with it, or call
   them to an account for it.

   Now these hopes and fears do argue, if not the firm belief and
   persuasion of a future judgment, yet great suspicions and misgivings of
   it in bad men; and in good men, secret and comfortable apprehensions
   concerning it. From whence else can it be, that good men, though they
   find that virtue is discountenanced, and goodness many times suffers,
   and is persecuted in this world, and that the best actions and designs
   are often unsuccessful; whence, I say, is it that good men,
   notwithstanding this, bear up and persist in their course, but because
   they have this inward apprehension and persuasion, that there will be a
   time when virtue and goodness will be considered and rewarded, though
   not in this world? And whence is it that bad men, though they prosper
   in their impiety, are yet guilty, and fearful, and timorous, but
   because they stand in awe of a Being, greater, and more righteous, and
   more powerful than themselves; but because they have some secret
   apprehensions of an invisible Judge, and inward presage of a future
   vengeance, which sooner or later will overtake them; and because they
   believe there will be a time when all the wickedness they have done
   shall be accounted for? Insomuch, that when they have done what they
   can, they cannot shake off these fears, nor quit themselves of these
   apprehensions of Divine justice, threatening and pursuing them for
   their evil deeds.

   All which are plain acknowledgments of a natural apprehension and
   persuasion born with us, and riveted in our minds, concerning a future
   judgment.

   II. This will farther appear from the natural notion which men have of
   a God and his providence. This is essential to the notion of a
   God--that he is good, and holy, and just; and, consequently, that he
   loves goodness and hates iniquity; and there fore it must be agreeable
   to his nature to countenance the one, and to discountenance the other,
   in such a manner as becomes the wise Sovereign and Governor of the
   world. Now this cannot be solemnly and openly done, but by a public
   distribution of rewards and punishments; and this we see is not done in
   this world. The dispensations of God's providence in this world, toward
   good and bad men, are many times very promiscuous, and very cross, and
   contrary to what might be expected from the wise and just Sovereign of
   the world, from one whom we believe to love righteousness, and to hate
   iniquity. For virtuous and holy men are often ill treated in this
   world, grievously harassed and afflicted, and that for righteousness
   sake: and bad men many times flourish and are prosperous, "they are not
   in trouble like other men, neither are they plagued like other men."
   And this is a very great objection against the providence of God, if
   there were no other consideration had of virtue and vice, no other kind
   of retribution made to good and bad men, but what we see in this world.
   And, there fore, the justice of the Divine Providence seems to require
   that there should be a day of recompence, and a solemn and public
   distribution of rewards and punishments to the righteous and to the
   wicked. For this is plainly a state of trial and probation, of patience
   and forbearance to sinners, and of exercise to good men; and being a
   state of trial, it is not so proper a season for the distribution of
   public justice. But since the justice of God doth not appear in this
   world, it seems very reasonable to believe that there will be a time
   when it will be made manifest, and every eye shall see it; that God
   will one day fully vindicate his righteousness, and acquit the honour
   of his justice, and that there shall be a general assize held, when all
   men shall have a fair and open trial, and "God will render to every man
   according to his works."

   Now the justice of God's providence is, in a great measure, hid and
   covered, but there will come hemera apokalupseos, (as the apostle calls
   the day of judgment, Rom. ii. 5.) "A day of the revelation of the
   righteous judgment of God;" when "he will bring forth his righteousness
   as the light, and his judgment as the noon-day," and "every mouth shall
   be stopped," and every conscience and heart of man acknowledge "the
   righteous judgment of God."

   And in the mean time God contents himself to give some particular and
   remarkable instances of his rewarding and punishing justice in this
   world, which may be to us an earnest of a future and general judgment;
   he is pleased sometimes, in the dispensations of his providence,
   clearly to separate and distinguish "the precious from the vile,"
   remarkably to deliver good men, and to "snare the wicked in the works
   of their own hands." Some times he gives good men some foretastes of
   heaven, some earnest of their future happiness in this life: and, on
   the other hand, he many times gives sinners some præjudicia divini
   judicii, some intimations of a future judgment, and shadows of that
   utter darkness, where they are to dwell for ever; he drops down, now
   and then, a little of hell into the conscience of a sinner. That fire
   which is kindled in some men's consciences in this life, that
   unspeakable anguish, and those inexplicable horrors, which some sinners
   have felt in this world, may serve to give us notice of the extreme
   severity of the Divine justice towards impenitent sinners: that
   miraculous deluge that swept away the old world; those stupendous and
   terrible showers of fire and brimstone, which consumed Sodom and
   Gomorrah, and the cities about; that dreadful earthquake which
   swallowed up Corah and his company, and let them down, as it were,
   quick into hell, may serve for pledges and earnests to us of the dismal
   punishments and torments of the next world.

   But, notwithstanding all these particular and remarkable instances of
   the Divine justice, yet, considering how unequal and promiscuous the
   greatest part of God's providences are in this world, it is highly
   requisite, that there should be a general judgment, for a more clear
   and full manifestation of the justice and equity of the Divine
   Providence.

   III. But this will most evidently appear from the clear and express
   revelation of the Holy Scripture. I will not cite texts out of the Old
   Testament to this purpose, because these things were but obscurely
   revealed to the Jews in comparison; "Life and immortality being brought
   to light by the gospel." Yet St. Jude tells us, that there was an early
   revelation of this to the old world: (ver. 14, 15.) "And Enoch also,
   the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord
   cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all,
   and to convince all that are ungodly." But whether this refer to the
   flood, or the final judgment of the world, is not so clear and certain;
   how ever, this is most plainly revealed by our blessed Lord and Saviour
   in the New Testament. The process of this great day, with several of
   the particular circumstances of it, are fully described by our Saviour,
   (Matt. xxv.) and in the vision of St. John, (Rev. xx. 11-13.) And the
   apostles of our Lord and Saviour do most frequently declare and
   inculcate it. (Acts xvii. 30, 31.) "But now commandeth all men every
   where to repent: because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will
   judge the world in righteousness, by that Man whom he hath ordained,
   whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised
   him from the dead." (Rom. ii. 5-9.) Where, speaking of the day of
   judgment, he calls it, "The day of wrath, and revelation of the
   righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to
   his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for
   glory, honour, and immortality, eternal life: but unto them that are
   contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
   indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man
   that doeth evil." (1 Pet. i. 17.) "And if ye call on the Father, who
   without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work." (2
   Pet. iii. 10.) "But the day of the Lord will come, in which the heavens
   shall pass away with a great noise," &c.

   Thus you see the truth and certainty of a future judgment confirmed,
   from the acknowledgments of men's natural hopes and fears, from the
   natural notions which men have concerning God and his providence, and
   from plain revelation of Scripture.

   All that I shall do farther at present, shall be to make some
   reflections upon what hath been delivered, concerning the certainty of
   a future general judgment. And,

   I. If there be such a day certainly a-coming, it may justly be matter
   of wonder and astonishment to us, to see the general impiety and
   stupidity of men, how wicked they are, and how careless of their lives
   and actions, and how insensible of that "great and terrible day of the
   Lord," which is coming upon all flesh, and, for any thing we know to
   the contrary, may be very near us, and even at the door. How securely
   do the greatest part of men pass away their time, some in worldly
   business, others in worldly pleasures and vanity, and a great many in
   wickedness and vice! Surely such men have no apprehensions of a future
   judgment: surely they do not believe that there will be any memorial of
   their actions in another world, and that they shall be called to a
   strict and severe account for all the actions of this life: they do not
   think that there is a just and powerful Being above them, who now
   observes every thing that they do, and will one day judge them for it;
   that there is a pen always writing, and making a faithful record of all
   the passages of their lives; and that these volumes shall one day be
   produced and opened, "and men shall be judged out of the things that
   are written in them;" and all our thoughts, words, and actions, shall
   pass under a most severe trial and examination!

   Or, if men do believe these things, they stifle and suppress this
   belief, and "detain this great truth of God in unrighteousness;" they
   do not attend to it, and consider it, that it may have its due awe and
   influence upon their lives. For it is not imaginable, that if men were
   possessed with a firm belief and persuasion of this "great and terrible
   day of the Lord," they should be so careless and secure, as we see they
   are, and have so little regard to what they do; that they should pass
   whole days, and weeks, and years, in the gross neglect of God and
   religion, and of their immortal souls; that they should "spend their
   days in vanity, and their years in pleasure:" that they should live in
   a continued course of impiety and profaneness, of lewdness, and
   intemperance, in the cursed habits of swearing and cursing: which are
   now grown so common among us, that a man cannot walk in the street
   without having his ears grated with this hellish noise; and that they
   should go on in these courses, without any great regret and
   disturbance, as if no danger attended them, as if justice were asleep,
   and all their actions would be buried with them, and never rise up
   against them.

   What can we resolve this into, but either into habitual or actual
   atheism and infidelity? either men do not at all believe a judgment to
   come; or else they do not actually consider it, and attend to the
   natural and proper consequences of such a belief: one of these two is
   necessary. It seems very hard to charge the generality of wicked men
   with habitual atheism and unbelief, but that the Spirit of God in
   Scripture so often does it. (Psal. xiv. 1.) "The fool hath said in his
   heart, There is no God." How doth that appear? It follows, "They are
   corrupt, and have done abominable works, there is none that doeth
   good." And, (Psal. xxxvi. 1.) "The transgression of the wicked saith
   within my heart, there is no fear of God before his eyes." David speaks
   as if the wicked practices of men did convince him, that they had no
   belief and apprehension of a God.

   Nay, even after those clear discoveries which the gospel hath made of a
   future judgment, our Saviour seems to foretel a general infidelity
   among men, at least as to this particular article of a future judgment:
   (Luke xviii. 8.) "Nevertheless when the Son of man shall come, shall he
   find faith upon the earth?" and St. Peter tells us, (2 Pet. iii. 3, 4.)
   that "there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their
   own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming?" that is,
   deriding the belief and expectation which the Christians had of a
   future judgment.

   But, to be sure, if the generality of men be not already sunk thus low,
   as to disbelieve these things, yet this at least is evident from the
   lives of men, that they are strangely inconsiderate, and guilty of the
   most gross and stupid inadvertency that can befal reasonable creatures.
   For I dare appeal to any man of understanding and serious
   consideration, whether a greater folly and madness can be imagined,
   than for men to profess in good earnest to believe, that there is a day
   shortly coming, wherein they shall appear before the impartial tribunal
   of the great Judge of the world, and all the actions of their lives
   shall be ransacked and laid open, and that there is not any thing that
   ever they did, that shall escape a severe censure; yea, and farther to
   be persuaded, that as it shall upon that trial appear, that they have
   demeaned themselves in this world, they shall be sentenced to an
   eternal and unchangeable state of happiness or misery in the other
   world; and yet after all this conviction, to live at such a mad and
   careless rate, as no man in reason can live, but he that is undoubtedly
   certain of the contrary of all this, and verily persuaded in his heart,
   that not one syllable of what the gospel says concerning these matters
   is true? This is so incredible a stupidity and folly, that did not
   frequent and undeniable experience make us sure of the truth of it, out
   of mere charity and respect to human nature, it were not to be
   believed. "Consider this all ye that forget God, and put far from you
   the evil day; consider and shew yourselves men, O ye transgressors!"
   who profess to believe a future judgment, and yet run the hazard of it,
   as if ye had no fear and suspicion of any such thing.

   II. Having considered, not without wonder and astonishment, what manner
   of persons the generality of men are, notwithstanding all the assurance
   we have of a future judgment, let us in the next place consider,
   "seeing these things shall be, what manner of persons we ought to be,
   in all holy conversation and godliness, waiting for and hastening unto
   the coming of the day of God," as the apostle argues, (2 Pet. iii. 11,
   12.) How should the serious belief of this great principle of religion
   work upon us, that "we must all appear before the judgment-seat of
   Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body,
   according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil?" St. Paul
   tells us, that the consideration of it had a mighty awe and influence
   upon him, to be careful of himself, and to be concerned for others: to
   be careful of himself, in the verse before the text, "Wherefore we
   labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him: for we
   must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ." And to be
   concerned for others, that they may prevent the terrors of that day, in
   the verse immediately after the text, "Knowing therefore the terror of
   the Lord, we persuade men."--"Knowing the terror of the Lord;" it were
   no difficult matter to make such a dreadful representation of this
   "great and terrible day of the Lord," as would affright the stoutest
   sinner, and make every joint of him to tremble: but it is much more
   desirable that men should be wrought upon by reason, and convinced and
   persuaded by a calm and sober consideration of things; because that is
   likely to have a better and more lasting effect than present terror and
   amazement; and therefore I shall content myself with the naked
   representation of the thing in the plain and powerful expressions of
   the Holy Scriptures. Imagine then thou sawest "the Son of man coming in
   great power, and great glory, and all his holy angels with him;" that
   thou heardest the great trumpet sound, and a mighty voice piercing the
   heavens and the earth, saying, "Arise ye dead, and come to judgment."
   Suppose thou sawest the thrones set, and "the great Judge sitting upon
   the throne of his glory," and "all nations gathered before him," and
   "all the dead both small and great standing before God, the books
   opened, and the dead judged out of the things written in these books;"
   and the several sentences pronounced from the mouth of Christ himself,
   "Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
   before the foundation of the world;" and, "depart ye cursed into
   everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." Would not
   this be a dreadful and amazing sight! Why, the gospel plainly declares
   that all this shall be, and thou professest to believe it. Why then
   dost thou not live as if thou didst believe these things? Why should
   not that which will certainly be, have to all reasonable purposes the
   same effect upon thee, as if it were already and actually present? Why
   do men suffer themselves to be diverted from the attentive
   consideration of so important a matter, by the impertinent trifles of
   this world? Why do we not make wise and speedy preparation for that
   day, which will certainly come? But we are uncertain when it will come,
   "for it will come as a thief in the night, and as a snare upon all them
   that dwell upon the face of the whole earth," Why dost thou stifle thy
   conscience, and drown the loud crys of it, with the din and noise of
   worldly business; why dost thou? at any time check and suppress the
   thoughts of a future judgment, and "put far from thee the evil day?"
   And not rather suffer the terrors of it to haunt and pursue thee, till
   they have made thee weary of thy wicked life, till they have reclaimed
   thee to thy duty, and effectually persuaded thee to break off thy sins
   by repentance; and to resolve upon such a holy and virtuous course of
   life, that thou mayest be able not only with peace and comfort, but
   with joy and triumph to entertain the thoughts of that day?

   Reason thus with thyself: If this day be so dreadful at a distance,
   that I can hardly now bear the thoughts of it, how insupportable will
   the thing itself be, when it comes to be present? And it will come
   nevertheless, nor the later, for my not thinking of it; is it not
   reasonable, instead of putting away the thoughts of it, to endeavour by
   all possible means to prevent the terrors of it?

   We especially, who profess ourselves Christians, and live in the clear
   light of the gospel, ought to consider, that we cannot plead ignorance
   for our excuse, as the heathen world might. We read and hear the gospel
   every day, "wherein the wrath of God is clearly revealed against all
   ungodliness and unrighteousness of men;" so that, if we continue
   impenitent, we have no cloak, no excuse for ourselves: woe unto us
   above all others! "It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, for
   Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for us." "The times of
   ignorance, (saith St. Paul, speaking of the heathen world,) the times
   of this ignorance God winked at; but now he commands all men every
   where to repent, because he hath appointed a day, in which he will
   judge the world in righteousness, by that Man whom he hath ordained,
   whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised
   him from the dead." Thus much concerning the general proposition the
   certainty of a future judgment.

SERMON CLXXVIII.

  OF THE PERSON BY WHOM THE WOULD SHALL BE JUDGED.

   For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every
   one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
   done, whether it be good or bad.--2 Cor. v. 10.

   IN these words, besides the general point mainly intended, concerning
   the certainty of a future and general judgment, there are likewise
   several particular propositions.

   First, That the administration of this judgment is committed to the
   Lord Jesus Christ.

   Secondly, That all men are liable to this judgment.

   Thirdly, That all the actions which men have done in this life shall
   then come to account, and they shall be judged for them.

   Fourthly, That this sentence shall be passed upon men, according to the
   nature and quality of their actions, whether good or evil. I have
   handled the general point--the certainty of a future judgment: I shall
   now proceed to the particular propositions contained in the text, and
   shall handle them in the order in which I have proposed them.

   First, That the administration of this judgment is committed to the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and that he is the person constituted and ordained
   of God, to be the judge of the world. The tribunal before which we must
   stand, is here in the text called "the judgment-seat of Christ." "We
   must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ." In the prosecution
   of this I shall,

   First, Endeavour to confirm and illustrate the truth of this
   proposition.

   Secondly, Draw some inferences from it, by way of application.

   First, For the confirmation of it, I shall do these two things:

   I. Prove it from clear testimony of Scripture.

   II. Endeavour to give some account of this economy and dispensation;
   why God had committed the administration of this great work to the Lord
   Jesus Christ; in all which I shall rely only upon Scripture, the thing
   being capable of no other proof or evidence. And, indeed, the whole
   mediatory undertaking of our blessed Saviour, and all the circumstances
   of it, are matter of pure revelation; this is the hidden and manifold
   wisdom of God, which none of the princes and philosophers of this world
   knew, and which we could not possibly have found out and discovered,
   had not God been pleased to reveal it to us.

   I. I shall prove this from express testimony of Scripture, that the
   Lord Jesus Christ is the person constituted and ordained by God, to
   administer the judgment of the great day: (Matt. xiii. 40-43.) "So
   shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth
   his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that
   offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace
   of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the
   righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father." Here
   our Saviour is represented as the chief minister of God's justice, in
   the distribution of rewards to the righteous and the wicked; and though
   the effect and execution of the sentence only be expressed, yet it
   supposeth a judicial process preceding. So likewise, Matt. xvi. 27.
   "For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his
   holy angels, and then he shall reward every man according to his
   work."--"Shall come in the glory of his Father;" that is, with his
   authority committed to him. (Matt. xxiv. 30.) Where our Saviour
   speaking of his coming to judge the world, it is said, "Then shall
   appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then shall all the
   tribes of the earth mourn; and they shall see the Son of man coming in
   the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory;" that is, in order to
   the judgment of the world. But most fully and expressly, (Matt. xxv.
   31.) where you have the manner of his coining particularly described,
   together with the solemn representation of the process of that great
   day. "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
   angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and
   before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall separate the one
   from the other, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he
   shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then
   shall the King say to them on his right hand," &c. You see the whole
   administration of this judgment, and the management of every part of
   it, is committed to Christ. (John v. 22.) Our Saviour there produceth
   his commission, and tells us from whence this authority was derived to
   him: The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the
   Son." And (ver. 27.) "He hath given him authority also to execute
   judgment, because he is the Son of man." (Acts x. 42.) "Anil he
   commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he
   that is ordained of God, to be the judge of the quick and dead." (Acts
   xvii. 31.) "He hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in
   righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained," that is, by Jesus
   Christ; for it follows, "Whereof he hath given assurance unto all men,
   in that he hath raised him from the dead." (Rom. ii. 16.) "In the day
   when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ." (Rom. xiv.
   10.) "We shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ." (2 Thess.
   i. 7-9.) The apostle there speaking of the day of judgment, describes
   it thus: "When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his
   mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on all them that know
   not God, and obey not the gospel of his Son, who shall be punished with
   everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
   glory of his power." (2 Tim. iv. 1.) "I charge thee, (saith St. Paul
   there to Timothy,) before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
   judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom." (Rev.
   xxii. 12.) "Behold I come quickly, (saith our Lord,) and my reward is
   with me, to give to every man according as his work shall be." I
   proceed to the

   II. Second thing I proposed, namely, To give some account why God hath
   committed the administration of this work into the hands of the Lord
   Jesus Christ. And of this, I shall give an account in these two
   particulars:

   1. God thought fit to confer this honour upon Christ, as a suitable
   reward of his patience and sufferings.

   2. He thought fit likewise hereby to declare the righteousness and
   equity of his judgment, in that mankind is judged by one in their own
   nature, a man like themselves.

   1. God hath thought fit to confer this honour upon Christ, as a
   suitable reward of his obedience and sufferings, of his coming into the
   world by his appointment, to undertake the work of our redemption, and
   to mediate a reconciliation between God and us, of his voluntary
   submission to a condition so mean and low, to that poverty and
   contempt, and to those extreme sufferings which he did so patiently
   undergo, in the prosecution of this great design.

   That God hath committed all power to Christ, with a design to put an
   honour upon him, our Saviour himself tells us: (John v. 22, 23.) "The
   Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son; that
   all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father." The
   Scripture speaks of this matter, as if, when Christ undertook the great
   work of our redemption, it were expressly covenanted between God the
   Father and him, that he should undertake this work, and submit to all
   those grievous things, which were necessary to be done and suffered, in
   order to the effecting of it; and that when he had accomplished it, God
   would confer this glory upon him, that in his human nature he should be
   "exalted to the right hand of God," and have "power given him over all
   flesh, to judge the world, and to give eternal life to as many as he
   pleased;" and when he had received this reward, that then this
   mediatory office should cease, and he should "resign up the kingdom to
   God the Father, that God might be all in all." This is the scope and
   design of the several texts of Scripture concerning this matter.

   With relation to this covenant and agreement between him and his
   Father, he prays, (John xvii. 1, 2.) that he would not be unmindful of
   the glory which he had promised to invest him withal. "Fa her, the hour
   is come; glorify thy Son; as thou hast given him power over all flesh,
   that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him."
   And, (ver. 4, 5.) "I have glorified thee on earth: I have finished the
   work that thou gavest me to do." And then he claims the reward of it:
   "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self." And the
   apostle to the Hebrews (chap. xii. 2.) tells us, that the hopes of this
   did encourage, and bear up our Lord under his sufferings, "Who for the
   joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame,
   and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God." And St. Peter
   tells us, (1 Pet. i. 11.) that "the prophets of old testified
   beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."
   And St. Paul tells us what this glory is, (Eph. i. 20, 21.) viz. that
   "God hath set him at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above
   all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name
   that is named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come."
   But most expressly, (Phil. ii. 7-11.) the same apostle tells us, that
   in consideration of the great humiliation and sufferings of Christ, God
   hath highly exalted him. "He made himself of no reputation, (he emptied
   himself) and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the
   likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
   himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
   Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, which
   is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
   of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth:
   and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the
   glory of God the Father." And that the giving of this name and
   authority to Christ, upon account whereof all creatures shall be
   subject to him, doth principally import that power of judging the world
   which was committed to him, is evident from the explication of these
   phrases, of "bowing the knee to Christ," and of "confessing to him with
   the tongue," which the same apostle tells us elsewhere do signify our
   being judged by him. (Rom. xiv. 10, 11.) "We shall all stand before the
   judgment-seat of Christ: for it is written, As I live, saith the Lord,
   every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So
   then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God."

   So that you see that the glorious reward of Christ's self-denial and
   suffering, doth principally consist in having the judgment of the world
   committed to him, which therefore is called "his kingdom," (Matt. xvi.
   28.) where our Saviour expresseth it by "the Son of man's coming in his
   kingdom." (2 Tim. iv. 1.) "I charge thee, there fore, (saith St. Paul
   to Timothy,) before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
   quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom." And it is with
   relation to this power and authority, that the title of King was given
   to him, (Matt. xxv. 34.) "Then shall the King say unto them on his
   right hand," &c. And the Scripture almost every where, when it speaks
   of Christ's coming, calls it his glorious appearance. (Matt. xvi. 27.)
   "They shall see the Son of man coming in the glory of his Father."
   (Matt. xxiv. 30.) "They shall see the Son of man coming with power and
   great glory." (Matt. xxv. 31.) "When the Son of man shall come in his
   glory." And (Tit. ii. 13.) it is called, "The glorious appearance of
   the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ."

   And this is a very suitable reward of his great submission and
   sufferings, that he, who lived in so mean and obscure a condition,
   should come in great glory; that he, who was rejected and despised of
   men, should be attended on by mighty angels; that he, who was arraigned
   and condemned by the powers of the world, should have authority given
   him to summon all, both small and great, the kings and great men, and
   judges of the earth, to appear at his bar, and to receive sentence at
   his month.

   And this shall be the last act of his Mediatorship, to sit in judgment
   upon the world, to distribute rewards to his faithful servants, and to
   punish his obstinate and implacable enemies. And when this work is
   finished, then this authority shall expire, and the office and kingdom
   of the Mediator shall cease; for "when he shall have subdued all things
   to himself, (as the apostle expressly tells us, 1 Cor. xv. 24, 25, &c.)
   "Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of
   God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all
   authority, and power. For he must reign till he hath put all enemies
   under his feet. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then
   shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that hath put all things
   under him, that God may be all in all."

   2 God hath committed the administration of this judgment to Christ,
   that he might hereby declare the righteousness and equity of it, in
   that mankind is judged by one in their own nature, a man like
   themselves. And therefore we find that the Scripture, when it speaks of
   Christ, as judge of the world, doth almost constantly call him "man,"
   and "the Son of man." In the places I have mentioned before; (Matt.
   xiii. 41.) "The Son of man shall send forth his angels." And, (Matt.
   xvi. 27.) "The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father."
   (Matt. xxiv. 30.) "Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
   heaven, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of
   heaven, with power and great glory." (Matt. xxv. 3l.) "When the Son of
   man shall come in his glory." (Acts xvii. 31.) "He hath appointed a
   day, in which he will judge the world with righteousness, by that man
   whom he hath ordained." By the constant use of which expression, the
   Scripture doth give us plainly to understand, that this great honour of
   being judge of the world, was conferred upon the human nature of
   Christ. For as he is God, he is over all, and judge of the world, and
   could not derive this power from any, it being originally inherent in
   the Deity. Which likewise appears in those expressions of his being
   "ordained a judge," and having "all authority and judgment committed
   and given to him." (Acts xvii. 31.) "He will judge the world in
   righteousness, by the man whom he hath ordained." And, (John v. 22.)
   "The Father hath committed all judgment to the Son." And (ver. 27.) "He
   hath given him authority to execute judgment." Now this cannot be said
   of Christ as God, but in respect of his human nature. And this is clear
   be yond all exception, by what our Saviour adds, as a reason why this
   authority is committed to him; "He hath given him authority to execute
   judgment, because he is the Son of man:" that is, because in that
   respect, and no other, he is capable of having this authority derived
   to him; for as he is the Son of God, he hath it in himself. And,
   perhaps, for this reason likewise--because, in respect of his human
   nature, he is visible; a man being part of the visible creation of God,
   and the judgment of the great day being to be administered in a visible
   manner, and to that end the bodies of men to be raised and united to
   their souls, in order to their visible appearance at this judgment; it
   seems very congruous, that the Son of man, clothed in our nature, and
   in vested with a human body, should sit in judgment upon mankind.

   But, principally, because nothing can more effectually declare the
   equity of this judgment, and that it shall be administered in
   righteousness, than that God hath ordained a man like ourselves to sit
   in judgment upon us. In human judgments, it is reckoned a great piece
   of equity, for men to be tried by their peers, to be acquitted or
   condemned by those who are as near as may be to them, and in the same
   circumstances of rank and condition with themselves; because such are
   like to understand their cases best, and to have a fair and equitable
   consideration of all the circumstances belonging to it. Now Christ, as
   he is the Son of man, is near to us, "bone of our bone, and flesh of
   our flesh, made in all things like unto us, only without sin;" which
   was necessary to qualify him to be our judge; he dwelt among us, and
   understands all our circumstances, and whatever may have influence upon
   our case, to extenuate or aggravate our guilt. What the apostle to the
   Hebrews says of Christ as a high-priest, may be applied to him as a
   judge: (Heb. iv. 15.) "We have not a judge, which cannot be touched
   with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like
   as we are, yet without sin."

   That which now remains, is to draw some inferences from what I have
   discoursed to you upon this argument."

   1. If the Lord Jesus Christ shall judge the world, and we must "all
   appear before his judgment-seat," then it greatly concerns every one of
   us so to demean ourselves in this world, that we may be accepted of him
   in the next. If a man be to be tried for his life, how will he court
   the favour of the judge, that when he comes to stand at the bar, he may
   receive a gracious sentence from his mouth? Why, there is a day
   certainly coming, when every one of us must appear before the tribunal
   of the great Judge of the world; and therefore we should with all
   possible care and diligence endeavour to approve our consciences, and
   all the actions of our lives to him. "Wherefore we labour (saith the
   apostle immediately before my text) that whether present or absent, we
   may be accepted of him. For we must all appear before the judgment-seat
   of Christ." This is that which makes his acceptance and approbation so
   valuable and considerable, that he is to be our judge; to him we must
   stand or fall, by his sentence we shall be cast or cleared for ever.

   We are very apt to court the favour of great men, of the princes and
   judges of this world, that when we come to stand in need of it, we may
   have the benefit and comfort of it. But this is not our great interest;
   for the sentence that men can pass upon us, doth but operate for a
   little while, the effect and consequences of it do not reach beyond
   this world; it is not final and conclusive as to our eternal state. To
   allude to that saying of Solomon's, "many seek the Prince's favour; but
   every man's judgment is of the Lord." We seek the favour of the great
   men of this world; but there is a greater man than any of these, whom
   we are apt to despise and neglect, "the prince of the kings of the
   earth, the man who is ordained of God, to be judge both of quick and
   dead."

   Every man's judgment shall be from him, it is his sentence which above
   all other we have most reason to desire or dread. Therefore we should
   have regard to him, and by submitting to his sceptre, and yielding a
   willing obedience to the laws of his holy gospel, seek his favour, lest
   "he break us with a rod of iron, and dash us in pieces like a potter's
   vessel." This advice we find given to the kings and rulers of the
   earth. (Psal. ii. 10-12.) "Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings; and be
   instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and
   rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish
   from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: blessed are all
   they that put their trust in him."

   2. This is matter of great comfort to all sincere Christians, that
   Christ shall judge the world; as it likewise is of great terror to all
   that disobey the gospel, and by their wicked lives confute their
   profession, and pretended belief of it. Christ is "the author of
   eternal salvation to them that obey him," and to none else. He hath not
   only purchased this salvation for us, but, by a public, and solemn, and
   authoritative sentence, will confer it upon us.

   Indeed it is justly matter of great terror to the wicked of the world,
   who live in ungodliness and worldly lusts; and, under the name and
   title of Christians, have "trampled under foot the Son of God," and by
   their lives have openly declared, that "they would not have this man
   rule over them." Sure it cannot but be matter of great horror and
   amazement to such persons, to think of this Judge, and to consider,
   that he, whom by their lewd lives and practices they have so contemned
   in this world, will sit as judge upon them, and condemn them in the
   next. And therefore our Saviour tells us, (Luke xxi. 25, &c.) that when
   the day of judgment shall surprise the world, and "they shall see the
   Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory;"
   then the wicked of the earth shall be in great distress and perplexity,
   and "their hearts shall fail them with fear, and for looking after
   those things which are coming upon the earth;" but that to good men it
   shall be a day of great joy, and that the approach of it shall revive
   their spirits, and raise their heads: (ver. 28.) "But when these things
   shall begin to come to pass, then lift up your heads with joy, because
   your redemption draws nigh."

   And this consideration is matter of great comfort to all good men, both
   upon account of their sufferings and services for Christ.--In respect
   of their sufferings for him. In this world they are exposed to great
   trials and persecutions for him: but he, for whose name we suffer, is
   to give us our reward; he, who is of the same nature with us, and took
   part of flesh and blood, and suffered himself in the flesh, more
   grievously than any of us can suffer; he it is to whom God hath
   referred it, to consider our sufferings, and give what rewards to them
   he thinks fit. And then, in respect of our services, though the best of
   them be imperfect, and nothing that we do is able to abide the severity
   of his justice, yet, by virtue of his meritorious sacrifice and
   satisfaction, the imperfection of them is pardoned, and the sincerity
   of them is accepted. For he being our judge, who was our sacrifice, and
   is our advocate with the Father, we may rest assured that he will plead
   our cause for us, and the merit of his own sufferings, in bar of that
   sentence which strict justice would pass upon us.

   3. And lastly, This shews what reason the ministers of Christ have to
   be earnest and importunate with sinners, to repent and turn to God, to
   believe and obey the gospel of Christ, that they may have him their
   friend, who will certainly be their judge. This inference the apostle
   makes from this doctrine, in the words immediately after the text;
   "Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men;" we, who
   are employed by Christ, to warn sinners of the danger and terror of a
   future judgment, who are ambassadors sent from this great King and
   Judge of the world, to treat with sinners, and to offer peace to them,
   and in "Christ's stead to beseech them to be reconciled to God," as the
   apostle speaks in the latter part of this chapter. So that, if we
   ourselves believe what we preach to others, to be the word and law of
   him who shall shortly judge us, and them that hear us, can we forbear
   with all possible importunity to solicit their repentance, and to warn
   them to "flee from the wrath which is to come?" Can we let them sleep
   in their sins, when we see them neglect so great a happiness, and run
   themselves upon so intolerable a misery? If we believe that holy book
   out of which we preach, and the discoveries and revelation there made,
   we may take an easy prospect of another world, and see "the wrath of
   God revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
   of men." For the gospel hath made a more particular and clear discovery
   to us of the state of the next world, and the proceedings of the great
   day, than ever the world was acquainted with before. It tells us who is
   the person that shall sit in judgment upon us, even "Jesus Christ,
   whereof God hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised
   him from the dead." Now if we know this, and he assured of it, we
   cannot but deal plainly with sinners, and, out of tender pity and
   compassion to them, endeavour to make them sensible of the sad issue
   and event of a wicked life, and that, without repentance and amendment,
   they will not be able to stand in the judgment of the great day. When
   we see men in the highway to ruin and destruction, and the evil day
   making haste towards them, we cannot but warn them of that sad fate
   which hangs over them, and endeavour by all means to rescue them from
   that extreme and endless misery, which is ready to overtake them.

   Consider then, sinner, whom it is thou now rejectest and despisest, and
   whose laws thou castest behind thy back. It is he who, for all his mean
   appearance in the world, is the Lord of glory, into whose hand the
   "Father hath committed all judgment." And can there be a greater
   madness, than to provoke and make him thine enemy, who shall be thy
   judge? than to despise him, who can destroy thee? He appeared once as
   "a lamb, to take away the sins of the world;" but if through our
   obstinacy and impenitency we render this appearance of his ineffectual
   for our recovery, he will appear a second time in a more terrible
   manner, as "a lion to tear us in pieces." He came once as "a light into
   the world;" in a still and gentle way, to convince and convert sinners:
   but if we resist this light, he will come "in flaming fire to take
   vengeance on all them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of his
   Son."

   And this is that which will make us speechless, and fill oar faces with
   everlasting confusion, at the second coming of Christ that we have
   frustrated and made void the end of his first coining. What shall we be
   able to say to him, when he comes to judge us, who rejected him when he
   came to save us? With what reason can we hope that he will deliver us
   from hell, when we would not be saved by him "from our sins, and
   redeemed from our vain conversation?"

   I will conclude all with that merciful warning which the Judge himself
   hath given us, and left upon record: (Luke xxi. 34-36.) "Take heed to
   yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be over charged with
   surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day
   come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that
   dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore and pray
   always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that
   shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man,"

SERMON CLXXIX.

  OF THE PERSONS WHO ARE TO BE JUDGED.

   For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every
   one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
   done, whether it be good or bad.--2 Cor. v. 10.

   I PROCEED to the second proposition contained in the words; viz. That
   all men are liable to this judgment, and that no man that ever lived in
   the world, except our blessed Saviour, the judge himself, shall be
   exempted from it. "We must all appear before the judgment-seat of
   Christ."

   I shall first endeavour to illustrate and confirm the truth of this
   proposition; and then apply it to ourselves.

   First, For the confirmation of it. This I shall endeavour to do from
   express testimonies of Scripture: and then by arguments drawn from
   reason and Scripture together.

   I. I shall endeavour to confirm the truth of this point from express
   testimonies of Scripture. And we find that the Scripture useth words of
   the greatest latitude and extent, to express this matter more
   emphatically tons. (Gen. xviii. 25.) God is called "the judge of the
   earth."--"Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?" (Matth. xxv.
   32.) It is said, "that when Christ shall sit upon the throne of his
   glory, all nations shall be gathered before him," (Acts x. 42.) He is
   said to be "ordained of God to be judge of quick and dead." And so,
   likewise, (1 Pet. iv. 5.) "Who shall give an account to him, who is
   ready to judge the quick and the dead?" This expression is purposely
   used to take in all persons that have ever lived in the world; not only
   those that shall be already dead at the coming of Christ, but those
   that shall be found alive at his corning, who, though they shall not
   die, yet they shall undergo a sudden and equivalent change, as St. Paul
   tells us from particular revelation: (I Cor. xv. 51, 52.) "Behold, I
   shew you a mystery: we shall not all sleep;" that is, we shall not all
   die, and sleep in the grave; "but we shall all be changed in a moment,
   in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump (for the trumpet shall
   sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
   changed);" that is, they that are already dead shall be then raised,
   and their corruptible bodies changed into incorruptible; and they that
   shall be found alive, though they shall not die, yet their bodies shall
   undergo the same change with those that are raised. And this is the
   reason why Christ is often in Scripture called, "the Judge of quick and
   dead."

   But to proceed to other texts. (Acts xvii. 31.) "He hath appointed a
   day in which he will judge the world in righteousness." The world; that
   is, all men that ever lived in it. "He commands all men every where to
   repent, because he will judge all men." (Rom. xiv. 10-12.) "We shall
   all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; for it is written, As I
   live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue
   shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give an account of
   himself to God." (Heb. ix. 27.) "It is appointed for all men once to
   die, and after this the judgment." That is, as death shall pass upon
   all men, or a change equivalent to it, so after death the judgment
   shall pass upon the same persons: (Heb. xii. 23.) "And to God the judge
   of all." (1 Pet. i. 17.) "If ye call on the Father, who without respect
   of persons judgeth every man, according to his works."

   And to express this the more fully, the Scripture reckons up the
   several ranks and conditions of men, to shew that none shall be
   exempted: (Rev. vi. 15-17.) where you have a representation of the day
   of judgment, and several sorts of men in vain endeavouring to hide
   themselves from it, and escape it: "And the kings of the earth, and the
   great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty
   men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens,
   and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks,
   Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the
   throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. For the great day of his wrath
   is come, and who shall be able to stand?" Which words are a lively
   representation of the universal appearance, that all persons in the
   world, of all ranks and conditions, must make before God at that great
   day. If any be exempted, they must either be secured by their power and
   interest, or overlooked for their meanness and inconsiderableness; but
   none shall either be privileged for their greatness, or neglected for
   their meanness. If any can pretend to be privileged, it must be those
   of greatest dignity and authority, the kings and great men: or of the
   greatest esteem, the rich men of the earth: or of the greatest strength
   and power, the chief captains and the mighty men: but these have no
   protection against the arrest of that judgment. Nor shall any be
   overlooked for their meanness. If any sort of men be contemptible and
   inconsiderable, it must be those who are in the lowest condition of
   debasement, bondmen and slaves: but every bondman, as well as every
   freeman, shall be brought before this tribunal. And so, likewise, (Rev.
   xx. 12, 13.) where all persons are distributed into two ranks small and
   great: "I saw the dead both small and great, standing before God, and
   the books were opened, and the dead were judged out of the things which
   were written in those books, and the sea gave up the dead which were in
   it, and death and the grave gave up the dead which were in them; and
   they were judged every man according to their works." You see the whole
   world is ransacked and searched, sea and land, that none may escape
   this judgment. For which reason it seems to be called by the apostle
   St. Jude, (ver. 6.) "the judgment of the great day;" for that will be a
   great day indeed, in which all men that ever lived in the world shall
   appear and receive their trial.

   The sum of all is this: that all persons that ever were upon the face
   of the earth, none excepted, of what sex or age, of what rank or
   quality, of what country or nation, in what times or places soever they
   were born or lived; high or low, rich or poor, knowing or ignorant,
   good or bad, young or old, the greatest princes and potentates, as well
   as the meanest subjects and slaves; the deepest statesmen and
   politicians, the learned clerks and disputers of this world, as well as
   the idiots and the simple; in short all, without any distinction or
   exception, without any privilege or respect of persons, shall at this
   great day appear before this high tribunal, and give an account of
   themselves, and all their actions, and receive the proper doom and
   sentence respectively due to them. I proceed to the

   II. Second thing I proposed; which was to confirm this yet farther by
   arguments drawn from reason and Scripture together. And this will
   appear, whether we consider the nature of man, or the nature of God.
   And,

   1. If we consider the nature of man: we are all God's creatures, who
   have received all that we have from him, and depend wholly upon him,
   and are entirely subject to him, to be governed by such laws as he hath
   prescribed to us, and to be account able to him for our observance or
   violation of them; all this is essentially included in the nature of a
   reasonable creature, and as such we all stand equally related to him.
   As we are creatures, we are not our own, but wholly another's, and
   perfectly at the disposal of him who made us, and from whom we received
   all that we have: and as we are reasonable creatures, we are all
   equally endowed with free choice and power over our actions; by the
   good or bad use whereof we are capable of doing well or ill, and
   consequently of deserving well or ill for our doings, and of receiving
   rewards and punishments accordingly: we are all capable of being
   governed by laws, and therefore under the authority of God, as our
   lawgiver, and liable and accountable to him as our judge.

   And all this is necessary and universal, because it is consequent upon
   the condition of our nature and being; and whoever pretends to be
   exempted from the judgment of God, he must exempt himself out of the
   creation of God, he must deny the God that made him, and renounce his
   relation to him as a creature; must disclaim his dependance upon him,
   and subjection to him; he must withdraw himself from the authority and
   jurisdiction of the universal King of the world, and declare that he
   hath nothing to do to rule over him, that he doth not stand obliged to
   him for his being, nor did receive from him those talents of life, and
   health, and reason, and other blessings which he enjoys, and
   consequently that he is not concerned to make any improvements of them,
   being accountable to none for the good or bad use of them.

   Now, if any man can think thus, that he is none of God's creatures and
   subjects, he may hope to decline and escape his judgments: but every
   man that owns God for his creator and sovereign, must yield himself to
   be subject to his laws, and liable to his judgment. Upon this account
   the apostle St. Paul concludes all the world, the gentiles as well as
   the Jews, to be liable to the judgment of God; because they are all
   equally subject to his laws. (Rom. iii. 19.) "Now we know (says he)
   that whatsoever things the law saith, it saith to them who are under
   the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world, (that is,
   both Jews and gentiles,) may become guilty before God" In the Greek it
   is upo'dikos ge'netai to theo, "that all the world may be subject (or
   liable) to the judgment of God." Now though this be immediately spoken
   of the Jews, who were under a written law; yet he had told us before in
   what sense the gentiles also, as well as the Jews, are under the law of
   God: (chap. ii. 14.) "For when the gentiles, which have not the law, do
   by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,
   are a law to themselves, shewing the work (or effect) of the law
   written in their hearts, their consciences also bearing them witness,
   and their thoughts in the mean while accusing, or else excusing one
   another." His meaning is, that there is no person in the world, but,
   though he hath not the knowledge of Divine revelation, and that law of
   God which is written in the Scriptures; yet he hath the light of
   natural conscience, he hath a law which is born within him, enacted, as
   I may say, in his very nature, and written upon his heart, which will
   acquaint him with the material parts and great lines of his duty; and
   by virtue of this law he is obnoxious to the judgment of God, and
   stands accountable to him for all his breaches and violations of it. So
   that, from the common nature of man, and that which is essential to all
   men, it is evident that we are all equally liable to the judgment of
   God.

   2. If we consider the nature of God, who is impartially just, and no
   accepter of persons, this likewise will furnish us with an argument for
   the proof of this truth, that none shall be exempted from the judgment
   of God. Justice requires that every one should have that which of due
   belongs to him: but of due it belongs to every reasonable creature, to
   give an account of himself, and of his actions, to the great Judge of
   the world: and to exempt any from this account would be partiality, and
   that which the Scripture calls proosopolepsi'a, "respect" or
   "acceptation of persons," and which the Scripture doth every where
   remove at the greatest distance from God. (Deut. x. 17.) "The Lord your
   God is Lord of lords, and God of gods; a great God, mighty and
   terrible, he regardeth not persons." (2 Chron. xix. 7.) "There is no
   iniquity with the Lord your God, nor accepting of persons." Job,
   (xxxiv. 18, 19.) speaking of the impartial justice of God, says, "He
   accepteth not the persons of princes, nor accepteth the rich more than
   the poor: for they are all the work of his hands." (1 Pet. i. 17.) "If
   we call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth every
   man."

   Now, respect of persons is, in the distribution of justice, to have
   respect to some qualities and circumstances of persons, which do not at
   all appertain to the merits of the cause, and upon that account to deal
   unequally with those whose cases otherwise are equal. As, when two
   persons are equally guilty and obnoxious to the law, to bring one upon
   his trial and condemn him, but to exempt the other from justice; or, if
   he come upon his trial, to ab solve and acquit him upon some account of
   relation, or interest, or friendship; or, because he is rich and
   powerful, the other mean and poor; or upon any other account besides
   the pure merits of the cause. Now the impartial and inflexible justice
   of the Divine nature is such, that he is not to be moved and wrought
   upon by any consideration whatsoever, to exempt any person from
   appearing at his bar, and receiving his trial there, and having
   judgment passed upon him, according as upon trial his cause shall
   appear to be. "We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ."
   No person whatever, of what condition soever, shall be exempted from
   it.

   All that now remains is to apply this to ourselves, and that in these
   following particulars:

   I. From what has been said, we learn that this doctrine of a future
   judgment equally concerns every one of us, and ought in reason to have
   the like influence upon us, because we are all of us, without
   difference or exception, equally liable to the judgment of God; not one
   of us, of what age, or quality, or condition soever, shall be exempted
   from it Whoever thon art, how great, or rich, or powerful soever,
   though never so big and considerable among men, thou shalt not escape
   the judgment of God. It may be, thou art a prince, and bearest rule
   over others: but thou also art liable to the judgment of God, and
   therefore oughtest to remember, that "they that rule over men must be
   just, ruling in the fear of God," and of that great account which they
   must one day give of that high charge committed to them. It may be now
   thou judgest others, and canst call them before thy bar, and make them
   tremble, having power and authority to absolve or condemn them: but
   remember, that for all this thou must come into judgment thyself, and
   give an account how thou hast judged others, and whether thou hast sat
   and proceeded in these inferior courts as one mindful of the high
   tribunal of God, and with a just sense of the judgment of the great
   day, when all the causes which thou hast tried here upon earth, will be
   reviewed and severely scanned in that higher court, from which there
   can be no appeal.

   It may be thou art rich and powerful, and one of those great flies that
   can break through the cobwebs of human laws, and escape the judgment of
   them: but the judgment of God will take fast hold of thee, and, in
   despite of all thy interest and might, will take a severe revenge upon
   thee. As powerful as thou art, thou art but a man, and God is
   infinitely too strong for thee, thou canst not escape out of his hands.
   "Thinkest thou, O man! that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?"
   says the apostle, looking upon it as a foolish and absurd imagination,
   for any man to think that he can by any means avoid the judgment of
   God.

   So that, so long as we are men, whatever else we are, we ought to stand
   in awe of the judgment of the great day; because, let our rank and
   condition be what it will, we are all equally obnoxious to that, and
   can upon no account whatsoever plead any privilege or exemption from
   it.

   II. The consideration of this confounds all those differences and
   distinctions of men, which make such a noise in this world; and
   whatever they may signify in this world, makes them very inconsiderable
   as to the other. Why then should men be puffed up, and look so big upon
   account of any of these things, when there is a day not far off, and
   which will certainly, and, for aught we know, shortly overtake us,
   which will level men in all these respects, and set them upon even
   ground, before an impartial bar: where none of these things will be had
   in any consideration, and where the foolish pride and arrogance of men
   shall be confounded: and those who were wont to look down with so much
   scorn upon others, as so infinitely below them, shall find themselves
   upon an equal level with the poorest and most abject part of mankind,
   and shall be ready to say, with the wise man in the Wisdom of Solomon,
   (chap. v. 8.) "What hath pride profited us, or what hath riches with
   our vaunting brought us? All these things are passed away as a shadow,
   and as a post that hasteth by." So that we ought to use well all those
   advantages which we have above others in this world: if we do not, they
   will be of no use and benefit to us in the other. "Riches profit not in
   the day of wrath."

   All these petty civil differences and discriminations of high and low,
   rich and poor, honourable and base, they only hold in this world, and
   are in vogue on this side the grave: but when we come into the other
   world, they will all cease, and signify nothing. There the powerful
   oppressor can do nothing to the injury of the poorest man that ever
   lived in this world, and as little to his own safety and security. All
   that power and interest which is now so considerable, and makes its way
   every where, and does what it pleaseth, will be of no use and
   significancy in the other world. The great and the mighty, when death
   hath once arrested them, and bound them over to the judgment of the
   great day, their glory and strength departs from them, and they are
   then but like other men. Job elegantly describes the state of men after
   death: (Job iii. 17-19.) "There the wicked cease from troubling: and
   there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest together, they
   hear not the voice of the oppressor. The small and the great are there,
   and the servant is free from his master." While we are upon the stage
   of this world, we sustain several persons; one is a prince and a great
   man, another is a captain and a mighty man; and whilst this life lasts,
   these differences are considerable. But when we retire and go off the
   stage, we shall then be undressed, we shall be stripped of all our
   titles, and of all our glory, and go out of the world as naked as we
   came into it. Death and judgment level all mankind, and when we come to
   appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, we shall all stand upon
   equal terms. For God respects not the persons of the mighty in
   judgment, he will shew no reverence to the great ones of this world,
   but will deal impartially and alike with all. (Matt. xxv. 32.) You may
   there see how the Judge himself represents the universality and
   impartiality of his dealings with men in that day: "Before him shall be
   gathered all nations, and he shall separate them one from another, as a
   shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats." All mankind shall then be
   gathered into one common flock, among which there shall no other
   distinction be made, but of sheep and goats; the separation which shall
   then be made, shall not be of the high from the low, of the rich from
   the poor, of the honourable from the base, of the learned from the
   ignorant; there shall be but one distinction then made, of the good
   from the bad, and the righteous from the wicked; there shall no
   consideration be then had, but only of the moral differences of men;
   all civil difference will then vanish and be of no account in that day,
   either to exempt any man from that judgment, or to gain any favour and
   respect to him in the hearing or decision of his cause. This should
   make all men very modest and humble in this world, to consider how they
   shall be levelled in the next.

   III. How should the consideration of this dash all our sensual mirth
   and jollity, and put a damp upon our spirits, when they are too light
   and vainly transported with the pleasures and delights of this world!
   If a man be to prepare himself to be tried for his life after a few
   days, how will he look about him! With what care and seriousness will
   he provide for so solemn an occasion, and neglect nothing that may
   stand him in stead, and help to bring him off when he shall receive his
   trial! The thoughts of this will spoil all his mirth, and turn the
   lightness of his spirit into sober sadness. Much more ought the
   consideration of a judgment infinitely more terrible, and in the
   consequence of it of far greater concernment to us, to compose our
   minds into a serious frame. For if we believe a future and general
   judgment, and that none of us can by any means possibly escape it, then
   certainly it highly concerns every one of us to be serious, and to pass
   the time of this life in a perpetual awe of it. So St. Peter argues
   from this consideration: (1 Pet. i. 17.) "And if ye call on the Father,
   who without respect of persons judgeth every man, pass the time of your
   sojourning here in fear," This thought should interpose itself in all
   our mirth, that "we must appear before the judgment-seat of Christ."
   And therefore Solomon admonisheth young men, in the midst of their
   sports and pleasures, to think of a future account; (Eccles. xi. 9.)
   "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in
   the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the
   sight of thine eyes: but know, that for all these things God will bring
   thee into judgment."

   IV. And lastly, From hence we learn, that the business of religion does
   equally concern every man. For if we must all be judged, we are all
   concerned to prepare and provide for it: and a religious and virtuous
   life is the only preparation for it. How should we order our lives with
   a respect to this great and general assize, when every one of us shall
   be brought upon his trial, and stand at the bar of God to be judged by
   him! Many live as if they thought the business of religion below them,
   and not at all appertaining to them: but if the judgment of God will
   equally reach all persons, then I am sure it equally concerns all to
   mind religion, and a holy and virtuous life; for that alone will make
   us worthy, as our Saviour himself expresseth it, "to escape all these
   things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."

   And this is the result of Solomon's inquiry, and of his long discourse
   upon that argument--what is the great work and business, the great
   interest and concernment of men in this life; which we find in the
   conclusion of his sermon, called the book of the preacher: (Eccl. xii.
   13, 14.) "Let us (says he) hear the conclusion of the whole matter.
   Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of
   man." Religion is the great business and concernment of men in this
   world, because God will bring every man, and "every work into,
   judgment, whether it be good or evil."

SERMON CLXXX.

  OF THE ACTIONS FOR WHICH MEN WILL BE ACCOUNTABLE.

   For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every
   one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
   done, whether it be good or bad.--2 Cor. v. 10.

   I PROCEED to the third proposition contained in these words, viz. that
   all the actions which men have done in this life shall then come to
   account, and men shall be judged for them. "That every man may receive
   the things done in the body;" ta` i'dia tou so'matos, "the things
   proper and due to the body;" so some very good copies have it: and then
   the meaning will be, that every one may receive the reward due to him;
   the word body, by a frequent Hebraism, being pat for the person: as if
   he had said, the reward due to himself, according to the actions he
   hath done in this life, good or bad. But in most copies, it is, ta` dia
   tou so'matos, "the things done in, or by, the body," as our translation
   renders it; that every one may receive a reward of the actions which he
   hath done in this life; and then this phrase doth import what it is
   that shall be the matter of our account at the day of judgment, viz.
   "The things done in the body;" that is, all the actions of this life,
   while we are in this world, in this state of union of the soul and
   body.

   Whether there be any peculiar emphasis in this phrase, ta` dia tou
   so'matos, "the things done by, or in, the body," as if it did exclude
   those things which shall be done after death, in the state of
   separation of our souls from our bodies, from being accounted for at
   the resurrection in the day of judgment; I say, whether there be any
   such emphasis in those words, "the things done in the body," I cannot
   certainly affirm; though, according to the nature and reason of the
   thing, it seems very probable, as the schoolmen have generally
   determined in this case, that meritum est viatoris, "merit and demerit
   are proper to this state of trial;" and that wicked men, when they are
   in termino, and their state is finally concluded, and the trial of
   their obedience is at an end, do not demerit by their sins, nor
   increase their punishment. For, although that hatred and enmity of God
   which is in the damned spirits, be a monstrous irregularity in a
   creature, yet it cannot well in reason be otherwise, but that a
   creature, which is extremely miserable, and withal desperate, and past
   all hopes of remedy and recovery out of that dismal state; I say, it
   cannot well in reason be otherwise expected, but that a creature in
   such a condition should rage against the Author of its torment and
   punishment, and do all the despite to him that he can, and wish that he
   were not, though it be in vain to wish so; and it seems probable that
   God will not bring this to a new account, because it seems so natural
   and necessary a consequent of a miserable and desperate state: but
   though all this be probable, I am far from being peremptory in it, much
   less am I confident that it is the meaning of this phrase here in the
   text; I do not love to build an opinion upon a single and doubtful
   phrase of Scripture. I only mention it by the by, not intending to
   insist upon it, being much of his mind who said, Non amo nimis argutam
   theologiam, "1 am no lover of great subtlety and nicety in divinity."

   It is sufficient to my purpose, that this phrase of "every man's
   receiving the things done in the body," does at least import thus
   much--that we shall be accountable, at the day of judgment, for all the
   actions that we have done in this life, and receive the due recompence
   and reward of them; which is the proposition I intend as briefly as I
   can to illustrate and confirm.

   And, first, For the illustration of this point, I shall instance in the
   several heads of action, as they take their difference and variety from
   the principle, or matter, or object, or other circumstances of them. We
   must render an account to this great Judge for our inward as well as
   outward actions; for the acts of our minds, and every thought springing
   up there, especially if it be cherished and entertained by us; for all
   our secret designs, purposes, and intentions, as well as for the words
   which we speak, and the outward actions which we do; whatever we have
   thought and designed, spoken and declared, accomplished and done, will
   then be considered and examined, and we shall be judged for it. We must
   likewise give an account of all our civil as well as religious actions,
   of our behaviour toward men in all our dealing and intercourse with
   them, as well as of our demeanour toward God in the duties of his more
   immediate worship and service. The neglects and omissions of our duty
   in any kind will also come under consideration, as well as our
   commissions of evil; a strict account likewise will be exacted of all
   the talents which God hath entrusted us with, of all the abilities,
   opportunities, and advantages we ever had of doing service to God, and
   good to men; and whether we have made answerable improvements of them
   for the glory of God, and the benefit and advantage of men.

   We must be accountable likewise for words and actions of less moment
   and consequence, as well as for those of greater weight and
   concernment; for those which were done in secret, and in the greatest
   darkness and privacy, as well as for those which were done in public,
   and in the open view and light of the world; for the good and evil
   which hath been done by ourselves, and in our own persons, and for what
   hath been done by others by our command and countenance, and from the
   influence of our counsel and persuasion, or example, or which we have
   been any ways accessary to hinder or promote; and lastly, for the
   manner and circumstances of our actions, as well as for the matter and
   substance of them; all these will be surveyed and strictly searched
   into, and weighed in an exact balance, that we may receive a reward or
   punishment proportionable to them.

   Secondly, For the confirmation of this, I shall make it evident both
   from Scripture and reason.

   I. From Scripture; which in general tells us, that "God will bring
   every work into judgment;" and that, in order thereto, God strictly
   observes and takes notice of what we do; that "his eyes are upon the
   ways of man, and that he seeth all his goings; that there is no
   darkness nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide
   themselves," (Job xxxiv. 21, 22.) That "the ways of men are before the
   eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings," (Prov. v. 21.) That
   "he knoweth our paths and our lying clown, and is acquainted with all
   our ways." That "there is not a word in our tongue, but he knoweth it
   altogether," and that "he understands even our thoughts afar off;"
   (Psal. cxxxix. 2-4.) That all the actions of men are recorded in books,
   which shall be produced and opened at the great day, "and the dead,
   both small and great, shall be judged from those things, which shall be
   written in those books;" (Rev. xx. 21.)

   And more particularly the Scripture tells us, that those words and
   actions of men which seem most inconsiderable, and are most likely to
   be exempted, shall be accounted for, and severely scanned and weighed.
   (Matt. xii. 36, 37.) Says our Lord there, "I say unto you, that every
   idle word," by which, if our Saviour do not mean every unprofitable, to
   be sure every wicked word, "that men shall speak, they shall give an
   account thereof in the day of judgment, For by thy words thou shalt be
   justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned." By which saying,
   our Saviour designedly confutes an opinion, too current among many,
   that men's words signify little, and that no account will be taken of
   them at the day of judgment; that God will not be so severe as to make
   them matter of charge and accusation, and to punish us for them in the
   other world; and, therefore, to obviate this mistake, he purposely
   adds, "for by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
   shalt be condemned." And therefore men must not think, that all their
   lewd and filthy talk, all their rash oaths and imprecations, all their
   atheistical discourse and profane jests upon religion and the Holy
   Scriptures, all their calumnies and slanders of good men, all their
   officious lies to serve a present turn and occasion will pass for
   nothing at the judgment of the great day. No, the Judge himself hath
   expressly told us, that of all such "words men shall give an account in
   the day of judgment." And St. Jude tells us, out of an ancient prophecy
   of Enoch, that "the Lord shall come with ten thousands of his saints,
   to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly,"
   not only "of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
   committed," but likewise "of all their hard speeches which ungodly
   sinners have spoken against him."

   Our most secret thoughts and actions also, as well as our open and
   public deeds, shall then be brought upon the stage. (Eccles. xii. 14.)
   "For God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
   whether it be good, or whether it be evil." (Rom. ii. 16.) "In the day
   when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to
   my gospel." And this likewise is the meaning of that proverbial speech
   so often used by our Saviour, "there is nothing covered that shall not
   be revealed; neither hid that shall not be known." There is nothing so
   secret, which shall not be disclosed and made manifest in that great
   day of revelation, and be laid open in the face of the whole world;
   especially the cunning, dissimulation, and hypocrisy of men, with God
   and men. Men are apt to think themselves safe enough, if they can but
   escape the eye of men, and commit their sins secretly, and in the dark.
   But this is either direct atheism, or downright folly; because the eye
   of God is continually upon us, and "the darkness hideth not from him,
   but the night shineth as the day; the darkness and the light are both
   alike to him." And if we be always under the inspection of our Judge,
   if all that we think, and say, and do, be "open and naked to the eye of
   him," pros o'n emin o lo'gos, "to whom we must give an account/ what
   will it profit us to dissemble before men, and to conceal any of our
   actions from them? Nay, if we could hide them from ourselves (as we
   cannot our wilful and deliberate sins), yet that would be of no
   advantage to us, because "God is greater than our hearts, and knows all
   things."

   And then, likewise, we must be accountable to God for all the neglects
   and omissions of our duty, as well as for the positive commission of
   sin, and that in proportion to the advantages and opportunities we have
   had of doing more and greater good. So our Saviour tells us, that "unto
   whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required." (Luke xii.
   48.) Many are apt to think, that if they do but abstain from notorious
   and scandalous vices, if they do nobody harm, though they do not serve
   God so fervently and constantly as others do, though they seldom think
   of him and pray to him, though they have no manner of activity or
   concernment to do good, either to the bodies or souls of men; yet that
   this negative virtue will serve their turn at the day of judgment. But
   the matter is quite otherwise, as our Saviour hath most expressly
   declared. "A good tree (saith he) will bring forth good fruit." And by
   the parable of the foolish virgins, who for want of oil in their lamps
   were shut out of the kingdom of God, he declares to us the dangerous
   state of those who slumber away their lives in a drowsy inactivity, and
   are not careful either to keep alive grace in their hearts, or to shew
   forth the light of good works in their conversation. And in the parable
   of the talents, (Matt. xxv.) he passeth a most severe sentence upon
   that slothful servant, who hid his lord's talent in a napkin, and
   buried it in the earth, without making any manner of improvement of it;
   (ver. 30.) "Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, there
   shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." And in the same chapter, where
   our Saviour represents to us the proceedings of the great day, the
   charge there drawn up against them, consists of sins of omission, and
   gross neglects to do the good which they had the ability and
   opportunity to do; (ver. 42, 43, &c.) "Depart from me, ye cursed, into
   everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was
   hungry, and ye gave me no meat; thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; a
   stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick and
   in prison, and ye visited me not." Not that sins of commission shall
   then be passed by, and left out of the account; it is taken for
   granted, that they shall be reckoned for in the first place: but the
   wisdom of our Saviour chooseth to instance in those sins, which many
   hope they shall not be called to account for, the omission and neglect
   of their duty, that he might hereby root out of the minds of men
   effectually that false opinion, which they are so apt to entertain
   concerning such sins, as if they were of a very light and venial
   nature.

   II. This is evident likewise from reason; because all the actions of
   reasonable creatures, as such, are under the regulation and government
   of law, by which, as by a rule, every thing that we do is to be
   measured. And we have all the reason that can be to expect, that he who
   gave us this law, will look to the observance of it, and take an
   account of all breaches and transgressions of it, so as to reward those
   that keep it, and to punish the bold transgressors of it; and if this
   were not so, the law would want its proper sanction and enforcement,
   and had been given to no purpose.

   And this law of God reacheth all our actions, in ward and outward,
   religions and civil, secret and open, positive and negative, with all
   the circumstances of commendation or aggravation that be long to them.
   And as this law is the rule of all human actions now, and by which we
   ought to live in this world; so it will be the rule by which we and all
   our actions shall be examined and judged in the next. The judgment of
   God will be of the same extent with his law.

   And thus I have, as briefly as I could, illustrated and confirmed the
   truth of this proposition, that all the actions which men have done in
   this life shall come to account in the next, and they shall be judged
   for them.

   And if so, then certainly no consideration that can be presented to the
   mind of man, ought in reason to be more powerful to beget in us a
   strict care and conscience of all our thoughts, words, and actions,
   than this; that, after a little while, when a few days or years are
   over, all that we ever did in this world, shall be .strictly examined
   and looked into, and be approved or condemned by the impartial judgment
   of God. And therefore, if we have any grain of true wisdom in us, any
   love to ourselves, any sense of our great and everlasting interest,
   that great day of account should always be before us, and present to
   our minds, and we should govern every action of our lives with a
   serious and awful regard to it. And if we be conscious to ourselves
   that "there is any way of wickedness in us," that we have been grossly
   culpable in the violation of any known law of God, or in the neglect of
   any part of our duty, how can we without dread think of coming to so
   severe an account, and falling under so heavy a sentence, as will then
   be pronounced upon the workers of iniquity?

   Indeed, if we could do any thing now, of which we were to give no
   account hereafter, and which would not be taken into consideration at
   the great day, we then might be secure and careless as to such actions;
   but when nothing we do is exempted from the judgment of God; when we
   are assured, beyond all doubt, that he will one day take cognizance of
   every thought, word, and action; how circumspect should we be, "what
   manner of persons we are in all holy conversation and godliness!" How
   nearly does it concern us, "to take heed to our ways, lest at any time
   we offend: to keep our hearts with all diligence," and a to set a watch
   to the door of our lips!" that we may not think or speak any thing in
   the sight and hearing of our Judge, by which we may incur his censure
   and condemnation. This is the consideration which the wise man proposes
   to us, as of all other the most likely to awe men to the careful
   obedience and observance of God's laws. "Fear God, and keep his
   commandments; for God will bring every work into judgment, and every
   secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil."

   Can we be negligent of our lives and actions, when we consider that all
   the passages of our lives are upon record, and that there is a most
   exact register kept of them, written in indelible characters, with "a
   pen of iron., and the point of a diamond?" as the expression is, (Jer.
   xvii. 1.) "I remember all their wickedness, and their doings are before
   me," says God,(Hos. vii. 2.) and, (Amos viii. 7.) "The Lord hath sworn
   by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will not forget any of their
   works." We sin, and forget that we have sinned; but God chargeth
   himself with the remembrance of all our evil doings, and they can never
   slip out of his mind.

   Did men seriously believe these things, and were they affected with
   them as they ought, they could not but have a wonderful effect upon
   their lives, to make us more watchful over our ways, and to tread every
   step of our lives more warily. We could not commit iniquity with so
   much greediness and pleasure, and "rush into sin, as the horse rusheth
   into battle," without any fear or consideration, were we verily
   persuaded, that every evil action that we do in this life, will be
   matter of charge and accusation in the day of judgment.

   Therefore, when we are doing any thing, we should ask ourselves, will
   not this also come into judgment? When we are engaged in any wicked
   design, or vicious course, we should consider, with what face will this
   act of violence and oppression, of fraud and cozenage, of filthy
   lewdness and brutish intemperance, appear at the great day? How will it
   look when "God shall arise to judgment?" When we are careless and
   remiss, slight and superficial in the service of God, and the duties of
   his worship, we should remember that God takes notice of all this, and
   we must give an account to him for the manner, as well as the matter of
   our actions.

   If the actions of our lives were transient, and the consequence of them
   were over so soon as they are done, and no memorial of them would
   remain here after; if they would die with us, and never rise up in
   judgment against us; we needed not to take such heed to them: but we do
   all things for eternity, and every action of this life will have a good
   or bad influence upon our everlasting state.

   More particularly, the consideration of this should have an influence
   upon us, more especially, to these purposes.

   1. To make us afraid of lesser sins, as well as greater, because those
   also, as well as these, will come into judgment; and we should not
   esteem any thing little, which God shall think fit to take into
   consideration, and to bring upon the stage at the great day.

   2. The consideration of this should likewise deter us from secret sins.
   We are apt to think, that if we can but sin in secret, and hide what we
   do from the eyes of men, we are secure and safe enough: but, alas! our
   great danger is not from men, but God; not now, but hereafter. We are
   now very solicitous to conceal our wickedness, that we may avoid shame,
   and escape punishment from men: but God will one day produce all our
   secret sins, and bring them forth into the light, for all our studious
   concealment of them now. Now we are afraid of the eye of men, and
   therefore choose secrecy, that we may commit our sins privately and
   unseen. Vain man! the day is at hand, when all thy secret lewdness and
   fraud will be brought upon the public stage of the world, and be matter
   of public infamy to thee, and an everlasting reproach that can never be
   wiped off; and though thou now coverest thy transgression as Adam, and
   hidest thine iniquity in thy bosom, yet the time is coming, when all
   thy secret wickedness shall be exposed to the view of angels and men:
   and then, sinner, what wilt thou do, when thou shalt appear before this
   all-seeing Judge? none of thine arts of concealment will then stand
   thee in stead, Canst thou hide thy sins from his eye, so that he cannot
   search them out? or thyself from his wrath? If thou canst not, what
   matters it to have any secret from others, when all is known to thy
   Judge?

   3. This should likewise dispose us to great sincerity in all our words
   and actions, and make us always to speak as we think, to perform what
   we promise and profess, and in all things to be what we would seem to
   be, since there is a day coming when "the secrets of all hearts shall
   be disclosed," and every mask of hypocrisy and dissimulation shall be
   plucked off, and our most close and cunning designs shall be brought
   into the open light. In that great day of revelation, nothing will be
   matter of comfort and rejoicing to us, but "the testimony of our
   consciences, that, in all simplicity, and godly sincerity, we have had
   our conversation in the world."

   4. This should make us faithfully to improve all the talents and
   opportunities which God affords to us; because we are but stewards, and
   must give an account of them. We are apt to covet great wealth, and to
   aspire after great places and power; but do we consider what it is that
   we so eagerly desire and pursue? All this will but bring upon us the
   burden of a greater and heavier account, if we do not improve these
   talents and advantages to the end for which they were given, to relieve
   the wants of the poor and miserable, and to serve the great ends of
   religion and virtue; and if we fail herein, a dreadful account will be
   exacted of us, and we shall wish that we had been the poorest and
   meanest, the most ignorant and unlearned persons in the world.

   5. This should restrain us from uncharitable censures of others. "Thou
   art therefore inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art, that judgest
   another: for thinkest thou that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?"
   as the apostle reasons, (Rom. ii. 1.)

   6. This may help to support us under the unjust censures and reproaches
   of men. If we be innocent, God will one day "bring forth our
   righteousness as the light, and our judgment as the noon-day." "With
   me, (saith Paul, 1 Cor. iv. 3.) it is a very small thing that I should
   be judged of you, or of man's judgment. He that judgeth me is the
   Lord." It is desirable to approve ourselves and our actions to men: but
   if we cannot, it is a great satisfaction to approve them to our own
   consciences, and to God, who is "greater than our hearts, and knows all
   things."

   Lastly, This will teach us not to measure our condition by the good
   opinion which others have of us; but by the law of God, which will be
   the standard and measure of our judgment. He will consider every thing
   exactly, and weigh all the circumstances of our case, and make all the
   allowances that equity requires. Men can but judge according to
   appearance: but the judgment of God will be according to truth;
   therefore we should above all "labour to be accepted of him in that
   day,"
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLXXXI.

  OF THE SENTENCE TO BE PASSED AT THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.

   For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every
   one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath
   done, whether it be good or bad.--2 Cor. v. 10.

   I PROCEED to the fourth and last proposition contained in the text;
   viz. That at the day of judgment, sentence shall be passed upon men
   according to the nature and quality of their actions done in this
   world, whether good or evil. The reward of happiness or misery, which
   men shall be sentenced to at that day, shall bear a proportion to the
   good or evil which they have done in this life.

   In the prosecution of this argument, I shall inquire into these two
   things:

   First, What proportion the rewards of the next world shall bear to the
   actions of men in this life.

   Secondly, The grounds and reasons of it. And then make some application
   of this truth to the consciences of men.

   First, What proportion the rewards of the next world shall bear to the
   actions of men in this life. I mean, whether the rewards of the next
   life shall only be proportioned to the kind and quality of our actions
   considered in general, as good or evil; that is, that good men shall be
   rewarded with everlasting glory and happiness, and wicked men with
   eternal punishment and torment: or whether the degrees of these rewards
   shall likewise bear a proportion to the degrees of the good or evil of
   our actions, so that a more eminent degree of piety and holiness shall
   have a proportionable share of glory and happiness; and greater and
   more heinous sins shall be loaded with greater and heavier punishments.

   I. It is clear, and out of all controversy, that men shall be rewarded
   according to the quality and kind of their actions; good shall be
   rewarded to the good, and evil to the evil. And this is the constant
   tenor of the Bible. (Psal. i. 6.) "The Lord knoweth the way of the
   righteous;" that is, doth approve it, and will reward it: "but the way
   of the ungodly shall perish;" which is of the same importance with the
   expression in the verse before, "the wicked shall not stand in the
   judgment." (Isa. iii. 10, 11.) "Say ye to the righteous, it shall be
   well with him, for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings. Woe
   unto the wicked, for it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his
   hands shall be given him;" which, if it be meant of the rewards and
   punishments of this life, is much more constantly and universally true
   of the other. (Matt. xvi. 27.) "The Son of man shall come in the glory
   of the Father, with his angels with him, and shall reward every man
   according to his works." (Rev. xxii. 12.) "Behold, I come quickly, and
   my reward is with me, to render to every man according as his work
   shall be;" that is, whether good or evil. (Rom. vi. 23.) "The wages of
   sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life:" that is, "to those
   who have their fruit unto holiness," as he had said immediately before.
   Hither likewise belong those innumerable texts, in which glory, and
   happiness, and eternal life, are promised to those who live "soberly,
   righteously, and godly in this present world;" and wickedness and
   disobedience are threatened with dreadful and eternal punishment. But I
   shall only take notice of two or three of the most remarkable of them.
   (Matt. xiii. 41 43.) "The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and
   they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them
   which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire, there
   shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine
   forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father." But this is most
   fully represented in that particular description, which our Lord
   himself makes of the process of that day, (Matt. xxv. 34.) where the
   sentence that shall be passed on the righteous is this: "Come ye
   blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you before the
   foundation of the world." And on the wicked, (ver. 41.) "Depart from
   me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
   angels." And, (ver. 46.) "These, (speaking of the wicked, (shall go
   away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal."
   (John v. 28, 29.) "The hour is coming, in which all that are in their
   graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done
   good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto
   the resurrection of damnation." (Rom. ii. 6-9.) Speaking of "the
   revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who (says the apostle)
   shall render to every man according to his works; to them, who by
   patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and
   immortality, eternal life: but to them that are contentious, and obey
   not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
   tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doth evil."

   II. That the rewards and recompences of the next world shall likewise
   bear a proportion to the degrees of good or evil which we have done in
   this life, though it hath been controverted, seems also to be
   sufficiently clear from Scripture. And to this purpose, I shall,

   1. Produce such texts as will fully prove it.

   2. Answer the grounds of the contrary opinion.

   1. The Scripture doth plainly assert, that the rewards of the next life
   will bear a proportion not only to the kind and quality of our actions,
   but to the degree of them; that good men shall receive a reward
   proportionable to the degree of their holiness and obedience, of their
   service and sufferings for God; and that the torments of the wicked
   shall be greater or less, according to the degree and aggravation of
   their sins.

   (1.) As for good men: that the reward that shall be bestowed upon them
   shall bear a proportion to the degree of their service and sufferings
   for God. This seems to be intimated in those metaphorical expressions
   used by the prophet Daniel: (chap. xii. 3.) "They that be wise, shall
   shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to
   righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever." Which is much the same
   with what St. Paul expressly affirms, concerning the different glory of
   the saints at the resurrection: (1 Cor. xv. 41.) "There is one glory of
   the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for
   one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the
   resurrection of the dead." (Matt. v. 10, 11.) "Blessed are ye, when men
   shall revile you, and persecute you, and speak all manner of evil
   against you for my name's sake: rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for
   great is your reward in heaven." Which words, if they do not signify a
   more glorious reward to those who suffer persecution for Christ, have
   no emphasis or encouragement in them. For what cause of exceeding joy
   and gladness is it, to be persecuted and suffer for Christ, if a
   peculiar reward did not belong to those who suffer for him? If there do
   not, then those who suffer for Christ are plainly in a worse condition
   in this world, than other good men who escape these sufferings; and yet
   are in no better condition than others in the next world: and why then
   should any man be glad to suffer? (Matt. x. 41, 42.) "He that receiveth
   a prophet, in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward;
   and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man,
   shall receive a righteous man's reward." Where you see a difference
   intimated between the reward of a prophet and a righteous man; namely,
   that a prophet shall have a greater reward than an ordinary good man.
   (Matt. xix. 28, 29.) Where our blessed Saviour tells us, that all that
   denied themselves for Christ, shall inherit everlasting life; but for
   his disciples, who were continually attendants upon him, and sufferers
   for him, that a more eminent degree of glory should be conferred on
   them; which is expressed by their "sitting upon twelve thrones, to
   judge the twelve tribes of Israel." But most plainly in the parable of
   the talents, where every man's reward is according to the improvement
   of his talents. "He that had gained five talents, is made ruler over
   five cities: and he that had gained ten talents, ruler over ten
   cities." (Luke xix. 15. 1 Cor. xv. 58.) "Be ye steadfast, unmoveable,
   always abounding in the work of the Lord: forasmuch as you know that
   your labour is not in vain in the Lord." But if our reward should not
   hold a proportion to the degree of our service, it would be in vain to
   be abundant in the work of the Lord. (2 Cor. iv. 17.) "Our light
   affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory;" that is, our affliction
   contributes to our glory, and adds to the degree of it. (2 Cor. ix. 6.)
   The apostle useth this as an argument to persuade the Corinthians to be
   very liberal and bountiful to their distressed brethren, because
   according to the degree of their charity, would be the degree of their
   reward. "This, I say, he that soweth sparingly, shall reap sparingly;
   and he that soweth plentifully, shall reap plentifully:" than which I
   cannot imagine any thing can be spoken more plainly to this purpose.
   And the same argument he useth to the Philippians, to stir them up to
   charity: (Phil. iv. 17.) "Not because I desire a gift, but I desire
   fruit that may abound to your account;" clearly implying, that the more
   good we do in this world, the more abundant shall be our reward in the
   next.

   (2.) It is likewise as plain from Scripture, that the punishment and
   torment of wicked men will be abated or increased proportionably to the
   degree and aggravation of their sins. Upon this account our Saviour
   threatens those who continue impenitent under the gospel, with more
   heavy and dreadful punish-, merits, and tells us, that in the day of
   judgment their condition shall be far worse than theirs of Tyre and
   Sidon, of Sodom and Gomorrah. (Matt. xi. 20, 21.) And (Matt. xxiv. 51.)
   he threatens that servant, who, because "his Lord delayed his coming,"
   presumed so much upon the patience of God, with a more severe
   punishment: "The lord of that servant shall cut him in sunder, and
   appoint him his portion with the hypocrites;" intimating, that the
   punishment of hypocrites will be very severe, and, as it were, the
   standard of the highest punishment. And so, likewise, (Luke xii. 47,
   48.) our Saviour tells us, that, according to the degree of light and
   knowledge which men sin against, shall be the degree of their torment.
   "The servant that knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself to do
   according to it, shall be beaten with many stripes: but he that knew it
   not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few
   stripes." And in general he tells us, that the punishment of sinners
   takes its aggravation from the advantages and opportunities which men
   have neglected. "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him much shall
   be required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask
   the more." So likewise the apostle to the Hebrews tells us, that God
   will vindicate the contempt of the gospel more severely than of the law
   of Moses: (Heb. ii. 2-4.) "If the word spoken by angels was steadfast,
   and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of
   reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?" And,
   (chap. x. 28, 29.) "He that despised Moses's law died without mercy,
   under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, think ye,
   shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God?"

   So that it seems very evident from Scripture, that the degree of
   happiness or misery which men shall be sentenced to in the next world,
   shall be correspondent to the degree of good or evil which they have
   done in this world; and I can hardly imagine any thing more clear. But
   it seems the schoolmen, and other divines, who have been at leisure to
   tie knots, and to make objections against the plainest truths, have
   called this also into question. And, therefore, I shall, in the

   Second place, briefly examine the grounds of the contrary opinion;
   which, though they do but immediately strike at the degrees of glory
   and happiness, yet, by a parity of reason and consequence, they
   likewise overthrow the degrees of punishment; and they are these two:

   I. They say, that the merits of Christ, by which eternal life and
   happiness is purchased for us, are equal to all those who have any
   interest in them, and are of value sufficient to purchase the highest
   degree of glory for them; and the meritorious cause being the same,
   there is no reason to imagine any difference of degrees in the effect.

   Answer.--The weakness of this objection, how specious soever it may
   appear, will be evident to any one that considers, that eternal life
   and happiness doth not accrue to us by way of necessary and natural
   result from the merit of Christ's obedience and sufferings, but of
   voluntary compact and agreement, and therefore is only available so far
   as it pleased God the Father and him that it should be. Now the
   Scripture hath declared, that "Christ is the author of eternal
   salvation to them that believe and obey him:" but it hath declared
   likewise, that, according to the degrees of our holiness and obedience,
   shall be the degrees of our happiness; because the happiness which
   Christ hath purchased for us, is not bestowed upon us but upon certain
   terms and conditions to be performed on our part, upon the performance
   whereof, and the degree of that performance, the degrees of our
   happiness do depend.

   II. The other objection is from the parable of the labourers in the
   vineyard, (Matt. xx.) where it is said, that "they that came in at the
   last hour received as much as they that came in at the first, and had
   borne the heat and burden of the day, every one his penny." For answer
   to this, it is a known rule among divines, that theologia parabolica
   non est argumentativa; by which they mean, that we cannot argue in
   divinity from every circumstance of a parable, but only from the main
   scope of it. Now this parable seems plainly directed against the
   envious Jews, who murmured because the gentiles were to partake of the
   blessing of the Messias, and that they who were called in the last age
   of the world, should share in this benefit, as well as the ancient
   people of God; so that, by the murmurers, the Jews are designed, who
   were offended that salvation should come to the gentiles. And then the
   scope of the parable is not that all good men shall have equal degrees
   of glory; but that the gentiles, which were called long after the Jews,
   should be saved as well as they. I proceed to the

   Second thing I proposed to inquire into, viz. The grounds and reasons
   of this, why the rewards which shall be distributed at the day of
   judgment, shall bear a proportion to the good or evil which men have
   done in this life? And,

   1. That they shall be correspondent to the nature and quality of our
   actions, the justice and equity of the Divine providence doth plainly
   require. For justice is to give to every one that which of due belongs
   to him: now of equity it belongs to them that do well, that it should
   go well with them; and to the evil, that it should be ill with them;
   that every one should "receive the fruit of his doings." Not that we
   can strictly merit any thing at the hand of God. It is goodness to
   reward an innocent creature, and it is goodness to reward the good
   actions of those who have been sinners; but justice requires that good
   and bad men should not fare alike. Thus Abraham reasons from the
   justice of God; "that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be
   far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the world do right?" And,
   considering the promises which the goodness of God hath made freely to
   good men, for their encouragement in goodness, the performance of these
   promises is founded in the righteousness and faithfulness of God.

   2. That the rewards of the next life should bear a proportion to the
   degree of the good or evil done by us in this life, is clearly founded
   in the equity and reasonableness of the thing; it being very much for
   the encouragement of holiness and goodness, to be assured, that
   whatever we do for God now will be fully considered and rewarded
   hereafter; that he will take notice of the least service that we do for
   him, and that every degree of grace and holiness shall be crowned with
   an answerable degree of glory and happiness. And so, on the other hand,
   it tends very much to discountenance sin, and to keep men from running
   to the height of impiety; to consider that every sin will aggravate
   their misery, and that every degree of wickedness will add to the
   weight of their torment; and that though they be "children of wrath"
   already, yet, by adding "iniquity to transgression, they may cause the
   "wrath of God and his jealousy to smoke against them," and bring more
   curses upon themselves, and make themselves "ten times more the
   children of wrath."--

   And, indeed, in the nature of the thing, it cannot be otherwise; but
   that the better and more holy any man is, the more capable he should be
   of happiness, and the more disposed for the enjoyment of God; and the
   more wicked any man is, the more he should exasperate his own
   conscience, and awaken those furies which rage in his breast. "He
   treasures up" more "wrath against the day of wrath," and piles up more
   fuel for everlasting burnings. The torments of hell are in Scripture
   compared to fire; now the more fuel and greater store of combustible
   matter is cast into it, the more fierce and raging it must be.

   I have done with the explication, and shall now apply what hath been
   delivered:

   I. If sentence shall be passed at the great day according to the good
   or bad actions of men, this shews us what should be the great care of
   every man in this life--to attend to the nature and quality of our
   actions, and to observe that difference between them in our practice
   now, which our Judge will certainly make in the sentence which he will
   pass upon them at the great day. And yet, so blind and mistaken is the
   greatest part of the world, that they make this the least part of their
   care and business. Men are generally very solicitous to be rich and
   great, and to be in a healthful and prosperous condition, and do with
   all possible care seek to avoid sickness, and poverty, and meanness:
   but how few are concerned to be virtuous and good, and to avoid
   wickedness and vice! And yet these moral differences of men at the day
   of judgment will only be taken into consideration; other things will
   not "profit us in the day of wrath." God in that day will not proceed
   with men according to their outward quality and condition in this life;
   their eternal estate shall not then be decided according to their
   wealth or poverty, their height and meanness in this world: it will not
   then be inquired what office a man bore, what titles of honour, what
   manors or lordships, he was owner of; but how he hath behaved himself
   in those circumstances, what use he hath made of his wealth and power,
   what good or evil he hath done, whether he hath glorified God, and
   served the great ends of his creation; whether he hath obeyed or
   disobeyed the truth; whether he hath lived in "ungodliness and worldly
   lusts," or "soberly, and righteously, and godly, in this present
   world:" in a word, whether we have been righteous or wicked. This will
   be the great inquiry at that day; and these qualities, according as
   they are found with us, will determine our condition for ever.

   II. The consideration of this, may comfort good men under the
   promiscuous dispensations of God's providence in this world. Now all
   things generally happen alike, and "there is the same event to the
   righteous and to the wicked:" but things will not be always thus. Have
   but a little patience, and the justice of God's providence, which is
   now under a cloud, will clear up; the day is coming, which will make a
   wide and vast difference between good and bad men, "between those that
   serve God, and those that serve him not; those that swear, and those
   that fear an oath;" between the lewd and the chaste, the sober and
   debauched, the meek of the earth and the murderers; between the proud
   and the humble, the just and the oppressors; between those that
   persecute, and those who are persecuted, for righteousness.

   Now the difference is frequently on the wrong side; good men suffer and
   are afflicted, the wicked flourish and are prosperous: but "go into the
   sanctuary of God, and there thou shalt see their end." Let us but look
   a little before us, beyond "the things which are seen, and are but
   temporal, unto the things which are not seen, and are eternal," and we
   shall see all things straight; that the end of the wicked, who
   flourished in this world, is to be destroyed for ever; and that the
   righteous, who were so distressed and afflicted in this world, "shall
   enter into rest and joy: when the days of refreshing shall come from
   the presence of the Lord, these shall be comforted, and the other
   tormented."

   III. If the reward of the next life shall bear a proportion to the
   degrees of good or evil, which we have done in this world, then, on the
   one hand, here is matter of great comfort and encouragement to us in
   the ways of holiness and obedience. This is a mighty argument to good
   men "to grow in grace," and to press forward toward perfection, "to be
   steadfast, and unmoveable, and abundant in the work of the Lord,
   because they know that their labour shall not be in vain in the Lord;"
   but that, according to the degree of our service and obedience, of our
   virtue and goodness, shall be the degree of our glory and happiness. We
   serve a good Master, who will consider every thing that we do for him;
   "who is not unrighteous, to forget our work and labour of love," and
   will not let the least service pass un rewarded. Let us not then
   content ourselves with any low degree of goodness; but be continually
   aspiring after the highest perfection we are capable of. Since we have
   such a prize in our view, "let us run with patience," and with all our
   might, "the race which is set before us." For by the same reason that
   any man desires happiness, he cannot but desire the highest degrees of
   it that are attainable; and will consequently endeavour to make himself
   capable of the greatest degree of glory: and though no degree of
   holiness can merit everlasting life and happiness, yet greater degrees
   of holiness will certainly be rewarded with a larger portion of
   happiness. God is not bound antecedently to his promise, to give so
   great a reward to any man for his works, yet he hath promised to reward
   every man according to them.

   So that there is no reason why a good man, when he is once come to
   this, that, by the grace and assistance of God, he can refrain from
   gross sins, and resist the temptations to them, and perform the great
   duties of religion, why he should, with Esau, sit down and say, "I have
   enough," I have so much as will carry me to heaven, and I desire no
   more. It is a sad presage of apostacy, to stand still in religion. He
   that once stops, the next thing is to look back. This is the remedy
   which St. Peter prescribes against apostasy: (2 Pet. iii. 18.) "Take
   heed, lest ye fall from your own steadfastness;" and then it follows,
   "but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
   Christ." The best remedy against apostacy, is growth in goodness. It is
   a rule in policy, that an ambitious man should never stay at any step
   of preferment, till he come at the top, because it is some security to
   be in motion. Our ascent to heaven is steep and narrow, and we are
   safest when we do not stand still: temptation cannot so well take its
   aim at us.

   Let us therefore press after the highest degree of virtue and holiness,
   and labour to be as good as we can in this world, that in the next our
   happiness may be the greater; that when the day of recompence shall
   come, we may receive an ample reward, and God the righteous judge may
   set a bright and glorious crown upon our heads.

   We ought likewise to consider, that if any man can be content only to
   be saved, and desire no more but just to get to heaven, that such a
   degree of holiness and virtue, as will save a man that can attain no
   more, will perhaps not save that man who lazily rests in the lowest
   degree, and desires no more. To be least in the kingdom of God, is next
   to being shut out of it. It is not to be expected that God should
   bestow heaven and happiness upon those who are so indifferent about it,
   as to desire heaven for no other reason, but because they would not go
   to hell. Men must not think to drive so near and hard a bargain, in so
   desirable and advantageous a purchase.

   And then, on the other hand, it is matter of great terror to great
   sinners. "The wages of" every "sin is death," eternal death; and every
   degree of hell and damnation is dreadful: but there are sins more
   heinous in themselves, and some that are attended with heavier
   aggravations in some persons; these do inflame hell, and heat that
   furnace seven times hotter. There are some moderate sinners in
   comparison; these shall have a moderate doom, and a cooler hell; but
   there are others who are extravagant and enormous sinners, that "drink
   up iniquity, as the ox drinks up water;" that "let themselves loose to
   commit all wickedness with greediness;" such as sin above the common
   rate of men, with full consent and upon deliberation, with great design
   and contrivance, in despite of the clearest convictions, of the best
   counsels and reproofs; these make haste to ruin and take hell by
   violence. Now such "mighty transgressors shall be mightily tormented;"
   they shall not be punished at the common rate of sinners, their
   consciences will breed more and sharper stings, and wilder furies to
   torment them, and they shall sink into a deeper misery. More
   particularly this concerns us Christians, who continue impenitent, and
   live in our sins, not withstanding the clear revelation of the gospel,
   and "the wrath of God revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and
   unrighteousness of men;" not withstanding "life and immortality" so
   clearly "brought to light by the gospel. How shall we escape, if we
   neglect so great salvation?" What condemnation will be heavy enough for
   those, who wilfully refuse to be saved? "This is the condemnation (says
   our Saviour), that light is come into the world, and men love darkness
   rather than light." All the sins which we now commit, are infinitely
   aggravated above the sins of thousands in the world, who never enjoyed
   that light, and those advantages and opportunities, which we have done.
   "The ignorance of these God winked at, but now" he expects, "he
   commands all men every where to repent; because he hath appointed a
   day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness." What stripes
   do we deserve, who have "known our Master's will, but have not prepared
   ourselves to do according to it?" All that light and knowledge which we
   have, all those counsels and instructions which we have read and heard
   out of God's word, will inflame our account, and heighten our
   condemnation, and the very means of our salvation will be the saddest
   aggravation of our ruin. What our Saviour said of the impenitent and
   unbelieving Jews, holds as well concerning impenitent Christians; that
   "it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, for Sodom and Gomorrah,
   in the day of judgment, than for them. But, beloved, I hope better
   things of you, and things that accompany salvation." Let us but
   remember, and seriously consider, that "we must all appear before the
   judgment-seat of Christ, to receive the things done in the body,
   according to what we have done, whether good or evil;" and this will
   certainly have a mighty awe and influence upon our lives, and all the
   actions of them. Now the God of peace, &c.

SERMON CLXXXII.

  THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE DAY OF JUDGMENT, CONSIDERED AND IMPROVED.

   But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which
   are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and
   pray; for ye know not when the time is.--Mark xiii. 32, 33.

   THESE words are spoken by our Saviour of the day of judgment; for
   though, in this chapter, as likewise in the 24th of St. Matthew, and
   the 21st of St. Luke, which are parallel to it, our Saviour discourseth
   very particularly and largely concerning the eminent appearance of his
   power and justice in the destruction of Jerusalem, which may, perhaps,
   sometimes in Scripture be called "his coming;" yet it is plain,
   likewise, that he discourseth there concerning his coming to judgment
   at the end of the world. For we find, in the 24th of St. Matthew, that,
   after our Saviour had foretold his disciples of the utter ruin of
   Jerusalem, they came afterwards to him, to inquire more particularly
   about it: (ver. 3.) "And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, the
   disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us when shall these
   things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of
   the world?" Where there are two several questions, to which our Saviour
   returns a distinct answer. The first, when those things he had been
   speaking of before should be? that is, the things which related to the
   destruction of Jerusalem, for of that only he had been speaking of
   before. The other question was, concerning the sign of his coming, and
   of the end of the world.

   The reason of their joining these two questions together, seems to be
   this, (as is very probable from many texts of the New Testament) viz.
   that the apostles did think (and our Saviour permitted them for a long
   time to remain under this mistake) that the end of the world, and the
   general judgment, would be presently after the destruction of
   Jerusalem.

   Now to this second question of theirs, concerning the end of the world,
   and our Saviour's coming to judgment, he gives an answer in the latter
   part of that chapter: (ver. 29.) "But immediately after the tribulation
   of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give
   her light; and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven."
   Not that the general judgment of the world was immediately to follow
   the destruction of Jerusalem; for there were many other things to
   intervene, as is manifest from St. Luke: (xxi. 24.) That the Jews
   should be led captive into all nations, and Jerusalem should be trodden
   down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles were fulfilled.
   And though these things be expressed in a few words, yet they
   comprehend a long tract of time; for the captivity of the Jews hath
   continued for above sixteen hundred years, and is not yet at an end.
   And then after the accomplishment of these things it follows, that
   "there shall be signs in the sun and the moon, and then they shall see
   the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory." And then
   he tells them in conclusion, that these things should begin to come to
   pass, that is, some of them should happen before the end of that
   generation: and so they did, for the destruction of Jerusalem was about
   forty years after. But when the end of all should be, that is, when the
   day of judgment would happen, he could not tell them the precise time:
   (ver. 36.) "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels
   of heaven, but the Father only;" and it is added in St. Mark, "neither
   the Son."

   Now by that day and hour is meant that famous and terrible time of the
   general judgment of the world, which St. Peter calls, by way of
   eminency, "the day of the Lord:" (2 Pet. iii. 10.) "The day of the Lord
   will come as a thief in the night;" that is, it will surprise men
   suddenly and unexpectedly, because no man can tell when it will be; it
   will steal upon the world, as a thief does into a house by night. "But
   of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in
   heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and pray;
   for ye know not when the time is."

   Having thus cleared all difficulties concerning the general meaning of
   the text, that it is to be understood of the day of judgment, and not,
   as some learned men have thought, of the destruction of Jerusalem; I
   shall now consider the words more particularly, and they contain in
   them these two things:

   First, The uncertainty of the day of judgment as to us, and all other
   creatures. "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels
   of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."

   Secondly, That the consideration of the uncertainty of the time, should
   make us very careful to be always prepared for it. "Take ye heed, watch
   and pray, for ye know not when the time is." I shall speak as briefly
   as I can to both these.

   First, Our Saviour here declares the uncertainty of the time, as to us
   and all creatures, when the general judgment shall be. And to express
   this the more emphatically, he tells us,

   1. That God only knows it. "Of that day and hour, oudei`s oiden, ei me`
   o Pate`r, none knows, but the Father," For though we translate it, "no
   man," yet in the Greek it is more general, "none knows but the Father,
   (that is) God only." For the word Father is several times in the New
   Testament not used personally, in way of distinction from the Son and
   the Holy Ghost; but signifies the Deity, the Father being fons et
   principium Deitatis, "the fountain and principle of the Deity."

   "Of that day and hour;" the word hora is not here to be taken strictly
   for the measure of time, commonly called a hour; this were to make our
   Saviour's expression very flat, after he had denied that the day is
   known, to deny that they know the hour; for if they do not know the
   clay, much less the hour. Now in these kind of speeches, the expression
   ought to rise, and that which is most emphatical ought to be said in
   the last place; so that it should rather have been, "they know not the
   hour, no, nor the day;" but hora here does undoubtedly signify the
   appointed season or time; and so the four seasons of the year are by
   the Greeks called horai; and in this sense the word is most certainly
   used by the evangelist St. John: (chap. vii. 30.) "But no man laid
   hands upon him (speaking of Christ), because his hour was not yet
   come," that is, the time appointed for his suffering; and that which in
   the text is called hour, is in the next verse called kairo's, which
   signifies a particular season, or appointed time. "Ye know not when the
   time is;" that is, the time which God hath particularly designed and
   appointed for this great work of judging the world.

   2. He excludes from the knowledge of it, those who were most likely to
   know it, if God had not absolutely reserved it to himself. "Of that day
   and hour knows none, no, not the angels, neither the Son."

   (1.) "Not the angels, which are in heaven;" though they be creatures of
   so perfect a knowledge, though they be the ministers of God, and do
   continually attend upon him, and behold his face, and understand much
   more of the works of God, and his providence, in regard to the affairs
   of the world, than we that live here below in so much error and
   ignorance, that "dwell in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the
   dust:" yet the particular time, when God will judge the world, he hath
   reserved as a secret to himself, and not communicated it so much as to
   the angels, who are designed to wait upon the great Judge of the world,
   and to make up his train in that solemnity. So our Saviour tells us,
   (Matt. xxv. 31.) that "the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all
   the holy angels with him." And so likewise the apostle, (2 Thess. i.
   7.) that "the Lord Jesus Christ shall be revealed from heaven, with his
   mighty angels."

   But this is not only hid from "the angels," but which is yet more, from
   the Son himself. "Of that day and hour knows none, no, not the angels
   which are in heaven, neither the Son." This seems strange indeed, that
   the Son of God, who came from the bosom of his Father, and therefore is
   more likely than any to know his secrets, that he, whom God had
   ordained to be the judge of the world, into whose hands he had
   committed that great trust and authority, should not be acquainted with
   the time of this judgment: nay, that he, in whom are all the treasures
   of wisdom and knowledge, and in whom the Divinity does substantially
   reside, should not know this time; this seems incredible, but that he
   himself hath told us so. It was, indeed, a common saying among the
   Jews, that the time of the end of the world was revealed to none; but
   yet one would think, the Son was always excepted. Nay, how can it well
   be otherwise, if we believe him to be God? and indeed the fathers, in
   their disputes with the Arians, have mightily puzzled themselves about
   this text.

   Some, and those of no small account, have understood these words, as if
   our Saviour only in tended to put off his disciples from a more
   particular inquiry about this matter; not that he was ignorant of the
   day of judgment, but that he did not know it so as to reveal it to
   them: which is by no means to be admitted, not only because it looks
   too like the equivocation of the Jesuits, but likewise because the same
   may be said of the angels; since it is no otherwise denied of the
   angels, that they know this time, than it is of the Son. Others say,
   that his human nature was not ignorant of the day of judgment, but that
   it did not know this of itself, but by virtue of its union with the
   Divine nature. But our Saviour absolutely says, that the Son did not
   know it. And therefore others more reasonably have distinguished
   between his human nature and Divine; and though as God he could not be
   ignorant of any thing, yet his human understanding did not know it. And
   it is not unreasonable to suppose that the Divine wisdom which dwelt in
   our Saviour, did communicate itself to his human soul according to his
   pleasure; and so his human nature might at some times not know some
   things. And if this be not admitted, how can we understand that passage
   concerning our Saviour, (Luke ii. 52.) that "Jesus grew in wisdom and
   stature;" or, as the word helikia may more fitly be translated, "in
   age, and in favour with God and man? For if the human nature of Christ
   did necessarily know all things by virtue of its union with the
   Divinity, he could not then, as man, be said to grow in wisdom.

   And this I think may be sufficient for the clearing of this difficulty,
   concerning the Son's not knowing the particular time which God had
   appointed for judging the world: and if he did not know it, it is
   surely no reflection upon his disciples if they were ignorant of it, or
   mistaken about it. Their infallibility was only in things that were
   revealed to them, but cannot be imagined to extend to things not
   revealed.--And thus I have done with the first thing, namely, the
   uncertainty of the time of the general judgment, as to all but God
   only. "Of that day and hour knoweth none, no, not the angels which are
   in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father." I proceed now to the

   Second thing, which I mainly intended, viz. That the consideration of
   the uncertainty of the time should make us very careful to be always
   prepared for it. "Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when
   the time is." In which words we have,

   First, A general caution; "Take ye heed." Look to it, that ye be not
   surprised and overtaken by that time. The time being so uncertain, they
   were always in danger.

   Secondly, More particular directions how they should demean themselves
   in this case. And our Saviour directs to two things, vigilancy and
   prayer; "Watch and pray."

   Thirdly, There is a reason added to enforce this care and diligence,
   from the uncertainty of the time as to us: "For ye know not when the
   time is,"

   From whence I shall observe, by the way, the great goodness of God to
   us, and his singular care of us. That, as he is gracious and merciful
   to us, in giving us the knowledge of those things which are necessary
   and useful for us to know; so no less in keeping us ignorant of other
   things, which are not only not necessary for us to know, but which it
   would be very much to our harm and prejudice, to have the knowledge of
   them communicated to us. God hath acquainted us with whatever is
   necessary to direct and excite us to our duty; but he hath purposely
   concealed from us those things, which might tend to make us slothful
   and careless, negligent and remiss in it. He hath not acquainted us
   with the secrets of his decrees and providence; but hath reserved these
   in his own power; because it would be really to our disadvantage to
   have the knowledge of them. If we knew all events before hand, and how
   and when all things would happen, we should be too much concerned about
   some things, and too little about others; and therefore God hath, in
   great wisdom and goodness, afforded us the knowledge of those things
   which are most proper and useful for us, whereby we may be instructed
   in our duty, and encouraged and stirred up to it. (Job xxviii. 28.)
   "Unto man he saith, The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom: and to depart
   from evil, is understanding." This is the knowledge which is fit for
   us, and which no man is destitute of, but by his own fault, and gross
   neglect of himself.

   So that God is very good to us, both in revealing some things to us,
   and in hiding other things from us; particularly those things which we
   are speaking of, concerning the time of the end of the world, and the
   judgment of the great day. Which, did men certainly know to be so far
   off, as it really was in our Saviour's time, and may perhaps now be, it
   would very much abate the force and awe of it upon the minds of men;
   for then men would think themselves safe, till death should remove them
   out of the world. But when, for any thing we know, the general judgment
   of the world may overtake us the next moment; this consideration gives
   a great deal of weight to all the rest, and is apt to strike a
   particular terror into men. What man would not be afraid to offend, if
   he did not know but that the next moment he should be brought to his
   trial, be fore a severe and impartial judge? So that, for this reason,
   God hath in great kindness to us concealed this matter from us, and,
   like a wise and good father, instead of gratifying our curiosity, hath
   consulted our real benefit and advantage.

   Besides this, that it is always useful to the world to be kept in awe
   by the continual danger and terror of an approaching judgment, there
   seems to have been a more particular reason why our Saviour would have
   the disciples and first Christians ignorant of this thing; for which
   reason he discoursed so to them concerning it, as that they might
   rather apprehend, that the end of all things was at hand, and might
   probably happen in their time. And thus it seems his disciples
   understood his speech concerning St. John, as if he should not die till
   our Lord came to judgment. And the apostles, in several of their
   exhortations, seem to urge Christians from this very consideration, of
   the nearness of the general judgment. So St. Paul: (Phil. iv. 5.) "Let
   your moderation be known to all men; the Lord is at hand." And the
   author to the Hebrews, (chap. x. 25.) encourageth Christians to
   constancy in their profession upon the same account; "Not forsaking the
   assembling yourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting
   one an other, and so much the more, because the day approacheth." So
   likewise St. James: (chap. v. 9.) "Grudge not one against another,
   brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the Judge standeth at the
   door." And St. Peter tells us, that several impious men scoffed at them
   upon this account, as if the apostles had been deceivers in this
   matter, and therefore said, "Where is the promise of his coming?" as it
   were upbraiding them, for putting men in a vain expectation of it.

   And it was no inconvenience at all, that the apostles and first
   Christians had this apprehension of the nearness of that time; for no
   consideration could be more forcible to keep them steadfast in their
   profession, and to fortify them against sufferings, than a persuasion
   of the approach of that day, where in those who suffered for Christ
   should be so gloriously rewarded; and those who, for fear of suffering,
   fell off from him, should be so terribly punished. And nothing could be
   more proper and powerful, to wean their affections from the love of
   this world, and to make them willing to part with any thing in it, than
   to apprehend that there would shortly be an end of it, and then all the
   enjoyments of it would signify nothing. So that their ignorance in this
   matter was, by the providence of God, admirably fitted for the
   animating and encouraging of Christians to a great zeal and constancy
   in the profession of their faith, and in the propagating of it, as
   thinking they had but a little while to do this great work in.

   And it will be in all ages to the end of the world, a good argument to
   men to vigilance and constant preparation; because, if they be remiss
   and careless, the great Judge of the world may "come in a day that they
   think not of, and at an hour when they are not aware."--But to return
   to the particulars I propounded to speak to from the words.

   First, Here is a general caution, "Take ye heed;" look heed fully to
   it, that ye be not surprised and overtaken by that time: for, being
   uncertain when it will happen, ye are always in danger. But, because
   this general caution is only premised by our Saviour, to make way for
   the more particular directions, therefore I shall not insist upon this,
   but in the second place proceed to them. And they are these two, "Watch
   and pray."

   I. Vigilancy, which is a large duty, and comprehends under it the whole
   care of a Christian life; all that watchfulness and preparation which
   we ought to use, that we be not surprised by that terrible day; that we
   be not found in such a condition, as slothful and negligent servants
   use to be in, when their lord comes suddenly upon them, and finds all
   things in confusion and disorder. And to this our Saviour alludes
   several times in his exhortations to watchfulness: (Luke xii. 35, 36.)
   "Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning, and ye
   yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord. Blessed are those
   servants, whom the lord, when he comes, shall find watching." And,
   (ver. 40.) ".Be ye therefore ready also; for the Son of man cometh at
   an hour when ye think not." So that this watchfulness implies a
   continual care of our lives and actions, that we be always in such a
   posture as we would be willing the great Judge of the world should take
   us in; doing those things which we should not be ashamed to own, if he
   should come suddenly upon us, and summon us before his tribunal; and
   avoiding those things, which would be matter of shame and confusion to
   us at his appearance. (Luke xxi. 34-36.) Where our Saviour giveth this
   caution, he instanceth in some particular sins, which are more directly
   contrary to this vigilance: as, intemperance, and an inordinate love
   and care about earthly things: "Take heed to yourselves, lest your
   hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of
   this life, and so that day come upon you unawares: for as a snare shall
   it come on all that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye
   therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape
   all those things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son
   of man."

   It would be a large work to descend to all particulars, whereby we
   should express our care and vigilance. I shall mention but a few, but
   such as will comprehend most others under them.

   1. We should resolve, without delay, to put ourselves into that state
   and condition, in which we may not be afraid judgment should find us.
   It is to be feared, that a great part of mankind are in that loose and
   negligent posture, in the time of their health and prosperity, in
   which, if the great Judge of the world should surprise them, and bring
   them to a speedy trial, it would go ill with them; their lease would be
   sad and deplorable beyond all imagination, infinitely sadder than of a
   malefactor standing before an earthly judge, guilty of great and
   notorious crimes, and continually expecting the sentence of death to be
   passed upon him, Such is the condition of all impenitent sinners, who
   have lived careless and dissolute lives, without any serious
   consideration of their future state, or preparation for it; who have,
   in the general course of their lives, neglected God and religion, and a
   great many necessary and essential parts of their duty, and have
   indulged themselves, either in a continual course of impiety and
   wickedness, or of sensual pleasures and vanity. What shall become of
   those whom the Judge of the world shall find in this condition, either
   actually wicked, or wretchedly secure?

   Nay, those who do in some measure and degree mind religion, how few of
   them live under "the powers of the world to come," have "their loins
   girded about, and their lamps burning;" and are habitually so prepared,
   as if they were in a continual expectation of the coming of their Lord?
   So that, in the secure and negligent posture that most men live, even
   the better sort of men, if judgment should overtake them, how few could
   be saved? For this cause "God is long-suffering to men, because he is
   not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
   repentance." And if he should not by his merciful providence awaken
   many men to consideration and care of themselves, and, by some great
   affliction, or long sickness, put men upon serious thoughts, and give
   them the space and opportunity to recollect themselves, to make up
   their accounts, and so make their peace with God, and to put themselves
   into a better posture for another world, than they usually are in the
   time of their health and prosperity; it is very much to be feared, that
   the great est part of those who are tolerably good would be destroyed
   in their security.

   But this patience of God will not always last; but "the day of the Lord
   will come as a thief in the night," and will surprise the careless
   world all at once, and give them no time to trim up their lamps, and to
   get oil, if they be not provided already; but in an instant the door
   will be shut against them, and they shall never enter into the kingdom
   of God. This day hath not yet happened; but it will certainly come,
   and, as our Saviour says, "will come as a snare upon all them that
   dwell upon the face of the whole earth." And "blessed is that servant,
   whom his lord when he comes shall find ready."

   So that our first care must be, to get out of this dangerous state of
   sin and security, "to break off our sins by repentance," that we may be
   capable of the mercy of God, and at peace with him, before he comes to
   execute judgment upon the world; for, till this be done, we are every
   moment in danger; and if death or judgment should overtake us in this
   impenitent state, we are lost beyond recovery.

   2. After this great work of repentance is over, we should be very
   careful how we contract any new guilt, by returning to our former sins,
   or by the gross neglect of any part of our duty. A true and sincere
   repentance will put us into a safe condition; but then we must take
   heed, that we do not repent of our repentance, and bring ourselves into
   danger again, by starting aside from those good resolutions, which we
   had so solemnly taken up. For every deliberate and presumptuous sin
   that we are guilty of after our repentance, does endanger our state,
   and shake the foundations of our peace: but if we relapse into our
   former evil course, or after our repentance we allow ourselves in the
   habitual practice of any known sin, either our repentance was insincere
   before, or if it were true for the time, we are fallen from it, and all
   that we have done signifies nothing, and we have the whole work to
   begin again. And if the judgment of God should over take us, before we
   have renewed our repentance, and reformed our lives, we should be found
   in the number of the ungodly, "who cannot stand in judgment." So that,
   as it concerns us to make haste out of an impenitent state, so no less
   to order our conversation afterwards with great vigilancy and care:
   lest, by relapsing into our former sins, and being surprised in them by
   the judgment of God, we fall into condemnation.

   3. Let us neglect no opportunity of doing good, but always be employing
   ourselves, either in acts of religion and piety towards God, or of
   righteousness and charity towards men, or in such acts as are
   subordinate to religion; I mean the works of a lawful calling, in
   which, if we demean ourselves with diligence and good conscience, we
   may be said to serve God, and to live in his fear, because we are
   governed by the rules of religion, all the while we are about our
   worldly business, and providing for the necessities of this life in an
   honest and industrious way.

   More particularly we should strictly charge ourselves, according to our
   estate and opportunities, to be very much in the works of mercy and
   charity; remembering that our Saviour hath represented this as a
   special matter of inquiry at the judgment of the great day, how we have
   acquitted and discharged ourselves in duties of this kind, and that
   nothing does more immediately qualify us for the mercy of God, when we
   shall come to stand before his judgment-seat, than to have shewn mercy
   to our brethren; as, on the other hand, the Scripture hath terribly
   threatened, that "he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath
   shewed no mercy." By these, and all other acts of a good life, we shall
   be in a constant readiness and preparation for the coming of our Lord.
   And, oh! what a happiness and comfort will it be to us, to be found by
   him thus employed! "Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he
   cometh shall find so doing." I proceed:

   4. We should often review our lives, and call ourselves to a strict
   account of our actions, that, judging ourselves, we may not be judged
   and condemned by the Lord. This frequent examination of ourselves, will
   give us to understand our errors and miscarriages; which, if we
   seriously consider, must needs prompt us to repentance, and engage us
   in purposes and resolutions of amendment. And the practice of this is
   certainly the best way to keep our accounts clear, and to prevent that
   horrible confusion which we shall be in, if judgment should surprise us
   unawares, when we have the guilt of great and manifold sins unrepented
   of lying upon our consciences, like a heavy weight, ready to sink us
   into eternal perdition. Besides that, this strict and frequent
   examination of our actions, will be an excellent means to make us more
   careful for the future to avoid those faults and miscarriages which we
   have observed in ourselves before. We should be ashamed to fall into
   those errors again, for which we have so lately and severely censured
   and condemned ourselves.

   5. Another part of our preparation for the coming of our Lord, is, a
   humble trust and confidence in the virtue of his death and passion, as
   the only meritorious cause of the remission of our sins, and the reward
   of eternal life. Though we be regenerated and renewed by the Holy
   Ghost, and, by the assistance of God's grace, enabled to perform works
   of righteousness, and, as is said of Zachary and Elizabeth, "to live in
   all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless;" that is, in
   the general course of our lives, to yield a sincere obedience to the
   laws of God: yet, because in many things we offend, and our best
   righteousness is very imperfect, and falls extremely short of that
   exact and strict duty which the law of God requires; and if it were
   perfect, our obedience for the future could make no reparation to the
   justice of God for past sins and transgressions; therefore, we cannot
   hope for our own righteousness to be justified and accepted with God,
   and upon the merit of it to have our sins pardoned, much less to be
   rewarded with eternal life. God, indeed, of his infinite mercy is
   pleased, upon our repentance, to pardon our sins past, and upon our
   sincere obedience to give us eternal life; and without these
   qualifications we shall never be made partakers of these blessings;
   except we repent, our sins shall not be forgiven us, and "without
   holiness no man shall see the Lord." But then, it is not for the merit
   of our repentance and righteousness, that these blessings are conferred
   upon us, but for the meritorious obedience and sufferings of our
   blessed Saviour: that most acceptable sacrifice of himself, which he
   offered to God in our stead, and in our behalf, hath purchased and
   procured these benefits for us; and "we are accepted in his beloved
   Son," and "justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is
   in Jesus Christ;" and therefore, "not for any works of righteousness
   which we have done, but of his mercy he saves us." And here we are to
   fix our hopes of justification and salvation, viz. upon that perfect
   propitiation and satisfaction, which Christ, by the sacrifice of
   himself once offered, hath made for the sins of the whole world. For
   the alone merit of this sacrifice, God is graciously pleased to forgive
   us all our sins, upon our true repentance, and to reward our sincere,
   though very imperfect, obedience, with eternal life. So that through
   faith in the blood of Christ, not by confidence in ourselves and our
   own righteousness, we obtain remission of sins, and eternal life. And
   it is not only in itself great arrogance, but great ingratitude to our
   blessed Redeemer, "who gave himself for us," to ascribe that to the
   merit of our own righteousness, or the merits of the saints, which
   nothing in heaven or earth, but the precious blood of Christ, who was
   "a lamb without spot or blemish," could have purchased for us. And it
   is argument and encouragement enough to holiness and obedience of life,
   that without it we cannot see God; and by it we are qualified for that
   happiness which Christ hath purchased for us, and, as the apostle
   expresseth it, are "made meet to be made partakers of the inheritance
   of the saints in light."

   6. And lastly, To awaken and maintain this vigilancy and care, we
   should often represent to our minds the judgment of the great day,
   which will certainly come, though we know not the time of it. And if
   any consideration in the world will make men watchful and diligent,
   certainly this will, that the judgment of God continually hangs over
   them, and may seize upon them at any time; nay, for aught we know, the
   judgment of God may now be standing at the door, and be ready to rush
   in upon us, whilst we are so negligent and secure. For this day,
   whenever it shall be, will come suddenly, and surprise the careless
   world, when they least think of it, and look for it. So our Lord
   himself hath foretold, that "as a snare it shall come upon all them
   that dwell on the face of the whole earth:" that is, the greatest part
   of mankind shall be taken unprepared, when they are unprovided for it;
   nay, when they are generally lulled asleep in a stupid security and
   infidelity; when the world is grown atheistical, and do hardly believe
   any such thing as a future judgment. So our Saviour seems to intimate:
   (Luke xviii. 8.) "When the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith upon
   the earth?" And if this be a mark and token of the general judgment, we
   have too much cause to apprehend that it is drawing on apace: for never
   was there any age since the general flood, that we know of, when
   iniquity did so abound, and the infidelity of mankind was so full, so
   great, and so general; when profaneness and atheism, the open contempt
   of God and religion, was so raging and violent; and when, as our Lord
   says, there was so little faith to be found on the earth; whether by
   faith we understand the belief of the principles of religion, or the
   fidelity of men one towards another. For was there ever any age,
   wherein false accusation, perjury, and subornation were more rife and
   impudent? wherein the reverence of an oath was so lost, and the sacred
   obligation of it in so little regard among men? So that, if the great
   Judge of the world should delay his coming, human society seems ready
   to disband and dissolve of itself, for want of mutual trust and
   confidence among men to hold it together.

   And this want of faith, in both senses, we owe in a great measure to
   popery; which, by its artificial ways of falsehood and perjury (which,
   when they have to deal with heretics, they have upon solemn occasions
   declared lawful), hath not only weakened, but even destroyed the credit
   of mankind with one another, as we find of late by sad experience. And
   as for infidelity in religion, they have not only given great occasion
   to it, by the monstrous absurdities they have brought into religion;
   and, by overstraining the faith of men in some parts of it, have
   brought them to a disbelief of the whole; as is at this day too visible
   in many of the most knowing persons of their communion, both in France
   and Italy: but besides this, they have, in their writings, to gain men
   to a dependance upon, and submission to, the infallibility of their
   church, undermined the foundations of religion, and industriously
   endeavoured to bring men to scepticism and infidelity; hoping that,
   when they have made men of no religion, they will be fit for theirs,
   which in too many respects is next to none; and in some, worse.

   But whether the judgment of the great clay be near at hand, or farther
   off, God alone knows; this is certain, that God hath in great mercy
   delayed it for a long time, because "he is not willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to repentance." And it is no less
   certain, that it may come at any time, and will come when men least
   expect it; when the world is in great security, and very little
   apprehensive of the nearness and danger of it; which is reason and
   argument enough to continual care and vigilancy: for it may come the
   next hour, the next moment, for any thing we know to the contrary: and
   whenever it comes, if we be not prepared, it will be too late to begin
   that work; if our lamps be gone out, and we want oil, we cannot provide
   ourselves in such a hurry; we shall be full of fear and amazement, but
   we shall "find no place for repentance," and a deliberate preparation
   for our great trial. As the great Judge of the world then finds us, so
   will he deal with us; such as our state and condition then is, such
   will be our sentence and doom to all eternity. And is not this argument
   enough to us to be always upon our guard, always watchful, and always
   ready--because the Son of man may "come at an hour when we think not?"
   and if we be not then prepared, it will be too late to set about it:
   the opportunity of doing it, and wo ourselves, are lost for ever.

   This is the first direction our Saviour gives us; continual vigilancy
   and watchfulness over ourselves in general.

   The second direction is more particular, and that is, prayer; "Take ye
   heed, watch and pray." And the practice of this duty of prayer will be
   of great advantage to us upon these two accounts:

   1. As it tends to awaken and excite our care and diligence in the
   business of religion.

   2. As it is, if sincerely performed, effectual to engage the Divine
   blessing and assistance to second our care and endeavours, and to
   secure them from miscarriage.

   1. It is very apt to awaken and excite our care and diligence in the
   business of religion. For whenever we heartily beg of God to assist us
   by his grace to any thing that is good, we mind ourselves of our own
   duty; and both reason and Scripture will tell us, that we pray to God
   in vain for his help, if we will do nothing ourselves; that it is gross
   hypocrisy, and an impudent mocking of God, to implore his grace and
   assistance, if we be not resolved to put forth our own endeavours.
   Prayer, indeed, supposeth I hat we stand in need of the Divine help;
   but it implies, likewise, a resolution on our part to do what we can
   for ourselves; otherwise we ask in vain, and have no reason to hope
   that God will hear our prayers, and grant our requests, though never so
   earnestly and importunately put up to him.

   2. If we use our sincere endeavours for the effecting of what we pray
   for, prayer is the most effectual means to engage the Divine blessing
   and assistance to second our endeavours, and to secure them from
   miscarriage. And, without the aid of God's grace, and his blessing upon
   our endeavours, they will all be ineffectual, and signify nothing; we
   shall not be able so much as to "watch one hour." If God be not with
   us, "the watchman waketh but in vain:" for "the way of man is not in
   himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps." It is
   necessary, therefore, that we continually implore the Divine grace, and
   that we do not rely upon our own, strength, and the fickleness and
   uncertainty of our own resolutions, according to the wise advice of
   Solomon; (Prov. iii. 5, 6.) "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart,
   and lean not to thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge
   him, and he shall direct thy paths." Therefore, as ever we hope to
   persevere and continue in a good course, and to order our lives so, as
   to be in preparation for judgment, let us every day, by continual and
   fervent prayer, apply ourselves to the Fountain of grace and mercy, for
   his aid and help, to make us vigilant over ourselves, and all the
   actions of our lives; to enable us to a "patient continuance in
   well-doing, to keep us from every evil work, and to preserve us to his
   heavenly kingdom."

   And, to this purpose, we have all the encouragement which the assurance
   of the Divine goodness, and the security of his never-failing promise
   can give us. It is but asking and receiving. So St. James tells us,
   speaking of this heavenly wisdom to direct us in our Christian course,
   so as we may be "perfect and entire, wanting nothing." (Jam. i. 5.) "If
   any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men
   liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him." I proceed to
   the

   Third and last part of the text, which is the reason which our Saviour
   here adds to enforce our care and diligence in a matter of so great
   concernment, viz. the uncertainty, as to us, of the particular time
   when this day of judgment will be: "ye know not when the time is."
   Therefore we should always be in expectation of it, always in a
   readiness and preparation for it. The certainty of the thing, and that
   God hath appointed and deter mined "a time, in which he will judge the
   world in righteousness," though we were sure this day were far off,
   ought, in all reason, to make us very watchful over ourselves, and very
   careful of all our actions, very strict and conscientious in the
   discharge and performance of every part of our duty. If there were no
   more but this, that we must one day be called to a strict account for
   all the actions of our lives, and receive the just recompence of them,
   and according to the nature and quality of them be sentenced to eternal
   happiness, or ever lasting misery; this alone were a mighty argument.
   So St. Peter reasons: (2 Pet. iii. 10-12.) "But the day of the Lord
   will come, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
   and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the
   works that are therein, shall be burnt up. Seeing then all these things
   shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy
   conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of
   the day of God?" that is, making speedy preparation for it. The very
   expectation of this "terrible day of the Lord," at how great a distance
   soever, should make us diligent, that when ever it shall be, "we may be
   found of him in peace, without spot and blameless."

   But it adds a great deal of awe and force to this argument, to
   consider, that, for aught we know to the contrary, this judgment may
   surprise us at any time; that this very night we may be awakened by the
   sound of that mighty trumpet, which shall pierce the ears of all the
   world, and summon the living and the dead to judgment. And God, who is
   the lover of souls, and desirous to save us any ways, by hope and by
   fear, by his mercies and by his corrections, by our knowledge and by
   our ignorance, hath purposely concealed from us the time of his coining
   to judgment, to the end we may always be prepared, and that we might
   continually stand in awe of it; and for fear our Lord should come upon
   us unawares, might always be in a posture to receive him.

   And whatever the secure part of mankind may think, who "put far from
   them the evil day," how careless and confident soever they may be, it
   would for all that be a terrible thing to them, all on the sudden, to
   "see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with his mighty
   angels;" to hear the great trumpet sound, summoning the dead to arise
   and come to judgment; to see the whole world in a combustion, and the
   whole frame of nature ready to dissolve and. fall in pieces; "the sun
   darkened, and the moon turned into blood, and all the powers of heaven
   shaken, the earth and all the works that are therein, flaming about
   us;" to see the dead starting out of their graves, some with great joy,
   others in a mighty amazement and fright, according to their several
   expectations of a happy or fearful doom. What a surprise would it be to
   drowsy and careless sinners, to be thus suddenly and unexpectedly
   overtaken? How will the profane infidel like to find himself so
   terribly confuted by his own eyes, and forced to believe that which
   will make him tremble? It will then be too late for men to think to
   make their peace with God, and to prepare for judgment. And if there
   were any time for it, the horror and amazement that sinners will then
   be in, will hinder them from doing any thing. Thus the Scripture
   represents the fearful case of impenitent sinners, who are thus
   surprised, as not knowing what to do with themselves, nor whither to
   fly for safety, as ready to betake themselves any whither for shelter
   and refuge, as "calling upon the mountains and rocks to fall upon them,
   and hide them from the face of Him that sits upon the throne, and from
   the wrath of the Lamb;" here by signifying to us, that sinners shall be
   in such a consternation, and so deep a despair of the mercy of God
   towards them, that instead of addressing themselves to him, they shall
   turn their supplications to the mountains and rocks, as being more
   exorable than he.

   But this possibly may not be our case; this dreadful day may not come
   in our days; and yet it is madness to run a venture in a matter of such
   moment: but if it should not, I must tell you, that the case of a dying
   sinner is not much different, who hath neglected God and religion in
   his life-time, and would never think of betaking himself to him, or
   making any submission, till his justice be ready to cut him off. And
   how secure and careless soever sinners may be now, no man knows how
   soon he may be reduced to the very last opportunity of making his peace
   with God, and may be brought into those sad and miserable straits, that
   no man that is in his wits would be in for all the world: that he may
   have nothing left that can give him the least hope of being saved from
   eternal perdition, but a sudden and confused, and, in all probability,
   an ineffectual repentance; nothing but this one plank to trust to,
   which it is ten thousand to one whether it ever bring him to shore.

   Therefore be wise, sinner, in time, and seize upon the present
   opportunities of life, and improve them with all thy might, with all
   possible care and diligence, lest judgment find thee unprepared; or in
   case God, in mercy to the world, should delay it yet longer, lest death
   seize upon thee careless and unprovided. And when that is once in view,
   it is but very little that can be done by way of preparation: for as
   "there is no counsel, nor wisdom, no work nor device in the grave,"
   whither we must go; so there is very little when we are come near to
   it; and therefore, "blessed is that servant, whom his Lord, when he
   cometh, shall find watching,"

SERMON CLXXXIII.

  THE CERTAINTY AND THE BLESSEDNESS OF THE RESURRECTION OF TRUE CHRISTIANS.

   For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again, even so them also
   which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.--1 Thess. iv. 14.

   THE words which I have read are an argument of the blessed resurrection
   of good men to eternal life, grounded upon the resurrection of Christ.
   In the verse before the apostle comforts Christians, concerning their
   brethren that were already departed in the faith of Christ, that there
   was no reason why they should so immoderately grieve for them. "But I
   would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
   asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others that have no hope;" that is,
   as the heathens do, who mourn for their dead friends in so grievous a
   manner, as if they were utterly extinguished by death, and they had no
   imagination of any life beyond this. And thus we find the apostle
   elsewhere describing the state of the heathen world: (Eph. ii. 12.)
   that "they were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers from
   the covenant of promise, having no hope."

   But Christians should not mourn for their deceased friends as the
   heathen were wont to do, who had no hope of a better life; because
   Christians profess to believe that Christ is risen from the dead, and
   ascended into heaven: "for if we believe that Jesus died, and rose
   again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him."

   There are two things to be explained in the words before we come to
   consider the matter of them:

   First, What is meant by those that sleep in Jesus.

   Secondly, What by God's bringing them with him.

   First, What is meant by those that sleep in Jesus. Sleep is a metaphor
   used for death by all sorts of writers, profane and sacred; and by the
   ancient Christians, the place of burial was called koimete'rion, that
   is, "a sleeping-place." This metaphor is sometimes applied to the death
   of the wicked, but most frequently used of the death of the righteous,
   because to them it is truly a rest. And so the prophet, speaking of the
   death of the righteous, calls it: (Isa. lvii. 2.) "They shall enter
   into peace, they shall rest in their beds."

   And the death of the righteous is very fitly called a sleep, both as it
   is a rest from labour and pain: "Blessed are the dead which die in the
   Lord, for they rest from their labour;" (Rev. xiv. 13.) and, likewise,
   because sleep is not final, but in order to waking again. The death of
   the righteous is not an eternal sleep of the body, but that shall be
   awakened in the morning of the resurrection.

   But why is the death of good men called a sleeping in Jesus? dia`
   Iesou, "for Jesus sake;" which may seem to have some particular
   relation to those who died martyrs for Christ; as some likewise
   understand that text, (Rev. xiv. 13.) "Blessed are the dead which die
   in the Lord," that is, that suffer for his cause; "for they rest from
   their labours," that is, their sufferings are then at an end. But we
   shall best understand the meaning of this phrase by comparing it with
   those others which seem to be equivalent to it, as (1 Cor. xv. 18.)
   They also that are fallen asleep in Christ; (ver. 23.) "They that are
   Christ's at his corning;" that is, they that belong to him, that died
   in the faith of Christ. So likewise is this, (1 Thess. iv. 10.) "The
   dead in Christ shall rise first;" that is, the Christians that are dead
   before the coining of Christ, shall first be raised, be fore those that
   are alive shall be changed. (Heb. xi. 13.) "All these died in faith;"
   that is, in firm belief of God's promise of a better life. So that to
   sleep in Christ, to be Christ's, to die in Christ, to die in the faith,
   do all seem to signify the same thing; viz. to die in the state of true
   Christians. For so we understand the like expressions of being in
   Christ: (Rom. viii. 1.) "He that is in Christ," that is, every sincere
   Christian; and of abiding in Christ: (John xv. 4.) "He that abideth in
   me." So to die in Christ, is to die a true Christian, in the faith and
   obedience of the gospel.

   And it is observable, that, in the phrase and style of the New
   Testament, we are said to die all in and with Christ; to be in him, and
   to live in him, and to walk in him, by our sanctification and
   obedience; to die with him, by the mortification of our lusts; to rise
   with him, by our renovation to a new life; to ascend with him into
   heaven, and to have our life hid with Christ in God, by our heavenly
   affections and hopes; and, by death, to sleep in him.

   But before I pass over this phrase of sleeping in Jesus, there is one
   difficulty more about the sleep of the soul, which seems to be
   countenanced from this text: "Those that sleep in Jesus, shall God with
   him; as if the apostle spake here of the souls of good men which had
   been asleep, and Christ should bring with him to be united to their
   bodies, which should be raised; as, likewise, from the whole tenor of
   the apostle's discourse about the resurrection, (1 Cor. xv.) where the
   apostle says nothing of the living of the soul before the body be
   raised; as if the soul separated from the body were in a state of
   insensibility till the resurrection. But the true answer to this is,
   that neither our Saviour, in his discourse of the resurrection, nor St.
   Paul, in the 15th chapter to the Corinthians, nor here, in this text,
   do keep closely to the proving of the resurrection of the body; but of
   a blessed immortality after this life, against the Sadducees, who said,
   "there was no resurrection," neither angel nor spirit. But sometimes
   they prove that there is a life after death, and sometimes that, at the
   resurrection, the soul shall be joined to a spiritual and heavenly
   body, and that the whole man shall enjoy perfect bliss and happiness.

   But this opinion, or rather dream, concerning the sleep of the soul
   from the time of death, that is, from the time of the separation of the
   soul from the body till the general resurrection, may be effectually
   confuted these two ways:

   1. By taking away the ground of it: and,

   2. By producing several texts of Scripture, which are utterly
   inconsistent with it. And this I shall the rather do, because some men
   have taken a great deal of pains to establish and prove this opinion;
   though I confess I do not well understand to what end, because there is
   as little comfort as truth in it.

   1. By taking away the only ground that I know of, of this opinion; and
   that is, from the frequent metaphor and resemblance in Scripture of
   death to sleep. And, indeed, those which are dead are frequently in
   Scripture said to sleep, or to be fallen asleep: but then (which falls
   out very cross to this opinion) this metaphor of sleep is no where in
   Scripture applied to the soul, but to the body resting in the grave, in
   order to its being awakened and raised out of this sleep at the
   resurrection. And thus it is frequently used, with express reference to
   the body; (Dan xii. 2.) "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the
   earth shall awake;" and surely sleeping in the dust of the earth can
   only be applied to the body. And more expressly yet: (Matt. xxvii. 52.)
   "And the graves were opened, and many bodies of saints, which slept,
   arose." (Acts xiii. 36.) "David, after he had served his own generation
   by the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw
   corruption: but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption." Now that
   of David which fell asleep, and was buried with his fathers, and saw
   corruption, was certainly his body: and that of our Saviour which was
   raised again, and saw no corruption, was likewise his body, according
   to that prediction concerning him: "Thou wilt not leave my soul in
   hell," in Hades, by which is plainly meant the state and place of souls
   separated from the body; a nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption;"
   that is, the body of our blessed Lord to rot in the grave. (1 Cor. xv.
   20.) "But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
   first-fruits of them that slept;" that is, the resurrection of his body
   out of the grave, is an earnest and assurance that our bodies also
   shall be raised. And, (ver. 51.) "We shall not all sleep, but we shall
   all be changed;" where the apostle undoubtedly speaks both of the death
   and change of these corruptible bodies. And so, likewise, the text is
   to be understood of the resurrection of the bodies of the saints, which
   shall be raised up by the sound of the great trumpet, and reunited to
   their souls, that they may in person accompany Christ at his coming. So
   that it is the body, which is every where said in Scripture to sleep,
   and not the soul; and, if so, then the only foundation of this opinion
   is taken away.

   2. I shall shew, that this opinion of the sleep of the soul is utterly
   inconsistent with several passages of Scripture, which plainly suppose
   the contrary; as (Luke xvi. 22, 23.) where, in the parable of the rich
   man and Lazarus, the different states of good and bad men, immediately
   after their departure out of this life, are described; but they are so
   described, that it is evident that the souls of neither of them are
   asleep. It is said of Lazarus, that "he was carried by the angels into
   Abraham's bosom," and that there he was comforted; and of the rich man,
   that he was in hell, and there tormented in flames. This was not like
   to be a state of sleep and insensibility, and the rich man cries out of
   his torment; and that we may be sure he was awake, he is said to "lift
   up his eyes." And there is all the reason that can be to conclude, that
   Lazarus was every whit as sensible of the comfort and happiness that he
   was in, as the rich man was of his torment. Luke xxiii. 43. where our
   Saviour says to the penitent thief, "This day shalt thou be with me in
   paradise:" but not surely to sleep there till the resurrection. "Though
   some have endeavoured to avoid the force of this text, by referring
   this day to what goes before, and not to what follows after; as if our
   Saviour had said, I say unto thee this day; and not, "this day thou
   shalt be with me in paradise:" which is a foolish evasion, because, I
   say unto thee necessarily implies the present time, and there is no
   need to add, "this day;" besides, that there is no such phrase any
   where used, as, I say unto thee this day. (Phil. i. 23.) "I am in a
   strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ,
   which is far better." But if to be with Christ, be to be in a state of
   sleep and insensibility, how is that so much better than to be in the
   body, serving God and his church? (2 Cor. v. 6.) "Therefore we are
   always confident, knowing that while we sojourn in the body we are
   absent from the Lord; we are confident, I say, and willing rather to be
   absent from the body, and present with the Lord." But certainly, to be
   "present with the Lord," which the apostle here affirms that good men
   are, so soon as they depart out of the body, must needs signify a state
   of happiness; which sleep is not, but only of insensibility. Besides
   that, the apostle's argument would be very flat, and but a cold
   encouragement to Christians against the fears of death, that as soon as
   we are dead, we shall fall asleep and become insensible. But the
   apostle useth it as an argument, why we should be willing to die as
   soon as God pleaseth, and the sooner the better; because so soon as
   ever we quit these bodies, we shall be "present with the Lord," that
   is, shall be admitted to the blissful sight and enjoyment of him; and
   that, whilst we abide "in the body," we are detained from our
   happiness. But if our souls sleep as well as our bodies till the
   general resurrection, it is all one whether we continue in the body or
   not, as to any happiness we shall enjoy in the meantime; which is
   directly contrary to the main, scope of the apostle's argument.

   Secondly, What is here meant by God's bringing with him those "that
   sleep in Jesus?" In general these words signify a blessed resurrection,
   as may be seen by the opposition: "If we believe that Jesus died, and
   rose again; even so them also that sleep in Jesus shall God bring with
   him." Whereto Christ's death is opposed our sleeping in Jesus; and, to
   his resurrection, God's bringing us with him; that is, his raising us
   out of the grave to accompany him at his coming. But the meaning of
   this expression will best appear, by considering what follows after the
   text: "for this we say by the word of the Lord," that is, by special
   revelation, "that we that are alive, and remain, at the coming of the
   Lord, shall not prevent them that are asleep;" that is, we shall not be
   taken up into heaven, before the saints who are already dead shall be
   raised; but thus it shall be: "The Lord himself shall descend from
   heaven with a shout, and the voice of an archangel, and with the trump
   of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we, which are
   alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,
   to meet the Lord in the air." The plain meaning of all which is, that
   first the dead in Christ shall be raised and taken up to him in the
   air, to accompany him at his corning, and thus he shall bring them with
   him; and then those, which are alive at his coming, shall be changed
   and taken up likewise, "to meet the Lord in the air." And the same
   account the same apostle gives us: (1 Cor. xv. 51, 52.) "Behold, (says
   he) I shew you a mystery," (which is the same he had said before in the
   former text, this we say unto you by the word of the Lord)--"I shew you
   a mystery," (so he calls that which was not revealed to all by our
   Saviour, but to himself particularly) "we shall not all sleep, but we
   shall be changed;" that is, all shall not die, but at the coining of
   Christ many shall be found alive and changed; but these shall have no
   advantage of those who were dead in Christ before: for "in a moment, in
   the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, the dead shall be raised
   incorruptible;" that is, with spiritual bodies, which will be no more
   liable to corruption; "and we," that is, those that remain then alive,
   "shall also be changed." From all which it appears, that the meaning of
   this expression, "those that sleep in Jesus shall God bring with him,"
   is this: that the Lord Jesus shall come "in the clouds of heaven, in
   the glory of his Father," and by the sound of the trump of God shall
   raise the dead in Christ. And our Saviour tells us more particularly,
   that this shall be done by the ministry of angels. (Matt. xxiv. 30,
   31.) When the Son of man comes "with power and great glory," that the
   angels shall with the great sound of the trumpet gather the "elect from
   the four winds;" and, when they are thus gathered, God shall bring them
   with him.

   And here I cannot but observe, that the title of God is given to our
   Saviour, who is to be judge of the world. "Them that sleep in Jesus,
   shall God bring with him." And elsewhere our apostle, speaking of this
   glorious appearance and corning of Christ to judgment, calls him the
   great God: (Tit. ii. 13.) "Looking for the blessed hope, and glorious
   appearance, of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ." Which
   cannot be understood of the appearance of two persons, viz. God the
   Father, and his son Jesus Christ our Saviour; for then the article
   would have been added to distinguish them, and it would not have been
   kai` soteros emon, but kai` tou soteros emon; as if he had said, "the
   appearance of the great God and of Jesus Christ our Saviour;" when as,
   according to the propriety of the Greek, the article being wanting, it
   ought to be rendered thus: "looking for the appearing of Jesus Christ
   the great God and our Saviour." This is very much confirmed, in that
   the same apostle here in the text, speaking of Christ's coming to
   judgment, calls him God, them "shall God bring with him."

   The words, thus explained, give us this observation; that it is a firm
   principle of the Christian religion, that those, who die in the faith
   of Christ, that is, in the state of true Christianity, shall have a
   blessed resurrection. "If we believe, (saith the apostle) that Jesus
   died, and rose again; even so them also, that sleep in him, shall God
   bring with him." The apostle to the Hebrews reckons the "resurrection
   of the dead, "among the principles of the doctrine of Christ. (Heb. vi.
   2.)

   In speaking to this observation, I shall do these three things:

   First, I shall shew what it is to die in the faith of Christ, or in the
   state of a true Christian, which is here called sleeping in Jesus.

   Secondly, I shall shew how the death and resurrection of Christ are an
   argument and proof of our resurrection from the dead. And,

   Thirdly, Wherein the blessedness of the resurrection of the just doth
   consist.

   First, What it is to die in the faith of Christ, or in the state of a
   true Christian, which is here called sleeping in Jesus. And this
   imports one of these two things; either,

   1. That we die in such a belief of the doctrine of Christ, as hath been
   accompanied with a holy obedience of life, to the commands and precepts
   of the gospel; that our profession of the Christian religion hath
   evidenced itself in the virtues of a good life, in the constant course
   and tenor of a holy and unblameable conversation. This assurance the
   Christian religion gives us, that if we have our fruit unto holiness,
   our end shall be everlasting life.

   Or else, 2. That we exercise such a sincere and unfeigned repentance
   before death for the errors and miscarriages of our lives, as produceth
   a firm purpose and resolution of amending our lives, if God should be
   pleased to prolong and continue them. For only such a belief and
   profession of the Christian religion, as produceth one of these
   effects, doth put us into a state of grace, and give us hope of a
   blessed resurrection to eternal life.

   The first of these effects is much to be preferred, viz. the general
   course and tenor of a holy life; the latter being infinitely more
   hazardous, by reason of the deceitfulness of our hearts, and the
   infinite uncertainty of a death-bed repentance.

   Secondly, I shall shew how the death and resurrection of Christ are an
   argument and proof of our resurrection from the dead. "If we believe,"
   &c.

   I shall shew, by and by, how the resurrection of Christ is an argument
   and proof of our resurrection. But why is his death here mentioned, as
   part of the argument? "If we believe that Christ died." The reason is
   obvious; because the truth of the miracle of his resurrection depends
   upon the reality of his death; for if Christ was not really dead, then
   he could not rise from the dead, and the pretence of his resurrection
   was a delusion and imposture: but if he was really dead, and rose again
   from the dead, then have we a firm ground for the belief of a future
   resurrection. Now this Christians do believe, that Christ was really
   dead, and rose again from the dead, and that upon very good grounds. We
   need not doubt but that the malice of the Jews took care 1o kill him;
   and the story makes it evident, because blood and water came out of his
   side, which is a certain proof that his heart was pierced; and it could
   not be a deliquium, or a fainting fit, because, after his blood was
   exhausted, he could not naturally return to life again. But we need not
   contend much about this, since the heathens who are unconcerned confess
   this. Tacitus, in the 15th book of his Annals, tells us, that "Jesus
   was put to death by crucifixion under Pontius Pilate." And Josephus,
   who was a Jew both by his birth and religion, and lived presently after
   our Saviour's time, in the 18th book of his Jewish Antiquities, tells
   us, that "Christ was crucified, and that he appeared to his followers
   the third day, risen from the dead."

   Now this cannot, in reason, be said to be done only in appearance, and
   to be a mere illusion of men's senses, as some ancient heretics
   pretended; because that which may be an evasion in any case, is to be
   admitted in none. For what greater evidence is possible of any one's
   rising from the dead, than the circumstances of our Saviour's
   resurrection? That there was a great earthquake, and that the stone was
   rolled away from the grave, and the grave-clothes found there, and his
   body gone; and that after this he appeared and conversed so often with
   so many, to whom he was well known when alive, and entertained long
   discourses with them, and did eat and drink with them, and permit them
   to handle his body, and to put their fingers into the wound of his
   side; and all this exactly agreeing with his own prediction. So that,
   if we believe the providence of God, we cannot think it to be so little
   vigilant, as that men, after their utmost care, must necessarily be
   deluded in a matter of so great consequence.

   Now I shall shew, that the death and resurrection of Christ is a very
   good argument of our resurrection. (1 Cor. xv. 20.) Christ is said to
   be "risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that
   slept." Not that he was the first that was raised from the dead; for
   Elijah and Elisha raised some, and so did our Saviour himself in his
   life-time: but the apostle here alludes to the "first-fruits" among the
   Jews, which were a pledge and an earnest of a future harvest. In like
   manner, the resurrection of Christ is called the "first-fruits of them
   that slept," because it is an earnest of that general harvest, which
   should be at the end of the world, when "the angels, the reapers, shall
   come to gather the elect from the four winds." But the resurrection of
   others before Christ was no earnest of this, because they "were raised/
   but Christ is said to "rise from the dead by his own power." And in
   this sense he is truly said by St John (Rev. i. 5.) to be "the
   first-begot ten from the dead." And this secures our resurrection to
   eternal life; because he who hath promised to raise us up, did "raise
   himself from the dead."

   And that Christ intended to lay great stress upon this argument,
   appears in that he foretold it so often, as the great sign that he
   would give to the Jews to convince their infidelity. (John ii. 18, 19.)
   "The Jews said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us; Jesus
   answered, Destroy this temple, and I will raise it up in three days; v
   speaking of the temple of his body. And] (Matt. xii. 39, 40.) he tells
   the Jews, that he would give them "no other sign but the sign of the
   prophet Jonah," that "as he was three days and three nights in the
   whale's belly, so should the Son of man be three days in the bowels of
   the earth."

   Now the resurrection of Christ from the dead, and, which was consequent
   upon it, his ascension into heaven, does first give us satisfaction in
   general of another life after this, and an immortality after death; and
   then of his power to raise us from the dead, because "he raised
   himself;" as the apostle argues: (Rom. viii. 11.) "If the Spirit of him
   that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in yon, he that raised up
   Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his
   Spirit which dwelleth in you." And then, lastly, it secures us of his
   truth and fidelity, that he will perform what he hath promised us. He
   could not have promised any thing more improbable than this, that he
   himself would rise again the third day; and therefore, since he kept
   his word in this, there is no reason to distrust him in any thing else
   that he hath promised. By his own resurrection from the dead, he
   wrought such a miracle, as is the most proper to confirm us in the
   belief of our resurrection to eternal life: (Rev. i. 18.) "I am he that
   liveth, and was dead; and be hold I am alive for evermore, Amen, Amen."
   What is that? we have it explained, (Rev. iii. 14.) where he says of
   himself, "I am the Amen, the faithful and true witness." This very
   thing, that Christ was dead, and lives again, makes him the "Amen, the
   true and faithful witness." I proceed to the

   Third and last thing, viz. Wherein the blessedness of the resurrection
   of the just shall consist; namely, in these two things:

   I. In the mighty change which shall be made in these vile and mortal
   bodies of ours, and the glorious qualities they shall then be invested
   withal. And,

   II. In the consequent happiness of the whole man, of the soul and body
   united and purified.

   I. In the mighty change which shall be made in these vile and mortal
   bodies of ours, and the glorious qualities which they shall then be
   invested withal. But wherein this glory shall consist, because it is
   matter of pure revelation, we must wholly rely upon Scripture for the
   particular account and explication of it. And there are three texts of
   Scripture, wherein this glorious change, which shall be made in our
   bodies at the resurrection, is more particularly mentioned and
   described. The

   First is, (Luke xx. 35, 36.) "But they, who shall be counted worthy to
   obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry,
   nor are given in marriage." This our Saviour speaks, because that,
   which occasioned this discourse concerning the resurrection, was a
   question moved by the Sadducees concerning a woman that had seven
   husbands in her life-time; upon which they captiously asked our
   Saviour, Whose wife of the seven this woman should be at the
   resurrection? To which our Saviour answers, by taking away the
   foundation of it, telling them, that in the other world "they neither
   marry, nor are given in marriage." And the reason of this is very
   obvious; because the reason why men marry now is, because they are
   mortal, and therefore to preserve and propagate the kind, which would
   otherwise fail, marriage was instituted: but in the other world this
   reason will cease; because then men shall be immortal and die no more.
   And, therefore, our Saviour, after he had said, that "at the
   resurrection of the dead, men neither marry, nor are given in
   marriage," he immediately adds, as the reason of it, "neither can they
   die any more, for they are equal unto the angels, that is, they shall
   be like them in the immortal duration of their beings; "and are the
   children of God, being the children of the resurrection." Good men are
   now "the children of God," because they resemble him in the holy
   disposition of their minds: but then they shall be like him in the
   participation of his happiness, so far as finite and created beings are
   capable; the whole man, the body as well as the soul, shall be
   partakers of immortality. And this is a glorious change for a frail and
   mortal body, liable to pains, and diseases, and death, to become
   immortal, and freed from all those troublesome accidents to which they
   are now liable. The

   Second text to this purpose is, (Phil. iii. 20.) "But our conversation
   is in heaven," says St. Paul, speaking of true and sincere Christians;
   "but our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the
   Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it
   may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working
   of that mighty power, whereby he is able even to subdue all things to
   himself." And this is a great change indeed, whether we consider what
   our bodies now are, vile and corruptible; or the pattern according to
   which they shall be changed: "they shall be fashioned like to the
   glorious body of our blessed Saviour;" that wherein he now sits in the
   highest heavens, at the right hand of the throne of God. And what glory
   can we desire beyond that, with which God thought fit to reward his own
   Son, after all his obedience and sufferings? And this will be the more
   credible, if we consider the relation which the Scripture so often
   mentions between Christ and all true Christians. He is the head, and
   they are the members; now there must be a conformity between these. A
   glorious head and vile members would make a monstrous and irregular
   body; nay, the head could not be glorious, if the members were not so
   too. Or, lastly, if we consider the mighty power which will be put
   forth for the effecting this change. The omnipotency of the Son of God
   will exert itself in this work. So the apostle here tells us, that "the
   Lord Jesus Christ will change our vile body, according to the working
   of that mighty power, whereby he is able even to subdue all things to
   himself." Omnipotency will display its whole force in bringing about
   this change. And what cannot that Almighty power do, which is able to
   conquer and subdue all things?

   The third text, and that wherein this change is most fully and
   particularly described, is, (1 Cor. xv. 35.) "But some will say, How
   are the dead raised? And with what bodies do they come!" This was the
   common objection which the infidels made against this article of the
   resurrection: either men shall rise with the same bodies which they had
   in this life; or they shall not. If with the same bodies which they had
   in this life, to what purpose will that be? Since in the other world
   men shall not eat, or drink, or propagate their kind, and consequently
   have no use of such a body as ours now is: but if it be not the same
   body, how then are men's bodies raised? To this question, the apostle
   gives a clear answer; that the bodies of men which shall be raised,
   shall in some respects be the same, and in other respects not the same;
   the matter and substance of the body may still be the same, and yet may
   under go a mighty change, be fashioned after another manner, and be
   endowed with quite other qualities than it had before. And this he
   illustrates by two instances.

   1. By the difference between the com which is sown, and that which
   grows up. And,

   2. By the difference of several sorts of bodies, which are all made of
   the same kind of matter.

   1. From the difference between the corn which is sown, and that which
   is grown up: (ver. 36-38.) "Thou fool, that which thou so west is not
   quickened except it die;" that is, unless it be first buried in the
   earth, and rot, and be corrupted there; "and that which thou sowest,
   thou sowest not that body which shall be, but bare grain, as of wheat,
   or some other kind." "But bare grain;" that is, a naked grain, without
   either stalk, or blade, or ear: "but God giveth it a body as it hath
   pleased him;" that is, the Author of nature makes it spring up in a
   blade, which grows up into a stalk, which bears an ear which contains
   many grains of corn; "and to every seed his own body;" that is, a body
   of the same kind with the seed that was sown.

   2. The other instance is from the difference of several sorts of
   bodies, which are all made of the same kind of matter, put into
   different forms, some more perfect and glorious, and others less: (ver.
   39-41.) "All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of
   men, another of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds;" and
   yet all these are fashioned out of the same kind of matter. "There are
   also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial; but the glory of the
   celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another;" and the
   celestial bodies are of a different lustre and glory; "for there is one
   glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of
   the stars; and one star differeth from another star in glory."

   And then he applies these instances to the resurrection: (ver. 42.) "So
   also is" it in "the resurrection of the dead." This matter, which was
   vile before, when it was buried in the earth, puts on another form, and
   by the power of God is raised up a different thing, and far more
   glorious than when it was put into the earth: (ver. 42-44.) "It is sown
   in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour,
   it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
   it is sown a natural (or an animal) body, it is raised a spiritual
   body." I shall briefly explain these several expressions, which
   represent to us the difference between our bodies, as they now are, and
   as they shall be at the resurrection.

   "It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption." Our bodies,
   as they are now, are unequally tempered, and in a perpetual flux and
   change, continually tending to corruption, being made of such contrary
   principles and qualities, as by their perpetual confliction do conspire
   the ruin and dissolution of it. But when they are raised again, they
   shall be so tempered and refined, as to be free from all these
   destructive qualities, which threaten a change and dissolution; "they
   shall be raised incorruptible," so as not to be liable to decay and
   death. The body, though it continues still material and consists of
   matter, shall then partake of the immortality of the soul to which it
   is united, and be of equal duration with it. So the apostle tells us:
   (ver. 52, 53.) "The dead shall be raised incorruptible; for this
   corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
   immortality."

   "It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory." Our bodies, when they
   are committed to the earth, are vile offensive carcasses, and therefore
   we hide and bury them out of sight: but they shall be raised beautiful
   and glorious, as different from what they were before, as the heavenly
   mansions, in which they are to dwell for ever, are from the dark cell
   of the grave, out of which they are raised: and they that before were
   only fit company for dust and worms, shall be admitted into the
   reviving presence of God, and the blessed society of angels.

   "It is sown in weakness, it shall be raised in power." Our bodies now
   fall to the ground through their own frailty, and drop into the grave
   through the weakness and infirmity of nature to support and bear them
   up any longer: but though they fall through weakness, they shall at the
   resurrection be endowed with such a life, and strength, and vigour, as
   to be able, without any change or decay, to abide and continue for ever
   in the same state.

   "It is sown a natural body," psuchiko`n, "an animal body," an earthly
   cottage or tabernacle fitted for the soul to lodge in for a little
   while, "but it is raised a spiritual body." And this is the sum of all
   the rest. Our bodies in this world are gross flesh and blood, liable to
   be affected with natural and sensual pleasures, and to be afflicted
   with natural pains and diseases, to be pressed with natural necessities
   of hunger and thirst, and obnoxious to all those changes and accidents
   to which natural things are subject: but it shall be "raised a
   spiritual body," pure and refined from the dregs of matter: it shall
   not hunger nor thirst, be diseased or in pain any more. These "houses
   of clay, whose foundation is in the dust," are continually decaying,
   and therefore they stand in need of perpetual reparation by food and
   physic: but "our house, which shall be from heaven," shall be of such
   lasting and durable matter, as not only time, but even eternity itself,
   shall make no impression upon it, or cause the least decay in it. "They
   who shall be accounted worthy (says our Saviour) to obtain that world,
   and the resurrection from the dead, cannot die any more; but shall be
   like the angels, and are the children of God;" that is, in some degree
   shall partake of the felicity and immortality of God himself, who is
   "always the same, and his years fail not."--"It is raised a spiritual
   body." We shall then be, as it were, all spirit, and our very bodies
   shall be then raised and refined, that they shall be no clog, no
   impediment to the operations of our souls. And surely we cannot but
   think this a glorious change, when we consider how our bodies do now
   crush our spirits, and what a melancholy and dead weight they are upon
   them, and how grievous an incumbrance, and trouble, and temptation they
   are, for the most part, to us in this mortal state. I proceed now to
   the

   II. Second thing, wherein the blessedness of the just at the
   resurrection shall consist, viz. in the consequent happiness of the
   whole man, of the soul and body united and purified; the one from sin,
   the other from frailty and corruption; and both admitted to the blessed
   sight and enjoyment of the ever-blessed God. But this is an argument
   too big for our narrow apprehensions of things, whilst we are in this
   mortal state; a subject too unwieldy for such children as the wisest of
   us all are while we are in this world; and, whenever we attempt to
   speak of it, we do but speak like children, and understand like
   children, and reason like children, about it. "That which is imperfect
   must be done away;" our souls must be raised to a greater perfection,
   and our understandings filled with a stronger and steadier light,
   before we can be fit to handle such a subject, according to the worth
   and dignity of it. We must first have been in heaven, and possessed of
   that felicity and glory which is there to be enjoyed, before we can
   think or talk of it, in any measure as it deserves. In the mean time,
   whenever we set about it, we shall find our faculties oppressed with
   the weight and splendour of so vast and glorious an argument; like St.
   Paul, who, when he was caught up into paradise, saw and heard that,
   which, when he came down into this world again, he was not able to
   express, and which is not possible for man to utter.

   So that, in discoursing of the state of the blessed, we must content
   ourselves with what the Scripture hath declared in general concerning
   it, that it is a state of perfect freedom from all those infirmities
   and imperfections, those evils and miseries, those sins and
   temptations, to which we are liable in this world; a state of
   unspeakable and endless joy and happiness in the blessed sight and
   presence of God, and in the happy society of "an innumerable company of
   an gels," and of the "spirits of just men made perfect."

   So St. John describes the felicities and glories of that state, as they
   were represented to him in a vision: (Rev. xxi. 2-4.) "And I, John, saw
   the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,
   prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I. heard a great voice
   out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and
   he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself
   shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears
   from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
   crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are
   passed away;" that is, all those evils which we saw and suffered in
   this world, will for ever vanish and disappear. (And ver. 23.) "And the
   city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it; for
   the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light there of."
   And, which is the greatest privilege and felicity of all, no sin shall
   be there: (ver. 27.) "And there shall in no wise enter into it any
   thing that defileth:" and consequently no misery and curse shall be
   there: (chap. xxii. 3, 4.) "And there shall be no more curse; but the
   throne of God, and of the Lamb, shall be in it, and his servants shall
   serve him, and they shall see his face." In which last words, our
   employment and our happiness are expressed; but what in particular
   these shall be, and wherein they shall consist, it is impossible for us
   now to describe: it is sufficient to know, in general, that our
   employment shall be our unspeakable pleasure, and every way suitable to
   the glory and happiness of that state, and as much above the noblest
   and most delightful employment of this world, as the perfection of our
   bodies, and the powers of our souls, shall then be above what they were
   in this world.

   In a word, our happiness shall be such as is worthy of the great King
   of the world to bestow upon his faithful servants, and infinitely
   beyond the just reward of their best services; it is "to see God, and
   to be ever with him, in whose presence is fulness of joy, and at whose
   right hand are pleasures for evermore."
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLXXXIV.

  OF THE HAPPINESS OF GOOD MEN, IN THE FUTURE STATE.

   It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when he
   shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.--1
   John iii. 2.

   THE great design of this Epistle is to persuade men to purity and
   holiness of life, without which we can lay no claim to the promises and
   privileges of the gospel. Christians are called "the children of God;"
   and this is a great privilege indeed, a mighty argument of God's love
   and favour to us, to own us for his children. "Behold what manner of
   love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the
   sons of God." This is the happiness of our present condition: "now we
   are the sons of God; and if sons, then heirs; this gives a title to a
   future inheritance. "And it does not yet appear what we shall be;" the
   circumstances of our future happiness and glory are not perfectly
   revealed to us, only thus much in general is discovered to us, that we
   shall be very happy, because we shall be admitted to the immediate
   sight and enjoyment of God; and we cannot see him and enjoy him, unless
   we be like him: and to be like God is to be happy. "We know that when
   he shall appear," ean phanerothe, that is, "when it shall appear." "It
   doth not yet appear what we shall be, but when it shall appear," that
   is, when our future happiness shall be revealed to us: it is not yet
   particularly discovered to us, but thus much in general we know of it
   beforehand, that "we shall be like God, for we shall see him as he is."
   In which words there are these four things worthy of our consideration:

   First, The present security of our future state, as to the particular
   circumstances of that happiness which good men shall enjoy in another
   world: "It doth not yet appear what we shall be."

   Secondly, That thus much we certainly know of it in general, that it
   shall consist in the sight and enjoyment of God; "We know that, when it
   shall appear, we shall see him as he is."

   Thirdly, Wherein our likeness to God shall consist; "We shall be like
   him."

   Fourthly, The necessary connexion between our likeness to God, and our
   sight and enjoyment of him; "We shall be like him; for we shall see him
   as he is:" that is, because "we shall see him as he is;" therefore it
   is certain "we shall be like him;" for unless we be like God, we are
   not capable of seeing and enjoying him.

   First, The present obscurity of our future state, as to the particular
   circumstances of that happiness which good men shall enjoy in another
   world: "It doth not yet appear what we shall be." The Scripture tells
   us, that it is a glory yet to be revealed: that there shall be such a
   state of happiness for good men in another world, though it was in a
   great measure obscure to the world before, both to Jews and gentiles,
   yet it is now clearly revealed to us by "the appearance of Jesus
   Christ, who hath brought life and immortality to light by the gospel."
   But the particular circumstances of this happiness are still hid from
   us; and, as it is a needless, so it would be a faulty, curiosity in us
   to pry and inquire into them. It is enough that we certainly know there
   is such a state; the knowledge of this in general is enough to quicken
   our diligence, and excite our endeavours, for the obtaining and
   securing of it: it is enough to mortify all evil affections in us, and
   to baffle all temptations to sin, to know that it will rob us of so
   great a felicity as God hath promised to us; it is enough to support
   and comfort us under all the miseries and afflictions of this present
   time, to be fully assured that after a few days of sorrow and trouble
   are over, we shall be unspeakably and eternally happy. A firm
   persuasion of this, is argument enough to our obedience, and a
   sufficient support to our faith and patience, and we need inquire no
   farther. Thus much God hath revealed to us, for our comfort and
   encouragement, the rest he hath concealed from us; and it would be a
   bold intrusion into his secrets, to pry and search any farther; and, if
   we should, it would be to no purpose. For in things which depend upon
   Divine revelation, it is impossible for us to know any more, than God
   is pleased to reveal to us. In matters of pure revelation, we cannot go
   beyond the word of the Lord: "The things of God knoweth no man, but the
   Spirit of God, or he to whom the Spirit of God shall reveal them." If
   one should come from a strange country, never known and discovered
   before, and should only tell us, in general, that it was a most
   pleasant and delightful place, and the inhabitants a brave, and
   generous, and wealthy people, under the government of a wise and great
   king, ruling by excellent laws; and that the particular delights and
   advantages of it were not to be imagined by any thing he knew in our
   own country, and should say no more of it: if we gave credit to the
   person that brought this relation, it would create in us a great
   admiration of the country described to us, and a mighty concern to see
   it, and live in it. But it would be a vain curiosity, to reason and
   conjecture about the particular conveniences of it; because it would be
   impossible, by any discourse, to arrive at the certain knowledge of any
   more, than he, who only knew it, was pleased to tell us. This is the
   case as to our heavenly country. Our blessed Saviour, who "came down
   from heaven," from "the bosom of his Father," hath revealed to us a
   state of happiness and glory in general, that there is such "a kingdom
   prepared for us;" and when he was leaving the world, he told us, that
   he was going thither by the way of the grave; and when he was risen
   again from the dead, and was ascended into heaven, he promised to come
   again at the end of the world, and to raise us out of the grave, and to
   carry us into those celestial mansions, "where we shall be for ever
   with the Lord." And beyond this he hath made no particular discovery to
   us of the felicity of that place; he hath given us no punctual
   representation of the glory of it; he hath not declared to us, in a
   special manner, what our work and employment shall be, in what way God
   will communicate himself to us, nor what kind of conversation we shall
   have with the blessed angels, and with one another, and how far we
   shall know, or be known, to one another; or whether we shall stand
   affected in any peculiar manner to those who were our friends, and
   relations, and acquaintance in this world. These and perhaps a thousand
   things more, which may concern the glories of that state, and the
   happiness and employment of the "spirits of just men made perfect," our
   Saviour hath told us nothing of, but only in general; and it is
   impossible for us with any certainty to make out the rest, any more
   than children can make a conjecture of the designs and reasonings of a
   wise man; not only because it would be of no great use to us, but
   because the imperfection of human nature, and of our faculties in this
   state of mortality, is not able to bear a full and clear representation
   of so great a glory.

   When our Saviour was transfigured upon the mount, and a little image of
   heaven was shewn to men, the disciples were strangely amazed, and knew
   not what they said. And St. Paul tells us, that when he was "taken up
   into the third heaven," the things which he saw and heard there, "were
   not to be uttered." So that well might the apostle say here in the
   text, "It doth not yet appear what we shall be." Our future state is
   very obscure to us while we are in this world, as to any distinct and
   particular knowledge of it.

   There are a sort of idle men in the world, I mean the schoolmen, who
   have been very busy and bold in their inquiries, very peremptory in
   their determinations of several things relating to it: but after all
   our search and study, it is impossible for us to advance one step
   farther in the knowledge of it, than God hath been pleased in his holy
   word to reveal it to us. And how much God hath revealed, I shall, in
   discoursing of the

   Second particular, consider; namely, That thus much we know of it in
   general, that it shall consist in the blessed vision of God: "It doth
   not yet appear what we shall be; but when he shall appear, we shall see
   him as he is." Thus much all Christians know, because our Saviour hath
   plainly revealed it to them, that the blessedness of the saints should
   consist in the vision of God. (Matt. v. 8.) "Blessed are the pure in
   heart; for they shall see God." Which the apostle expresseth with a
   little variation; (Heb. xii. 14.) "Without holiness no man shall see
   the Lord." Here is a great thing expressed to us in a few words, "We
   shall see him as he is:" for the better understanding of which, it will
   be convenient to inquire into these three things:

   I. What is meant here by seeing God.

   II. What by seeing him as he is.

   III. The fitness of this metaphor, to express to us the happiness of
   our future state.

   I. What is meant by seeing God. The school men have spun out abundance
   of fine cobwebs about this, which in their language they call "the
   beatific vision of God," and they generally describe and explain it so
   as to render it a very dry and sapless thing. They make it to consist
   in a perpetual gazing upon God, and contemplating the Divine essence
   and perfections, in which, as in a clearer mirror, they suppose men to
   see and know all other things. But this is a very jejune and insipid
   notion of happiness, but yet suitable enough to the gust and
   inclination of those that devised it. And, indeed, men are naturally
   apt to form such notions of God and heaven to themselves, as are most
   agreeable to their own appetites and inclinations. So the heathen world
   framed to themselves gods after their own image and likeness; of like
   passions, and inclinations, and lusts with themselves; and such a
   heaven as pleased themselves, and was most suitable to their own gross
   imaginations of pleasure and happiness; and therefore they described it
   by pleasant fields, and clear rivers, and shady walks. So likewise
   Mahomet framed such a paradise, as is most agreeable to our sensual
   appetites and lusts. In like manner the schoolmen, who addicted
   themselves wholly to contemplation, would have the happiness of heaven
   to consist in that which they themselves took most delight in. But
   surely the Scripture understands something more by the sight of God,
   than a bare contemplation of him. It is a known rule given by divines
   for the understanding of Scripture--"The words that signify sense and
   knowledge, are very often in Scripture to be so understood, as to
   comprehend in them those affections and effects, which sense and
   knowledge are apt to produce in us." So our knowledge of God doth in
   Scripture many times import the sum of all religion, the whole duty of
   man: "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
   liar:" and God's knowing of us, signifies the whole happiness of man;
   "The Lord knoweth them that are his." So tasting and sight are in
   Scripture put for experience and enjoyment: (Psal. xxxiv. 8.) "Taste
   and see that the Lord is gracious." (Lament. iii. 1.) "I am the man
   that hath seen affliction;" that is, that hath suffered it. (1 Pet.
   iii. 10.) "He that will love life, and see good days," that is, enjoy
   them. And so we use the word in common speech. To see a friend, is to
   enjoy the pleasure of his company, and all the advantages of his
   conversation. So here, the sight of God doth comprehend and take in all
   the happiness of a future state. As to see the king includes the court,
   and all the glorious circumstances of his attendance; so to see God,
   does take in all that glory, and joy, and happiness, which flows from
   his presence.

   I grant, indeed, that this expression primarily and immediately denotes
   our perfect knowledge of God in the other life, in opposition to those
   obscure and more imperfect discoveries and apprehensions which we have
   of him in these earthly bodies: for I think we need make no doubt, but
   that sight is here taken in a spiritual and intellectual sense. We are
   not to dream that we shall see God with our bodily eyes; for being a
   pure spirit, he cannot be the object of any corporeal sense. But we
   shall have such a sight of him, as a pure spirit is capable of; we
   shall see him with the eyes of our minds and understanding. And in this
   sense, we do in some degree see God in this life, by faith and
   knowledge; but it is but darkly, and as it were through a glass that we
   see him, as the apostle expresseth it. But when we come to heaven, our
   understanding shall be raised and cleared to such a degree of strength
   and perfection, that we shall know God after a more perfect manner,
   than we are capable of in this state of mortality. And this perfect
   knowledge of him, together with the happy effects of it, those
   affections which it shall raise in us, and that blessed enjoyment of
   the chief good which we are not able to express, is that which is
   cabled the sight of God.

   II. What is here meant by seeing God as he is: we shall see him as he
   is. Now this cloth farther and emphatically express our perfect
   knowledge and enjoyment of God.

   1. Our perfect knowledge of him. Not that we are to imagine, that when
   we come to heaven, our understanding can, or shall be raised to such a
   pitch, as to be able perfectly to comprehend the infinite nature and
   perfections of God: for all created understanding being naturally
   finite, we cannot imagine that it can be stretched to the comprehension
   of what is infinite, as the Divine nature and perfections are. But our
   knowledge shall be advanced and raised to such degrees of perfection,
   as a finite and created understanding is capable of.

   And we may very reasonably conceive (and in deed the Scripture leads us
   to it, without and be yond which it is not safe to speak of these
   things); I say, we may reasonably conceive the perfection of this
   knowledge to. consist in these three things: in a more immediate, and
   clear, and certain knowledge of the Divine nature and perfections, than
   we are capable of in this state of mortality.

   (1.) We shall then have an immediate knowledge of God. In this world we
   see him by the means and help of his word and works; we see him as he
   hath manifested and revealed himself to us in the Holy Scriptures, as
   he hath represented himself to us in. the creatures, as the apostle
   tells us: (Rom. i. 20.) that "his eternal power and Godhead are clearly
   seen by the things that are made." But thus we do not see God
   immediately and directly; but by a reflection of his perfections from
   the works of creation and providence. We see him by faith at a great
   distance, which the apostle calls, seeing him as it were "through a
   glass," (1 Cor. xiii. 12.) Now faith in Scripture is most frequently
   opposed to sight, which is a more immediate view and nearer discovery
   of a thing. (2 Cor. v. 7.) "We walk by faith, and not by sight." But in
   heaven we shall have an immediate and direct sight of God, that which
   the Scripture calls, seeing him? face to face;" not at a distance, as
   we do now by faith; not by reflection, as we do now see him in the
   creatures; but we shall have an immediate and direct view of him. Faith
   shall then cease, as the apostle tells us, and be perfected in sight,
   because of the nearness and evidence of the object.

   (2.) We shall not only then have an immediate, but a far clearer
   knowledge of God, than we have now in this life: (1 Cor. xiii. 12.) "We
   now see him in a glass darkly," an ainigmati, "in a riddle," which is
   an obscure and involved declaration of a thing. We have now but very
   dark and confused apprehensions, and such as do not only represent him
   very imperfectly, but many times very falsely, to us. While our souls
   are muffled in these gross bodies, we are compassed about with clouds,
   which do in a great measure intercept the sight of him: but the light
   of glory will scatter all these clouds, "the veil shall then be taken
   away." The resurrection will refine our bodies to that purity, that
   they shall be fit instruments for our souls. We shall have spiritual
   bodies, as the apostle tells us, (1 Cor. xv.) so purified from all
   these dregs which now incumber them, that they shall be fit to be
   united to a spirit, and to act with it; and then "we shall with open
   face behold the glory of God," as the apostle expresseth it; (2 Cor.
   iii. 18.) or as it is here in the text, "we shall see him as he is." We
   see him now many times as he is not; that is, we are liable to false
   and mistaken conceptions of him: but then we shall see him as he is.
   The clearness of our knowledge will free us from all error and mistake
   about him. We are now many times at a loss what conceptions to have of
   God; we are hard put to it to reconcile one perfection of God with
   another, and to make them consistent and agree together. We believe his
   providence; but we are puzzled many times how to make that accord with
   his goodness and justice: but in heaven we shall see the harmony of all
   these, and that it was nothing but our ignorance and darkness which
   made us imagine any discord and disagreement in them.

   (3.) We shall then, likewise, have a certain knowledge of God, free
   from all doubts concerning him. There may be a certainty in faith; but
   not that high degree of evidence and assurance which is in sight. It is
   spoken by way of abating the certainty of faith, when it is called the
   evidence of things not seen; nay, many times the faith of good men is
   mixed with a great deal of fear and doubt of the contrary: but in the
   state of glory, we shall not be liable to any of these doublings and
   jealousies, which do so frequently possess the best of men in this
   world. Then "we shall know, as also we are known," as the apostle
   expresseth it, (1 Cor. xiii. 12.) As God now knows us, so shall we then
   know him, as to the truth and certainty of our knowledge.

   Now such an immediate, and clear, and certain knowledge of God, as hath
   been described, doth necessarily suppose a very great elevation of our
   understandings, above what this state of mortality can bear. We cannot
   now have a clear and immediate sight of God, because the weakness and
   imperfection of our present state will not admit of it. In this life,
   our understandings are easily overborne by the lustre and excellency of
   an object. Hence it was that God said to Moses, when he so earnestly
   desired to see his face, "Thou canst not see my face, and live," (Exod.
   xxxiii. 20.) So transcendent and glorious a sight would quite overwhelm
   and overcome our faculties; as the light of the sun, if we look
   steadfastly and directly upon it, will dazzle and blind the strongest
   eye. The sight of so glorious a being as God is, of so much excellency,
   and happiness, and perfection, as concentre in him, would fill us with
   joy and wonder, too great for frail mortality to bear: but in the state
   of glory, the eye of the soul, that is, our understanding faculty,
   shall be enlarged unto that capacity, and purified to that clearness,
   and elevated to that strength, as to be able to receive and bear so
   much of the lustre and glory of the Divine nature and perfection, as is
   consistent with the finiteness of a human under standing, and suitable
   to the perfection of a glorified soul; and our understandings shall
   then be raised and advanced to such a strength, that they shall be so
   far from being oppressed and burdened with the presence of God, and
   from sinking under the weight of his glory, that they shall be
   infinitely ravished and delighted with it.

   2. To see God "as he is," does imply our perfect enjoyment of him. We
   shall not only perfectly know him, but we shall take infinite pleasure
   in him, in beholding his glory, in praising and admiring his goodness,
   in doing his will with all imaginable readiness and cheerfulness. I do
   not pretend to describe to you the particularities of that state, and
   all the blessed comforts and enjoyments of it: "It doth not yet appear
   what we shall be." God hath not told us, and none but he, who is the
   author and fountain of this happiness, can discover it to us. Let it
   suffice us, that God hath assured us of it, and hath prepared it for
   us; and it can be no mean thing, which the infinite wisdom, and
   goodness, and power of God hath designed for the final reward of those
   who love him, and of those whom he loves. If we know thus much of it,
   that it is certain be yond all doubt, and vast beyond all imagination,
   we have nothing more to wish, but that God would fit us for it, and, as
   soon as he pleaseth, bring us to the enjoyment of it,

   III. We will consider the fitness of this metaphor, to express to us
   the happiness of our future state. And that the Scripture doth very
   much delight to set forth to us the blessedness of heaven, by this
   metaphor of seeing, is evident from the frequent use of it in
   Scripture. (Matt. v. 8.) "Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall
   see God." (1 Cor. xiii. 12.) "We shall see him face to face." (Heb.
   xii. 14.) "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord." And here in the
   text, "we shall see him as he is." And indeed God is pleased, in
   Scripture, to make sensible descriptions of the happiness and misery of
   another world, and, by way of accommodation to our understandings, and
   condescension to the weakness and imperfections of this state, to set
   forth heaven and hell to us by such things as are sensible; and that,
   not only to help our under standings to a more easy conception of
   things, but likewise to move and rouse our affections, which, while we
   are in the body, and immersed in sense, are commonly most powerfully
   wrought upon, by sensible representations of things. And therefore hell
   is described to us by such things as affect the sense of feeling,
   because that is capable of the greatest and sharpest pain; and the
   enjoyments of heaven, by the sense of sight, because that is the
   noblest of all our senses; and the primary and proper object of it is
   most delightful, and of the most spiritual nature of any corporeal
   thing.

   1. Sight is the noblest and most excellent of all our senses: and
   therefore the frame of the eye is the most curious of all other parts
   of the body, and the dearest to us, and that which we preserve with the
   greatest tenderness. When the apostle would set forth the mighty
   affection which the Galatians bore to him, he says, "they would have
   plucked out their very eyes for him." It is the most comprehensive
   sense, hath the largest sphere, takes in the most objects, and discerns
   them at the greatest distance. It can in a moment pass from earth to
   heaven, and survey innumerable objects. It is the most pure, and
   spiritual, and quickest in its operations, and approacheth nearest to
   the nature of a spiritual faculty. Of all our senses, it carries the
   greatest evidence and certainty along with it, and the reports of it
   are the most certain and unquestionable. Hence we use to say, that one
   eye-witness is more than ten ear-witnesses. When Job would express to
   us the most perfect knowledge of God, he does it by sight: (Job xlii.
   5.) "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now my eyes
   see thee:" that is, he had a more perfect and clear discovery of God
   and his perfections, than ever he had before. And to mention but one
   thing more; it is that sense which is more apt to work upon our
   affections:


   Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures,

   Quam quæ sunt oculis commissa fidelibus;

   "The things which we hear reported, are not so apt to move our pity, or
   anger, or love, as the things which we see with our eyes." So that in
   all these respects, of the dignity and excellency, the largeness and
   comprehensiveness, the spirituality and quickness, the evidence and
   certainty of this sense, and the power it hath to raise our affections,
   it is the fittest to represent to us the noblest employment and
   operation of our souls in the state of glory.

   2. The primary and proper object of this sense, is the most delightful
   and of the most spiritual nature of any corporeal thing, and that is
   light. "The light of the eye rejoiceth the heart," (Prov. xv. 30.)
   "Light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eye to behold the
   sun," (Eccles. xi. 7.) It is the purest and most spiritual of all
   corporeal things, and therefore God chooseth to represent himself by
   it: "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."

   And thus I have done with the second thing I propounded to speak to;
   namely, that thus much, in general, we certainly know of the happiness
   of our future state--that it shall consist in the sight of God. I
   should now proceed to the third thing, namely, wherein our likeness to
   God shall consist; but this I shall defer to another opportunity.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLXXXV.

  OF THE HAPPINESS OF GOOD MEN IN THE FUTURE STATE.

   It doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when he
   shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.--1
   John iii. 2.

   IN these words are four things worthy of our consideration.

   First, The present obscurity of our future state, as to the particular
   circumstances of that happiness which good men shall enjoy in another
   world; "It doth not yet appear what we shall be."

   Secondly, What we know of it in general; that it shall consist in the
   perfect knowledge and enjoyment of God; both which are comprehended in
   that expression: "We shall see him as he is."

   Thirdly, Wherein our likeness and conformity to God shall consist;
   "This we know, that, when, he shall appear, we shall be like him."

   Fourthly, The necessary connexion between our likeness and conformity
   to God, and our sight and enjoyment of him. The two first of these I
   have spoken to. I shall now proceed to the

   Third; namely, Wherein our likeness and conformity to God shall
   consist, "We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him:" in
   these two, things--in the immortality of our nature, and in the purity
   of our souls.

   I. In the immortality of our nature. In this mortal state, we are not
   capable of that happiness which consists in the vision of God; that is,
   in the perfect knowledge and perpetual enjoyment of him. The
   imperfection of our state, and the weakness of our faculties, cannot
   bear the sight of so glorious and resplendent an object, as the Divine
   nature and perfections are: we cannot see God and live. The frailty of
   our mortal condition is unequal to sustain so great a weight of glory;
   to be sure it is incapable of eternal felicity; nothing but an immortal
   nature can be happy for ever. And therefore the Scripture tells us,
   that, when our bodies shall be raised, the quality and condition of
   them shall be quite altered, and that our blessed Saviour shall, by his
   almighty power, make a mighty change in them, from what they were in
   this mortal state: (Phil. iii. 20, 21.) "Our conversation is in heaven,
   from whence also we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who
   shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
   glorious body, according to the working where by he is able even to
   subdue all things to himself." And the apostle tells us, more
   particularly, wherein this change doth consist: (1 Cor. xv. 42.) "It is
   sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in
   dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised
   in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body."
   These corruptible, and vile, and weak, and gross bodies, which we wear
   and carry about us for a while, and at last put off, and lay down in
   the grave, shall, by the power of God at the resurrection, be refined
   and advanced into spiritual and vigorous, glorious and immortal bodies.
   Our bodies are now but a tabernacle, a temporary and moveable dwelling,
   that shall shortly be taken down; but, at the resurrection, they shall
   become a fixed and settled habitation, a house that shall never decay,
   nor come to ruin. So the apostle tells us: (2 Cor. v. 1.) "We know,
   that, if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
   building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
   And when this blessed change shall be made, "mortality shall be
   swallowed up of life; for this corruptible must put on incorruption,
   and this mortal must put on immortality." And there is a necessity of
   this, in order to our perfect happiness. For that is not a perfect
   happiness, which shall expire and have an end; which it must have, if
   we were still liable to mortality. And therefore the apostle is
   peremptory, that there must be such a change, because our bodies, as
   they are now constituted and framed, are utterly incapable of the
   happiness of the next life. (Ver. 50.) "For this I say, brethren, that
   flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." Where, by "flesh
   and blood," the apostle does not mean, as many have imagined, our
   sinful and impure nature; but our frail and mortal nature, consisting
   of such gross materials as flesh and blood are, for the maintenance and
   support of which, there is continual need of new recruits, and fresh
   supplies of nourishment by meat and drink. Such a nature as this, which
   is necessarily mortal, "cannot inherit the kingdom of God," which is a
   state of perpetual and endless happiness. And that the apostle means
   this, by the phrase of "flesh and blood," is evident, beyond all doubt,
   from the next words, which he adds by way of explication of what he had
   said, "This, I say, brethren, flesh and blood cannot inherit the
   kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption." That
   which is liable to death and corruption, is not capable of immortal
   glory and happiness. And therefore our nature must be made immortal;
   and immortality makes us like to God, and is an evident testimony and
   declaration that we are the sons of God. "We are now the children of
   God," in respect of our title to a future inheritance; but this is hid
   from the world: but at the resurrection, when we shall bear the image
   of his immortality, this will be an evident mark of our being the sons
   of God. As our blessed Saviour was "mightily declared to be the Son of
   God, by his resurrection from the dead;" so likewise shall his members
   be declared to be "the children of God," by that glorious change that
   shall be made in them at the resurrection, when "this mortal shall put
   on immortality." Then we are the sons of God, indeed, in an eminent
   manner, when "we can die no more."

   And therefore it is worth our observation, that the Scripture gives us
   the title of "the children of God," more especially upon this account:
   (Luke xx. 35, 36.) "But they which shall be counted worthy to obtain
   that world, and the resurrection from the dead, can die no more, but
   are equal to the angels, and are the children of God, being the
   children of the resurrection." And (Rom. viii. 19.) the resurrection is
   called, "the manifestation of the sons of God." And (ver. 21.) "Our
   being delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious
   liberty of the sons of God." And (ver. 23.) it is called our "adoption
   or sonship; we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the
   adoption, viz. the redemption of our bodies." This is the first thing,
   wherein our likeness and resemblance to God in our future state of
   happiness shall consist, the immortality of our nature; without which
   we could not be capable of the blessed vision of God, and the
   everlasting enjoyment of him.

   II. It shall consist in the purity of our souls. Now purity is a
   freedom from sin, which is the great stain and defilement of the soul.
   Before we can be admitted into heaven, we must be quit of all those
   vicious and corrupt inclinations, of all those inordinate desires and
   passions, which defile our souls, and render us unlike to God. In this
   world, every good man does "mortify his earthly and corrupt
   affections," and in some measure "bring them into obedience and
   subjection to the law of God." But still there are some relics of sin,
   some spots and imperfections in the holiness of the best men. But upon
   our entrance into the other world, we shall quite "put off the old man
   with the affections and lusts thereof;" we shall be perfectly
   "delivered from this body of sin and death," and, together with this
   mortal nature, part with all the remainders of sin and corruption,
   which cleave to this mortal state. For till "our earthly house of this
   tabernacle be dissolved," we shall never be wholly cleansed from the
   leprosy of sin. While we are in this world, we must be continually
   "cleansing ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit," and
   "perfecting holiness in the fear of God." But we shall never be wholly
   cleansed, we shall never be perfectly holy, in this life: but in the
   other state, all sin and imperfection shall be done away, and we shall
   be "presented to God, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing." And
   perfect holiness is the image of God, and the very nearest resemblance
   of the Divine nature, that creatures are capable of.

   But how our souls shall be purified from those remainders of sin and
   dregs of corruption, which are in the best men, while they are in this
   world, it is not necessary that we should be able perfectly to explain.
   It ought to be sufficient to us/ that he who hath promised it, is able
   to do it one way or other; only I am confident, and have great reason
   to be so, that this purification will not be wrought by the fire of
   purgatory. For if there be any such thing, as there is not the least
   spark of Divine revelation for it (and how any body should come to know
   it otherwise, is not easy to imagine), it is granted to be a material
   fire; and if it be so, it is no ways fitted, either for the punishment
   or purgation of impure souls. Indeed, if men carried their bodies into
   purgatory, the fire of it might be a cruel torment and vexation to
   them: but how a fire should scorch a spirit, is, I believe, beyond the
   subtilty of a schoolman to make out; much less is it fitted to purge
   and take away sin. And, if the truth were known, it was never seriously
   intended for this purpose, to do any good to the dead, but to drain the
   purses of the living, by deluding them with a vain hope of getting
   their friends delivered out of that imaginary torment.

   But we, who take our faith from the word of God, and not from the
   fictions of men, do believe, that the souls of good men do immediately
   pass out of this world into a state of happiness; and that he who does
   bestow this happiness upon them, does qualify them for it, before he
   admits them into it. And if we consider the matter well, we shall find,
   that a man who hath truly repented of his sins, and through the mercy
   of God, in Jesus Christ, hath obtained of God the pardon and
   forgiveness of them, and is firmly resolved against sin, and doth truly
   endeavour to mortify his lusts, and to lead a holy life, and by the
   grace of God does "deny ungodliness and worldly lusts," and "lives
   soberly, and righteously, and godly, in this present world;" I say, we
   shall find that such a man is "not far from the kingdom of God," but
   very nearly qualified and disposed for it; and that there hardly wants
   any thing to make such a man perfectly good, but only to remove out of
   his way those obstacles and impediments to virtue, and to free him from
   those circumstances of infirmity and temptation, which do unavoidably
   encompass us in this world; such as are ignorance, and the instigations
   of our bodily temper to irregular appetites and passions, that which
   the apostle calls, "the law in our members warring against the law of
   our minds;" the necessities of this life, the temptations of the devil
   and of bad company, and the like; all which do appertain to this state,
   and which we shall be quit of so soon as we leave this world, and put
   off these frail and mortal bodies: and when these are removed, we are
   free from the bondage of sin, and have nothing to hinder and divert
   that strong bent and inclination of mind, which is in every good man,
   to do the will of God. So that our very translation into another state
   does of itself assert us into this "glorious liberty of the sons of
   God." And if, besides this, any thing more be necessary to cleanse us
   from sin, and perfect the holiness and purity of our souls, we need not
   be solicitous about the way and manner of it, but may rest confident,
   that "he who hath begun a good work in us, will perfect it in the day
   of Christ;" and that what is wanting in our love to God, or charity to
   men, in goodness, and meekness, and purity, or any grace or virtue
   whatsoever, shall then be added to them, that "so an entrance may be
   administered to us abundantly in to the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ."--"This we know, that when he shall appear,
   we shall be like him;" like him in the immortality of our nature, and
   in the purity of our souls, which are the very image of God, and the
   most express character of the Divine nature. The

   Fourth and last thing remains, which is to shew the necessary connexion
   which is between our likeness and conformity to God, and our sight and
   enjoyment of him; "We know that we shall be like him, for we shall see
   him as he is." Which implies, that, unless we be like God, we are in no
   capacity of the blessed sight and enjoyment of him.

   I. Likeness to God in the immortality of our nature, is necessary to
   make us capable of the happiness of the next life; which consists in
   the blessed and perpetual vision and enjoyment of God. If our natures
   were mortal, we were incapable of seeing God. What was said of Moses,
   is equally true of all mankind, in this state of mortality: we cannot
   see the face of God and live. Nothing that is frail and dying can
   endure the splendour of so great a glory: nothing that stands in need
   of continual reparation, as flesh and blood does, can "inherit the
   kingdom of God;" nothing but a fixed and immutable nature, which can
   never decay, is capable of everlasting happiness.

   But this part of likeness and conformity to God, though it be necessary
   to make us capable of the felicity of another world, yet it is no part
   of our duty and care: if we endeavour after the other, which consists
   in holiness and purity, God will work this in us, and for us, without
   any concurrence of ours. All that he requires of us, is, that we firmly
   believe it, and patiently expect it, and fervently pray for it, and
   aspire after it. And, indeed, our likeness to God in this respect,
   depends upon our conformity to him in purity and holiness. For as "by
   sin death entered into the world, and so death passed upon all men;" so
   nothing but holiness can restore us to immortality.

   The foundation of all our hopes of a blessed immortality, is to be laid
   in the price of our redemption, as the meritorious cause of it, and in
   our being "renewed after the image of God, in righteousness and true
   holiness," as the proper qualification and capacity for it on our
   parts. We must "have our fruit unto holiness," if we look that the end
   should be everlasting life. And to this purpose it is excellently said,
   in the Wisdom of Solomon, "the keeping of God's commandments is the
   assurance of immortality, and immortality makes us like to God." And
   therefore I shall mainly apply myself to the

   II. Second thing; namely, To shew that our likeness to God in the
   purity of our souls, is necessary to make us capable of the blessed
   sight and enjoyment of him in the next life. It is necessary as a
   condition of the thing; and it is necessary as a qualification in the
   person.

   1. It is necessary, as a condition of the thing to be performed on our
   part, before we can expect that God should make good the promise of
   eternal life and happiness to us. The express constitution and
   appointment of God hath made it necessary, who hath told us, "without
   holiness no man shall see him;" that "if we sow to the flesh, we shall
   of the flesh reap corruption; but if we sow to the Spirit, (that is, if
   we be sanctified and renewed) we shall of the Spirit reap everlasting
   life." And if this were a mere arbitrary condition, imposed upon us by
   the sovereign will of God, without any necessity from the nature of the
   thing; yet we ought to accept it, as a very easy condition; when he
   hath only said, as the prophet did to Naaman, "Wash and be clean."
   Certainly no man can refuse so great a benefit and blessing conferred
   upon such cheap and tolerable terms. God hath promised us eternal life;
   a mighty blessing indeed! for the obtaining of which, no condition that
   is possible can be thought hard and un reasonable. And what does he
   require of us for the obtaining of it? but that we "cleanse ourselves
   from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and perfect holiness in the
   fear of God;" that is, that we do with all care and diligence abstain
   from sin, and endeavour to live a holy life; to conform ourselves to
   the will of God, and to be obedient to his laws. He does not require
   perfect holiness of us in this life, but a sincere endeavour after it,
   and he hath promised to assist our endeavour; and if we go as far as we
   can, he will perfect what is wanting. So that there is nothing in all
   this but what is very possible for every man to do, by the assistance
   of that grace which he hath promised to afford us; and if it be
   possible, we cannot answer our neglect of it, when all our hopes of
   happiness depend upon it. But this is not all, there is yet,

   2. A farther necessity of it, inwardly to qualify and dispose us for
   the sight and enjoyment of God. We cannot possibly love God, nor take
   delight in him, unless we be like him in the temper and disposition of
   our minds. If we would know what will make us happy, we must look upon
   the great pattern of happiness, and that is God himself; who, as he is
   the most powerful, and wise, and every way perfect, so is he the
   happiest being in the world. So that if we would be happy, we must be
   like God. We cannot be so perfect as he is, and therefore we cannot be
   so happy; but if we would be as happy as creatures are capable of
   being, we must endeavour to be as like God as it is possible for
   creatures to be.

   We must resemble him as near as we can, in those perfections wherein he
   is imitable by us. And these are, as I may call them, the moral
   perfections of his nature, which the Scripture usually comprehends
   under the name of holiness; his goodness, and patience, and mercy, and
   justice, and truth, and faithfulness; and these, as they are the great
   glory, so the chief felicity of the Divine nature.

   Goodness is a perfection of itself, though it were without any great
   degree of knowledge or power. A poor man, and one that is ignorant in
   comparison of others, may yet be a very good man. But power and
   knowledge separated from goodness are not perfections, but may be
   applied to the worst and most mischievous purposes; as we see in the
   devil, who hath both these qualities in a high degree.

   If we could suppose an omnipotent and all-knowing being, that were
   destitute of goodness, he would not only be troublesome to others, but
   uneasy to himself. Without goodness there can be no happiness. So that
   those perfections which contribute most to the happiness of the Divine
   nature, are the easiest to be imitated by us. We may be like God in his
   holiness, that is in his goodness, and patience, and mercy, and
   righteousness, and truth. And these perfections are the very temper and
   disposition of happiness; for they are the nature of God, who is
   therefore essentially happy, because he is a being constituted of these
   perfections. And so far as we imitate God in these, we are "partakers
   of a Divine nature; we dwell in God, and God in us." So our apostle
   tells us, in the 4th chapter, verse 16. "God is love; and he that
   dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him." These Divine
   qualities make us fit company for our heavenly Father, and capable of
   the joys of heaven, and the delights of that glorious place.

   And the contrary temper and disposition is the nature of the devil, and
   the very thing which makes it impossible for him to be happy. Malice,
   and envy, and revenge, are unquiet passions; and in what nature soever
   they are, they are as vexatious and tormentful to itself, as they are
   troublesome and mischievous to others. These are a hell within us, and
   are as natural causes of misery, as bodily diseases are of pain and
   restlessness; and while these furies are in us, nothing without us can
   make us happy.

   The capacity and foundation of all felicity must be laid in the inward
   frame of our minds, in a god like temper and disposition. Till the
   image of his holiness and goodness, which hath been defaced by sin, be
   renewed upon our minds, we are utterly in capable of the enjoyment of
   the first and chief good, in which all our felicity does consist.

   And thus you see what a necessary connexion there is between our
   likeness and conformity to God, and the blessed vision and enjoyment of
   him. All that now remains, is to draw some inferences from what hath
   been discoursed upon this argument, and so I shall conclude.

   I. This shews us how impossible it is to reconcile a wicked life with
   the hopes of heaven. The terms of our happiness are firmly and
   immutably fixed, like "the foundation of the earth, which can not be
   moved;" nay, sooner may "heaven and earth pass away," than a wicked man
   enter into the kingdom of heaven. If we continue in a sinful and
   impenitent state, we must necessarily "come short of the glory of God."
   And therefore, all those devices which men have found out, to excuse
   themselves from a holy life, and yet to maintain hopes of getting to
   heaven at last, are but foolish arts of security, and tricks to undo
   ourselves quietly, and without any great disturbance. Some think to be
   saved by an external profession of religion, though it have no force
   and efficacy upon their lives; some by being of the only true church,
   wherein salvation is to be had: and yet, if it were true, that there
   were any one party or community of Christians, out of which there were
   no salvation, I am sure this likewise is true, that there is no church
   wherein a wicked man can be saved.

   Others rely upon absolutions and indulgences, and hope, notwithstanding
   all the unrighteousness and ungodliness of their lives, to do their
   business at last that way. But can any man be so foolish, as to think,
   that any church or priest can forgive a man upon other terms, than
   those upon which only God hath declared he will forgive sinners?

   Others hope to be saved by the righteousness of Christ, without any of
   their own. But what a presumption is this, to think that any thing that
   Christ hath done for us, will avail us while we cherish our lusts, and
   live in the contempt of his laws? "Let no man deceive you; he that
   doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous." The
   righteousness of Christ shall never be imputed to any for their
   justification, but those who are "sanctified by the renewing of the
   Holy Ghost."

   So that nothing can be vainer than a wicked man's hopes of heaven. The
   whole design of the gospel is, to convince men that blessedness belongs
   only to the righteous, and that no man that allows himself in any
   wickedness and impiety of life, shall have any "inheritance in the
   kingdom of God and Christ."

   II. The consideration of the indispensable necessity of our likeness
   and conformity to God in holiness and purity, to make us capable of the
   happiness of the next life, calls loudly upon us, to endeavour after it
   in this life. So it follows in the words immediately after the text;
   "we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is: and every man
   that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself, even as he is pure." It
   is true, indeed, nothing but perfect holiness makes us capable of the
   enjoyment of God, and we cannot be perfectly holy in this life. But
   then we are to consider, that if we do not purify ourselves in some
   measure in this world, if we do not begin this work here, it will never
   be perfected hereafter; such dispositions as we carry with us out of
   this world, stick by us for ever. Indeed, if they be good, the degree
   of them shall be perfected; but if they be bad, they shall never be
   altered. If the "image of God be renewed upon us" in this life, "we
   shall be changed from glory to glory" in the other, "by the Spirit of
   the Lord." But if we be utterly unlike God when we die, death will make
   no change in us for the better: we shall "go to our place, and inherit
   the portion of sinners." We did not endeavour to be like God, and
   therefore we can never be admitted to the blessed sight and enjoyment
   of him; for there is a direct and eternal op position between the holy
   nature of God, and an impure creature; and till this opposition be
   removed, we can have no communion with him. And it is too late to take
   away this opposition between God and an impure soul in the other world;
   because our condition is then concluded, and we shall remain for ever
   such as we have made ourselves, while we were in this world.

   Now is the time, "this is the day of salvation." Now we may repent and
   leave our sins, and purify ourselves; and by purity make ourselves like
   to God, and by our likeness to him render our souls capable of being
   admitted to the blessed sight of him, "in whose presence is fulness of
   joy, and at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore."

   So that we ought to resolve upon one of these two things; either to
   give over all thoughts of happiness in another world; or to qualify
   ourselves for it, by "purifying ourselves, as God is pure:" for till we
   are like God, we are not capable of enjoying him. While we live "in
   ungodliness and worldly lusts," we are as unlike God as is possible;
   and there are but two ways imaginable, whereby to bring a conformity
   and likeness between God and us either by changing God or ourselves.
   Now the nature of God is fixed and immutable, he cannot recede from his
   holy nature; therefore we must leave our sins. It is certain we cannot
   change God; therefore we must endeavour to change ourselves. Rather
   think of purifying thy corrupt nature, which may be done; than of
   making any alteration in God, "with whom is no variableness, nor shadow
   of turning."

   Once God hath condescended so far as to take our nature upon him, to
   bring us to a participation of his own Divine nature, and make us
   capable of happiness: but if this will not do, we must not expect that
   God will put off his own nature to make us happy.

SERMON CLXXXVI.

    [Preached at Whitehall, 1686.]

  THE WISDOM OF RELIGION JUSTIFIED, IN THE DIFFERENT ENDS OF GOOD AND BAD MEN.

   The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath
   hope in his death.--Prov. xiv. 32.

   SOLOMON, all along this Book of the Proverbs, doth recommend to us
   religion and the fear of God, by the name, and under the notion of
   wisdom. (Chap. i. 7.) "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
   knowledge." (Chap. ix. 10.); "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
   wisdom; and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding." Hereby
   signifying to us, that religion is the fundamental principle of wisdom,
   by which our whole life, and all the actions of it, ought to be
   conducted rand governed; and that all wisdom which doth not begin here,
   and lay religion for a foundation, and which doth not act upon
   supposition of the truth of the principles of religion, viz. the belief
   of a Gad, and his providence, of the immortality of our souls, and the
   rewards and punishments of another life, is but wisdom falsely so
   called; because it is preposterous, and begins at the wrong end, and
   proceeds upon a false supposition, and wrong schema of things; and
   consequently our whole life, and all the actions and designs of it, do
   run upon a perpetual mistake, and false statings of our own case; and
   whatever we do pursuant to this mistake, is foolish in itself, and will
   be fatal in the issue and consequence of it.

   For he that takes it for granted that there is no God, and that the
   world is not governed by the providence of any superior being, but by
   chance; that his soul dies with his body, and that there is no life
   after this: he that proceeds upon these principles, is free from all
   fetters and obligations of conscience, and hath no reason to regard any
   rule of right and justice, of virtue and goodness, farther than they
   conduce to his own ease and pleasure, his convenience and safety in
   this world; he hath nothing to do, but to contrive his own present
   happiness, and to live as long as he can; and because he knows he must
   die, to compose himself to undergo it as contentedly, and to bear the
   pain of it as cheerfully and patiently, and to act this last part as
   decently, as he can, being secured by his own principles against all
   future misery and danger, because death makes an utter end of him.

   This is a very consistent theory, and hath but one fault--that it is
   not true at the bottom, and will fail us when we come to lay our whole
   weight upon it. It is just as the prophet describes "the staff of the
   broken reed of Egypt, whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand
   and pierce it." Such are the principles of infidelity, to all that
   trust in them; when they should stand us in most stead, and when we
   come to lean hard upon them, they will not only fail us, but go into
   our very heart, and pierce it with sharp pain and anguish. In the days
   of our health and prosperity, the spirit of a man may bear up itself by
   its own natural force and strength; and false principles are like
   antics in a building, which seem to crouch under the weight of an arch,
   as if they bore it up, when in truth they are borne up by it. But when
   these men fall into any great calamity, or death makes towards them in
   good earnest, then is the trial of these principles, of what strength
   they are, and what weight they will bear; and we commonly see, that
   they do not only fail those who trust in them, but they vanish and
   disappear like dreams and mere illusions of the imagination, when a man
   awakes out of sleep; and the man that was borne up by them before with
   so much confidence, can now feel no substance and reality in them; he
   cannot now be an atheist if he would; but God, and the other world,
   begin to be as great realities to him, as if they were present to his
   bodily eye. And now the principles of infidelity are so far from
   ministering any comfort and good hopes to him, that they fill him with
   horror, and anguish, and despair; and are so far from quieting his
   mind, that there is nothing but storm and tempest there. "The wicked is
   driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his
   death." "The wicked;" that is, the sinner, the hardened and impenitent
   sinner is driven away; which may either signify the sudden and violent
   end many times of bad men, they are carried away as it were by a
   tempest, answerable to that expression, (Prov. x. 25.) "As the
   whirlwind passeth, so the wicked is no more:" or else the word may
   signify, to be cast down and dejected; and then it imports that trouble
   and despondency of mind, that anguish and despair, which ariseth from
   the guilt of a wicked life. "Is driven away in his wickedness;" the
   word in the original is, "in his evil," which may either refer to the
   evil of sin, or of affliction and calamity, and it will come much to
   one in which sense we take it. According to the first sense of the word
   evil, the meaning will be, that the sinner, when he comes to die, is in
   great trouble and despondency of mind, because of his wicked life; hath
   no comfort, no good hopes concerning his future state, according to
   that other saying of Solomon, (Prov. xi. 23.) "The expectation of the
   wicked is wrath." If we take the word evil in the latter sense, for the
   evil of affliction and calamity, then the meaning is, that bad men,
   when they fall into any great evil and calamity, more especially upon
   the approach of death, (for that, as the last and greatest of evils, is
   probably intended, as appears by the opposition in the next words, "the
   righteous hath hope in his death;") I say, that bad men, when they fall
   into any great evil or calamity, especially upon the approach of death,
   are full of trouble and disquiet, by reason of their guilt, and
   destitute of all comfort and hope in that needful time. And this is
   most agreeable to the opposite part of this proverb or sentence, "but
   the righteous hath hope in his death;" that is, the good man, when any
   evil and calamity overtakes him, though it be the most terrible of all,
   death itself, is full of peace, and comfort, and good hopes; when there
   is nothing but storms without, all is calm within, he hath some thing
   which still supports him and bears him up.

   So that Solomon, in this sentence or proverb, seems to design to
   recommend religion and virtue to us, from the consideration of the
   different ends of good and bad men, so obvious to common observation,
   and generally speaking, and for the most part, which (as I have often
   observed) is all the truth that is to be expected in moral and
   proverbial speeches; that, for the most part, the end of good men is
   full of peace and comfort, and good hopes of their future condition:
   but the end of bad men quite contrary, full of anguish and trouble, of
   horror and despair, without peace or comfort, or hope of any good to
   befal them afterwards. The righteous man hath great peace and serenity
   in his mind at that time; is not only contented, but glad to die; does
   not only submit and yield to it, but desires it, as much better. And so
   some read the words, "the righteous desires," or "hopes to die:" but
   the wicked man and the sinner dreads the thoughts and approaches of
   death, quits life with great reluctancy, clings to it, and hangs upon
   it as long as he can, and is not without great violence parted from it.
   The good man goes out of the world willingly and contentedly: but the
   wicked is driven away, not without great force and constraint, with
   much reluctancy, and in great trouble and perplexity of mind, what will
   become of him for ever.

   You see the meaning of the words; that they contain a great truth, and
   very well worthy of our most attentive regard and consideration;
   because, if this be generally, and for the most part, true, which
   Solomon here asserts, then this is a mighty testimony on the behalf of
   piety and virtue; and plainly shews, that the principles of religion
   and virtue are proof against all assaults to which human nature is
   liable, and that the principles of infidelity and vice do shrink and
   give back when it comes to the trial. And this, to any wise and
   considerate man, is as good as a demonstration, that the religious man
   is in the right, and proceeds upon principles of sound and true wisdom,
   and hath chosen the better part: but that the infidel and the wicked
   man is in the wrong, and under a fatal mistake, which he seldom?
   discerns till it be too late to rectify it.

   Now in the handling of this argument, I shall do these three things:

   First, I shall shew that this observation of Solomon, concerning the
   different end of good and bad men, and the final issue and event of a
   virtuous and vitious course of life, is generally true, and that the
   exceptions, on either side, to the contrary, are but few, and not of
   force to infringe the truth of the observation.

   Secondly, I shall consider whence this difference proceeds, and I shall
   endeavour to shew that it is founded in the true nature and reason of
   things. And,

   Thirdly, That if this be true, it is a demonstration on the side of
   religion, and does fully justify the wisdom of it.

   First, I shall endeavour to shew, that this observation of Solomon,
   concerning the different end of good and bad men, and the final issue
   and event of a virtuous and vitious course of life, is generally found
   true, and that the exceptions, on either side, to the contrary, are but
   few in comparison, and by no means of sufficient force to infringe the
   general truth of this observation; I say, that this observation of the
   wise man is generally, and for the most part true, which (as I
   mentioned before) is all the truth that is to be expected in moral and
   proverbial sentences. And for this I appeal to the common and daily
   experience of mankind, whether we do not generally see religious and
   good men to have great ease and comfort, and sometimes great joy and
   transport in their minds, from the reflection, upon an innocent and
   useful, a holy and virtuous course of life. David was so confident of
   this, that he appeals to common observation and experience for the
   truth of it: (Psal. xxxvii. 37.) "Mark the perfect man, and behold the
   upright; for the end of that man is peace." Or, as this text is
   rendered in our old translation, "Keep innocency, take heed to the
   thing that is right; for that shall bring a man peace at the last." And
   he gives the reason of this, (ver. 39.) because God stands by them to
   support them in this needful time, with the comfortable hopes of his
   salvation; "the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord, he is their
   help in the time of trouble." As they have sincerely endeavoured to
   serve God, so they have great hopes and confidence of his mercy and
   goodness to them, that he will stand by them, and support them in their
   greatest distress, and guide and conduct them to happiness at the last;
   and in this confidence they can say with David: (Psal. xvi. 8, 9, 11.)
   "I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand,
   I shall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory
   rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope." For "thou wilt shew me
   the path of life; in thy presence is fulness of joy, at thy right hand
   there are pleasures for evermore." And (Psal. xxxi. 5.) "Into thy hand
   I commit my spirit, O Lord God of truth." And (Psal. xlviii. 14.) "This
   God is our God for ever and ever, he will be our guide even unto
   death." And again, (Psal. lxxiii. 23-26.) "Nevertheless, I am
   continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou shalt
   guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. Whom have
   I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire
   besides thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of
   my heart, and my portion for ever." Thus a good man, not only in the
   contemplation of death, and upon the approach of it, but even under the
   very pangs of it, is apt to comfort himself, in the Divine mercy and
   goodness, and to rejoice in the hopes of the glory of God.

   But the wicked, on the contrary, when death makes its approach towards
   them, the guilt of their wicked lives flies in their faces, and
   disturbs their minds, and fills them with horror and amazement, with "a
   fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation to consume
   them." "The expectation of the wicked is wrath," saith Solomon, (Prov.
   xi. 23.) "What is the hope of the hypocrite (that is, of the wicked
   man), when God shall take away his soul?" (Job xxvii. 8.) In their
   life-time they neglected God and religion, and perhaps denied him, or
   said unto him with those in the 21st chapter, ver. 14. "Depart from us,
   for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways;" and when they come to
   die, they find that God is departed from them. They have not the
   confidence to look up to him, or to expect any mercy or favour from
   him, being conscious to themselves that they have denied the God which
   is above, or at least neglected and despised him; and now "the terrors
   of the Almighty take hold of them, and his arrows stick fast in them,"
   and wound their consciences, and they cannot pluck them out, or get rid
   of them; their spirits are ready to sink with in them, and the
   principles of infidelity which they once relied upon now fail them;
   and, instead of ministering any comfort and confidence to them, they
   pierce them to the heart, and are the greatest ground of their trouble
   and despair.

   So that here is a very visible and remarkable difference between good
   and bad men when they come to die. Good men have commonly a great calm
   and serenity in their minds, are full of good hopes of the mercy and
   favour of God to them, and of the sense of "his loving-kindness, which
   is better than life itself;" and are willing to leave this world, in
   the comfortable expectation and assurance of a better condition after
   death; and not only willing, but many times heartily glad, that they
   are going out of this vale of tears, out of this sink of sin and
   sorrows; that they are quitting these drooping mansions, and exchanging
   these earthly tabernacles, for "a building of God, a house not made
   with hands, eternal in the heavens:" whereas the wicked is full of
   trouble and anguish, and his mind in greater pain and disorder than his
   body; all storm and tempest, "like the troubled sea, when it cannot
   rest:" "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked." And how can
   there be peace, when his whoredoms and adulteries, his repeated acts of
   drunkenness and in temperance, his profane oaths and blasphemies, have
   been so many? When he is conscious to himself what a life he hath led,
   and is thoroughly awakened to a just sense of the evil of his doings?
   And when death makes up to him, how does he dread the sight and
   thoughts of it, and how does he hanker after life, as if all his
   happiness depended upon it and ended with it? And at last, like the
   young man in the gospel, he goes away sorrowful; because, perhaps, he
   had great possessions in this world, and hath no hopes at all in the
   other. "This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
   appointed to him by God."

   There are, I confess, some exceptions to the contrary on both sides;
   but they are but few in comparison, and by no means sufficient to
   infringe the general truth of this observation.

   On the one hand, some good men are very melancholy and dispirited, when
   they come to die, and leave the world full of fears and jealousies
   concerning their future condition; and this may proceed from several
   causes. Perhaps they are naturally of a dark and melancholy temper,
   which is usually heightened and increased by bodily weakness and
   distemper; and in this case it is no wonder, if the considerations of
   religion be not sufficient to scatter these clouds, and to overrule and
   correct the irregularities of our bodily temper; because the principles
   and considerations of religion do not work naturally and by way of
   physic, but morally and by way of conviction and counsel. Sometimes
   this fear and dejection of mind in good men, proceeds from mere lowness
   and faintness of spirit, naturally caused by the load and continuance
   of the distemper which they labour under, and by which the mind is
   likewise, in some degree, weakened and broken; and when this happens,
   it is usually very visible, and consequently the account of it easy and
   obvious; and sometimes, perhaps, we are charitably mistaken in our good
   man, and either he is not a sincerely good man, or not so good as we
   took him to be; perhaps his life hath been very unequal, and full of
   great failings: and, in either case, it is no wonder if the man have
   not that peace and comfort, which is answerable to our good opinion of
   him; if the man be not sincerely good, there is no real foundation of
   peace and comfort; for "the hope of the hypocrite shall perish: whose
   hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be as a spider's web. He
   shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold it
   fast, but it shall not endure," as one of Job's friends speaks: (Job
   viii. 14, 15.) And (ver. 20.) "Behold, God will not cast away a perfect
   (or sincere) man; neither will he help (or support) the evil doers."
   Or, though he have been in the main a good man, yet perhaps with a
   great mixture of imperfection, and many great failings and neglects;
   and then it is no wonder, if his mind be not so cairn, and clear of
   doubts and jealousies concerning his condition: for proportionably to
   the breaches and inequalities of our obedience, and our more and
   greater failings, will our peace and comfort, living and dying, be
   naturally abated and interrupted. But these cases are not many; it is
   sufficient that it is generally other wise with good men, and that
   their end is peace. And this is so remarkable, that Balaam, when he was
   reckoning up the blessings and privileges of the people of Israel, the
   type of good men in all ages, he takes particular notice of their happy
   end, as a most signal and invaluable blessing; which made him break out
   into that wish, (Numb. xxiii. 10.) "Let me die the death of the
   righteous, and let my last end be like his."

   And, on the other hand, it cannot be denied, but that some very bad men
   (as bad as we can well imagine) have passed out of this world, not only
   quiet and? undisturbed, but with a great deal of courage and
   resolution. And this I believe in fact and experience, at least
   according to my best observation, is the more rare case of the two; for
   a notorious bad man to die in perfect peace, than for a good man to die
   in great trouble and perplexity of mind. But this, when it happens, may
   probably enough be ascribed to one or more of these causes--either to
   the mistake of the by-standers, who take silence for peace; and because
   the man is of a strong resolution, and hath a good command of himself,
   and does not think fit to trouble others, in a mutter in which he
   thinks they can give him no comfort and relief, they interpret this to
   be tranquillity of mind; because he holds his peace and says nothing,
   they think he hath peace, and that all is quiet within. But I remember
   the observation of a very wise historian, Phil. Comines, who says, that
   he knew in his time several great persons, who, in ordinary
   conversation, and to a superficial view, seemed to be very happy and
   contented; but yet to them who knew them more intimately, and in their
   private freedoms and recesses, were the most miserable and discontented
   persons in the world. This I confess is very rare, for men to conceal a
   very great trouble, and more yet for a man to dissemble when dying; and
   yet there is reason to believe it sometimes happen.

   Sometimes, the quiet death of a very bad man proceeds from stupidity,
   and want of a just sense of the danger of his condition, and this from
   want of discipline and instruction in the nature and principles of
   religion: this temper looks like courage, because it is fearless of
   danger; but this fearlessness is founded in great ignorance and want of
   apprehension; whereas a true courage discerns the danger, and yet
   thinks it fit and reasonable to venture upon it. Now this stupidity of
   dying men, who have lived very ill, is commonly the case of such as
   have been brought up in great ignorance, and have lived in great
   sensuality, by which means their spirits are immersed, and even stifled
   in carnality and sense; and no wonder, if they who live like beasts,
   die after the same manner. And thus our Saviour represents the rich
   glutton in the parable, as never coming to himself, and a sense of his
   condition, till he was awakened by the flames of hell; (Luke xvi. 22,
   23.) "The rich man also died, and Was buried; and in hell he lifted up
   his eyes, being in torment." As if he had never been awakened till
   then, his voluptuous and sensual course of life rendering him
   insensible of another world.

   Or else this false peace may be ascribed to the delusion of false
   principles, by virtue whereof it is often seen, that men die in a very
   bad cause, not only without any regret and trouble, but with
   cheerfulness and satisfaction: and this is not to be wondered at,
   because every man's conscience is a kind of god to him; and whether a
   man be in the right or wrong, so long as he thinks he does well, "and
   his heart condemns him not/ he is apt "to have confidence towards God;"
   but for all that it greatly concerns every man to take great care to in
   form his conscience. For if men will not be impartial in their inquiry
   after truth, and be not ready "to receive it in the love of it," St.
   Paul tells us, "that for this very cause, God may send them strong
   delusions, that they should believe a lie, and that they might be
   damned, because they believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
   unrighteousness;" (2 Thess. ii. 11, 12.) that is, in falsehood and
   imposture: for so the word adiki'a, which is here rendered
   "unrighteousness," is sometimes used in the New Testament.

   And this is the last cause I shall mention, to which the false peace of
   wicked men when they come to die, is to be ascribed, viz. to the just
   judgment of God, who permits great sinners to be so hardened in an evil
   course, as neither living nor dying to be awakened to a sense of their
   condition; such as the apostle speaks of, (1 Tim. iv. 2.) who said to
   have "their consciences seared, as it were, with a hot iron." This, it
   is to be hoped, is but the case of a few, that are thus utterly
   forsaken of God, and left to perish in their own hardness and
   obstinacy. This is like a gangrene in the body, which mortifies the
   part, and leaves it without sense, and thereby incapable of recovery. I
   proceed, in the

   Second place, to shew whence this difference between good and bad men,
   when they come to die, does proceed. And here I shall endeavour to
   shew, that this difference is founded in the true nature and reason of
   the things themselves; in the nature of religion and virtue, and of
   impiety and vice, in the different ways and courses of good and bad
   men, which do naturally tend to these different ends.

   And to make out this more clearly and distinctly, I shall endeavour to
   manifest these two things:

   I. That a religious and virtuous life is a real ground of peace and
   serenity of mind, of comfort and joy, under all the evils and
   calamities of life, and especially at the hour of death.

   II. That impiety and wickedness is a real foundation of guilt and fear,
   of horror and despair, in the day of adversity and affliction, and more
   especially in the approaches of death.

   I. That a religious and virtuous life is a real ground of peace and
   serenity of mind, of comfort and joy, under all the evils and
   calamities of life, and especially at the hour of death.

   Under the evils and calamities of life, innocency is a great stay and
   support to our minds under sufferings, and will bear up our spirits
   when nothing else can; especially if a man suffer for a good
   conscience, "and for righteousness sake;" because then, beside the
   comfort of innocency, we are entitled in a special manner to the favour
   of God, and the comforts of his Holy Spirit, and the hopes of a
   glorious reward from that God, for whose sake and in whose cause we
   suffer. All trouble is tolerable to him who hath no burden of guilt
   upon his mind, to him who is at peace with his own conscience, and at
   peace with God, and is assured of his favour and friendship, of his
   providence and care, of his approbation and reward; this is a firm
   ground, not only of patience, but of joy to a good man, in the saddest
   and most dismal condition he can fall into. "Unto the upright (saith
   the Psalmist) there ariseth light in darkness," (Psal. cxii. 4.) And no
   wonder, because he that fears God, and serves him faith fully, and
   suffers for him patiently, hath laid a sure foundation of comfort to
   himself, hath sown the seeds of contentment and peace, of joy and
   gladness in his own mind, which will spring up and flourish most, when
   we are in the most destitute and afflicted condition: "Light is sown
   for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart," says David,
   (Psal. xcvii. 11.) "The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the
   effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever," saith the
   prophet, (Isa. xxxii. 17.)

   And more especially at the hour of death, then the comfort of a good
   man overflows, and "he lifts up his head with joy, because his
   redemption draweth nigh:" then the reflection upon a well-spent and
   unspotted life fills his soul with abundant consolation, with "joy
   unspeakable and full of glory:" for God, and the things of another
   world, appear more real and substantial to him, as he draws near to
   them, and his faith begins to be turned into sight and fruition; he now
   stands upon the confines of both worlds, and discerns more clearly the
   vanity and emptiness of that which he is going from, and the
   substantial and durable happiness of that which he is entering into.
   Here is the trial of our faith, and the proof of religion, by the real
   fruits and effects of it, in the peace and comfort which it gives to a
   good man, when he is leaving this world; so that, "when he walks
   through the valley of death, he fears no ill," and his hopes are then
   most lively and vigorous, when he is ready to give up the ghost; the
   voice of nature, and of every man's reason and conscience, as well as
   Scripture, says to the righteous, "it shall be well with him, for he
   shall eat the fruit of his doings; but woe unto the wicked, it shall be
   ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him." Which
   brings me to the

   II. Second thing; namely, That impiety and wickedness is a real
   foundation of guilt and fear, of honor and despair, in the day of
   adversity and affliction, and especially in the approaches of death.

   And how can it be otherwise, when all inward support and comfort fail
   him, and all sorts of evil and calamity, inward and outward, assault
   him, and break in upon him at once? When the principles of infidelity
   fail him, and what he hath made out so speciously to himself, vanisheth
   into nothing, "as a dream when one awakens, and as a vision in the
   night?" For when any great calamity befals this man, God, who was not
   before in all his thoughts, then begins to appear terrible to him, and
   he cannot banish, the thoughts and fear of him out of his mind. But how
   uncomfortable is this--to be convinced there is a God, when a man hath
   most need of him, and can least hope for his favour and pity?

   But especially at the approach of death, what a sad preparation for
   that is an impious and wicked life! how does his conscience then fly in
   his face, and how bitter is the remembrance of those sins which he
   committed with so much pleasure and greediness? What a terror is the
   Almighty to him, and the apprehension of that vengeance that threatens
   him, and that eternal misery which is ready to swallow him up? And in
   the midst of all this anguish and horror, which naturally spring from
   an evil conscience, and the guilt of a wicked life, he is destitute of
   all comfort and hope; he hath denied the God that is above, and now he
   dares not look up to him: his whole life hath been a continued affront
   to the Divine Majesty and an insolent defiance of his justice; and what
   hopes can he now reasonably have of his mercy? "Of the God that formed
   him, he hath been unmindful," and hath used him with all the despite he
   could; and, there fore, he hath all the reason in the world to conclude
   that "he that made him will not save him, and he that formed him will
   have no mercy on him." And this is the natural consequence of impiety
   and wickedness, it fills the soul of a dying sinner with trouble and
   anguish, with guilt and despair, when he is leaving the world, and puts
   him into the most dismal condition that can be imagined on this side
   hell, and very like to it, without comfort and without hope. I proceed
   to the

   Third and last thing I proposed; viz. That if this be true, it is a
   demonstration on the side of religion, and doth fully justify and
   acquit the wisdom of it; and that upon these three accounts:

   I. Because the principles of religion, and the practice of them in a
   virtuous life, when they come to the last and utmost trial, do hold
   out, and are a firm and unshaken foundation of peace and comfort to us.

   II. That they minister comfort to us in the most needful and desirable
   time.

   III. That when men are commonly more serious, and sober, and impartial,
   and when their declarations and words are thought to be of greatest
   weight and credit, they give this testimony to religion and virtue, and
   against impiety and vice.

   I. That the principles of religion, and the practice of them in a
   virtuous life, when they come to the last and utmost trial, do hold
   out, and are a firm and unshaken foundation of peace and comfort to
   good men, at that time. The belief of a God, and of his providence and
   care of good men, and that "he is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek him;" the persuasion of our own immortality, and of the eternal
   recompence of another world; that "Jesus Christ came into the world to
   save sinners," and to purchase eternal life and happiness for those
   who, "by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honour,
   and immortality:" I say, the belief of these things is commonly most
   strong and vigorous in the minds of good men when they come to die; and
   they have then a more clear apprehension, and firm persuasion of the
   truth and reality of these things, than ever they had in any time of
   their lives, and find more comfort from them, more peace and joy in the
   belief of them. And this is the great time of trial, when death
   presents itself to us, and the terrors of it compass us about, whether
   upon occasion of persecution or sickness. These are the rains, and
   storms, and winds, which will try upon what foundation our peace and
   comfort is built; and nothing but the principles of religion, sincerely
   believed and practised, will make us firm and impregnable against these
   assaults. So our Saviour assures us: (Matt. vii. 24, 25.) "Whosoever
   heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them," that is, believes and
   practiseth my doctrine, "I will liken him to a wise man, which built
   his house upon a rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and
   the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was
   founded upon a rock."

   And, on the contrary, the principles of infidelity and vice are most
   apt to shrink and give back at such a time: nay, for the most part,
   they vanish and disappear, and, upon the apprehension of death, a new
   light, as it were, springs up in their minds, and things appear quite
   contrary to that scheme which they had formed, and which they had taken
   so much pains to maintain and make probable to themselves; and that
   hypothesis which they had been so long a-building, appears now to have
   no foundation, and falls at once, and all their hopes together with it.
   And now the infidel believes and trembles, is sensible of his wicked
   life, and of the vengeance that hangs over him, and was never in his
   life half so well satisfied of the principles of infidelity, as he is
   now convinced of the contrary, to his infinite trouble and confusion
   that there is a God, and another life after this, and a terrible
   punishment to the workers of iniquity.

   And daily experience confirms to us the certainty and truth of this
   matter, and that there is this difference, for the most part, very
   visible in the temper and carriage of good and bad men when they come
   to die.

   II. The principles of religion and virtue do minister comfort to us in
   the most needful and desirable times; and, on the contrary, the
   principles of infidelity and vice do not only fail us in the day of
   distress, but give great trouble to us at the most un seasonable time.

   And this makes a mighty difference between the condition of these two
   sorts of persons: for when would a man desire to be at peace and quiet
   in his mind, but when his body is restless and in pain? When would a
   man wish for "strong consolation and hope," that "anchor of the soul
   sure and steadfast," as the apostle to the Hebrews calls it, but in
   that last and terrible conflict of nature, with the last of enemies,
   which is death? And when would a man dread trouble and anguish of mind,
   but at such a time, when he is hardly able to sustain his bodily pains
   and infirmities? If it be true of every day of our lives, "sufficient
   for the day is the evil thereof," much more of the day of death: it is
   enough surely to have that one enemy to encounter, at which nature
   startles, and our best reason can hardly furnish us with force enough
   for the conflict, even when the sting of death is taken away--I mean
   the guilt of an evil conscience: but when all evils assail a man at
   once, pains without, and terrors within, a weak body, and a wounded
   spirit, an in curable disease, and intolerable despair, death ready to
   assault us, and hell following it; how unseasonable is the conjuncture
   of so many and so great evils! Wise men are wont to provide with great
   care against such a time, that they may not be op pressed with too many
   troubles at once; and, there fore, in the time of their health, they
   settle their worldly concernments, and make their wills, that when
   sickness or death comes, they may have no care upon them, nothing to do
   but to die. This is a time, when all the force of our reason, and all
   the comfort and hope that religion can give, will be little enough to
   give us a quiet and undisturbed passage out of this world into the
   other: and we shall be very miserable, if the terrors and stings of a
   guilty conscience, and the pangs of death, do seize upon us at once.
   And therefore a wise man would make it the business of his whole life,
   to prevent this unhappy concurrence of evils, so insupportable to human
   nature; and to render death, which is grievous and terrible enough of
   itself, as comfortable and easy as it is possible. For if there were
   nothing beyond this life, yet it were worth the while to provide for a
   quiet death; and if men were sure to be possessed of these passions of
   hope and fear, of comfort and despair, which usually attend good and
   bad men when they come to die, there is no man, that calculates things
   wisely, would, for all the pleasures of sin, forfeit the peace and
   comfort of a righteous soul, going out of the world full of the hopes
   of a blessed immortality, and endure the anguish and torment of a
   guilty conscience, and the amazing terrors of a despairing and dying
   sinner. This is a condition so sad and fearful, that a wise man would
   avoid it upon any terms.

   III. When men are commonly more serious, and sober, and impartial, and
   their declarations and words are thought to be of greatest weight and
   credit, they give this testimony to religion and virtue, and against
   impiety and vice.

   It is generally seen, when men come to die, that the manner of their
   death is answerable to the course of their life; that the reflection
   upon a holy and virtuous life, is a great ease and comfort to men's
   minds: and, on the contrary, the guilt of a wicked life is apt to fly
   in their faces, and to disturb their minds, and fill them with horror.
   And this is a critical time, when the consciences of men are usually
   awake, and apt to pass an impartial judgment and censure upon
   themselves. And for this, the infidel may believe one of his own great
   authors, I mean Lucretius, who observes, that when men are in distress,
   and the apprehensions of death are upon them, religion does then shew
   its force:

   Acrius advertunt animos ad religionem,

   "The thoughts of it are then more pungent and powerful upon their
   minds."


   Nam veræ voces turn demum pectore ab imo

   Eliciuntur, et eripitur persona, manet res:

   "Men's words then come from the bottom of their hearts, the mask is
   taken off, and things then appear to them as indeed they are."

   Now, that when men are so impartial and in good earnest, when they
   stand upon the confines of both worlds, and can view them at once, when
   they are leaving this world, and are now no longer in danger of being
   blinded or flattered, or tempted by it, and are just ready to pass into
   the other world, and so much the more likely to discern the reality of
   it, as they approach nearer to it: I say, that, in these circumstances,
   men generally declare on the side of piety and virtue, and declaim most
   vehemently against their sins and vices; that, generally speaking, and
   according to what is commonly seen in experience, the man who hath led
   a religions and virtuous life, is, when he comes to die, quiet and easy
   to himself, hath no regret at what he hath done, no severe and angry
   reflections upon the strict course of a virtuous life, his conscience
   doth not accuse, or upbraid, or terrify him, for having lived "soberly,
   and righteously, and godly in this world;" nay, so far from this, that
   if he have any trouble, it is not because he hath lived piously and
   virtuously, but because he hath not lived more so, because he hath come
   short of his duty, and hath been so imperfectly and inconstantly good:
   that generally dying men repent of their evil actions, and are troubled
   for them; but no man ever repented himself of serving God, and doing
   good. This surely is a great testimony on the side of religion and
   virtue, because it is the testimony, not only of the friends to
   religion, but of those who have been the greatest enemies to it, and at
   a time when they are most likely to declare the inward sense of their
   minds, and to speak most impartially, without design or disguise. When
   the ungodly man and the sinner comes to lie upon a death-bed, he hath
   then other apprehensions of things than he had, or would own to have,
   in the days of his health and prosperity, and his soul is full of
   sadness and trouble, of perplexity and anguish, of fear and despair,
   because of the wicked and lewd life which he hath led. But why art thou
   so dismayed, man? why so troubled and cast down, so restless and
   unquiet, so wretched and miserable in thine own thoughts?

   If thou hast not done well in renouncing the principles of religion,
   and breaking loose from all obligations of duty and conscience, in
   gratifying thine inclinations and lusts, why art thou now troubled at
   it? If thou wert in the right all the while, why dost thou not now
   stand to it, and justify thy actings, and bear up like a man? If the
   principles thou wentest upon were sound and firm, why dost thou not
   still take comfort and support from them? why does thy heart faint, and
   thy spirit sink within thee? how comes thy imagination to be so
   disturbed with such frightful appearances, and to haunt thee
   continually with such vain and groundless terrors? whence is it that
   those who have taken a contrary course, and lived a quite different
   life, have so much the advantage of thee, in the comfort, and peace,
   and tranquillity of their minds when they come to die?

   But if thou hast been in the wrong, and dost now discern real cause for
   so much trouble and fear, why didst thou not consider in time? why wast
   thou not troubled sooner, when trouble would have done thee good, and a
   great part of the anguish which thou now feelest, and all the misery
   thou art so afraid of, might effectually have been prevented?

   I think it is said, by those who are concerned to take off the force of
   this terrible objection against infidelity and a wicked life, that when
   men are in a dying condition their spirits are low, and their
   understandings weak and disturbed, and their minds thrown off the
   hinges; and therefore it is no wonder if they want that firmness and
   resolution of spirit, that consideration and courage, which they had in
   the time of their health.

   This is speciously said, and with some show and appearance of reason:
   but it does by no means answer and take off the objection. For if this
   were a true reason at the bottom, why is it not true on both sides? why
   are not both sorts of men, when they are sick and near to die, those
   who have lived piously and virtuously, as well as the loose and wicked
   livers, equally troubled? why are they not disturbed and afraid alike?
   hath not sickness the same natural effect upon them, and does it not
   equally weaken and disorder their minds? but we see generally in
   experience a plain and remarkable difference between these two sorts of
   men, when they come to die; so plain, that it is not to be denied; and
   so remarkable, that there must be some considerable cause of it; and so
   general and constant, that it cannot without great folly and
   perverseness be imputed to chance. Now what can we imagine should be
   the reason of this palpable difference between good and bad men, when
   they are under the apprehensions of death, but this: that a pious and
   virtuous life is a real ground of peace and joy, of comfort and
   confidence at that time; and that impiety and wickedness are a real
   foundation of guilt and fear, of horror and despair, in a dying hour:
   in a word, that the different ways and courses of good and bad men, do
   naturally lead to these different ends, and produce these different
   effects?

   Either this must be granted, and then the whole cause of infidelity and
   vice is yielded and given up at once; or .else men must fly to that
   which seems the most unreasonable and extravagant paradox in the world,
   and does effectually give up the cause another way; viz. That a false
   opinion of things, and a mere delusion, is more apt to support the
   fainting spirits of a dying man, and to give him more comfort and hope
   in the day of distress, than aright and well-grounded persuasion.

   But this (as I said before) does effectually give up the cause another
   way: for if this be true, then certainly they are rightest that are in
   the wrong; and religion, though it were a mistake, ought to be embraced
   and entertained by a wise man, because of this great benefit and
   comfort of it. If this be truly the case, then every wise man must say,
   Let me be so deceived; let it be my lot and portion, to live and die in
   so pleasant, and comfortable, and happy an error, as that of religion
   is.

   So that, whether religion be true or false, it must, according to this
   reasoning, be necessarily granted to be the only wise principle, and
   safe hypothesis for a man to live and die by. And this very thing, that
   it is so, is a strong evidence of the truth of religion, and even a
   demonstration of the real excellency of virtue; because no other
   supposition but that of religion, does so clearly solve all
   appearances, and so fully and exactly answer the natural desires, and
   hopes, and fears of mankind. If the being of God, and the obligations
   of religion and virtue, be admitted, this gives an easy account of the
   whole matter, and shews us, that sin and vice are the foundation of
   guilt and trouble; and that religion and virtue do naturally produce
   peace and comfort: for that is to be esteemed and reckoned the natural
   effect of any thing, which doth generally belong to the whole kind. If
   those who live religiously and virtuously, have generally peace and
   comfort when they come to die, and those who live wickedly are commonly
   full of guilt and remorse, of fear and perplexity, at that time; this
   is reason enough to believe, that these are the natural effects of
   those causes: and that men when they come to die, are, according as
   they have lived, afraid of the Divine justice, and of the vengeance of
   another world, or confident of God's goodness, and the rewards of
   another life, is a strong argument of a superior Being that governs the
   world, and will reward men according to their works; because no
   supposition but this doth answer the natural hopes and fears of men.
   And this likewise is an argument of the immortality of our souls, and
   of the rewards and punishments of another life; and as good a
   demonstration of the reality and excellency of religion and virtue,
   from these happy effects of it, as the nature of the thing is capable
   of.

   And now to make some reflections upon what has been said upon this
   argument.

   First, The consideration of the different ends of good and bad men, is
   a mighty encouragement to piety and a good life. Nothing in this world
   shews us so remarkable a difference between the righteous and the
   wicked, as a death-bed. Then a good man most sensibly enjoys the
   comfort of a good life, and "the peaceable fruits of righteousness;"
   and the sinner then begins to reap the bitter fruits of sin. What a
   difference is there then between the comfort and trouble, the composure
   and disturbance, the hopes and fears, of these two persons? And, next
   to the actual possession of blessedness, the comfortable hopes and
   expectation of it are the greatest happiness; and the next to being
   plunged into it, the fearful apprehensions of eternal misery are the
   greatest torment. "The wicked is driven away in his wickedness;" is
   violently hurried out of the world full of guilt and trouble. What
   storms and tempests are then raised in his mind, from the fear of God's
   justice, and the despair of his mercy? But "the righteous hath hope in
   his death." The reflection upon a holy and virtuous life, and the
   conscience of a man's uprightness and sincerity, are a spring of joy
   and peace to him, which refresheth his mind with unspeakable comfort
   and pleasure, under the very pangs of death. With what triumph and
   exultation of spirit cloth the blessed apostle St. Paul, upon the
   review of his labours and sufferings for God and his truth, speak of
   his dissolution? (2 Tim. iv. 6-8.) "For I am now ready to be offered
   up, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good
   fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth
   there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
   righteous Judge, shall give me at that day." He speaks with such a
   lively sense of it, as if he had his crown in his view, and were just
   ready to take hold of it. And what would not a man give, what would he
   not be contented to do and suffer to be thus affected, when he comes to
   leave the world, and to be able to bear the thoughts of his death and
   dissolution with so composed and cheerful a mind? And yet this is the
   natural and genuine effect of a holy and useful life. And that which
   the same apostle tells us was the ground of his rejoicing under
   sufferings, is likewise the comfort and support of good men at the time
   of their death: (2 Cor. i. 12.) "Our rejoicing (saith he) is this: the
   testimony of our conscience, that, in simplicity and godly sincerity,
   we have had our conversation in the world." Ail the holy and virtuous
   actions of our lives, are so many seeds of peace and comfort to us at
   the hour of our death, which we shall more sensibly enjoy when we come
   to depart this life. For then the consciences of men are apt to deal
   most freely and impartially with them: and "if our hearts do not then
   condemn us, we may have comfort and confidence towards God."

   I believe there are some very pious and good souls, who have lived very
   disconsolate and full of doubtings, and been under a cloud the greatest
   part of their lives, who yet, upon the approach of death, and just as
   they were leaving the world, have broken forth, as the sun sometimes
   doth just before his setting. I know it is not always thus; there are,
   I doubt not, some good men who go out of this world with little or no
   comfort; and yet, so soon as they step into another world, are
   encompassed with "joy unspeakable rind full of glory:" and though the
   comfort of such persons be not so early and forward, yet it cannot
   choose but be extremely welcome: and it must needs put a doubting and
   trembling soul into a strange kind of ecstasy and ravishment, to be
   thus unexpectedly surprised with happiness.

   Secondly, Since this is so great and evident a testimony of the truth
   and goodness of religion, is it not a strange thing, and to be wondered
   at, that true religion and virtue should be so little practised, and
   impiety and vice should so generally prevail in the world, against so
   many bars and obstacles, and against such invincible objections to the
   contrary? Not only against our inward judgment and conscience, but
   against the general sense and experience of men in all ages, the
   constant declarations and testimonies of dying men, both good and bad,
   when they are most serious, and their words are thought to be of
   greatest credit and weight; against the best and soberest reason of
   mankind, and their true interest and happiness; against the health of
   men's bodies, and, which is the most dear and valuable thing in the
   world, the peace and quiet of their minds; and that, not only in the
   time of life and health, but in the hour of death, when men stand most
   in need of comfort and support: in a word, against the grain of human
   nature, and in despite of men's natural fears of Divine vengeance, and
   to the defeating of all our hopes of a blessed immortality in another
   world, and against the inflexible nature and reason of things, by no
   art or endeavour of man, by no colours of wit, or subtilty of
   discourse, by no practice or custom to the contrary, by no conspiracy
   and combination of men, ever to be changed or altered? So that we may
   say with David, "Have all the workers of wickedness no knowledge," no
   consideration of themselves, no tenderness and regard to their present
   and future interest? Nay, if there were no life after this, setting
   aside the case of extreme suffering and persecution, religion and
   virtue are certainly to be chosen, not only for our contentment in
   life, but for our comfort in death: and if there be a state of
   happiness or misery remaining for men after death, as most assuredly
   there is, much more in order to the attaining of that endless
   happiness, and the avoiding of that eternal and in tolerable misery.
   "Oh that men were wise, that they understood this, and would consider
   their latter end!"

SERMON CLXXXVII.

  THE USEFULNESS OF CONSIDERING OUR LATTER END

   So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto
   wisdom.--Psalm xc. 12.

   THE title of this Psalm tells us who was the author of it. It is
   called, "A prayer of Moses, the man of God;" or, as the Chaldee
   paraphrase more expressly, "The prayer which Moses, the prophet of the
   Lord, prayed, when the people of the house of Israel sinned in the
   wilderness." Upon which provocation of theirs, God in great displeasure
   threatened, and was immutably resolved, that they should all perish in
   the wilderness, and that none of the men that came out of Egypt, Caleb
   and Joshua only excepted, should enter into the promised land, but
   should all die in the space of forty years.

   Upon this occasion, Moses made this psalm or prayer to God, being a
   devout meditation upon the shortness and frailty of human life, which
   was now brought into a much narrower compass than in former ages. But
   the case of that people was different from that of the rest of mankind,
   being limited and confined to forty years. They might die sooner than
   that time; but that was the utmost bound of their lives, which none
   were to exceed; which seems to be the ground and reason of the
   petition, which Moses puts up to God in the text, "So teach us," &c.

   For I do not think that Moses does here beg of God to reveal to every
   one of them the precise end and term of his life; that might seem to
   savour of too much presumption or curiosity: but since they knew that,
   according to the ordinary course of nature, the life of man was then
   reduced to threescore and ten, or fourscore years; and since God, by a
   peremptory sentence, had pronounced, that, two persons only excepted,
   all that vast number which came out of Egypt, and even Moses himself,
   should die within the compass of forty years; it was a very pious and
   proper request, which Moses here puts up for himself and the rest of
   that people, that God would give them wisdom to make a right use of the
   notice which they had of their end, since it might happen at any time,
   but could not reach beyond forty years, reckoning from the time of
   their coming out of Egypt.

   To know the determinate time of our life, or to know certainly that our
   life shall not exceed such a term (which was the case of the Israelites
   in the wilderness), is a very awakening thing, and does commonly rouse
   men more than the general consideration of our own frailty and
   mortality. And yet, to a wise and considerate man, it ought in reason
   to be the same; for that which will certainly be, ought to be reckoned
   upon and provided for; and if it be un certain when it will be, whether
   at some distance, or the next moment, we ought presently to take care
   about it, and to be always in a readiness for it, lest we should be
   surprised and overtaken.

   And then this prayer is as proper for us, as it was for Moses and the
   Israelites, though we are not just under the same circumstances that
   they were. They were under a peremptory sentence of death within forty
   years, and none of them knew how much sooner they might be taken away:
   and this is not much different from our case; for we are liable to
   death at any time, every day, every moment; and how few of us in this
   congregation can reasonably either hope or expect to have our lives
   prolonged beyond the term of forty years? Nay, it is very probable,
   that not one of us in a hundred will hold out so long. And then this
   prayer may be as fit for us, as it was for Moses and the Israelites,
   that God would "teach us so to number our days," that is, to make such
   an account of the shortness and uncertainty of our lives, and so to
   consider and lay to heart our latter end, "that we may apply our hearts
   unto wisdom;" that is, that we may manage and conduct this frail, and
   short, and uncertain life, in the best manner, and to the wisest
   purposes.

   And this consideration of our latter end was always esteemed by the
   wisest men, a principal part and main point of wisdom. Socrates, who
   was, by the general consent of wise men (a more infallible oracle than
   that of Apollo), esteemed the wisest of all the philosophers, gives us
   this definition of philosophy, that "it is the meditation or study of
   death;" to intimate to us, that this is true wisdom, to be much in the
   thoughts of our latter end, and in a constant readiness and preparation
   for it. And this a greater than Socrates had long before him observed
   to be a chief point of wisdom, I mean Moses, "the man of God," that
   Divine person and prince of the ancient prophets, not only in this
   Psalm, but also in his last Divine song, a little be fore his death; in
   which he makes this the sum of all his wishes for the people of Israel,
   that God would endow them with this high point of wisdom: (Deut. xxxii.
   29.) "Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
   would consider their latter end!" This is true wisdom and philosophy,
   to consider our latter end.

   And this, by God's assistance, shall be the argument which I intend to
   handle from these words; namely, to shew what influence and effect the
   serious consideration of our latter end, and of the shortness and
   uncertainty of this present life, ought in reason to have upon us. And
   of this I shall give you an account in these following particulars:

   I. The meditation of our latter end should make us to take into
   consideration our whole lives, and our whole duration, that we may
   resolve and act accordingly. And this is a main point of wisdom, to
   understand ourselves, and the nature of our beings, of what we consist,
   and for what duration we are designed; whether we consist only of
   matter a little better fashioned and moulded, and made up in a more
   curious and complicated engine, consisting of many secret and hidden
   springs and wheels, and fitted for greater variety of motions, and for
   more fine and subtle operations, than the bodies of those other
   creatures which we esteem below us: or whether we be endowed with a
   spiritual principle, wholly distinct from matter, and capable not only
   of sense, but of acts of reason, and of the impressions of religion,
   from the apprehension of a Deity and a superior Being that is of
   itself, and made us and all other things. In a word, whether we shall
   "die like beasts;" or whether there be an immortal spirit within us,
   which hath no dependance upon matter and the bodily and visible part of
   ourselves, but is a much "better and enduring substance," which hath no
   principle of corruption in itself, but shall survive these perishing
   bodies; and when they are mouldered into dust, shall subsist in a happy
   or miserable condition, according as we have behaved ourselves in this
   world.

   For these are two very different hypotheses and schemes of things, and
   ought to affect us very differently, and to inspire us with different
   resolutions, and to put us upon a quite contrary method and conduct of
   our lives.

   For, on the one hand, if we be well assured, that we shall be utterly
   extinguished by death, "like the beasts that perish," then we have
   nothing to take care of but our bodies, because we are nothing else;
   then we need not extend our thoughts, our hopes, or fears, beyond this
   world, and this present life; because we have nothing to do, but to
   please ourselves with present enjoyments, and to live so with other
   men, as may make most for our temporal quiet, and satisfaction, and
   security.

   But then we are to consider very well, whether these things be
   certainly so, and whether we may rely upon it, and whether it will bear
   all that weight which we lay upon it: whether these principles will not
   fail us when we come most to stand in need of the comfort and support
   of them, and, when death is in view, and making up towards us, quite
   vanish and disappear: because it is of infinite consequence to us to be
   well assured of this, since our happiness or misery to all eternity
   depends upon it. And therefore nothing less than a demonstration of the
   impossibility of the thing, of our having immortal spirits that shall
   survive our bodies, and subsist apart from them, and be extremely
   miserable or happy in another world: I say, nothing but a demonstration
   of the impossibility of this, ought to be satisfaction to us in a case
   of so great danger, and upon which so much does depend.

   For if there be a possibility, on the other side, of our having
   immortal souls, which shall live for ever in another world, nothing can
   acquit us from the greatest imprudence, if we should neglect to take
   care of that better and more lasting part of ourselves, and to provide
   for that duration which shall never have an end.

   And, therefore, if the supposition of the soul's immortality be
   infinitely more probable, as better agreeing with all the notions which
   men have of God and his providence, and with the natural desires, and
   hopes, and fears of mankind, and as most suitable to all our capacities
   and expectations, and to the general opinion and consent of wise men in
   all ages; then it is infinitely more safe, and consequently more wise,
   to proceed upon this supposition, and to provide and act accordingly.

   Thus "to number our days," that is, to make such an account of the
   shortness and uncertainty of this life, as to employ it mainly in the
   care and preparation for a better life, will engage us effectually in
   the business of religion. And this, perhaps, is the meaning of this
   phrase in the text, of "applying our hearts to wisdom," according to
   that of Job: (Job xxviii.28.) "But unto man he said, Behold the fear of
   the Lord, that is wisdom;" as if he had said, This is the true wisdom,
   the great excellency and perfection of human nature is religion, the
   lively sense and firm belief of a Deity, and a carnage and demeanour
   suitable to that belief; and that man is well taught, and rightly
   instructed in the great business and concernment of this life, and
   makes a wise reckoning and account of the shortness and un certainty of
   it, who applies himself to the business of religion: for this is the
   fundamental principle of wisdom, by which our whole life, and all the
   actions of it, ought to be governed and conducted.

   So that, if we have immortal spirits, which shall live and continue for
   ever, we cannot in reason but take our whole life, and our whole
   duration into consideration. And if we do so, we can never justify it
   to ourselves, to employ all our care and time about the worst and more
   ignoble part of ourselves, and to make provision only for the few days
   of our pilgrim age here in this world, without any regard to that
   eternal duration which we shall have in another world.

   The serious consideration of this cannot fail to make us careful of our
   souls, and concerned for eternity; and in order to the securing the
   happiness of that state, to mind us to "work out our salvation" with
   great care and diligence, that, if it be possible, we may avoid the
   misery, and obtain the happiness of another world; because there is no
   comparison between the goods and evils of this life, and those of the
   other, neither in respect of the degree, nor of the duration of them.
   And therefore it must needs be great wisdom, to forego the good things
   of this life, to obtain those of the other; and to bear the evils and
   afflictions of this life, to escape those of the other. For what man in
   his wits, for a temporal convenience and satisfaction, would forfeit an
   eternal benefit and advantage; and to escape a present evil, which
   cannot last long, would run himself upon one infinitely greater, and
   which will last for ever?

   "Consider, then, and shew yourselves men." Can there be a greater
   oversight and miscarriage in the conduct of our affairs, than to mind
   that least which concerns us most? Is it possible for men to run into a
   greater mistake, than to think that their great business in this world,
   is to mind the things of this world? And yet the greatest part of
   mankind not only run into this mistake at their first setting out, but
   persist in it all their days; as if their great, and indeed their only
   concernment were to please themselves for the present, and to provide
   for this world, as if they were to live always in it: forgetting all
   this while that they have immortal souls, which shall sur vive their
   bodies, and after a time be re-united to them, to live for ever,
   deprived of that happiness which they would take no care to secure, and
   under going that misery and punishment which they would be at no pains
   to prevent whilst they were in this world, and the opportunity of
   securing the one, and avoiding the other, was in their hands.

   II. The thoughts of our latter end should make us very serious and
   composed in our spirits. .For if we have immortal souls as well as
   dying bodies, if we shall live for ever, and if the happiness of all
   eternity depends upon the improvement of this short time of our lives,
   and our carriage and demeanour while we are here in this world; then it
   is no trifling business, it is not a matter of small concernment to us
   how we live here, and manage ourselves during our abode in this world.

   Whom do not the lively thoughts of death, and the near approach of it,
   make grave and serious? and many men much wiser and more considerate
   than ever they were in any other time of their lives, and much truer
   judges of things? They can then tell how they ought to have lived, what
   use they should have made of their time, and what use they would make
   of it, if God would be pleased to prolong it to them.

   The near view of another world is an amazing thing, and apt to inspire
   men with better thoughts and resolutions than ever they had before. And
   why should not the clear prospect of it at a distance, and the assured
   belief of it, have the same effect upon us, to make us serious and to
   mind in good earnest, "in this our day, the things which belong to our
   peace, and to wait all the days of our appointed time, till our change
   shall come?"

   And, therefore, to engage us to a continual seriousness and
   watchfulness, the great Judge of the world hath hid from us both the
   time of the general judgment, and of our particular summons out of this
   world, that we might never be unprovided for the main chance, for that
   which may happen at any time, and which will concern us for ever.

   III. The meditation of our latter end should put us upon minding the
   great business of our lives with all our might, and make us very
   vigorous and industrious in it; I mean the business of religion, and
   the salvation of our souls. And if we set up this, as in reason we
   ought, for the great end and design of our lives, and the main scope of
   all our actions, it will make our lives of a piece, and every part
   thereof agreeable to itself; because our mind will stand continually
   bent one way, and all our thoughts, and cares, and endeavours, will be
   united in one great end and design.

   And it will oblige us to great diligence and industry, and make us work
   hard, to think how great a work we have to do, and how little time to
   do it in; perhaps much less than most of us do imagine. It is not an
   easy work for a man to become good, and fit for heaven; it requires
   time and care, and great watchfulness over ourselves, great
   strugglings, and many a conflict with the evil inclinations of our
   minds, which, after we have conquered them, will often rally and make
   head again; a stout resistance of temptations, a stiff and obstinate
   resolution not to yield to them, and a "patient continuance in well
   doing." The consideration whereof should make us very careful and
   diligent to get oil into our lamps; that is, all those graces and
   virtues, all those good dispositions which may fit us for another
   world, and prepare us for eternity; it should make us very vigorous and
   industrious to do all the good we can, while the opportunity of doing
   it is in our hands, and to make ourselves as good as we can, because
   this is the time and season of laying the foundation of our future
   happiness, and increasing the degrees of it; for "as we sow, so shall
   we reap; he that sows sparingly, shall reap sparingly; and he that sows
   plentifully, shall reap plentifully." Every degree of virtue and
   goodness that we attain to in this world, will meet with a suitable
   reward, and a more resplendent degree of glory and happiness in the
   next life.

   And we shall have this advantage, by a great industry and diligence in
   "working out our own salvation," that, if we have made religion the
   great care and business of our lives, we shall have nothing to do when
   we come to die, but to renew our repentance for the errors and
   miscarriages of our lives, and to beg God's pardon and forgiveness of
   them, for the sake of the meritorious obedience and sufferings of our
   blessed Saviour; to comfort ourselves in the goodness and promises of
   God, and in the glorious hopes of the happiness which we are ready to
   enter upon; and in the mean time to exercise faith and patience for a
   very little while, till death put an end to the sorrows and miseries of
   life.

   IV. The meditation of our latter end should make us much in the
   exercise of repentance, and to renew it frequently; because we
   continually offend God, and provoke him every day, if not by sins of
   commission, yet of omission and neglect in one kind or other, and by
   the imperfection of our best actions and services; if not by
   presumptuous sins and against knowledge, yet by manifold sins of
   ignorance and infirmity; so that the best of us may say with David
   every day, "Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
   sins. If thou shouldest be extreme to mark what is done amiss, O Lord,
   who can stand?"

   Thus, by exercising a daily, or at least a very frequent repentance, we
   may keep our accounts in a good measure even, and not be in a hurry and
   confusion when we come to die, neither knowing where to begin our
   repentance, nor how to go through with so great a work in so short a
   time, and in circumstances of so much weakness and destruction. There
   are hardly any of us, especially of us who are ministers, and have
   frequent occasion to attend upon sick-beds, but have seen several in
   these wretched circumstances, not knowing what to do, desirous to
   repent, but, what through weakness of body, and horror and confusion of
   mind, not knowing how to go about it, lamenting their neglect of it in
   the time of their health, and despairing of doing it now with any
   success and acceptance. These are sad spectacles indeed, and ought to
   be loud warnings to us who are in health, and have the opportunity of
   repentance before us, to make use of it, and to set about this
   necessary work out of hand, "to-day, whilst it is called to-day, lest
   any of us be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin," and be at last
   brought into those miserable straits which I have been describing, and
   which no man that understands himself would be in for all the world.

   V. The meditation of the shortness and uncertainty of life should make
   us great husbands of our time, as that which, next to our immortal
   souls, and for the sake of them, is the most precious and valuable
   thing in the world.

   For as, on the one hand, nothing will comfort us more when we come to
   die and leave this world, than the remembrance of a well-spent life,
   carefully employed in the service of God, and for the benefit and
   advantage of men; so, on the other hand, there is nothing for which our
   consciences will more bitterly reproach us at that time, and fly in our
   faces with greater fury and rage, than for an useless and unprofitable,
   especially if it have been likewise (as is too commonly seen) a wicked
   and vitious life.

   Our life is uncertain, and therefore we should seize the present time,
   and improve it to the best advantage, though it be but short in itself,
   and very short in respect of the great and long work which we have to
   do in it. To prevent or cure the manifold distempers of our minds, and
   to preserve our souls in a good state of health, and to keep them free
   from the disorders of our appetites and passions, requires a wise
   conduct, and a very careful management of ourselves. Evil and
   inveterate ha bits are not mastered and mortified in an instant: nor
   the contrary virtues attained in any measure of perfection, but by long
   practice and slow degrees. There must be time, and patience, and
   perseverance, for the doing of these things, and we must "give all
   diligence to add to our faith knowledge, and to our knowledge virtue,"
   and one virtue to another, and one degree of virtue to another; and
   nothing with out this can minister true comfort to us in the hour of
   death, and make us "to lift up our heads with joy in the day of
   judgment."

   The consideration of this should make us careful not to neglect any
   occasion of doing good, or of making ourselves better; and restrain us
   from al lowing too much of our time to those great wasters and
   devourers of it, diversions and visits; because they do not only hinder
   us from better work and employment, but are apt insensibly to work us
   off from that serious temper of mind, which becomes those who do in
   good earnest design for another world.

   VI. The meditation of our latter end should make us always to prefer
   the doing of our duty, and the keeping of a good conscience, to all
   temporal considerations whatsoever, whether of fame and the good
   opinion of men, or of wealth and riches, of honour and dignity, of
   authority and power. "choosing rather (with Moses) to suffer
   afflictions with the people of God, than to have the temporary
   enjoyments of sin."

   And as for pleasure, there is little in this world that is true and
   sincere, besides the pleasure of doing our duty, and of doing good; I
   am sure none that is comparable to it. A good conscience is "a
   continual feast;" and he certainly pleaseth himself best, and is most
   easy in his own mind, who is conscious to himself, that he endeavours
   as well as he can to do what he ought.

   V1I. The meditation of our mortality should teach us the true price and
   value of all temporal enjoyments, and make us duly affected towards
   them, and to sit as loose to them in our affections as we can: for
   nothing surely can be more apt to beget in us a coldness and
   indifferency towards the enjoyments of this world, than the
   consideration of the uncertainty of all these things, and of the
   shortness and uncertainty of our own lives.

   Or if we suppose, that they and we both should continue for some number
   of years, yet there will be an end of them or us; and nothing is to be
   reckoned a lasting happiness, that will have an end, though it should
   be long first: for where there can be either sorrow or an end of our
   joy, there can be no true felicity.

   Besides, that the nature of the things of this world is such, that they
   afford but little happiness to us whilst we have them; we cannot do
   well without them, and yet we can hardly do well with them. Most of the
   enjoyments of this world, as desirable as they are to us, are very
   dangerous, and are always attended with some inconvenience or other;
   and even when we have all that we can wish for in this world, we are
   apt to be still uneasy, either something troubles us, or nothing
   pleases us; we are pained with fulness, and cloyed with the long
   enjoyment of the best things this world can give us. Why then should we
   set such a high and unreasonable value upon these temporary enjoyments,
   and be so much concerned for those things of which we have so slippery
   a hold, and so slender an assurance, and which afford us so very little
   contentment and satisfaction when we have them, and yet give us so much
   grief and trouble when we lose them? Considering how soon we must, and
   how suddenly we may leave this world, and all the enjoyments of it, we
   ought in reason to set no great price upon them.

   VIII. The consideration of the shortness and un certainty of our lives,
   should make us contented with our present condition, and patient under
   all the evils and afflictions which may befal us in this world. A
   little may content us for a little while, for the short time of our
   abode here; and since we do not expect our rest and happiness in this
   world, we cannot think ourselves disappointed if we do not meet with
   it. If our condition be tolerable it is well, and we have reason to be
   contented with it, since it is as much as this world usually affords.
   If it be very mean and strait, it cannot last long; and even that
   consideration should silence our murmurings, and should restrain and
   check our discontent.

   And it should make us patient likewise under the greatest evils and
   afflictions of this present life, to consider that they will shortly
   have an end; either they will give off of themselves, or they will
   carry us off and make an end of us, and all the patience we have
   exercised will be rewarded far beyond the proportion of our sufferings.

   At the worst, the afflictions and sufferings of this present time are
   not like the troubles and miseries of the other world, they will not
   last always. The most grievous things that can befal us here are not
   like the torments of hell, neither for the degree, nor the duration of
   them, without intermission and without end.

   IX. The meditation of death, and of the consequences of it, should make
   us upright and sincere in all our words and actions. Hypocrisy and
   dissimulation, as much as they are practised, are no part of true
   wisdom, no, not as to this world; they recoil terribly upon men, and
   turn to their reproach and disadvantage so soon as they are discerned,
   and they cannot be long practised without being discovered. But if we
   regard the other world, all disguises and arts of deceit are perfect
   folly; because then "God will bring every work into judgment, and every
   secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil," as Solomon
   assures us, (Eccles. xii. 14.) And our blessed Saviour cautions us
   against hypocrisy, upon this consideration--that there is a day coming,
   when all the false pretences of men shall be exposed and laid open, and
   all those masks and vizors which men wear in this world will fall off,
   and the actions of men shall appear in their true colours: (Luke xii.
   1, 2.) "Beware (says our Saviour there first of all) of the leaven of
   the pharisees, which is hypocrisy; for there is nothing covered, that
   shall not be revealed; nor hid, that shall not be known."

   Lastly, The meditation of our latter end should put us upon a careful,
   and continual, and particular preparation for the time of our death and
   dissolution. And this is very well worth our while, and the sooner we
   set about it the better; because, when this work is in any good measure
   done, we have rescued ourselves from that bondage to which most men are
   all their life long subject, because of the continual fear of death.
   Nothing abates the terror of death like a due preparation for it. When
   this is once made, we cannot be much concerned when it comes; for, to a
   well-prepared mind, sooner or later makes no great difference; but if
   we have delayed this necessary work, the longer we have delayed it the
   more unfit we shall be for it, and the more un willing to set about it;
   and if necessity drives us to it at last, we shall find that old age
   and sickness are but bad times to make preparation for death in, to
   begin our repentance and the change of a bad life. He that prepares not
   for death before he draws near to it, and comes to lie upon a sick-bed,
   is like him that begins to study the art of navigation when he hath
   present occasion and use for the skill which he hath not yet learned,
   when his vessel is driven among rocks, and is every moment in danger of
   being dashed in pieces.

   Let this then be established for a firm principle and rule--that the
   best and surest preparation for a happy and comfortable death, is a
   holy and good life. For nothing will disarm death of its terrors like
   the conscience of our own innocency, and of a sincere desire and
   endeavour to please God in the general course and tenor of our lives,
   and of a sincere repentance for all the errors and miscarriages of our
   lives. And though our life be short and un certain, yet it is a great
   deal that we may do by way of preparation for another world, if we
   begin and set out betimes, and be good husbands of the present
   opportunities. It is a great way that we may go in a short time, if we
   be always moving and pressing forwards.

   But the mischief is, many men pass fifty or sixty years in the world,
   and, when they are just going out of it, they bethink themselves, and
   step back, as it were, to do something which they had all this while
   forgot; viz. the main business for which they came into the world, to
   repent of their sins and reform their lives, and make their peace with
   God, and in time to prepare for eternity. This, which is forgotten and
   deferred to the last, ought to have been first thought of, and to have
   been made the great business of their whole lives.

   But I proceed to give some more particular directions concerning our
   preparation for death; namely,

   1. By frequent meditation of it, which will render it more familiar to
   us, and help us to tame this monster, and to take off the dread of it;
   and therefore we should accustom ourselves to the thoughts of it, that
   we may in some measure be reconciled to it.

   2. We should endeavour to mitigate the evil and terror of death by
   thinking of something worse; I mean the evils and miseries of life. For
   when we once come to look upon death as a remedy of all the evils of
   life, we shall then begin to be reconciled to it; and if we be wise,
   shall be glad to be out of the noise, and danger, and suffering of so
   many evils as we are continually liable to in this world; and shall
   thank God heartily for dismissing us and giving us leave to die, and by
   death to put an end to this miserable life, and to begin a better and
   happier life, which shall never have an end.

   And we should likewise meditate much on the glory and happiness of
   another world. For if we be once possessed with a firm belief and
   persuasion of it, we shall think the time long that we are detained
   from it, and wish for that which we so much feared--I mean death; that
   it may bring us to the enjoyment of that which we have much more reason
   to desire.

   And, indeed, considering (as I said before) the many evils and miseries
   which we are liable to, and always in danger of, while we are in this
   world, we have cause to thank God that we were born to die, and that we
   are not condemned to live for ever in this world. So that, whenever God
   shall think fit to release us, we ought to esteem it a favour: but if
   he will have us to stay a little longer, we must with patience wait for
   another opportunity of making our escape out of an evil and troublesome
   world. But, methinks, we should not much desire to ride it out in the
   storm any longer, when the port is open, and we may safely enter in.
   And then,

   3. By way of farther preparation for death, we should endeavour to
   maintain always a lively sense of it in our minds, that we may be, to
   all good effects and purposes, as much under the power of it as if it
   were just approaching, as if the physician or the judge had passed the
   sentence of death upon us. We should always reckon upon that which may
   happen the next moment; and if we do so, we can never be extremely
   surprised; but whenever our Lord comes, shall be found watching. And,

   Lastly, We should make it our constant prayer to God, that he would fit
   us for our dissolution, and stand by us and comfort us in that needful
   time, without whose gracious support and assistance, both physicians,
   and even the ministers of God themselves, are but miserable comforters.
   It should be our daily petition to God, that he would enable us to
   perform this last act of our life with decency and constancy of mind,
   that neither our disease nor our weakness may break the firmness of our
   spirits, or leave us to be amazed with fear, or betrayed with
   peevishness, so as to render us uneasy to ourselves, or to make our
   friends willing to be rid of us.

   But, more especially, when God thinks fit, either by the nature or
   present danger of our distemper, to give us a nearer summons and
   clearer warning of our mortality, we should take the opportunity to
   impress upon our minds a deep and more lively sense of another world,
   that we may quicken our pace, and "work the work of Him that sent us
   into the world, while it is day; because the night is coming when no
   man can work."

   Nature I know is fond of life, and apt to be still longing after a
   longer continuance here, and to find many delays and excuses to tarry
   yet a while longer in this world: and yet a very long life, with the
   usual burdens and infirmities of it, is seldom in reason desirable; for
   it is the same thing over again, or worse; so many more days and
   nights, summers and winters, a repetition of the same pleasures, but
   still with less pleasure and relish; a return of the same or greater
   pains and troubles, but still with less patience and strength to bear
   them.

   Let us then be of good courage in the approaches of death, since we see
   land, and the storm which we are in will quickly be over; and then it
   will be as if it had never been, or rather the remembrance of it will
   be a great pleasure to us:


   Suave mari magno, turbantibus æquora ventis,

   E terra alterius magnum spectare periclum.

   Non quia vexari quendam est jucunda voluptas;

   Sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est.

   "It is a pleasant thing to stand upon the shore when we see others in a
   great storm at sea. Not that it is delightful to see others in danger;
   but when others are in great difficulties and dangers, it is a pleasure
   to find ourselves safe and out of danger."

   And if it should please God to exercise us with great pains and tedious
   sickness, we should make use of all the considerations which reason and
   religion do furnish us withal, to help to mitigate and deceive our
   troubles, and to make that short way a little more smooth and easy. For
   the best of us have no privilege and exemption from the common
   accidents of humanity, no piety can certainly secure to any of us an
   easy and comfortable death; and, therefore, it is a groundless
   confidence for any man to reckon upon it; we must in this, as in all
   other things, resign up ourselves to God's good pleasure, and submit to
   him the time and manner, and all other circumstances of our departure
   out of this world; whether our sun shall set in a cloud, or shine
   brightest and look biggest when it is going down. But however it sets,
   it is the sun still, and the fountain of light, and will rise
   gloriously. There are always the seeds of joy and comfort in the
   conscience of a good man; and though they be hid and buried for a
   while, they will spring forth one time or other. "Light is sown for the
   righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart," as David assures us,
   (Psal. xcvii. 11.) I will conclude all with the words of the author of
   this psalm: (Deut. xxxii. 29.) "Oh that they were wise, that they
   understood this, that they would consider their latter end!"
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CLXXXVIII.

  THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST CONSIDERED, AS OUR EXAMPLE.

   Leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.--1 Pet. ii. 21.

   THE apostle here propounds to Christians the example of our Saviour as
   an argument to persuade them to one particular grace and virtue;
   namely, patience under sufferings unjustly laid upon us: (ver. 19-21.)
   "For this is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure
   grief, suffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if, when ye be
   buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? But if, when ye
   do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently; this is acceptable
   with God. For even hereunto were ye called, because Christ also
   suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
   steps."

   But though the example of our Saviour be here propounded to us upon a
   particular occasion, and with a more especial regard to the particular
   virtue of patience under unjust sufferings, which did so eminently
   appear in our blessed Saviour, the most meek and patient endurer that
   ever was, of the greatest and most wrongful sufferings; yet the apostle
   does not limit this great pattern of all righteousness to the single
   virtue of patience, but propounds it to us, as an example of universal
   holiness and goodness; for so he extends it in the next words, "leaving
   us an example, that ye should follow his steps; who did no sin, neither
   was guile found in his mouth."

   In this latitude and extent I shall discourse of it at this time, and
   that under these following heads:

   I. That his life is a most absolute and perfect pattern.

   II. That it is a very easy and familiar example.

   III. Very encouraging to the imitation of it.

   IV. An universal pattern fitted for the imitation of all sorts of
   persons, of what rank or condition soever.

   V. In the nature of it, very powerful to engage and oblige men to the
   imitation of it.

   I. The life of our blessed Saviour is a most absolute and perfect
   pattern of holiness and goodness, complete and entire in all its parts,
   and perfect to the utmost degree, in the following whereof there is no
   danger of being misguided, no fear of miscarriage: whereas all other
   examples of mortal men are fallible and uncertain guides, which if we
   follow too closely, will some time or other mislead us. In the lives of
   the best men recorded in Scripture, we may discern some spot and
   blemish, some error and oversight, some fall or slip; so that the lives
   of the holiest men are no sure rule, no perfect measure of our duty,
   and are therefore to be imitated with great wisdom and wariness, lest,
   if we follow all their actions indifferently and implicitly, in
   confidence they are good, because they are theirs, we may fall into
   great errors and failings; and therefore, in following the lives and
   examples of the best men, we must have an eye to the rule, and by that
   judge of the example which we propose to imitate; otherwise we may
   easily be seduced by the authority of a great example.

   But the example of our Lord is a living law and rule, his precepts and
   his pattern are of equal perfection, and the imitation of his life and
   actions is the very same thing with obedience to his laws. For the life
   of our blessed Saviour here on earth, is the life of God in the nature
   and likeness of man; he was God as well as man, and the Divine nature
   is certainly the pattern of all perfection. As he was the Son of God,
   he was "the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image and
   character of his person;" and as he was the Son of man, though he had
   natural frailties and infirmities, and was subject to hunger and
   thirst, weariness and pain, like other men; yet he had all the moral
   perfections belonging to human nature, without any of the evil
   inclinations, and sinful frailties, to which it is incident; and his
   human nature was assisted in an extraordinary manner by the Spirit of
   God, which "was not communicated to him by measure, but he was anointed
   with that holy unction above his fellows," above all the sons of men,
   above all the prophets and messengers of God that ever were sent to
   mankind; "he had no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth." And
   indeed it was requisite, that he that "was manifested to take away our
   sins," and to make expiation for them, should himself be "without sin,"
   as the apostle to the Hebrews reasons: (Heb. vii. 26.) "Such a
   high-priest became us, who was holy, harmless, and undefined, separate
   from sinners:" and had he not been so, he could neither have been an
   example nor an expiation.

   And this is no small advantage to mankind, to have so excellent a
   pattern of the same nature with ourselves to imitate, so perfect a copy
   to write after. For whoever would excel in any kind, must (as
   Quintilian says) optima quæque exempla ad imitandum proponere, "propose
   to himself the highest and most perfect examples of that kind for his
   imitation;" and the example of our blessed Saviour is unquestionably
   such a perfect pattern of all goodness and virtue, to the perfection
   whereof though we can never attain, yet it is a great advantage to have
   it always before us, and in our eye, that we may correct the errors and
   deformities of our lives, by the unspotted purity and perfect innocency
   of his life, and that we may be always aspiring after farther degrees
   of goodness; for surely we can no way better learn how God would have
   men to live in this world, than by seeing how God himself lived, when
   he was pleased to become man, to assume our nature, and dwell among us.

   II. As the life of our blessed Saviour is a most perfect, so likewise
   it is a familiar and easy example. The Divine nature is the great
   pattern of perfection; but that is too remote from us, and above our
   sight; "no man hath seen God at any time, nor can see him;" and though
   his perfections are represented to our minds in some degree, yet they
   are so glorious and dazzling an object, that we cannot bear to be hold
   them with that steadfastness, with which we ought to eye our pattern;
   and therefore God hath been pleased to condescend so far to our
   weakness, as to give us a visible example of those virtues he requires
   of us in "his own Son, appearing in the likeness of sinful flesh:" and
   the Son of God is an example of equal perfection with God himself, but
   much more easy and familiar, and level to us, in which we may see the
   several virtues of a good life practised in such instances, and upon
   such occasions, as do frequently happen in human life.

   Nothing was ever more simple and open, more obvious and easy to common
   imitation, than the life of our blessed Saviour, in which there was
   nothing dark and mysterious, abstruse and intricate; it was all perfect
   innocency and goodness, and he carried on one plain, and intelligible,
   and uniform design, which was to do all the good he possibly could to
   all men: this he pursued with all his might, with the greatest vigour
   and industry, with an undaunted courage and resolution, with an
   unwearied diligence, with a constant cheerfulness and serenity of mind;
   this was "his meat and drink," his great business and delight, his life
   and his happiness; he was not superciliously morose, had no affected
   singularities, no peculiar austerities in habit or diet, different from
   the common usage of men; his conversation was kind and innocent, free
   and familiar, open and indifferent to all sorts of persons; for he was
   a physician, and every body had need of him, all mankind were his
   patients. He did not place religion (as some have done since) in
   retirement from the world, and shunning the conversation of men, and
   taking great care to do nobody good: not in profound mysteries and fine
   speculations, but in the plain and honest practice of the solid and
   substantial virtues of a good life; in meekness and humility, in
   kindness and charity, in contentedness in a low and mean condition, and
   a calm compo sure of mind under all accidents and events, in patience
   under the greatest reproaches and sufferings, and a perfect submission
   to the will of God in all his dispensations, how harsh and unpleasant
   soever.

   Now there is nothing in all this, but what lies open to every man's
   understanding, and is easy to our practice and imitation, requiring
   nothing but an honest mind, and due care and diligence to do what we
   may easily know, to follow our guide in a plain way, and in all the
   actions of our lives, to tread in those steps in which the Son of God,
   and the best man that ever was, hath gone before us.

   III. The life of our blessed Saviour is likewise an encouraging
   example. It cannot but give great life to all good resolutions and
   endeavours, to see all that which God requires of us performed by one
   in our nature, by a man like ourselves. Our Saviour, indeed, had many
   advantages above us, being God as well as man; and his humanity, being
   supported by the Divine nature to which it was united, being clear from
   all the ill effects of original sin, and from all kind of vicious and
   inordinate inclinations; but then it is a great encouragement to us, to
   consider that God doth not require at our hands a perfect and unsinning
   obedience, as the condition of our salvation and happiness; but only
   such an obedience to his laws as is sincere, and continually aspiring
   after greater perfection, which is very possible to us by the grace of
   Christ, even in this imperfect state; that God considers our weakness,
   and how much we stand in need of his grace and assistance, and hath
   assured us that it shall not be wanting to us, if we heartily and
   earnestly beg it of him; and that strength which we may have for
   asking, is as good as if it were our own. If Christ were the Son of
   God, so are we, in a lower degree, by grace and adoption; and "if we be
   the sons of God, the Spirit of God dwells in us," to quicken and raise
   us to newness of life. And he that hath left us such an example, on
   purpose that we might follow it, will not surely leave us destitute of
   power to enable us to do so. It is a good argument to us, that he will
   enable us to do that in some degree in our own persons, which he
   himself did for example in our nature.

   An example more suitable to our weakness, might seem to have had more
   of encouragement in it: but we are to consider, that the Son of God
   assumed our nature, as compassed with infirmities, and liable to be
   "tempted in all things as we are, only without sin;" so that his
   example could not possibly have come nearer to us than it does, without
   great disadvantage to us, without wanting that perfection which is
   necessary to a complete and absolute pattern. In short, the Spirit of
   Christ dwells in us; and the same Spirit which kept and preserved him
   from all sin, is equally able to mortify sin in us, and to enable us to
   do the will of God in such manner as he will accept to our
   justification.

   IV. It is an universal pattern. As the doctrine of our Saviour, so his
   example was of an universal nature and design, calculated for all times
   and places; and, as much as was possible, abstracted from the
   circumstances of a particular condition, that it might be the more
   equally suited to all callings, and conditions, and capacities of men,
   and fitted for general direction and imitation in all sorts of goodness
   and virtue, either in the general principle, or in the particular
   instances of them. And for this reason he would not engage himself in
   any particular calling, or way of life, that his pattern might more
   equally and indifferently regard all mankind.

   He was really a great person, the greatest that ever was in birth and
   dignity, being the only Son of God, the maker and heir of all things:
   and yet he submitted to the lowest condition, to all the degrees of
   poverty and meanness, of contempt and sufferings, to teach men of high
   degree to be humble and serviceable to the good of others: and men of
   low degree to be contented and cheerful in the meanest condition, and
   the hardest circumstances that the providence of God shall see good to
   place them in.

   He had the deepest and most comprehensive knowledge; in him, as the
   apostle expresseth it, "were hid all the treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge:" and yet he made no vain show and ostentation of it; he did
   not puzzle his hearers with abstruse speculations and sublime
   mysteries, but, in a way of plain and familiar instruction, declared to
   his hearers those things which were most useful and necessary for them
   to know. He confuted the doctors, and confounded the wisdom of the
   wise, those who were conceited of their own knowledge and skill in
   Divine things; but was always ready to condescend to the weakness and
   ignorance of the meanest capacity; giving herein an example to the wise
   and learned, not to make a show of their knowledge, but to make the
   best use of it; not to lift up themselves above others, but to
   condescend and stoop to them for their good.

   He sometimes retired from conversation and company, that he might be
   alone, and at leisure to at tend upon God, and meditate on Divine and
   heavenly things, without interruption and distraction; but most
   frequently he conversed with others, and mingled himself with all sorts
   of persons, that he might give all the advantage, and do all the good
   he could to all men. Nay, he did not decline the conversation of the
   worst of men, and it was really true which was objected to him, that
   "he was a friend of publicans and sinners," being sincerely desirous to
   do them the greatest kindness in the world, to reform their manners,
   and reclaim them to a better course; so that he was a pattern both of
   the contemplative and active life, and shews us how to mix these to the
   greatest advantage; and by his own example teacheth us, that we cannot
   serve God better than by doing good to men; and that he is as well
   pleased, when we lay out ourselves for the benefit of others, spiritual
   and temporal, as if we employed all our thoughts and meditations wholly
   upon himself and Divine things; that a perpetual retirement from the
   world, and shunning the conversation of men, is not the most religious
   life, but living among men, and doing good to them.

   More particularly, the life of our blessed Saviour is a pattern to us,

   1. Of the greatest and most substantial virtues.

   2. Of the most rare and unusual.

   3. Of the most useful and beneficial.

   4. Of the most hard and difficult: and,

   5. Of such virtues as are most needful; and for the practice of which,
   there is the greatest and most frequent occasion in human life.

   1. It is a pattern of the greatest and most substantial virtues.

   Of a fervent piety and devotion toward God. We read, that he often
   retired to pray, and sometimes spent whole nights in it: his mind was
   continually upon God, as appears by his frequent ejaculations upon all
   occasions, by his communication and discourse, which was always either
   instructive of men in Divine truths, or persuasive to a holy practice;
   from worldly objects and occurrences, he would take occasion to raise
   some spiritual meditation, and to speak of heavenly things.

   And then his ready and cheerful obedience to the will of God in all
   things: "In the volume of the book it is written of me, I come to do
   thy will, O my God." He speaks of it with pleasure; and he delighted to
   do it: he declined the will of God in no instance, how difficult and
   displeasing soever to flesh and blood.

   The perfect purity and innocency of his life; he was "a lamb without
   spot and blemish," (1 Pet. i. 19.) "He did no sin," (chap. ii. 21.)
   "Leaving us herein an example, (that though we cannot keep equal pace
   with him, yet) we should follow his steps." He was "holy, harmless,
   undefiled, separate from sinners," (Heb. vii. 26.)

   And then his universal charity, taking all opportunities to do all the
   good, temporal and spiritual, that he could to all men, of which his
   whole life is one great and continued instance: these are all great and
   substantial virtues.

   I have indeed said nothing of justice, both because there was little
   occasion for it, he having no thing to do in those matters wherein
   justice is concerned: he had no estate of his own, and he meddled not
   with those of other men: and, likewise, because his life was all
   goodness, which is a virtue of a higher pitch than justice: he that was
   so good to all, we need not doubt of his justice, if there had been
   occasion for it.

   2. He was a pattern of the most rare and unusual virtues.

   Such was his sincerity, "guile was not found in his mouth," (1 Pet. ii.
   22.) His conversation was free and open, without disguise and
   concealment; and therefore, when the high-priest asked him of his
   disciples, and of his doctrine, (John xviii. 19.) he wondered at the
   question: "Why askest thou me? Ask them that heard me. I spake openly
   to the world, I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple,
   whither the Jews always resort, and in secret have I said nothing." And
   this is no common virtue, and therefore our Saviour gave it as a
   singular commendation to Nathanael: (John i. 47.) "Behold an Israelite
   indeed, in whom there is no guile." Perfect sincerity is a great
   foundation of goodness; it is soundness at the heart, and, like perfect
   health, seldom to he seen; there is hardly any thing wherein men,
   otherwise good and virtuous, do oftener trip and falter.

   Another virtue, which is not very usual, was eminent in our Saviour--I
   mean true humility, without affectation and secret pride lurking under
   it. This appeared very remarkable, and very natural, in his whole life,
   which was all of it the greatest instance of humility that ever was;
   and, therefore, with great assurance he propounds himself to our
   imitation in this: (Matt. xi. 29.) "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of
   me; for I am meek and lowly in spirit." And St. Paul sets this virtue
   before us, as being the constant temper of our Lord, and visible in his
   whole undertaking, and in every part of it from first to last, from his
   coming into the world to his going out of it: (Phil. ii. 5-8.) "Let
   this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the
   form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made
   himself of no reputation (he emptied himself of all his majesty and
   glory), and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the
   likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
   himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."
   Here was humility indeed, from so great a height to stoop so low, from
   the top of glory and majesty, to the lowest pitch of meanness and
   misery! Here is a pattern for us; and how should it shame and confound
   the pride of the sons of men, to see the Son of God so humble? There is
   no virtue I am sure which we have so much reason, and yet none which we
   have so little inclination, to imitate. "Pride was not made for men,"
   says the son of Sirach; it does not become us, and yet it is the
   fashion; we know that we have no cause to be proud, and yet we know not
   how to be humble. Let the example of our Lord's humility bring down the
   haughtiness of men, and when we consider how he abased himself, let us
   be "vile in our own eyes, and abhor ourselves in dust and ashes."

   And then his contempt of the world, and the enjoyments and pleasures of
   it, to that degree, that he would have no part and share in the
   possessions of it, not so much as one of the first and almost lowest
   conveniences of life, a settled abode and habitation; so that, as he
   himself tells us, he was in a more destitute condition than the brute
   creatures: "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests,
   but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head." Not that he
   designed to oblige us to a strict imitation of him in this particular;
   for he might, and we may lawfully possess and enjoy these things: but
   to teach us not to overprize them, not to seek them too earnestly, nor
   love them inordinately. That he despised them, should keep us from
   admiring them, and doating upon them; that he would not have them in
   his possession, should keep them out of our hearts, and make us very
   loose and indifferent in our affections to them; that he valued doing
   good above all the enjoyments of this world, should make us value them
   only in order to that end.

   And then his excessive kindness and benignity to us, such as men very
   rarely shew to their best friends, and the best men; but such as no man
   ever shewed to his enemies: "Peradventure, for a good man one would
   even dare to die, (says St. Paul, Rom. v. 7.) But herein God commended
   his love to us, in that whilst we were sinners, Christ died for us."
   And this pattern of love our Saviour propounds to our imitation: (John
   xv. 12, 13.) "This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I
   have loved you. Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down
   his life for his friend." The highest pitch of human friendship that
   ever was, was to die for a friend: but our Lord died not for his
   friends, but for his enemies, that he might make them his friends, by
   gaining them to the obedience of his laws: "Ye are my friends, if you
   do whatsoever I command you." The same pattern the apostles of our Lord
   propound to us: (Ephes. v. 2.) "Walk in love as Christ also hath loved
   us, and given himself for us." (1 John iii. 16.) "Hereby perceive we
   the love of God, because he laid down his life for us; and we also
   ought to lay down our lives for the brethren." Here is a pattern of the
   highest and most unusual kind of love proposed to our imitation; not
   that every man, by virtue of this example, is to lay down his life for
   another, because that is not practicable; for then, by the same reason
   that I am obliged to lay down my life for another, he would be as much
   obliged to lay down his life for me; and so, by my dying for him, I
   should hinder him of doing a duty to which he was equally obliged, and
   take it out of his hands: but the meaning of this precept is, that, as
   Christ died for a common good, so we ought to bear that common
   affection to mankind, and especially to our brethren, who are endeared
   to us by a nearer relation, as, in imitation of the example he hath
   given us, to be ready by our single life, if there be occasion, to
   redeem the lives of many of our brethren, and to expose ourselves to
   save them. This I conceive is all that can reasonably be collected from
   our obligation to imitate our Lord's example.

   3. The life of our blessed Saviour is likewise a pattern of such
   virtues, as are most useful and beneficial to others.

   In his readiness to do good to all persons and all kinds; by
   instructing their ignorance, and supplying their wants, spiritual and
   temporal; by resolving their doubts, and comforting them in their
   sorrows; by healing their diseases and infirmities, which he, indeed,
   did in extraordinary and miraculous ways, because he was destitute of
   ordinary means; and we are to do it by ordinary means, and such as are
   in our power, which when they are, there is no need of miracles. And
   then in his seeking occasions and opportunities for it, not content
   with those that offered themselves, but inquiring after them; and in
   his unwearied diligence in this work; for "he went about doing good,"
   spent whole days from morning to night, for the service and benefit of
   others; neglected himself, and the ordinary refreshments of nature, out
   of his great zeal to "work the work of him that sent him," to bring
   glory to God, and good to men.

   And in the delight he took in this employment; it was "his meat and
   drink" to be doing of it,: he esteemed it his happiness, yea, a greater
   felicity to confer benefits upon others, than any man finds in
   receiving the greatest benefit from others: for that, it seems, was a
   noted saying of his, a kind of motto with him, as St. Paul testifies:
   (Acts xx. 35.) "It is more blessed to give than to receive." And in all
   this, he persisted in despite of the greatest discouragements from the
   ingratitude and malice of men, who maligned him for his kindness, and
   put an ill construction upon his most charitable actions, and were
   ready "to stone him for his good works:" but this did not discourage
   him, and take him off; so he might do good, he was contented to hear
   and suffer ill.

   And then in his condescension to others, and consideration of their
   weakness, and complying with them in lawful and indifferent things, for
   their edification, and to gain them in greater matters; this St. Paul
   tells us, was our Lord's temper, and he urgeth Christians with the
   example of it: (Rom. xv. 1-3.) "We then that are strong, ought to bear
   the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one
   of us please his neighbour for his good to edification: for even Christ
   pleased not himself." Where we have liberty and can yield, we ought to
   abate of our own humour, for the good and edification of others; and
   not peevishly and stiffly to insist upon lesser things, to the
   hinderance of a greater good; "for even Christ pleased not himself." He
   who had all authority to command, and right to be obeyed, and who could
   not err in any thing; yet he condescended to the weakness and
   infirmities of others, and in all indifferent things, did not consult
   his own inclination, but their interest and edification.

   And, which greatly conduceth to the comfort and benefit of all
   societies, both civil and ecclesiastical, he gave us the example of an
   obedient and peace able temper, conforming himself and his actions not
   only to Divine, but human laws, "giving to Cæsar the things which are
   Cæsar's, and to God the things which are God s;" insomuch, that when
   tribute was demanded of him, though he was really free from any such
   obligation, and so poor, that he was not able to pay it, in which case
   even Cæsar must lose his right; nevertheless, to avoid offence, he
   submitted to it, and chose rather to work a miracle, than to appear
   refractory and disobedient.

   And in religious rites and ceremonies, and the observance of days and
   times, he did not only conform to all Divine institutions, but to human
   appointment and usage in all things that were of an innocent and
   indifferent nature; and this without any anxious scrupulosity, and
   perverse disputing every inch of his liberty; with great peaceableness
   observing those religious festivals, which had no other appointment but
   of the civil authority, and were of mere human institution; and with
   great prudence steering a middle course, between endless superstition
   and scrupulous and petulant faction; giving all Christians herein a
   pattern, how to demean themselves in like cases with great
   peaceableness and obedience, and not to do or avoid the doing of any
   thing, out of peevishness and singularity of humour, and a spirit of
   contradiction, and not to indulge needless and endless scruples,
   especially on the wrong side, as it is too visible many men's scruples
   lie almost wholly about obedience to authority, and compliance with
   indifferent customs, but very seldom about the danger of disobedience
   and unpeaceableness, and rendering in pieces the church of Christ, by
   needless separations, and endless divisions.

   And our Lord did not only give us the example of a peaceable and
   uniting spirit, but a little before his departure out of the world, he
   bequeathes it to his disciples, as his last legacy. (John xiv. 27.)
   "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you." And, to confirm it
   to them, he makes it his most earnest and particular prayer to God for
   them, that God would preserve this spirit of peace and unity among
   Christians to the end of the world, foreseeing, in his infinite wisdom,
   what mischiefs and dishonour the contrary temper would bring to his
   holy religion. (John xvii. 20-23.) "Neither pray I for these alone,"
   meaning his disciples, "but for them also which shall believe on me
   through their word;" that is, for all Christians to the end of the
   world; "that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in
   thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that
   thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given
   them; that they may be one, even as we are one. I in them, and thou in
   me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know
   that thou hast sent me." Intimating, that nothing is more apt to bring
   in question the divinity of the Christian doctrine, than contentions
   and divisions among Christians; "that the world may know that thou hast
   sent me."

   Let us often think of this pattern, and this prayer of our Saviour, and
   let the consideration of it quell those unchristian heats which are
   among us, lest, by our animosities and divisions about lesser things,
   which, whatever opinion men may have of them, do no ways touch upon the
   life and essence of religion, we first dishonour, and finally destroy
   from among us the best religion in the world. "And God grant that we
   may all know and do in this our day, the things which belong to our
   peace, before they be hid from our eyes, for his mercy's sake in Jesus
   Christ; to whom, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and
   glory now and for ever."

SERMON CLXXXIX.

  THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST CONSIDERED AS OUR EXAMPLE.

   Leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.--1 Pet. ii. 21.

   I HAVE considered our Saviour's example as an universal pattern,
   calculated for all persons, times and places; and this I illustrated in
   these particulars:

   1. That it was a pattern to us of the greatest and most substantial
   virtues.

   2. Of such as are most rare and unusual.

   3. Of such as are most useful and beneficial to others: I proceed to
   the particulars, which remain to be spoken to.

   4. Our Saviour is likewise a pattern to us of such virtues as are most
   hard and difficult to be practised, such as are most against the grain
   of our corrupt nature, and most contrary to flesh and blood.

   Every virtue is then hard and difficult, when it either contradicts the
   strong inclinations of nature, or meets with powerful temptations to
   the contrary.

   The virtues which thwart the inclinations of human nature, are
   comprehended under the general name of self-denial; the denial of
   ourselves in those things which are commonly dearest to men; such are
   our own life, our pleasure or ease, our reputation: in all these, our
   blessed Lord hath given us the greatest example of self-denial that
   ever was; he denied his own life, and gave up himself wholly to the
   will of God, to do and suffer whatever he thought fit to impose upon
   him. So he himself tells us: (John v. 30.) "I seek not mine own will,
   but the will of the Father which sent me:" and, (John vi. 38.) "I came
   down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that
   sent me." And when he was in that great agony, on the apprehension of
   his approaching sufferings, at which nature did start, and when that
   bitter cup, that cup of astonishment was put into his hand, though he
   would have been glad to have declined it, if God had thought fit; yet,
   upon the whole matter, he submitted to it, and renounced his own will,
   the strongest inclination of nature that could be, in obedience to the
   will of God. (Matt. xxvi. 39.) "He fell on his face and prayed, saying,
   O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;
   nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt:" and, (ver. 42.) "He
   went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if
   this cup may not pass from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."
   Here was a great conflict; nature declined those dreadful sufferings
   which were coming upon him, and would have shrunk back: but he
   considered his duty, and made his inclination yield to it.

   And he did not only deny his own will in obedience to the will of God,
   for which there is so great and invincible reason; but he denied it
   likewise in compliance and condescension to the prejudices, and
   humours, and infirmities of men, for their edification and good. So St.
   Paul tells us, and propounds our Lord herein to us for a pattern. (Rom.
   xv. 2, 3.)

   He denied himself in the lawful pleasures and satisfactions, in the
   ease and accommodations of life: he lived meanly, and fared hardly; he
   possessed and enjoyed none of the good things of this world, and
   endured all the evils of it; he despised riches, and the pomp and pride
   of life, and contented himself with a poor and destitute condition,
   "having not where to lay his head," nor wherewithal to support nature,
   and to defray the common tribute, without a miracle. And he did not
   submit to this poor and mean condition upon necessity, for "he was Lord
   of all;" he made the world, and it was all his own, upon the highest
   right and title: but he voluntarily embraced it, "being rich, for our
   sake he became poor," that he might wean us from the love of these
   things, and be an effectual example to us of the contempt of worldly
   wealth and greatness.

   And he denied himself likewise in one of the dearest and tenderest
   things in the world, to the wisest and greatest minds, I mean in point
   of reputation: "he made himself of no reputation," says St. Paul,
   (Phil. ii. 7.) heauton ekenose, "he emptied himself." To submit to
   contempt, is to empty one's self indeed: reputation being one of the
   last things a generous mind would be content to forego, and that which
   some have held in equal dearness and esteem with life itself; yet in
   this our Lord denied himself, and, that he might do good to mankind,
   was contented to be esteemed one of the worst of men; and without any
   kind of cause and desert, to undergo all manner of obloquy and
   reproach, to be accounted a magician and impostor, "a friend and
   companion of publicans and sinners;" a seducer of the people, a
   seditious person, and more worthy of the most cruel and shameful death
   than the greatest malefactor. Thus was the Son of God contented to be
   set below the worst of men, to be abased and vilified, that he might be
   a perfect pattern to us of this difficult virtue of self-denial, even
   in those things which are held in greatest esteem among the best of
   men.

   And surely in no case is example more necessary than in this, to
   animate and encourage us in the discharge of so difficult a duty, so
   contrary to the bent and inclination of our nature. A bare precept of
   self-denial in these things, and a peremptory command to sacrifice our
   own wills, our ease, our pleasure and reputation, yea, and life itself,
   to the glory of God, and the good of men, would have sounded very harsh
   and severe, had not the practice of all this been exemplified in a
   pattern of so much advantage: one who, in all these respects denied
   himself much more than is possible for us to do, who might have
   insisted upon a greater right, who abased himself, and stooped from a
   greater height and dignity, who did not submit to a condition of
   poverty and meanness when it was unavoidable, but chose it; who
   submitted to suffering, though he never deserved it, and who met with
   all the contempt and reproach imaginable, whilst he truly deserved the
   greatest esteem and reputation. Here is an example that hath all the
   argument, and all the encouragement that can be to the imitation of it.
   Was he, who had so regular a will and inclination, contented to have it
   crucified and thwarted? did he, who had an unquestionable right to all
   the riches and enjoyments of the world, renounce them all, and embrace
   poverty? did he, to whose deep wisdom and judgment all mankind ought to
   submit, condescend to the weakness of others, and not please himself?
   did he, who never did the least thing in his whole life that might
   justly stain or blemish his reputation, patiently bear all sorts of
   contumely and reproach? And shall we think much to deny ourselves in
   any of these? Such an example is of greater force and authority than
   any precept or law. Well might our Lord, thus going before us, command
   us to follow him, saying: "If any man will be my disciple, let him deny
   himself, and take up his cross, and follow me." If he thus denied
   himself, well may we, who have much less to deny, and much more reason
   and cause to do it; for, as he argues, "the disciple is not greater
   than his master, nor the servant than his lord." He did it voluntarily
   and of choice; it is our duty: he did it for our sakes; we do it for
   our own: we did not deserve it of him; but he hath merited it of us.

   Our Lord did not, like the pharisees, give strict precepts to .others,
   which they themselves did not follow. "They said, and did not; laid
   heavy bur dens upon others, and grievous to be borne, when they
   themselves would not touch them with one of their fingers:" nor like
   the philosophers, who spake fine and glorious things of goodness and
   virtue, but did much like other men; gave strict rules to others, but
   lived loosely themselves; and therefore it is no wonder that their
   discourses had so little effect upon the lives and manners of men, and
   were so unavailable to the reformation of the world. Precepts of great
   strictness and severity, are like to be obeyed very slowly and faintly,
   unless they be sweetened and made easy by the familiar practice of
   those that give them. In a way that is rugged and difficult, full of
   trouble and danger, it is not enough to bid men go on; but he that bids
   them, must go before them, and take them by the hand, and give them an
   example to follow his steps; without this, rules and precepts are very
   dry things, and give but faint and cold encouragement. Cæsar's example
   prevailed much more upon his soldiers than his word of command. No man
   ever discoursed better of magnanimity and greatness of mind, in great
   dangers and calamities, than Tully does; and yet when it come to the
   trial, no man ever behaved himself more faintly, and shewed greater
   dejection of mind, than he did; so that it is hard to say, whether his
   discourses are more apt to raise, or his example to damp, a man's
   spirit. Seneca writes with wonderful wit and smartness, with great
   fineness and force of argument, about the contempt of the world and
   wealth; but then, to consider how he flowed in wealth himself, and how
   intent he was to heap up riches beyond measure, would make a man more
   apt to despise him than the world. So necessary is it that precepts,
   especially of great difficulty, should be backed and enforced by
   example, and that severe rules should be mollified, and made easy by
   the practice of those who prescribe them. And this our Lord took
   particular care to do in those precepts of his, which seem to offer the
   greatest violence to the common bent and inclination of human nature.

   And so he did likewise in those virtues which are so difficult upon the
   account of temptation from without, as well as of inclination from
   within. Not to insist upon his firm resistance of all the temptations
   to ambition, which made not the least impression upon him; the offer of
   the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, had no influence upon
   him. He was sometimes in great favour with the people, and mightily
   applauded by them, for speaking as never man spake, and doing such
   things as no man ever did: but he was as little moved by their
   applause, as he was dejected by their reproaches. When the people would
   have made him king, to qualify him the better, as they thought, to be
   the Messias, he would not take so much notice of the offer as to refuse
   it, but silently withdrew himself, that they knew not where to find
   him.

   But that which I shall particularly take notice of, under this head, is
   his great meekness; which is a very difficult virtue, if we consider
   the peevishness and infirmity of the human nature, and the frequent
   temptations to passion and anger, which occur in human life, and these
   very sudden and surprising; so that there is nothing wherein wise men
   do oftener betray their own weakness, than in the matter of sudden
   anger. Moses, the greatest of all the prophets that had been, and who
   it seems was naturally of a meek temper, having this testimony given
   him by the Spirit of God, that he was the meekest man upon earth; yet
   he miscarried in this matter, and not being able to bear the continual
   perverseness of that people, lost his temper, and fell into an
   irregular passion. But our blessed Lord, whose temper was perpetually
   assaulted with the highest provocations in all kinds, still maintained
   the evenness and meekness of his spirit.

   The dulness and slowness of his disciples, to understand and believe
   what he had so plainly taught, and so often inculcated upon them, was a
   great trial of patience; which yet provoked him no farther, than to a
   just rebuke of their fault. The hardest words he ever gave them, were:
   "O unwise and slow of heart to believe! how long shall I suffer you?"
   And when he was in the height of his sorrow and trouble, and his
   disciples were so un concerned for him, as to fall asleep, in the same
   breath that he reproves their drowsiness, he makes an excuse for it:
   "Can ye not watch with me one hour? The spirit indeed is willing; but
   the flesh is weak." This carriage from his friends and followers, when
   he stood in most need of their comfort and assistance, and "his soul
   was exceeding sorrowful, even to the death," was a great temptation to
   anger, especially falling upon a sore and afflicted mind; and yet it
   was so far from provoking his anger, that it rather moved his pity
   toward them.

   His sharp reproofs of the scribes and pharisees, were but a necessary
   severity, and a just expression of his indignation at the fulsome
   hypocrisy of such great pretenders to piety and devotion; for he knew
   their hearts. His whipping of the buyers and sellers out of the temple,
   the only action of his life in which there appears any transport of
   anger, was no other than a becoming zeal for the honour of God's house,
   which he saw so notoriously profaned; which zeal was warranted, after
   the example of Phineas, by the extraordinary occasion of it. In all his
   other actions, he was perfectly meek and lowly in spirit, void of
   pride, one of the chief causes of inordinate anger. We cannot say he
   was never angry; but whenever he was so, which was very seldom, he
   sinned not; it was upon great and just occasion, and never to any undue
   degree.

   And this is the more remarkable, because he was very apt to receive the
   impressions of other passions; of love and pity, which easily moved him
   to kindness and compassion. He could not forbear to weep, when he saw
   Lazarus's friends lamenting over his grave, though he knew the cause of
   their sorrow would soon be removed and turned into joy, by his
   resurrection to life. Nay, he had not only this tenderness towards his
   friends, but even to his greatest enemies. When he looked upon
   Jerusalem, and foresaw the terrible revenge that God would take upon
   his enemies and murderers, and beheld at a great distance the dreadful
   calamities that were coming upon them, he could not refrain from tears.
   He allowed himself in these innocent and human passions; but where
   there was danger of transgressing, as there is in no passion more than
   that of anger, he was continually upon his guard, and governed himself
   with great care, and never gave way to it, but upon evident and just
   occasion; and was never transported to any undue degree.

   And yet he lived and died almost under continual provocations to it;
   not only from his friends and followers, but from all soils of persons,
   provocations of the highest nature: if the most spiteful reproaches and
   injurious usage, and the most cruel persecutions and sufferings from
   the hands of those whom he had by all ways endeavoured to oblige; if
   the contradiction of sinners, whom he came to save; in a word, if the
   greatest malice, accompanied with the highest ingratitude; if any, if
   all of these be provocations of a high nature, he was almost
   continually, living and dying, exercised with these. And how did he
   demean himself in the midst of all these provocations? with the
   greatest meekness and mildness imaginable, answering their bitterest
   reproaches and cruellest usage either with calm reasonings or with meek
   silence; that, by the reasonableness and meekness of his answers and
   carriage, he might either convince or mollify them. When his enemies
   charged him with the profanation of the sabbath, he only reasons the
   matter fairly with them, asking them, whether it was "lawful to do good
   or to do evil on the sabbath-day?" telling them, that "the sabbath was
   made for man, and not man for the sabbath?" bidding them go and learn
   what that means, "I will have mercy and not sacrifice." When they
   accused him for being a magician, and "casting out devils by the prince
   of the devils," he convinceth them, by reason, that this was a
   malicious and groundless charge, telling them, that "a kingdom divided
   against itself cannot stand;" and that if he by Satan cast out Satan,
   his kingdom was divided against itself, and must fall. When they
   upbraided him for companying with publicans and sinners, he justifies
   the thing, by telling them, that "the whole have no need of the
   physician, but the sick;" that "he came not to call the righteous, but
   sinners to repentance." When they charged him with blasphemy, for
   saying to the man sick of the palsy, "thy sins be forgiven thee;" he
   only asks them this question, "Which is easier to say, thy sins be
   forgiven thee; or, take up thy bed and walk?" When they called him by
   the odious name of impostor, and seducer of the people, he makes no
   sharp answer, but appeals to his miracles, and the works which he had
   done among them, as an unquestionable testimony that he came from God.
   When they took up stones to throw at him, he opposeth to this hard
   usage only soft, gentle words, if by that means he might stay their
   rage: (John x. 32.) "Many good works have I shewed you from my Father;
   for which of these works do you stone me?" Thus, upon all occasions, he
   answers their malice and rage, not with boisterous passion, but by calm
   reason and argument; and, notwithstanding it had little effect, he
   continues this way to the last, and as the malice of his enemies was
   invincible, so was his meekness. In his last sufferings, when he was so
   rudely and injuriously treated at his trial, and one of the high
   priest's officers struck him in the open face of the court, he only
   says to him, "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if
   well, why smitest thou me?" What could be said more meekly? What more
   reasonably? And when, in the extremity of his sufferings, the high
   priests, and the soldiers, and the people, all joined together to
   revile him, and insult over his misery in the most barbarous and cruel
   manner; instead of breaking out into passion in this anguish of his
   soul, he pours out his prayers to God on their behalf, and makes the
   most charitable excuse and apology for them that their crime was
   possibly capable of: "Father forgive them; for they know not what they
   do." While he felt the bitter effects of their malice, he imputes it to
   their ignorance. Here is an example of meekness fit for the Son of God
   to give, and much more fit for the sons of men to follow; for, as the
   wise son of Syrach says excellently, "Pride was not made for men, nor
   furious anger for him that was born of a woman."

   And having such an example left us of this great virtue, let us do
   likewise, since, as St. Peter tells us, he suffered, with all this
   meekness and patience, "to leave us an example that ye might follow his
   steps; who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
   he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
   righteously." When we consider this example, can we resent so highly
   every petty injury and provocation; and upon every slighting word
   proceed to a challenge and a quarrel, and entertain fierce and
   implacable thoughts of revenge? When the Son of God with so much
   meekness endured the continual contradictions of sinners, and put up
   with such outrageous affronts and indignities from his creatures, those
   ungrateful wretches, whom he had made, and whom he came to save, and
   for whom he offered to give that very blood, which they so cruelly and
   maliciously shed, for the expiation of their guilt.

   To all which I shall add, his readiness to forgive injuries,
   considering the temptations he had to wrath and revenge, from the
   spiteful reproaches, and injurious calumnies, and continual persecution
   of his bitter and implacable enemies without a cause; who pursued him
   with incessant rage and malice, and never gave over until they had
   wrought his ruin, and by false accusations, and a most violent
   persecution, and seditious tumults and clamours, they had forced the
   Roman governor, contrary to his inclination and the convictions of his
   own mind and conscience, and against all reason and justice, to pass
   sentence upon him, when he declared he saw nothing in him worthy of
   death, and to condemn him to a most painful and ignominious death. Nor
   did their malice end here; but they aggravated his sufferings with
   scurrilous taunts and reproaches, and all the rudeness and indignities
   imaginable: and yet all this injurious and cruel usage did not provoke
   him to one revengeful thought; could not extort from him so much as one
   peevish, or misbecoming, or threatening word. "When he was reviled, he
   reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not." But,
   notwithstanding all this provocation, he was more ready to forgive the
   injuries and indignities they put upon him than they could be to offer
   them, and implored the mercy and forgiveness of God for them as
   heartily and as earnestly as they had solicited his death and
   destruction.

   It is easy to give precepts of forgiveness, to hid men "love their
   enemies, bless them that curse them, do good to them that hate them,
   and pray for them that despitefully use them, and persecute them; and
   to forgive our brother that offends us, not only to seven times, but to
   seventy times seven," without stint and limit: but the practice of this
   is exceeding difficult; for how hard do we find it to pass by a little
   provocation, and upon a very small affront and indignity offered to us
   to suppress the thought and desire of revenge, and to command our
   passion from breaking out in word or deed? But much more difficult is
   it perfectly to forgive, to love our enemies, to pray for them, and to
   be ready to do them good. Such a difficult virtue as this had need of
   ail sorts of inducements to engage us to the practice of it. And
   therefore our blessed Lord did not think it enough strictly to enjoin
   it, and to enforce it upon us by the most powerful considerations,
   teaching us in our daily prayers to beg mercy and forgiveness of God
   upon this condition--that we forgive others, and not to hope for it
   upon other terms; telling us, that as we demean ourselves toward one
   another in this case of injuries and provocations, so God will deal
   with us; "if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
   also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither
   will your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses." Nothing can be
   urged upon us with greater force than this duty is, because upon our
   practice and performance of it all our hopes of mercy and forgiveness
   from God are suspended. But yet it is difficult after all this; and,
   therefore, to allure us more powerfully to the practice of it, our Lord
   hath given us the example of it in the whole course of his life; in
   which, being continually assaulted with injuries and provocations, he
   had perpetual occasion for the practice of forgiveness; and that in
   greater instances, and upon occasion of greater injuries, than any of
   us are capable of receiving. He who could never stand in need of
   forgiveness from men, who needed none from God, who had it always in
   his power to have revenged with ease, and to the utmost, all the
   provocations and affronts that were offered to him; he who had none of
   those powerful inducements to forgiveness which we have, was thus ready
   to forgive; and did it perpetually, upon the greatest, upon innumerable
   occasions; he forgave his enemies, all their ill-will toward him, and
   all their vile and malicious usage of him throughout his whole life:
   but most remark ably at his death, when the provocations were greatest
   and most violent, when they fell thick and in storms upon him, and when
   they were most grievous and piercing, in the very agony and anguish of
   his sufferings; in these hard and pressing circumstances, he was so far
   from breathing out threatening and revenge against the authors of his.
   cruel sufferings, that with his last breath he did most effectually
   declare his free forgiveness of them, and perfect charity toward them,
   by his fervent prayer to God for them; "Father, forgive them, for they
   know not what they do."

   5. And lastly, Our Saviour is likewise a pattern to us of the most
   needful virtues, and for the practice whereof there is the greatest and
   most frequent occasion in human life.

   Several of these I have already mentioned under the former heads: as
   sincerity, which hath an universal influence upon all our actions; and
   is a principal ingredient into all the duties and services which we are
   to perform to God and men; humility and meekness, for the exercise
   whereof there is almost continual occasion in all our conversation with
   others. These have been spoken to, I shall therefore instance in some
   others, which are likewise of great and frequent use in human life.

   (1.) The great humanity of his carriage and deportment, of which he
   gave manifold instances, in his free and familiar conversation with all
   sorts of people. He did not despise the meanest. How familiarly did he
   talk with the woman of Samaria? insomuch that his disciples were
   offended at it, and "marvelled that he talked with her." He did not
   decline the conversation of the worst of men, where he had any hope of
   making them better by it; and though his companying "with publicans and
   sinners" was often objected as matter of scandal to him, yet he would
   not for that reason neglect any opportunity of doing good. He was
   affable to his inferiors, to the meanest person that had occasion to
   speak with him; yea, he rebuked his disciples, for forbidding the
   little children to come to him. They would have kept them from him,
   because they could not imagine to what purpose they should be permitted
   to come to him: but though they were not capable of his instructions,
   yet they were of his kindness and blessing. "He took them up in his
   arms, and laid his hands upon them, and blessed them;" and he proposed
   them to his disciples as emblems of that innocency and simplicity,
   without which no man shall enter into the kingdom of God.

   His humanity likewise appeared in the tenderness and compassion of his
   nature, towards all that were in want or misery of any kind. "He healed
   all manner of sicknesses and diseases among the people, and went about
   doing good." And when his followers, by their long attendance upon him
   hi desert and solitary places to hear his doctrine, were pinched with
   hunger, he could not find in his heart to dismiss them without some
   refreshment; and, having no other means, did it by a miracle. He was
   very apt to sympathize with the condition of others, to weep with them
   that wept, as he did with the friends of Lazarus over his grave: nay,
   he had a tenderness for his enemies; when he beheld Jerusalem, and the
   sad fate which hung over it for their obstinate impenitency, he could
   not refrain from tears at the thoughts of it.

   Another instance of his humanity was his easiness to be entreated, and
   readiness to yield to the request of those who desired his company, or
   implored his help and assistance. And as he was most ready to do good
   to all, so he did not disdain to receive kindness from any; complying
   cheerfully with the desires of those who invited him to their houses,
   and accepting kindly any well-intended respect. How did he resent the
   extraordinary kindness of the devout woman, who poured the box of rich
   ointment upon his head! taking care that the memory of it should be
   transmitted to all generations, and proclaimed over the whole world,
   (Matt. xxvi. 13.)

   (2.) Another very needful virtue, and for which our Lord was very
   eminent, was his neglect and disregard of the opinion of men, in
   comparison of his duty. As he was not affected, much less puffed up,
   with their applause (which is an argument of a vain and light mind), so
   was he as little moved with their censures and reproaches, by which he
   was neither disordered in his passions, nor discouraged from
   well-doing. He took heed to his duty, and made sure to do the things
   which pleased God, and was not very solicitous what men said or thought
   of him. He observed in the pharisees, how great a temptation and
   hinderance to the receiving of his doctrine an undue regard to the
   praise and censure of men was: "they loved the praise of men more than
   the praise of God," as he tells us; (John xii. 43.) and, (chap. v. 44.)
   "How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not,
   the honour which cometh from God only?" Not that we are to slight and
   neglect the opinion of others concerning our actions, that is pride and
   self-conceit; and our Lord himself was not so regardless of his
   reputation, as not to take great care to give no just occasion of
   censure, no needless handle to slander and calumny; he vindicated
   himself upon all occasions, and was ready to give a fair and reasonable
   account of his actions, to those who found fault with them, nay, even
   maliciously carped at them; he prudently avoided occasions of offence,
   and, by wise and cautious answers, many times avoided the snares that
   were laid to bring him under obloquy and reproach: but in competition
   with his plain duty, he neither regarded the applause nor censures of
   men; he complied with them in nothing that was bad, to gain their good
   opinion and esteem; nor was he hindered and discouraged from any thing
   that was good, for fear of being ill-spoken of, or of having a bad
   interpretation put upon his good actions.

   And this is a virtue very necessary to a good man, especially in bad
   times, and requires a good degree of fortitude and firmness of
   resolution to make a man master of it. And it is not more necessary
   than it is reasonable: for it is not in our power, whether men shall
   speak well or ill of us; but it is in our power, whether we will do
   well or ill. It is many times impossible to please men, they are so
   divided in their opinions about good and evil; but we may make sure to
   please God, and to gain his praise and approbation, "whose judgment is
   always according to truth." It is a vain and endless thing to live up
   to the humours and opinions of men, which are variable and uncertain;
   but if we keep steady to our duty, we live to the consciences of men,
   which first or last will come to themselves, and come over to us, and
   approve of that which is good. This is, as St. Paul speaks, "to commend
   ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God."

   (3.) Another virtue for which there is great occasion in human life,
   and for which our Lord was very remarkable, was his contentedness in a
   mean and poor condition; and such was his condition to the very lowest
   degree. He was destitute of the ordinary conveniences and necessary
   supports of life; he lived generally upon the kindness and charity of
   others, and when that failed, and he wanted ordinary supports, as he
   often did, he was maintained by miracle: and yet, in this mean and
   necessitous condition, he had a constant evenness and serenity of mind;
   he had no anxious care and solicitude upon him, "what he should eat,
   and what he should drink, or wherewithal he should be clothed;" he
   never murmured at the unequal providence of God, never uttered one
   discontented or envious word at the plenty and prosperity of others; he
   rather pitied the misfortune of rich and great men, who were exposed to
   so many temptations, that it was very hard for them, in his opinion, to
   be saved; but he enjoyed himself, and served God, and went about doing
   good, and depended upon the providence of God for his daily food; and
   if at any time that was wanting, he tells his disciples, that he had
   meat to eat which they knew not of; for it was his meat and drink to do
   the will of his Father. By all that appears in the history of his life
   (and we are sure that it is true), no man was ever poorer, and yet no
   man ever more contented than he was; which is not only an example of
   contentedness to those, whom the providence of God hath placed in the
   extremity of meanness and want, but a much stronger and more forcible
   argument of contentment in every condition. For discontent is not only
   the portion of the poor, but of those who have a competency, because
   they have not plenty; and many times of those who have plenty and
   abundance, because they are wanton and foolish, and know not what they
   would have; so that our Saviour, by giving an example of contentment to
   those of the poorest and meanest condition, hath given it much more to
   those who are in better circumstances. A narrow fortune is riches in
   comparison of none; a competency is plenty, compared with poverty, and
   the want of the ordinary accommodations of life. If the Son of God
   submitted to the lowest and poorest condition, and bore it with so much
   evenness and tranquillity of mind; well may we-, if God call us to it.
   If he that was "heir of all things," was destitute of all things, and
   well contented to be so; shall we murmur and repine, if we be in the
   same circumstances? If this example be of any force (as it is certainly
   of the greatest), should the providence of God see fit to reduce us to
   the lowest condition of want, we have no reason for discontent; but if
   he affords us a competency, we have no colour and pretence for it,
   unless we think ourselves better than the Son of God, and can claim a
   greater right to the possessions and enjoyments of this world, than he
   that made it.

   Before this example, we might have thought that poverty and meanness
   had been a sign of God's hatred and displeasure, or at least an
   argument of less love and regard: but now that we see him, whom God
   loved infinitely better than any man in the world, to have been one of
   the poorest men that ever lived; this is a demonstration, that a man
   may be entirely beloved of God, though he be in the poorest and most
   destitute condition; for in such a condition he thought fit to place
   his beloved Son, "in whom he was well-pleased." And if poverty be
   consistent with the highest degree of God's love and favour, we may
   bear it contentedly; and if there be reason for contentment even in
   poverty, to be discontented in any condition that is above it, is
   shameful and intolerable. Of such force is this example of our Lord, to
   banish discontent from any condition we are liable to in this world.
   The

   (4.) Fourth and last virtue I shall instance in, and for the exercise
   whereof there is very great and frequent occasion in human life, is
   patience under sufferings, and such a perfect resignation of ourselves
   to the will of God, that whatever pleaseth him should please us, how
   distasteful and grievous soever it be. And of this virtue our blessed
   Saviour was the greatest example that ever was; his whole life, from
   his birth to his death, was made up of persecution and patience, and
   was a continual exercise of his virtue. There had been great examples
   in all ages of the sufferings and patience of good men, which we might
   propound to ourselves with great advantage; and so St. James exhorts
   the Christians to do: (James v. 10.) "Take, my brethren, the prophets,
   who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering
   affliction, and of patience." Job, especially, was a most eminent
   example in this kind: "Ye have heard (says he) of the patience of Job."
   And all these examples are of great use, and considerable arguments to
   this virtue; but the pat tern of our Lord's sufferings and patience is
   a greater example, and a more powerful argument than all these. His
   sufferings were far greater than any man's ever were; "Never was any
   sorrow like to his sorrow, wherewith the Lord afflicted him in the day
   of his fierce anger:" and his patience was greater than any man's ever
   was, not only because he suffered more than any one of the sons of men
   ever did, but because he suffered without cause, being perfectly
   innocent, and free from the least personal fault and guilt. Well may we
   "bear the indignation of the Lord patiently," because "we have sinned
   against him." Whatever we suffer, our consciences tell us we have
   deserved it all, and much more from the hand of God, and that our
   punishment is always less than our iniquities have deserved. Sin is at
   the bottom of all our sufferings, and if we be buffeted for our faults,
   we ought to take it patiently. Upon this consideration, St. Peter
   recommends to us the example of our Lord's sufferings and patience, as
   a powerful argument to work the same temper and disposition in us: (1
   Pet. ii. 20-22.) "For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for
   your faults, ye shall take it patiently? But if when you do well and
   suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God. For
   hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving
   us an example, that ye should follow his steps, who did no sin." Where
   the apostle insinuates a two fold difference between our Lord's
   suffering for us and ours. He suffered for us: but we upon our own
   account, and for our own faults. He was perfectly innocent, "He had no
   sin," and yet he suffered with so much patience; much more ought we:
   for by how much the more guilt, so much the greater reason for
   patience; and the more innocent the person is that suffers, so much the
   more perfect and commendable is his patience.

   So that the greatness of our Lord's sufferings, considered together
   with his perfect innocency, gives his example a peculiar force and
   advantage above all other examples whatsoever. And therefore the
   apostle to the Hebrews, after a great number of examples of the
   persecution and patience of the saints in all ages, not content with
   these, he adds that of our Lord, as the most perfect and powerful
   example of all others: (Heb. xii. 1-3.) "Wherefore, seeing we also are
   compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us run with
   patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author
   and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that was set before him,
   endured the cross, despising the shame. For consider him that endured
   such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be weary and
   faint in your minds." "Such contradiction of sinners;" such as no man
   ever endured; and yet he bore all this, not with a stoical and stupid
   insensibility, but with a true patience. For no man had greater
   apprehensions of suffering, and a more quick and tender sense of it,
   than he had. He had not only the more manly virtues of wisdom, and
   resolution, and constancy; but was clothed also with the softer
   passions of human nature, meekness, and compassion, and grief, and a
   tender sense of pain and suffering. "He took our infirmities, (says the
   prophet) and bore our griefs." And this he expressed both in his agony
   in the garden, and in his behaviour upon the cross; he did not despise
   pain, but dreaded it, and yet submitted to it; he did not outbrave his
   sufferings, but bore them decently; he had a human sense of them, but
   under went them with a Divine patience, resigning himself absolutely to
   the will of God, when he saw them coming; and when they were upon him,
   expressing a great sense of pain, without the least sign of impatience.
   And hereby he was a pattern accommodated to the weakest and tenderest
   of mankind: he did not give us an extravagant example of bravery, and a
   sturdy resolution; but, which was much fitter for us, of a patient
   submission to the will of God, under a great sense of suffering.

   Before I come to the fifth and last advantage of our Lord's example, it
   will be requisite to clear what hath been said from three or four
   obvious objections. But this I shall reserve for another discourse.

SERMON CXC.

    [Preached March 25, 1686.]

  THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST CONSIDERED, AS OUR EXAMPLE.

   Leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.--1 Pet. ii. 21.

   THE example of Christ is an argument never un seasonable; and though it
   be somewhat foreign to the occasion of this day, yet it will afford us
   some thing not improper to be considered by us, concerning the blessed
   mother of our Lord. I have handled this argument of our Lord's example
   very largely, and, among other things, have shewn the manifold
   advantages of it, in these following respects:

   I. That the example of our Lord is a most absolute and perfect pattern,
   being the life of God, in the nature and likeness of man.

   II. A most familiar and easy example, in which we see the several
   virtues of a good life practised in such instances, and upon such
   occasions, as do frequently happen in human life.

   III. It is an encouraging example; nothing being more apt to give life
   to good resolutions and endeavours, than to see all that which God
   requires of us, performed by one in our own nature, and a man as like
   ourselves, as it is possible for a perfect pattern to be.

   IV. It is likewise an universal example, calculated as equally as it is
   possible for all conditions and capacities of men, and fitted for
   general direction and imitation of all sorts of virtue and goodness;
   such virtues as are the greatest and most substantial, the most rare
   and unusual, the most useful and beneficial to others, the most hard
   and difficult to be practised, and for the exercise whereof there is
   the greatest and most frequent occasion in human life. There remains
   now only to be spoken to, the

   V. Fifth and last advantage, which I mentioned of our Lord's example;
   that it is, in the nature of it, very powerful to engage and oblige all
   men to the imitation of it. But before I enter upon this, I proposed to
   clear what hath been already said concerning our Lord's example from
   three or four obvious objections.

   The first objection is, that a great part of our Saviour's life
   consisted of miraculous actions, wherein we cannot imitate him.

   This is very true; and for that very reason, because we cannot imitate
   him herein, we are not obliged to do it: but we may imitate the
   compassion and charity which he shewed in his miracles, by such ways,
   and in such effects, as are within the compass of our power. We are not
   anointed, as he was, "with the Holy Ghost, and with power to heal all
   manner of sickness and disease:" but we may "go about doing good," as
   he did, so far as we have ability and opportunity; we may comfort those
   in their sickness and distress, whom we are not able in a miraculous
   manner to recover and relieve; and in diseases that are curable, we may
   help the poorer at the expense of our charity, and do that by slower
   and ordinary means, which our Saviour did by a word in an instant.

   Secondly, Against the universality of our Saviour's example, it is
   objected, that he hath givenas no pattern of some conditions and
   relations of life, for which there seems to have been as great need and
   reason as for any other.

   To this I answer, that though his single state of life did hinder him
   from being formally an example as to some of the most common relations,
   as of a father and a husband; yet he was virtually so in the principle
   and practice of universal charity, which principle, if it be truly
   rooted in us, will sufficiently guide and direct us in the duties of
   particular relations.

   And whereas it is further objected, that he hath left us no example of
   that, which by many is esteemed the only religious state of life; viz.
   perfect retirement from the world, for the more devout serving of God,
   and freeing us from the temptations of the world, such as is that of
   monks and hermits; this, perhaps, may seem to some a great oversight
   and omission: but our Lord in great wisdom thought fit to give a
   pattern of a quite different sort of life, which was, not to fly the
   conversation of men, and to live in a monastery or a wilderness; but to
   do good among men, to live in the world with great freedom, and with
   great innocency. He did, indeed, sometimes retire himself, for the more
   free and private exercise of devotion, as we ought to do; but he passed
   his life chiefly in the conversation of men, that they might have all
   the benefit that was possible of his instruction and example. We read,
   that "he was carried into the wilderness to be tempted;" but not that
   he lived there, to avoid temptation. He hath given us an example of
   denying the world, without leaving it; and of renouncing, not only the
   pomp and vanity, but even the lawful enjoyments and conveniences of
   life, when it may serve to any good end, either of glory to God, or of
   advantage to men; teaching us hereby, that charity is a duty no less
   necessary than devotion; that we cannot serve God better, than by
   endeavouring the good and happiness of men. So that if our Saviour's
   example be of authority with us, that will soon decide which is the
   most perfect state of life, to go out of the world, or to live
   innocently and usefully in it. And since neither our Saviour nor his
   apostles have recommended it to us by their example, nor by one word of
   precept or counsel tending that way, it seems very plain that they did
   not esteem monkery the most perfect, much less the only religious,
   state of life. There could not have been so deep a silence throughout
   the New Testament concerning so important a piece of religion, as the
   church of Rome would bear us in hand this is: for to be professed of
   some monastical order, they call entering into religion; and they speak
   of it as the most direct and ready way to heaven; and not only so, but
   they give fair encouragement to believe, that to die, or be buried in a
   monk's habit, will go a great way (they are loath to tell us how far),
   in the carrying of a bad man towards heaven, or at least to the
   abatement of his pain in purgatory.

   Thirdly, It is objected, that some particulars of our Saviour's
   carriage towards rulers and magistrates seem liable to exception, and
   not proper for our imitation: as, his bold reproofs of the scribes and
   pharisees, many of whom were chief rulers, and of greatest authority
   among them; and his message to Herod, "Go and tell that fox." This
   opprobrious and reproachful treatment of magistrates seems directly
   contrary to an express law of God: (Exod. xxii. 28.) "Thou shalt not
   revile the gods, (or judges,) nor speak evil of the ruler of thy
   people."

   But to this the answer is plain: that our Lord used this freedom by the
   virtue and privilege of his prophetical office, and of his immediate
   commission from God; it being the office of prophets, and a part of
   their commission, to reprove kings and rulers with all freedom and
   plainness, because they were really superior to them in the execution
   of that office. In all positive laws of respect to superiors, there is
   an exception of the Divine commission; because, in that case, the
   prophet speaks in the name, and by the authority of one infinitely
   greater than the greatest upon earth; as, in the Lord's name, and by
   his commission, any man may check inferior magistrates, and that in
   such a manner, as would be rudeness and insolence for any other, not so
   war ranted, to do it. And of this there are manifold examples in the
   prophets of the Old Testament; and what the tenor of their commission
   was, t we may see in that given to the prophet Jeremiah: (chap. i. ver.
   10.) "Behold, I have set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms,
   to root out, and to pull up, and to destroy, and to throw down, to
   build, and to plant," (that, is, to denounce judgments and calamities,
   or peace and prosperity to them;) and, (ver. 17, 18.) "Thou therefore
   gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command
   thee; be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
   For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron
   pillar, and brazen walls .against the whole land; against the kings of
   Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and
   against the people of the land." This commission set him above them all
   in the discharge of his office: and therefore, what our Lord did in
   this kind, by virtue of an extraordinary commission, and the privilege
   of a prophet immediately sent by God, is not to be drawn into example
   in ordinary cases: for we may do that by special commission from God,
   which the ordinary rules of duty, and respect to princes and governors,
   will by no means allow to be done.

   The fourth and last objection is, that our blessed Saviour does not
   seem to bear himself with that duty and respect towards his mother,
   which that relation seems to require. And to speak according to the
   first appearance of things, this seems to be, of all other, the most
   exceptionable part of his life, and to require some particular and
   extraordinary reason, not so obvious at first sight, for the
   vindication of it

   There are, to my best remembrance and observation, but five passages in
   the history of our Saviour's life, concerning his carriage towards his
   mother, and his discourse with her, and of her; in all which he seems
   rather to treat her with some appearance of neglect, than with any
   great show of reverence and respect. Not that we are to imagine, but
   that he did pay her an entire duty; for we know that he "fulfilled all
   righteousness:" but, for reasons best known to his infinite wisdom, he
   thought fit very much to conceal it in his public behaviour, and to
   have as little notice taken of it in the history of his life.

   And the first passage is, Luke ii. 48. when his parents having lost
   him, at last found him in the temple disputing among the doctors; and
   his mother reproved him, "Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us?
   behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing:" he gives them
   this short and obscure answer, which they knew not what to make of;
   "How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my
   Father's business?" This happened when he was but twelve years old. And
   that we may not think, that, during his minority, he did ordinarily
   assume this behaviour towards his parents, but only upon this first
   essay of his public appearance, the evangelist purposely adds, (ver.
   51.) that "he went down with his parents to Nazareth, and was subject
   to them."

   The second passage is, John ii. 4. when his mother desiring him to work
   a miracle, at his first appearance and entrance upon his public
   ministry, he takes occasion to declare to her, that he was discharged
   from her conduct and government, and this in terms to all appearance of
   no great respect: "Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not
   yet come." Greg. Nyssen reads both sentences with an interrogation:
   "What have I to do with thee? is not mine hour now come?" As if he had
   said, "Why dost thou interpose in these matters? is not the time come,
   that I am to enter upon my office; and in the discharge of it, to be
   directed by God, and none else?"

   The third passage is, Matt. xii. 47. when he was told, that his mother
   and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him: "Who is my
   mother (says he), and who are my brethren?" And pointing to his
   disciples, "Behold my mother, and my brethren; for whosoever shall do
   the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and
   sister, and mother." Here is but little appearance of regard; for we do
   not find that he left the business he was about, to speak with her when
   she desired it. Nor, it seems, did she understand her power so well as
   the church of Rome hath done since, when (as is to be seen in some of
   their mass-books) they address to her in these terms, Jure matris
   impera redemptori; "By the authority of a mother, command the
   Redeemer."

   The fourth passage is not much different from the former; (Luke xi. 27,
   28.) when "a certain woman said to him, Blessed is the womb that bare
   thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked: he said, Yea, rather blessed
   are they that hear the word of God, and keep it." He does not deny what
   was said in honour of her, but turns his discourse another way; and,
   foreseeing the danger of a superstitious veneration of her, he seems to
   bring her down to the same level with all sincere Christians; teaching
   us, that no external privilege or relation, how glorious so ever, no,
   not that of being the mother of the Son of God, was so valuable as
   doing the will of God: "Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word
   of God, and keep it."

   The last passage is at the time of his death: (John xix. 25-27.) "Now
   there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother: when Jesus therefore saw
   his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto
   his mother, Woman, behold thy son: then saith he to the disciple.
   Behold thy mother. And from that hour that disciple took her unto his
   own home." Here, indeed, he shewed his great kindness and concernment
   for her, in committing her to the care of his best-beloved friend; but
   yet without any extraordinary demonstration of respect in the manner of
   it.

   These are all the passages I know in the gospel, which concern our
   Lord's carriage towards his mother; which, upon the whole matter, is so
   strange, that we cannot imagine but there must be some special and
   extraordinary reason for it: and we who have lived to see and know what
   hath happened in the Christian world, are now able to give a better
   account of this great caution and reservedness in his behaviour towards
   her; namely, that, out of his infinite wisdom and foresight, he so
   demeaned himself towards her, that he might lay no temptation before
   men, nor give the least occasion to the idolizing of her. He always
   called her "woman:" and by the privilege of his Divinity and high
   office, hardly seems to pay her the respect due to a mother, that he
   might restrain all Christians from worshipping her as a Deity: or if
   they did, that they might have no colour or excuse for it, from any
   thing he said or did. This is so probable an account of that which
   might otherwise seem so unaccountable, that I persuade myself, that all
   unprejudiced persons will readily assent to it. And, which is farther
   remarkable in this matter, the apostles of our Lord, in all their
   writings, use the same reservedness, and, no doubt, by the direction of
   the same Spirit, concerning the blessed mother of our Lord. For,
   throughout the history of the Acts, and all the Epistles of the
   apostles, there is but one mention made of her, and that only by the
   by; (Acts i. 14.) where it is said, that the "disciples all continued
   with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary
   the mother of Jesus." So far are they from proposing her for an object
   of our worship, that they only once make mention of her, and that
   joining with others in prayer and supplication to God, without any
   special remark concerning her; much less do they speak of any devotion
   paid to her.

   And surely, if this "blessed among women," the mother of our Lord (for
   I keep to the titles which the Scripture gives her), have any sense of
   what we do here below, she cannot but look down with the greatest
   disdain upon that sacrilegious and idolatrous worship which is paid to
   her, to the high dishonour of the great God and our Saviour, and the
   infinite scandal of his religion. How can she, with out indignation,
   behold how they play the fool in the church of Rome about her? What an
   idol they make of her image? and with what sottishness they give Divine
   honour to it! How they place her in their idolatrous pictures in equal
   rank with the blessed Trinity, and turn the salutation of the angel,
   Ave Maria, "Hail Mary, full of grace," into a kind of prayer; and in
   their bead-roll of devotion repeat it ten times, for once that they say
   the Lord's Prayer, as of greater virtue and efficacy! And, indeed, they
   almost justle out the devotion due to Almighty God, and our blessed
   Saviour, by their endless idolatry to her.

   So that the greater part of their religion, both public and private, is
   made up of that which was no part at all of the religion of the
   apostles and primitive Christians; nay, which plainly contradicts it:
   for that expressly teaches us that there is but one object of our
   prayers, and one Mediator, by whom we are to make our addresses to God.
   "There is one God; and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ
   Jesus," says St. Paul, when he gives a standing rule concerning prayer
   in the Christian church. And yet, notwithstanding all the care that our
   blessed Saviour and his apostles could take to prevent the gross
   idolatry of the blessed mother of our Lord, how blindly and wilfully
   have the church of Rome run into it: and, in despite of the clearest
   evidence and conviction, do obstinately and impudently persist in it,
   and justify themselves in so abominable a practice. I come now to the

   V. Fifth and last advantage of our Lord's example, that it is in the
   nature of it very powerful, to engage and oblige all men to the
   imitation of it.

   It is almost equally calculated for persons of all capacities and
   conditions, for the wise and the weak, for those of high and low
   degree; for all men are alike concerned to be happy. And the imitation
   of this example is the most ready and direct way to it, the most
   effectual means we can use to compass this great and universal end;
   nay, it is not only the means, but the end, the best and most essential
   part of it. To be like our Lord, is to be as good as it is possible for
   men to be; and goodness is the highest perfection that any being is
   capable of; and the perfection of every being is its happiness.

   There is a kind of contagion in all examples; men are very apt to do
   what they see others do, though it be very bad: every day's experience
   furnisheth us with many and sad instances of the influence of bad
   examples; but there are peculiar charms in that which is good and
   excellent. A perfect pattern of goodness does strongly allure and
   invite to the imitation of it, and a great example of virtue to a
   well-disposed mind is a mighty temptation, and apt to inspirit us with
   good resolutions, to endeavour after that in ourselves, which we so
   much esteem and admire in others. And such is the example of our Lord,
   perfect as is possible, and yet obvious to common imitation, and as
   much fitted for the general direction of mankind in all sorts of virtue
   and goodness, as any one single example can be imagined to be.

   The virtues of his life are pure, without any mixture of infirmity and
   imperfection. He had humility without meanness of spirit; innocency
   without weakness; wisdom without cunning; and constancy and resolution
   in that which was good, without stiffness of conceit, and
   peremptoriness of humour: in a word, his virtues were shining without
   vanity, heroical without any thing of transport, and very extra
   ordinary without being in the least extravagant.

   His life was even and of one tenor, quiet, and without noise and
   tumult, always employed about the same work, in doing the things which
   pleased God, and were of greatest benefit and advantage to men. Who
   would not write after such a copy; so perfect, and yet so familiar, and
   fit for our imitation? Who would not be ambitious to live the life
   which God lived, when he was pleased to become man, and dwell among us?

   We are ambitious to imitate those whom we esteem, and are apt to have
   their example in great dearness and regard, from whom we have received
   great kindness and mighty benefits. This pattern, which our religion
   proposeth to us, is the example of one whom we ought to reverence, and
   whom we have reason to love above any person in the world; it is the
   example of our Lord and master, of our sovereign and our Saviour, of
   the founder of our religion, and of the author and finisher of our
   faith; it is an example that carries authority with it, and commands
   our imitation. "You call me Lord and Master," says he himself,
   recommending to us the example of his own humility. (John xiii. 13,
   14.) "You call me Lord and Master, and ye say well; for so I am. If I
   then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to
   wash one another's feet;" that is, stoop to the lowest and meanest
   office to serve one another; "for I have given you an example, that ye
   should do as I have done to you."

   Yet farther, it is the example of our best friend and greatest
   benefactor, of him who laid down his life for us, and sealed his love
   to us with his own blood; and, while we were bitter enemies to him, did
   and suffered more for us, than any man ever did for his dearest friend.
   How powerfully must such a pattern recommend goodness, and kindness,
   and compassion to us, who have had so much comfort and advantage from
   them? Had not the Son of God commiserated our case, and pitied and
   relieved us in our low and wretched condition, we had been extremely,
   and for ever miserable, beyond all imagination, and past all remedy.
   All the kindness and compassion, all the mercy and forgiveness he would
   have us practise towards one another, he himself first exercised upon
   us; and surely we have a much greater obligation upon us to the
   practice of these virtues than he had: for he did all this for our
   sakes, we do it for our own. We have a natural obligation, both in
   point of duty and interest; his was voluntary, and what he took upon
   himself, that he might at once be a Saviour and an example to us. He
   that commands us to do good to others, was our great benefactor; he
   that requires us to forgive our enemies, shed his own blood for the
   forgiveness of our sins; while we were enemies to him, laid down his
   life for us, making himself the example of that goodness, which he
   commands us to shew to others.

   Are any of us reduced to poverty and want? let us think of him, who,
   being Lord of all, "had not where to lay his head; who being rich, for
   our sakes became a beggar, that we through his poverty might be made
   rich: Are we persecuted for righteousness sake, and exercised with
   sufferings and reproaches? "Let us run with patience the race which is
   set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our
   faith, who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross,
   despising the shame."

   When we are ready to be discouraged in well doing, by the opposition we
   meet withal from the ingratitude of men, and the malicious
   interpretation of our good actions, perverting the best things, done
   with the best mind and to the best ends, to some ill purpose and
   design, "consider him who endured such contradiction of sinners against
   himself, lest you be weary and faint in your minds."

   Can we be proud, when the Son of God "hum bled himself, and became of
   no reputation;" emptied himself of all his glory, and was contented to
   be "despised and rejected of men?" Shall we be covetous, and thirst
   after the things of this world, when we consider how the Son of God
   despised them, and trampled upon them? Shall we contemn and despise the
   poor; nay, can we choose but esteem them for his sake, whom they
   resemble, and whose low and indigent condition in the world hath made
   poverty not only tolerable, but glorious? Can we be peevish and fro
   ward, and apt to fly out into passion upon every little occasion, when
   we consider the meekness of the Son of God, and with what serenity and
   evenness of mind he demeaned himself, under great and continual
   provocations? Shall we be discontented in any condition, when we
   consider how contented the Son of God was in the meanest and most
   destitute condition; how he welcomed all events, and was so perfectly
   resigned to the will of his heavenly Father, that whatsoever pleased
   God, pleased him? Shall we be so ready to separate from the communion
   of the church of God, upon pretence of something that we think amiss,
   or less pure and perfect (which will always be in this world); when the
   Son of God lived and died in the communion of a church guilty of great
   corruptions both in doctrine and practice, such as can with no colour
   be objected to ours?

   Shall we resent injuries, slanders, and calumnies so heinously, as to
   be out of all patience, when we consider with what meekness of temper,
   and how little disturbance of mind, the Son of God bore all these; how
   "he gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked
   off the hair, and with held not his face from shame and spitting?" How
   "he was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as the sheep before the
   shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth; being reviled, he reviled
   not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself
   to him that judgeth righteously?" Such vile and barbarous usage the Son
   of God met withal; and yet, under all this, he possessed his soul in
   patience: and do we expect to be better treated than he was? Was
   goodness itself contented to be traduced, and evil spoken of, perfect
   innocence to be slandered and persecuted; and shall we, who are
   sinners, great sinners, think ourselves worthy to escape these things,
   and too good to have that done to us, which was done to one infinitely
   better than we are? It is our Lord's own argument, and there is great
   weight and reason in it; "if the world hate you, ye know that it hated
   me before it hated you. Remember the word that I said unto you, the
   servant is not greater than the lord. If they have persecuted me, they
   will also persecute you; it is enough for the disciple that he be as
   his master, and the servant as his lord: if they have called the Master
   of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of the
   household?"

   Can we entertain thoughts of revenge, when we have such a pattern of
   forgiving before us, who poured out his blood for the expiation of the
   guilt of them that shed it, and spent his last breath in fervent and
   charitable prayers for his betrayers and murderers? Lord endow us with
   the like temper; but do not try us with the like sufferings.

   Thus by setting the example of our Lord before us, and keeping this
   pattern always in our eye, we may continually correct all our own
   errors and defects, all the distempers of our minds, and the faults and
   irregularities of our lives; we may argue ourselves into all kind of
   virtue and goodness, and from such an example be strongly excited and
   sweetly led to the practice of it.

   Let us not be discouraged by the consideration of our own weakness; for
   he who hath given us such an example of virtue, is ready likewise to
   give us his Holy Spirit, to assist and enable us to conform ourselves
   to this pattern of our Lord and Master, and to follow the blessed steps
   of his holy life.

   "Now the God of peace," &c.

SERMON CXCI.

  THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST CONSIDERED, AS A PROPER MEANS OF OUR SALVATION.

   But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block, and
   unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews
   and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.--1 Cor. i.
   23, 24.

   THE sufferings of the Son of God for the sins of men, as they are a
   subject never improper to be insisted on; so they are more especially
   seasonable at this time, [2] which the Christian church hath for so
   many ages set apart for the solemn commemoration of them, in order to
   our more due preparation for the receiving the sacrament at Easter;
   which next after the Lord's day (which was set apart by the apostles
   for a weekly commemoration of our Saviour's resurrection) is the first
   and most solemn festival that is taken notice of in ecclesiastical
   antiquity, to be generally observed by Christians; at which time all
   Christians that were admitted to those sacred mysteries, did receive
   the holy sacrament; and, for this reason, I have pitched upon this
   subject at this time.

   Among all the prejudices that were raised against the Christian
   religion, when it first appeared in the world, this was the greatest of
   all other, that the first author of this doctrine should come to so
   miserable and shameful an end, as to die upon the cross; that the Son
   of God should be "delivered into the hands of men," to be so cruelly
   and ignominiously handled. This both Jews and Greeks laid hold on, as
   the most popular objection against Christianity, and matter of just
   reproach to that religion, which pretended to be brought from heaven by
   the Son of God: for though he called himself the Son of God, yet he
   died like a man; and, not only so, but suffered as a malefactor.

   But, notwithstanding the odium of this objection, the apostles of our
   Lord and Saviour, who were sent by him to publish his doctrine to the
   world, did not, in the least, endeavour to hide and dissemble the
   matter; but did openly, and without disguise, declare to the world,
   that he in whom they believed, and endeavoured to persuade others to
   believe, was for speaking the truth, which he had heard from God,
   arraigned at Jerusalem, and there "by wicked hands crucified and
   slain." And though they knew that this seemed very foolish and absurd,
   both to Jews and Gentiles, whom they designed to convert to
   Christianity, and did extremely prejudice them against it; yet
   nevertheless they persisted in the course they had begun, leaving God
   to do his own work, in his own way; and they found the success of it.
   For, though it was a very plain story which they told the world, and
   appeared even ridiculous to those who thought themselves the wisest and
   ablest judges of these matters; yet being the truth of God, it had a
   mighty efficacy upon the minds of men, notwithstanding all the
   prejudice that was raised against it. "It pleased God, by the
   foolishness of preaching, to save them that believe;" by this doctrine
   which seemed so absurd to human reason, to gain many to the belief and
   entertainment of it.

   Indeed, it was not suited to the genius either of the Jews or gentiles;
   for they, according to their different ways of institution, expected
   quite another thing: (ver. 22.) "The Jews require a sign, and the
   Greeks seek after wisdom."--"The Jews require a sign:" they expected
   the apostles should have given some extraordinary testimony from
   heaven, such as was Elias's calling for fire down from heaven, to
   consume those that opposed and resisted them. Such things as these they
   read of the prophets in their law, and they expected the Messias would
   do the same, and greater things. And though in truth he did so, wrought
   more and greater miracles than Moses and all the prophets had done
   before him, yet their curiosity was not satisfied; and, not
   withstanding the great works which he did among them, they were
   continually importuning him for a sign: (Matt. xii. 38.) "Then certain
   of the scribes and pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a
   sign from thee." This seems a strange and unreasonable demand,
   considering the many and great works he had done among them, which were
   so generally known. So that, in all probability, it was some particular
   and peculiar kind of miracle which they desired, as appears from Matt
   xvi. 1. "The pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting,
   desired him, that he would shew them a sign from heaven." He had
   wrought many miracles on earth, in healing the sick, and opening the
   eyes of the blind, and the ears of the deaf, in cleansing the lepers,
   and making the lame to walk; but these they looked upon as an inferior
   sort of miracles, here was all this while no extraordinary thing
   immediately from heaven; if they could once see that, they would be
   satisfied. But when no such thing was done, and at last God permitted
   him to die upon the cross, as an impostor and seditious person; and it
   appeared plainly that he, who pretended to free others from diseases,
   could not save himself from death: this confirmed them in their
   unbelief, and upon good reason as they thought. And that this was a
   sign which they particularly expected, and thought they had cause so to
   do, appears by their upbraiding of him with the want of it in the time
   of his suffering: (Matt. xxvii. 39.) "And they that passed by reviled
   him, wagging their heads, and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple,
   and buildest it up in three days, save thyself: if thou be the Son of
   God, come down from the cross." And it was not only the malice and
   ignorance of the common people that objected this to him, but even the
   priests, and scribes, and elders, insisted upon the same thing (ver.
   41-43.) "Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
   and elders, said, He saved others, himself he cannot save: if he be the
   King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
   believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will
   have him: for he said, I am the Son of God." By this passage you see
   what it was the Jews expected; that if our Saviour had been the Son of
   God, he should have saved himself; when they went about to crucify him,
   that God should have rescued him out of their hands, and given some
   extraordinary testimony from heaven to his innocency; and, for this
   reason, the preaching of Christ crucified was very offensive to them:
   "The Jews require a sign; but we preach Christ crucified."

   Such was the temper and disposition of the Jews: but now the gentiles,
   according to their way of institution, expected that the apostles
   should have discoursed to them upon philosophical principles, and have
   demonstrated things to them in their way. "The Greeks seek after
   wisdom;" they were great searchers after wisdom and knowledge, and they
   valued nothing but what had the appearance of it, and what was
   delivered with great sharpness of wit and reasoning, and set off with
   art and eloquence. Had the apostles pretended to some new theory of
   natural or moral philosophy, and discoursed to them about the first
   principles of all things, about the chief good, or about the nature of
   the soul, they would have heard them with great patience and delight.
   Nothing but deep and subtle speculations, about these kind of
   arguments, did relish with them, and please their palates. But the
   history of our Saviour, his life, and death, and resurrection, and the
   plain precepts of his doctrine, were dry and insipid things to them,
   and were so far from having a shew of wisdom and philosophy, that they
   appeared foolish and ridiculous to them.

   But the design of God in the Christian religion, being not to please
   the humour and gratify the curiosity of men; but really to do them
   good, and to reform the manners of mankind, he used quite another
   method; which, how offensive soever it might be to those who thought
   themselves wise, yet it was really the wisest and most powerful means
   to that end: so the apostle tells us here in the text: "But we preach
   Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks
   foolishness: but unto them that are called, (that is, to those whose
   minds are duly prepared to consider things impartially, and to receive
   the truth) the power of God, and the wisdom of God;" a most wise and
   powerful means to reform the world, an eminent instance of the Divine
   power and wisdom.

   In these words we have these two things considerable:

   First, The exception which the world took at the doctrine of the
   gospel, upon account of our Saviour's sufferings: Christ crucified was
   "to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness."

   Secondly, That notwithstanding the seeming un reasonableness and
   absurdity of it, it was a most wise and effectual contrivance for the
   end to which it was designed and appointed: "But unto them which are
   called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom
   of God." I shall speak something to each of these, as briefly and
   plainly as I can. I begin with the

   First, The exception which the world took at the doctrine of the
   gospel, upon account of our Saviour's sufferings. The world were
   generally offended at it, but not all upon the same account; the Jews
   took one kind of exception against it, and the heathen another: "We
   preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the
   Greeks foolishness." They were both offended at the same thing, the low
   and suffering condition of our Saviour; but not upon the same reason.
   The Jews thought, that this mean appearance and condition of our
   Saviour, was unsuitable to the power of God; and the heathen, that it
   was not agreeable to the wisdom of men.

   The Jews, from the tradition of their fathers, to which (just as the
   church of Rome does now-a-days) they paid a greater reverence than to
   the written word of God, were possessed with a strong persuasion, that
   the Messias whom they expected, and was foretold by the prophets, was
   to be a great temporal prince, to appear in great splendour and glory,
   to be a mighty conqueror, and not only to free them from the Roman
   yoke, which they were then under; but to subdue all nations to them,
   and so bring them under their dominion and government. And this did so
   generally prevail among them, that even the disciples of our Saviour
   were as strongly possessed with this conceit as any of the rest;
   insomuch that the mother of James and John made it her solemn request
   to our Saviour, that "her two sons might sit, one on his right-hand,
   and the other on his left, in his kingdom." And though he had told his
   disciples just before, that he "must go up to Jerusalem, and suffer
   many things of the scribes and pharisees, and be betrayed and put to
   death;" yet the other conceit of his temporal dominion and greatness
   did so possess their minds, that "they could not understand this
   saying, and it was hid from them that they perceived it not," as St.
   Luke tells us. (Luke ix. 45.) Nay, even after his death and
   resurrection, when he appeared to them, this still stuck in their
   minds, as appears by that question which they asked him immediately
   before his ascension: (Acts i. 6.) "When they were come together, they
   asked of him, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to
   Israel?" They took it for granted, the Messias would do it one time or
   other, and they inquire of him, whether that were the time.

   So that the Jews being so firmly fixed in this conceit of the temporal
   reign of the Messias, nothing could be a greater stumbling-block to
   them, than the mean and suffering condition in which our Saviour
   appeared. The meanness of his birth and life was a great objection
   against him; but when they saw him put to death so ignominiously, and
   that he did not then shew his glory and power, to save himself from
   that cruel and shameful death, they could rather believe any thing than
   that this was the Messias foretold, and whom they had so long expected.
   They made full account that the Messias, whenever he came, would live
   in great splendour and glory, and do great things for the advantage and
   honour of their nation; the least they expected from him, was their
   deliverance from the Roman yoke, and the establishing of the throne of
   David for ever; or if his beginning had been obscure, that he would at
   last break forth in great lustre and majesty; or if they could have
   supposed that the Messias should be persecuted, and condemned, and
   nailed to the cross, yet they doubted not but then God would have given
   testimony to him by some sign from heaven, and have rescued him from
   the cross in a miraculous manner: but seeing nothing of all this,
   nothing but poverty and meanness, reproach and suffering attending him,
   they concluded, whatever miracles he pretended to, this could not be
   the Son of God, the true Messias.

   On the other side, the heathen philosophers, who were not possessed
   with these conceits about the Messias, they were offended at the
   unreasonableness and folly, as they thought, of the apostles doctrine,
   who went about to persuade the world, that a man, who had lately
   suffered and was crucified at Jerusalem, was a great prophet come into
   the world; nay, the Son of God, in whom all men ought to believe, and
   by whom they ought to hope for life and salvation: as if it were
   reasonable to think, that God would have exposed the most innocent and
   virtuous person that ever was, to so great reproach and sufferings,
   that the Son of God should die, and that life and immortality were to
   be hoped for from him, who was crucified and put to death. This they
   looked upon as a story so ill-framed, that to all wise and sagacious
   men, it destroyed its own credit and belief. For though they said he
   was risen again from the dead, yet before that could be entertained by
   men of philosophical minds, there were many deep points to be
   determined, as concerning the nature of the soul, and whether it can
   subsist separately from the body, and whether a body once dead can be
   restored to life again, and re-united to the soul.

   And as for his doctrine, which the apostles pretended to deliver, it
   was a plain and rude thing, without art or eloquence, nothing of deep
   speculation, or strict demonstration in it: in short, so far from being
   worthy of "a teacher come from God," that it was below the pitch of an
   ordinary philosopher. These and such-like things were, in all
   probability, the exceptions which the heathen philosophers took as the
   apostles preaching, concerning our Saviour's death and his doctrine;
   and they had some colour in them.

   But, upon impartial examination, it will appear, that, notwithstanding
   these exceptions, the sufferings of our Saviour, considered with all
   the circumstances that belong to them, were a very wise and effectual
   method made use of by Almighty God, for the reforming and saving the
   world. Which brings me to the

   Second thing propounded to speak to from these words; namely, To
   vindicate the wisdom of this design and contrivance of Almighty God,
   for the salvation of mankind by the sufferings of his Son, from the
   seeming absurdity and unreasonableness of it. "But unto them that are
   called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom
   of God." And,

   First, The Jews had no sufficient ground to be so much offended at the
   sufferings of the Messias. For,

   I. They had no reason to expect that the Messias should be a great
   temporal prince, if they had attended to the predictions of their
   prophets concerning him, which ought to have been their rule: for they
   affirm no such thing of him. All that they say of him, plainly refers
   to a spiritual kingdom, that he should "rule in righteousness," that he
   should "preach the gospel to the poor, and open the eyes of the blind,
   and unstop the ears of the deaf, and make the lame walk;" that he
   should "finish transgression, and make an end of sin, and make
   intercession for iniquity, and bring in ever lasting righteousness." So
   that, if they had not entertained a very groundless and carnal conceit
   concerning him, they could not so widely have mistaken the ancient
   prophecies of him, which ought to have guided them in these matters,
   and which they might have seen all plainly fulfilled in the person of
   our Saviour.

   II. The predictions concerning him do most expressly foretel his death
   and sufferings, and that with very particular circumstances: David in
   the 22d Psalm: Isaiah quite throughout his 53d chapter: and Daniel does
   particularly point out the time when he should be cut off. So that they
   had all the reason in the world to expect that the Messias, when he
   came, should be "despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrow and
   acquainted with grief;" that he should be scourged and buffeted,
   oppressed and afflicted, and at last "cut off out of the land of the
   living." Nay, if it had been other wise, they had had no reason to have
   owned him for the true Messias.

   III. As for signs to evidence him to be the Son of God; though God did
   not gratify their curiosity as to the nature and manner of them, yet he
   gave the greatest testimonies that ever were given to any prophet, and
   abundantly enough to satisfy any reasonable man, that he was "a teacher
   come from God." Indeed, his miracles were not generally so prodigious
   and amazing: but they were many and public, they were useful and
   beneficial to mankind; and for that reason, more likely to come from
   God. He did not call for fire from heaven to destroy his enemies; but
   he gave sight to the blind, and hearing to the deaf, and health to
   those that were sick of the most dangerous and inveterate diseases, and
   (which was always reckoned among the greatest and most undoubted kind
   of miracles) life to the dead. And when he himself was put to death by
   the malice of the Jews, though he did not "come down from the cross,"
   and was not rescued from his sufferings by an immediate hand from
   heaven, to triumph over the malice and cruelty which they were
   exercising upon him (which was the miracle they required to be shewn),
   yet God was not wanting to give testimony to him in a most remarkable
   manner, by prodigies which immediately followed his death; in the
   strange darkness which came upon the land; in the terrible earthquake
   which rent the veil of the temple, and tore the rocks asunder; in the
   opening of the graves, and the rising of the dead; and, lastly, in his
   own miraculous resurrection, the third day after he was crucified: so
   that here was no sign wanting in heaven above, or in the earth beneath,
   to convince their obstinacy and unbelief, unless it were that very sign
   which they demanded. God did enough to satisfy every man's reason; and
   he is not wont to gratify the humour and curiosity of men. If men be so
   unreasonable as to expect this from him, God lets such men continue in
   their wilful blindness and infidelity.

   Secondly, Neither had the heathen philosophers reason, upon account of
   the story of our Saviour's sufferings, to look upon the gospel as so
   absurd and unreasonable a thing; as will, I hope, evidently appear, if
   you will be pleased to consider with me these following particulars:

   I. That there is nothing more inculcated in the writings of the wisest
   and most famous of the heathen philosophers than this, that worldly
   greatness and prosperity is not to be admired, but despised by a truly
   wise man. Aristotle, in his Ethics, makes it the property of a
   magnanimous and great spirit, not to admire greatness and power, and
   victory, and riches. So that, according to their own principles, our
   Saviour was not to be despised upon account of his meanness and
   sufferings. He might be a great prophet and come from God, though he
   enjoyed nothing of worldly greatness and prosperity.

   II. They tell us, likewise, that men may be very virtuous and good, and
   dearly beloved of God, and yet be liable to great miseries and
   sufferings. And to this purpose I could bring you almost innumerable
   testimonies out of the books of the philosophers. Max. Tyrius, the
   Platonist, speaking of Ulysses, says, that "the gods forced him to
   wander, and beg, and wear rags; and suffered him to be reproached and
   reviled, for the love and friend ship that they bare to him."
   Epictetus, a poor slave, but inferior to none of all the philosophers
   for true virtue and wisdom, thanks the gods for his mean condition, and
   says, "He did not believe himself to be one jot the less beloved by
   them for that reason; and that he was not cast into a state of poverty
   and contempt, because the gods hated him, but that he might be fit to
   be a witness to others."

   III. They tell us, likewise, that a state of affliction and suffering
   is so far from rendering a man unfit to reform the world, and to be an
   example of virtue, that none so fit as those that are in such
   circumstances. Arrian, in his dissertations of Epictetus, describing a
   man fit to reform the world, whom he calls "the apostle and messenger,
   the minister and preacher of God to mankind," gives this character of
   him: "He must (says he) be without house and harbour, and destitute of
   all worldly accommodations; (just as it is said of our Saviour, that
   the "Son of man had not where to lay his head;") he must be armed with
   such a patience by the greatest sufferings, as if he were a stone and
   devoid of sense; he must be a spectacle of misery and contempt to the
   world." And, to mention no more, Plato, in the second book of his
   Commonwealth, when he would represent a righteous man giving the most
   unquestionable testimony to the world of his virtue, "Let him (says he)
   be stripped of all things in this world, except his righteousness; let
   him be poor and diseased, and accounted a wicked and unjust man: let
   him be whipped, and tormented, and crucified as a malefactor; and yet
   all this while retain his integrity;" which does so exactly agree with
   our Saviour's condition, that had he not wrote before his time, one
   would have thought he had alluded to it.

   IV. As it seems very convenient, (I am not so bold as to say it was
   necessary, and that God had no other way to bring about the salvation
   of men; for what are we, that we should prescribe to God, and set
   bounds to infinite wisdom?) I say, as it seems very reasonable, that,
   in order to our salvation, the Son of God, who was the author of it,
   should become man, both that he might be an example of holiness, and an
   expiation for sin; and that he should be born after the manner of other
   men, to satisfy us, that he was really of the same nature with us, that
   so he might converse more familiarly with us, and might be a more easy,
   and encouraging, and imitable example of all holiness and virtue; so
   likewise was it convenient, that he should be subject to the miseries
   and sufferings of our nature, that, by passing through the several
   states and conditions of humanity, he might have an experimental
   knowledge of the sufferings that human nature is liable to; and from
   his own sense of our infirmities, might be a more merciful and
   compassionate high-priest. And this the apostle expressly takes notice
   of, (Heb. v.) that it was convenient that "our High-priest should be
   taken from among men," that he might learn to be compassionate, by
   knowing experimentally what it was to be tempted and afflicted; the
   knowledge of experience being the strongest motive and incitement to
   piety; and consequently to give us the greater assurance of his tender
   affection to us.

   It was of great use that he should live in so mean and afflicted a
   condition, to confound the pride, and vanity, and fantastry of the
   world, and to convince men of these two great truths, that God may love
   those whom he afflicts, and that men may be innocent, and virtuous, and
   contented, in the midst of poverty, and reproach, and suffering. Had
   our blessed Saviour been a great worldly prince, his influence and
   example might possibly have made more hypocrites and servile converts,
   but it would not have tended one whit to make men more inwardly good
   and virtuous. The great arguments that must do this, must be fetched,
   not from the pomp and prosperity of this world, but from the happiness
   and misery of the other. Besides, had our Saviour appeared in any great
   power and splendour, the Christian religion could not have so clearly
   been acquitted from the suspicion of a worldly interest and design.

   And then the Scripture assigns very plain and excellent reasons of his
   suffering of death; that he might make expiation for the sins of the
   whole world, that he might take away sin by the sacrifice of himself,
   and put an end to that troublesome and unreasonable way of worship by
   sacrifice, which was in use both among Jews and heathens, and that, by
   conquering death, and him that had the power of it, he might "deliver
   those, who, through fear of death, were all their life-time subject to
   bondage," as the apostle speaks, (Heb. ii. 14.) For though the death of
   Christ, barely considered in itself, be far from an encouragement to us
   to hope for immortality; yet the death of Christ, considered together
   with his resurrection from the dead, and his ascension into heaven, is
   the clearest, and most sensible, and most popular demonstration that
   ever was in the world, of another life after this, and a blessed
   immortality. So that, considering our Saviour rose from the dead, it is
   far from being ridiculous, to rely upon one that died, for our hopes of
   immortality.

   V. As for the plainness of our Saviour's doctrine and of the
   instruments whereby it was propagated, this is so far from being an
   objection against it, that it is the great commendation of it. It
   contains a plain narrative of our Saviour's life, and miracles, and
   death, and resurrection, and ascension into heaven, and a few plain
   precepts of life; but the most excellent and reasonable, and the freest
   from all vanity and folly, that are to be met with in any book in the
   world. And can any thing be more worthy of God, or more likely to
   proceed from him, than so plain and useful a doctrine as this?
   Lawgivers do not use to deliver their laws in eloquent language, to set
   them off with flourish of speech, and to persuade men to a liking of
   them by subtle and artificial insinuations; but plainly, and in few
   words, to declare their will and pleasure.

   And for the instruments God was pleased to make use of for the
   publishing of this doctrine, we grant they were generally rude and
   unlearned men, and our religion hath no reason to be ashamed of it; for
   this was very agreeable to the simplicity of the whole design, that all
   things should be managed in the plainest manner; that Christianity
   might be introduced in such a way, as there might be no possible
   suspicion of a, human contrivance, or worldly design in it.

   The religion itself was simple and plain, there were no worldly
   inducements to the embracing of it, but all imaginable discouragements
   upon that account; the instruments of propagating it were simple and
   plain men, unassisted by learning or art, by secular power and
   authority; which is so far from being a disparagement to our religion,
   that it is a great reputation to it, and a plain evidence of its Divine
   original, that it was from God, and was countenanced and carried on by
   him, "not by might nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord."

   And in truth, considering the nature of this doctrine, which consisted
   either of plain matter of fact, or of easy and familiar precepts, and
   rules for a good life, the apostles were as tit for the propagating of
   it, as any sort of persons in the world: for it did not require depth
   of understanding, or sharpness of wit to comprehend it, and declare it
   to others; but honesty and integrity of mind, zeal and industry to
   promote it; in which qualities the apostles excelled the philosophers
   and best learned persons in the world: and provided an instrument be
   sufficient and competent for its end, it matters not how plain and
   unpolished it be; for instruments are not intended for ornaments, but
   for use. Now the apostles of our Saviour, though they were illiterate
   and unbred, were as competent witnesses of matter of fact, as any other
   persons: for there is no wit and learning required, to relate what a
   man hath seen and heard. Nay, the more simple and plain, the less
   eloquent and artificial any relation is, the more likely it is to be
   true, and to gain belief.

   Thus you see, that, notwithstanding the seeming unreasonableness and
   absurdity of the doctrine of the gospel, it is a most wise and
   effectual contrivance for the reforming and saving of mankind. "But
   unto them that are called, both Jews and gentiles, Christ the power of
   God, and the wisdom of God."

   The proper inference from all this is, to stir us up to a thankful
   acknowledgment and admiration of the wisdom and goodness of God, in the
   salvation of men by Jesus Christ. We are most apt to admire that wisdom
   which finds out such means to an end, as human wisdom would have been
   least apt to devise and hit upon; and yet the more we consider them,
   the more we must approve their fitness. Such is the design of the
   recovery and redemption of mankind, by the death and sufferings of the
   Son of God. However it may appear to rash and inconsiderate men, who
   judge superficially, and according to the uppermost appearances of
   things, to be a very un likely and improbable design; yet, upon a
   thorough and impartial examination of things, we shall find that God's
   way is the wisest, and that, in the management of this design, he hath
   outdone the utmost prudence and wisdom of men, and hath ordered things
   to infinitely more advantage, than they would have been, in any of
   those methods which the short and imperfect wisdom of carnal men would
   have been most apt to pitch upon. Ignorant, and conceited, and
   prejudiced men, may censure it for folly; but the angels, more
   intelligent and discerning creatures than we are, and of a deeper
   reach, do look upon it with wonder and astonishment. So the apostle
   tells us: (1 Pet. i. 12.) where, speaking of the gospel, he calls it a
   thing "which the angels desire to look into." An allusion to the
   cherubims, who looked earnestly upon the mercy-seat which was over the
   ark, as if they would pry into it.

   And then let us acknowledge the infinite goodness of God, in saving us
   by the death and sufferings of his Son, us vile and miserable sinners.
   Had we been the most innocent and righteous, and the dearest friends to
   him in the world, what could he have done more? How could he possibly
   have testified greater love to us, than to give his Son to die for us?
   Here is goodness without bounds, love with out parallel and example;
   for "greater love than this hath no man, that a man should lay down his
   life for his friend." This is the highest pitch that human affection
   ever attained to, to die for one's friend: but herein hath God
   commended his love to us, that, while we were enemies, he gave his Son
   to die for us.

   This is that which we are to commemorate at this season, and by the
   commemoration thereof, to prepare ourselves for the receiving of the
   blessed sacrament of his body and blood, which was broken and shed for
   us. The consideration whereof, as it should excite in us a hearty
   sorrow and repentance for sin, so should it also inflame us with love
   to Christ, who, by suffering such things for us, hath laid upon us an
   eternal obligation of love and obedience to him. The remembrance of
   whose death should not only put us into a present fit and passion of
   grief and love, but should be the ground of lasting affections and
   resolutions; the thoughts of what he hath done and suffered for us,
   should make us ambitious to do or suffer any thing for him. What should
   not we be willing to part with for him, who did not think his own life
   and his glory dear to him for our sakes? Did he die for us? and shall
   we think much to live to him? Did he become miserable for our sakes?
   and shall we think much to become holy and happy for his sake and for
   our own?

   Such affections and holy resolutions the consideration of our Saviour's
   death and sufferings should be apt to excite in us. What grief, what
   love, what thankfulness, should the remembrance of his dying love work
   in us! when we consider seriously the many and the mighty blessings and
   benefits which flow to us out of his wounds, and are taking the cup of
   salvation into our hands, how should "our souls, and all that is within
   us, bless his holy name, who pardoneth all our iniquities, and healeth
   all our diseases; who redeemed our life from destruction, and crowneth
   us with loving-kindness and tender mercy." To him, therefore, our
   gracious and good God, let us give all thanks, adoration, and praise.
   Amen.

SERMON CXCII.

  THE EVIDENCE OF OUR SAVIOUR'S RESURRECTION.

   To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion, by many
   infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the
   things pertaining to the kingdom of God.--Acts i. 3.

   THESE words comprehend in short the whole evidence of our Saviour's
   resurrection, which maybe referred to these four heads:

   First, His appearance to them after his death and passion: "To whom
   also he shewed himself alive after his passion." "To whom;" that is, to
   the apostles whom St. Luke had mentioned just before: "After he had
   given commandment to the apostles, whom he had chosen; to whom also,"
   &c.

   Secondly, The proof of the reality of his appearance: "To whom also he
   shewed himself alive after his passion, by many infallible proofs;" en
   pollois tekmeriois, "idque compluribus argumentis," saith Erasmus, "and
   that by many certain and undoubted proofs, or arguments."

   Thirdly, The duration and continuance of his appearance to them: "Being
   seen of them forty days."

   Fourthly, The subject matter of his discourse with them: "And speaking
   of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God." Each of these affords
   us a considerable evidence of Christ's resurrection.

   First, His appearance to them after his death and passion: "To whom
   also he shewed himself alive after his passion." In which words there
   are three things very considerable, and which give great evidence to
   our Saviour's resurrection.

   I. His appearance to his apostles.

   II. That he was really alive, and his body vitally united to his soul.

   III. And this after he was really dead--"after his passion;" that is,
   after he was crucified, dead, and buried, he was raised to life again.
   I shall speak briefly of these.

   I. His appearance to his apostles: "To whom also he shewed himself
   alive." The apostles are here only mentioned, because this is here
   spoken of, in order to their designation and appointment to be the
   witnesses of Christ's resurrection to the world, as the great
   confirmation of that doctrine which they were to publish: but because I
   am considering his appearance after his resurrection, as an evidence of
   the truth of it, I shall therefore take in his appearance to others
   also of his disciples and followers; and consider, likewise, why he
   only appeared to his own followers, and not also to the unbelieving
   Jews, who had put him to death, for the full conviction of his enemies
   and murderers, and the conversion of that whole nation, to whom he was
   primarily sent.

   In considering his several appearances, not only to his apostles, but
   to his other disciples and followers, that I may give the shortest and
   fullest view of them, I shall take them as they are briefly summed up
   by St. Paul; (1 Cor. xv. 4, &c.) where, giving an account of the sum of
   his doctrine among the Corinthians, he tells us, that the foundation of
   all his preaching was the death and resurrection of Christ. "I
   delivered unto you first of all, that which I also received, how that
   Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was
   buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the
   Scriptures." And then follows the particular evidence of his
   resurrection: (ver. 5.) "And that he was seen of Cephas." St. Paul here
   takes no notice of his first appearance to the devout women, who
   brought spices and ointments to his sepulchre; "Mary Magdalene, and
   Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women," as we find,
   Luke xxiv. 10. The reason of which seems to be this: because his first
   appearance was in consideration of their piety and affection to him,
   and of the weakness of their sex, their faith being liable to be first
   staggered; and they were only to relate it to the apostles, and to be
   honoured with carrying the first news of it, not to be witnesses of it
   to the world; so that this appearance was only for the private
   confirmation of their faith, and therefore not particularly taken
   notice of by St. Paul among the public evidences of Christ's
   resurrection.

   "He was seen of Cephas." This is mentioned Luke xxiv. 34. "The Lord is
   risen, indeed, and hath appeared to Simon."

   St. Paul goes on; "And then of the twelve." The college of the
   apostles, because their number was twelve by our Saviour's institution,
   are most frequently called "The Twelve," though at some meetings some
   one of them might perhaps be absent: it is true there was a short
   interruption by the miscarriage of Judas, from the time of our
   Saviour's apprehension to his ascension, and then they are called "The
   Eleven," as before and after they are called "The Twelve:" yea, at this
   first appearance of our Saviour to them, when they were but ten, Thomas
   being absent, they are called "The Eleven." (Mark xvi. 14.) "He
   appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat;" because they were then but
   eleven in all. And, indeed, in this text of St. Paul, both the Vulgar
   translation, which certainly follows a very ancient copy, and St.
   Ambrose there, instead of twelve, render it eleven; so that St. Paul
   probably means our Saviour's first appearance to them, mentioned by St.
   Mark, where they are also called "The Eleven," though Thomas was
   absent; which is the reason why St. Paul says afterwards at the 7th
   verse, that he was seen of all the apostles, that is, Thomas also being
   present, as I shall shew by and by.

   "After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once." This
   was the most solemn appearance of all, mentioned Matt. xxviii. 10. and
   John xxi. 1. where our Saviour appointed a general meeting of all his
   disciples and followers. "Go tell my brethren that they go into
   Galilee, and there they shall see me." (Ver. 16.) "They went into
   Galilee into a mountain, where Jesus had appointed them." This
   mountain, according to the ancient tradition, was Mount Thabor.

   There is one considerable difficulty concerning the greatness of this
   number of five hundred; namely, that after our Saviour's ascension we
   find, (Acts i. 15.) that after their return from Mount Olivet (from
   whence our Saviour ascended) to Jerusalem, the whole number of their
   meeting was but a hundred and twenty, for so it is expressly said--"the
   number of names together, were about a hundred and twenty;" that is, of
   the persons there met. Now we cannot reasonably suppose that any of
   those five hundred, who had seen him after his resurrection, were
   fallen off from them.

   For the clear solution of this, it is to be considered, that the great
   meeting of five hundred was in Galilee, where our Saviour's residence
   chiefly had been, and where he had preached most constantly, and by
   consequence he had probably there the greatest number of followers,
   which was the reason why he chose to appear there, and appointed that
   place for the general meeting. After which, the apostles who went
   thither by our Lord's appointment, together with others who accompanied
   them from Jerusalem, returned back: but his followers who lived in
   Galilee remained there; so that there might very well be five hundred
   at the meeting in Galilee, and but a hundred and twenty at Jerusalem.

   St. Paul goes on; (ver. 7.) "After that he was seen of James." This
   particular appearance of our Lord to St. James, the brother of our
   Lord, is no where mentioned in the evangelists. St. Paul, probably, had
   it from the common tradition mentioned by St. Jerome, out of the Hebrew
   gospel of the Nazarenes, in which are several passages omitted by St.
   Matthew, and this for one; "That our Lord immediately after he had
   risen, went and appeared to James: for James had vowed that hour that
   he drank of the cup of the Lord, (viz. in the sacrament) he would not
   eat bread, till he saw him risen from the dead. The Lord, when he
   appeared to him, said, Bring hither bread and a table; and he took the
   bread, and blessed and brake it, and gave it to James the Just, and
   said to him, My brother eat thy bread; for the Son of man is risen from
   among them that sleep." To this tradition St. Paul probably alludes;
   but then e'pei'ta, which we translate afterwards or then, ought to be
   rendered, as it elsewhere is, præterea, besides, "moreover he appeared
   to James," without denoting the order of the time; for, according to
   the tradition, it was presently after his resurrection, before he had
   appeared to the other apostles.

   It follows, "Then he was seen of all the apostles;" that is, by Thomas,
   as well as the rest. And this was his second appearance to the apostles
   together; of which St. Luke gives us an account, (Luke xxiv. 5.) and
   St. John, (chap. xx. 19.)

   "And last of all, he was (says St. Paul) seen of me also, as an
   abortive," or one born out of due time. This he speaks of the
   appearance of our Lord to him in his way to Damascus, whereby he was in
   a very powerful and extraordinary manner, on a sudden, converted to
   Christianity.

   Thus I have given you an account of the several appearances of our
   Saviour, not only to the apostles, but to others, and have endeavoured
   to explain the chief difficulties relating to them; so that here is a
   very plentiful testimony of our Saviour's appearance after his
   resurrection. I proceed to the

   II. Second thing here observable, That our Lord was really alive when
   he thus appeared, and his body vitally united to his soul: "to whom
   also he shewed himself alive." To which purpose, there is a remarkable
   passage in Ignatius, in his epistle to the church of Smyrna, out of the
   same Hebrew Nazarene Gospel; "That Christ said to Peter, after his
   resurrection, Behold, touch me, and see that I am not a spirit that
   have assumed a body." For that was one great objection--that his body
   was not a real body united to his soul, but a thin airy body, such as
   are assumed by spectres and apparitions. But the farther evidence of
   this I refer to the second general head, concerning the proofs of the
   reality of his appearance. I proceed to the

   III. Third thing I observed; viz. That he appeared alive after he had
   been really dead; "To whom also he shewed himself alive after his
   passion," says the text; that is, after he was crucified, and dead, and
   buried, he was raised and restored to life again. And this likewise is
   necessary, to evidence the truth and reality of his resurrection, that
   he was really dead. That this was so, we cannot doubt, whether we
   consider the malice of the Jews, who would take care he should be dead
   before he was taken from the cross; or the manner of his death, his
   heart being pierced by the spear, which was evident from the water and
   blood which came out of his side, which shewed that his heart was
   mortally wounded; or the time of his being in the grave, which was part
   of three days.

   And now, if he was really dead, his restitution to life, which we call
   his resurrection, must be miraculous; it being beyond any natural
   power, that we know of, to effect it.

   As for that malicious tradition of the Jews, that he was stolen out of
   his grave by his disciples, while the watch was asleep, and given out
   to be risen from the dead; besides the undeniable proofs of his
   resurrection, which I shall produce by and by, the evidence which these
   suborned witnesses gave of his disciples stealing away his body
   destroys itself; for they said, "his disciples came by night, and stole
   him away, while we slept;" which amounts to no more, but that, when
   they awaked, his body was some way or other conveyed or gone out of the
   grave; which is consistent with his resurrection. But surely none will
   think fit to give credit to what they testify was done while they were
   asleep. They are very willing to believe a thing, who will admit of
   such a deposition.

   Thus much concerning our Saviour's appearance to his disciples and
   followers after his resurrection. I shall briefly consider, in the

   Second place, Why he only appeared to his own followers, and not also
   to the unbelieving Jews, who had put him to death, for the full
   conviction of his enemies and murderers, and the conversion of that
   whole nation to whom he was primarily sent.

   Of this matter, so far as is fit for us to inquire into the reason of
   the Divine dispensations, this probable account may be given:

   1. It was only of absolute necessity, that those who were to be the
   first publishers of the gospel, and the witnesses of his resurrection
   to the world, should have the utmost evidence and satisfaction
   concerning the reality of it: others might very soon credit it upon the
   testimony of so many witnesses, who also gave evidence to the truth of
   their testimony, by the miracles which they wrought; and of their own
   sincerity, by dying for this testimony. And thus St. Peter takes notice
   of the reason why our Lord, after his resurrection, did not appear to
   all the people, but only to select witnesses: because his appearance
   was necessary only to those, who were designed and appointed to be the
   witnesses of it. If more had been necessary, he must, by the same
   reason, have appeared to all the world, as well as to the Jews: (Acts
   x. 40, 41.) "Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
   not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before of God, even to
   us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead; and he
   commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify," &c.

   2. The unbelieving Jews, especially the chief priests and rulers, upon
   whose authority the people depended, were very unworthy, to whom God
   should afford so extraordinary a way of conviction, who had already
   despised and rejected so great evidence as was offered to them: and not
   only so, bat maliciously imputed the plainest miracles that ever were
   wrought amongst them, to the power and operation of the devil. Now if
   any thing can render men incapable of the favour of farther means of
   conviction, such a malicious resistance of the evidence which our
   Saviour's miracles daily wrought among them, carried along with them,
   would probably do it: especially if we consider, that the greatest of
   all the miracles which he wrought in his life-time (I mean the raising
   of Lazarus from the dead, after he had been dead four days), was so far
   from convincing them, though they could not deny the thing, that from
   thence their malice took occasion to resolve to put him to death; (John
   xi. 47.) "Then gathered the chief priests and pharisees a council, and
   said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles: if we let him
   alone, all men will believe on him." And, (ver. 53.) "Therefore from
   that day they took counsel together to put him to death." Now was it
   reasonable that he should appear to them for their conviction, after he
   was risen from the dead, who maliciously conspired to compass his
   death, for this very cause, because they knew that he had raised one
   from the dead?

   3. This would have been inconsistent with that just punishment, which
   God had determined to bring upon the Jewish nation for their obstinate
   in fidelity, and malicious rejection, and cruel usage of the Son of
   God. After fitting means used for the conviction of men, it is just
   with God to let men remain in their own obstinate infidelity, and to
   punish them for it. And it is not to be expected, that God should use
   violent and irresistible means, to bring such persons to repentance,
   and to prevent their ruin. He pities the weakness and infirmities of
   honest minds, and condescends to give them such evidence as it is
   reasonable to demand; as he did to his disciples: but he hath not
   thought fit to provide so extraordinary a remedy for wilful and
   obstinate infidelity; which was the case of the scribes and pharisees.

   Secondly, We will consider the proofs of the reality of our Saviour's
   appearance after his resurrection: "To whom also he shewed himself
   alive after his passion by many infallible proofs;" en pollois
   tekmeriois, a by many certain and undoubted proofs or arguments;" for
   so the words properly signify, as Quintilian from Aristotle tells us:
   tekme'ria, says he, are indubitata et necessaria signa, "undoubted and
   necessary signs of a thing;" as the actions of speaking, walking,
   eating, and drinking, are the tekme'ria, undoubted signs, of life.

   And these tekme'ria, or undoubted proofs of our Saviour's resurrection,
   may be referred to these two heads--the natural, and the supernatural
   and miraculous evidences of the thing.

   1. The natural evidence of the thing to their senses; to their eyes,
   the quickest and surest of senses, men being least apt to be deceived
   in those things, quæ sunt oculis commissa fidelibus, "which are
   committed to such faithful witnesses as our own eyes." He was seen of
   all his disciples, not once, but several times; not by a transient view
   and glance, but in a way of the most familiar conversation; he
   discoursed with them, and did eat and drink with them, and with the
   same circumstances that he used in his life-time, he gave thanks, and
   brake bread with them: he suffered his body to be touched by them, that
   they might be convinced that it was a real body, consisting of flesh
   and bones: (Luke xxiv. 39.) "Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not
   flesh and bones, as you see me have."

   And to convince them, beyond all doubt and scruple, that the very same
   body was raised in which he had suffered, he gives them leave to handle
   the wounds of his hands and feet; (Luke xxiv. 39.) "Behold my hands and
   my feet, that it is myself." (John xx. 20.) "He shewed them his hands
   and his side." And to Thomas, who was more unbelieving than the rest,
   he says, in the presence of them all, (ver. 27.) "Reach hither thy
   finger, and behold my hands: and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it
   into my side; and be not faithless, but believing." But, besides this
   natural sensible evidence, he gave them likewise,

   2. A supernatural and miraculous evidence. St. John mentions two or
   three instances: his coining on the sudden upon them, and standing in
   the midst of them when the doors were shut. Not that he passed through
   the door with his body, which is not a miracle, but a plain
   impossibility, and therefore just as fit to countenance
   transubstantiation as one impossibility is to prove another; but that
   he did miraculously open the door, and come in upon them so quickly, as
   was undiscernible to them; which very man will grant not only to be
   possible, but easy to the Divine power. But this way of our Saviour's
   conveying himself into the midst of his disciples, though it be also
   miraculous, yet the church of Rome will by no means allow it; it is too
   plain, and easy to be reconciled with the nature and possibility of
   things; they love at their hearts a lying wonder, a foppish miracle.

   And this miracle was repeated twice; first when Thomas was absent,
   (John xx. 19.) and when he was present the same was done again, (ver.
   26.)

   And then the miraculous draught of fishes, by which also he had made
   himself known to them in his life-time.

   And then Peter's casting himself into the sea, when he knew it was he,
   in confidence of that Divine power, which, in the like kind, he had
   experience of before.

   These miracles St. John mentions; but he tells us, (chap. xx. 30.) that
   "many other miracles Jesus did in the presence of his disciples, which
   are not set down in that book." The

   Third thing in the text is, The duration and continuance of his
   appearing to them, "being seen of them forty days." And this is of
   great moment to confirm the reality of the thing: a man may for once be
   imposed upon by an illusion of fancy, in a thing which he vehemently
   desires and expects, and which runs strongly in his mind: but where
   there is time to examine things, and compare all circumstances
   together, and to look narrowly into them, and to try them by several
   senses, and at several times, for so long a space, it is morally, nay,
   almost naturally impossible, that any one man in his senses, much more
   so many hundreds of persons, should, in such circumstances, be grossly
   deluded in a plain sensible matter of fact.

   Fourthly, and lastly, Here is the subject-matter of our Saviour's
   discourse with his disciples, concerning things which "pertain to the
   kingdom of God; or, as it is in the verse before, "after he had by the
   Holy Ghost (which was not given him by measure, as the evangelist tells
   us elsewhere) given commandment to his apostles, whom he had chosen:"
   that is, after he had given the full orders and instructions concerning
   the doctrine which they were to publish, and all other things
   pertaining to that spiritual kingdom which he was setting up in the
   world: by the agreement of all which, with what he had said to them in
   his life-time, they were more and more confirmed that it was the very
   same person whom they had conversed with before for above three years
   together. And yet in this discourse concerning his kingdom, he reserved
   some things to be afterward revealed to them by the Holy Ghost,
   according as he had promised, "that when the Spirit of truth was come,
   he should teach them all things;" particularly concerning the spiritual
   nature of his kingdom, which they did not yet fully understand, as
   appears by that question which they put to him, (ver. 6.) "Lord, wilt
   thou at this time restore the kingdom unto Israel?" They still dreamed
   of a temporal kingdom, in which our Saviour would appear in great pomp
   and splendour to subdue the world to them.

   From all this discourse which I have made, you see what evidence the
   apostles, who were to be the first publishers of the gospel, and
   witnesses of Christ's resurrection, had of the truth and reality of it;
   so plentiful, and clear, and convincing, as nothing more could either
   be desired or expected. And we have a credible relation of these things
   brought down to us, abundantly sufficient to satisfy those who are free
   from the bias of passion or interest, or the prejudice and
   prepossession of a contrary religion in which they have been educated
   and brought up, and sufficient to gain some few ingenuous and teachable
   persons here and there, who do more impartially consider things; and
   though they have been educated in a contrary religion, yet have
   preserved in themselves a greater freedom of judgment than education
   does usually leave in the minds of men.

   But yet this credible relation of actions and miracles done long ago,
   how true soever in itself, does not carry so present, and sensible, and
   strong a conviction with it, as to be able to bear down in the common
   people the violent prejudice of education in a contrary religion, and
   consequently is not likely to do any great matter of itself toward the
   conversion of infidel nations.

   And therefore the Divine wisdom, which does no thing that is
   superfluous and unnecessary, thought fit, not only to send the apostles
   armed with this evidence, which had abundantly convinced them, to
   testify the resurrection of Christ to the world, but also to give an
   immediate testimony to them, by enabling them to work present miracles
   upon the spot, for the confirmation of their testimony. And this Divine
   power which went along with them, was a sensible testimony and
   conviction both to the knowing and ignorant part of mankind, that they
   were teachers and witnesses sent by God; and therefore our Lord
   commands them, "not to depart from Jerusalem, till they had received
   power from on high," to qualify them to be witnesses of Christ's
   resurrection, not only in Jerusalem, and Judea, and Samaria, but to the
   utmost parts of the earth.

   And this I still believe to be the case of those many nations of the
   world, that are yet under the violent, and almost invincible, prejudice
   of education in another religion. That which may reasonably satisfy us
   who are brought up in the Christian religion, is not likely to be
   effectual enough to convince them; and, therefore, I think it still
   very credible, that if persons of sincere minds did go to preach the
   pure Christian religion, free from those errors and superstitions which
   have crept into it, to infidel nations, that God would still enable
   such persons to work miracles; without which there would be little or
   no probability of success. For as the wisdom of God is not wont to do
   that which is superfluous, so neither to be wanting in that which is
   necessary; and though the morality of the Christian religion be
   admirable, and very apt to recommend itself to the reason of mankind,
   yet the doctrine of the death of the Son of God would be such a
   stumbling-block, as would be hard for them to get over; and the
   relation of ancient miracles would not easily be admitted, by those who
   are utterly strangers to our histories of former times; and,
   consequently, not so fit to judge of what credit and value they are.

   It is not good to be confident where we are not certain; but this I
   piously believe, that God would extraordinarily countenance such an
   attempt by all fitting assistance, as he did the first publication of
   the gospel; because the reason and necessity is plainly the same in
   this case as it was at first. For if God did not think the apostles
   naked testimony, unless it were armed with miracles, sufficient for the
   conviction of the world, concerning the resurrection of Christ, of
   which themselves had been eye-witnesses, much less can we expect to
   gain credit, who only carry the relation of these ancient matters of
   fact, attested by histories to which they are wholly strangers.

   And I do strongly hope, that there still remains a great harvest among
   the gentiles, yet to be gained to Christianity before the end of the
   world; and that the providence of God will, in his own appointed time,
   make a further step in the conversion of the infidel nations; and that
   more of the kingdoms of the earth shall become the kingdoms of the
   Lord, and of his Christ; and that yet before the end of all things, the
   light of the gospel shall be displayed in a glorious manner, not only
   in those vast empires of Tartary, and China, and Japan, and Hindostan,
   and other great kingdoms of the east, but in the large and dark regions
   of the new-discovered world; for that solemn promise which God made to
   his Son, (Psal. ii. 8.) "Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen
   for thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy
   possession," seems to be very far from being yet fully accomplished;
   and since this is like to be the work of some ages, the time, perhaps,
   is not far off, when it shall begin: and though I see no sufficient
   grounds from Scripture to believe the personal reign of Christ upon
   earth for a thousand years; yet it seems to be not improbable, that
   some time before the end of the world, the glorious kingdom of Christ,
   I mean the prevalency of the pure Christian religion, should be of as
   long continuance, as the reigns of Mahomet and Antichrist have been,
   both which have now lasted about a thousand years.

   For it is clear, that the "fulness of the gentiles" is not yet come in,
   because the Jews still continue dispersed over the world, which is the
   mark our Saviour hath given of the call and restitution of the Jews:
   (Luke xxi. 24.) "They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be
   led away captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down
   of the gentiles, until the time of the gentiles be fulfilled." And thus
   St. Paul explains to us this prediction of our Saviour: (Rom. xi. 25.)
   "I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery,
   that blindness, in part, is happened unto Israel, until the fulness of
   the gentiles be come in."

   So that this we have reason to expect, and this let us pray for, "That
   the knowledge of the Lord may fill the earth, as the waters cover the
   sea; that his ways may be known upon earth, and his saving health among
   all nations;" and with St. Paul, "Let our hearty desire and prayer for
   Israel be, that they may be saved; that there may come out of Sion a
   deliverer, and he may turn away unrighteousness from Jacob;"
   especially, since St. Paul hath given us reason to hope, that this
   would be of so great benefit and advantage to the gentile world: (Rom.
   xi. 12.) "If the fall of the Jews be the riches of the world, and the
   diminution of them the riches of the gentiles; how much more their
   fulness?" and, (ver. 15.) "For if the casting away of them be the
   reconciling of the world; what shall the receiving of them be, but life
   from the dead?" Intimating, that as the rejection of the Jews was the
   occasion of publishing the gospel, that "doctrine of reconciliation,"
   to the world, as the same apostle doth elsewhere call it; so the
   receiving them to favour again, should be "life from the dead;" that
   is, a kind of resurrection to the remainder of the gentile world, who
   had so long "lain in darkness and the shadow of death." Which "the God
   of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting
   covenant," grant in his due time may be accomplished; that those "other
   sheep which are not yet of this fold, may hear his voice, and be
   brought in, that there may be one fold, and one Shepherd; and all the
   ends of the earth may see the salvation of our God."

SERMON CXCIII.

    [Preached at Whitehall, 1682.]

  THE POSSIBILITY OF THE RESURRECTION ASSERTED AND PROVED.

   Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should
   raise the dead?--Acts xxvi. 8.

   THE resurrection of the dead is one of the great articles of the
   Christian faith; and yet so it hath happened, that this great article
   of our religion hath been made one of the chief objections against it.
   There is nothing that Christianity hath been more upbraided withal,
   both by the heathens of old, and by the infidels of later times, than
   the impossibility of this article. So that it is a matter of great
   consideration and consequence, to vindicate our religion in this
   particular. For if the thing be evidently impossible, then it is highly
   unreasonable to propose it to the belief of mankind.

   I know that some, more devout than wise, and who, it is to be hoped,
   mean better than they under stand, make nothing of impossibilities in
   matters of faith, and would fain persuade us, that the more impossible
   any thing is, for that very reason is the fitter to be believed; and
   that it is an argument of a poor and low faith, to believe only things
   that are possible; but a generous and heroical faith will swallow
   contradictions, with as much ease as reason assents to the plainest and
   most evident propositions. Tertullian, in the heat of his zeal and
   eloquence, upon this point, of the death and resurrection of Christ,
   lets fall a very odd passage, and which must have many grains of
   allowance to make it tolerable: Prorsus credibile est (saith he) quia
   ineptum est; certam est quia impossibile: "It is, therefore, very
   credible, because it is foolish; and certain, because it is
   impossible:" "And this (says he) is necessarium dedecus fidei;" that
   is, "it is necessary the Christian faith should be thus disgraced, by
   the belief of impossibilities and contradictions." I suppose he means,
   that this article of the resurrection was not in itself the less
   credible, because the heathen philosophers cavilled at it, as a thing
   impossible and contradictious, and endeavoured to disgrace the
   Christian religion upon that account. For had he meant otherwise, that
   the thing was therefore credible, because it was really and in itself
   foolish and impossible: this had been to recommend the Christian
   religion from the absurdity of the things to be believed; which would
   be a strange commendation of any religion to the sober and reasonable
   part of mankind.

   I know not what some men may find in themselves; but I must freely
   acknowledge, that I could never yet attain to that bold and hardy
   degree of faith, as to believe any thing for this reason--because it
   was impossible; for this would be to believe a thing to be, because I
   am sure it cannot be. So that I am very far from being of his mind,
   that wanted not only more difficulties, but even impossibilities, in
   the Christian religion, to exercise his faith upon.

   It is true, indeed, Abraham, when he was offering up his son Isaac, is
   said "against hope to have believed in hope:" but he did not believe
   against a plain impossibility; for the apostle to the Hebrews expressly
   tells us, that "he reasoned that God was able to raise him from the
   dead." But had he believed this impossible, he could not have
   reconciled the command of God with his promise; the command to
   sacrifice Isaac, with the promise which he had made before, that "in
   his seed (which was Isaac) all the nations of the earth should be
   blessed." So that though God was pleased to try his faith with a great
   difficulty, yet with no impossibility.

   I premise all this, to satisfy men how necessary it is to vindicate the
   Christian religion from this objection--of the impossibility of any of
   its articles. And whatever Tertullian might say in a rhetorical rant,
   it is very plain, that the ancient fathers did not think the
   resurrection to be a thing impossible; for then they would never have
   attempted, us they very frequently do, to have answered the objections
   of the heathens against it, from the pretended impossibility of it.

   To be sure, St. Paul did not think the resurrection of the dead a thing
   impossible, for then he would never have asked that question, "Why
   should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise
   the dead?" Nothing being so likely to be thought incredible, and upon
   so good reason, as that which is impossible.

   Leaving therefore, to the church of Rome, that fool-hardiness of faith,
   to believe things to be true, which at the same time their reason
   plainly tells them are impossible, I shall at this time endeavour to
   assert and vindicate this article of the resurrection, from the
   pretended impossibility of it. And I hope, by God's assistance, to make
   the possibility of the thing so plain, as lo leave no considerable
   scruple about it, in any free and unprejudiced mind. And this I shall
   do from these words of St. Paul, which are part of the defence which he
   made for himself before Festus and Agrippa; the substance whereof is
   this: that he had lived a blameless and inoffensive life among the
   Jews, in whose religion he had been bred up; that he was of the
   strictest sect of that religion, a pharisee, which, in opposition to
   the Sadducees, maintained the resurrection of the dead, and a future
   state of rewards and punishments in another life; and that for the hope
   of this he was called in question, and accused by the Jews: (ver. 6,
   7.) "And now I stand here, and am judged for the hope of the promise
   made unto the fathers; unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly
   serving God day and night, hope to come; for which hope's sake, King
   Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews." That is, he was accused for
   preaching that Jesus was risen from the dead, which is a particular
   instance of the general doctrine of the resurrection, which was
   entertained by the greatest part of the Jews, and which, to the natural
   reason of mankind (however the heathen, in opposition to the Christian
   religion, were prejudiced against it), hath nothing in it that is
   incredible. And for this he appeals to his judges, Festus and Agrippa;
   "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should
   raise the dead?"

   Which words, being a question without an answer, imply in them these
   two propositions:

   First, That it was thought by some a thing incredible, that the dead
   should be raised. This is sup posed in the question, as the foundation
   of it: for he who asks why a thing is so, supposeth it to be so.

   Secondly, That this apprehension, that it is a thing incredible, that
   God should raise the dead, is very unreasonable: for the question being
   left un answered, implies its own answer, and is to be resolved into
   this affirmative that there is no reason why they, or any man else,
   should think it a thing incredible, that God should raise the dead.

   I shall speak to these two propositions as briefly as I can, and then
   shew, what influence this doctrine of the resurrection ought to have
   upon our lives.

   First, That it was thought by some a thing in credible, that God should
   raise the dead. This St. Paul had reason to suppose, having from his
   own experience found men so averse from the entertaining of this
   doctrine. When he preached to the philosophers at Athens, and declared
   to them the resurrection of one Jesus from the dead, they were amazed
   at this new doctrine, and knew not what he meant by it: (Acts xvii.
   18.) "They said, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods,
   because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection." He had
   discoursed to them of the resurrection of one Jesus from the dead; but
   this business of the resurrection, was a thing so remote from their
   apprehensions, that they had no manner of conception of it; but
   understood him quite in another sense, as if he had declared to them
   two new deities, Jesus and Anastasis; as if he had brought a new god
   and a new goddess among them, Jesus and the Resurrection. And when he
   discoursed to them again more fully of this matter, it is said, (ver.
   32.) that "when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, they
   mocked." And at the 24th verse of this chapter, when he spake of the
   resurrection, Festus told him, he would hear him no farther, and that
   he looked upon him as a man "beside himself, whom much learning had
   made mad." Festus looked upon this business of the resurrection, as the
   wild speculation of a crazy head. And indeed the heathens generally,
   even those who believed the immortality of the soul, and another state
   after this life, looked upon the resurrection of the body as a thing
   impossible. Pliny, I remember, reckons it among those things which are
   impossible, and which God himself cannot do; revocare defunctos, "to
   call back the dead to life." And in the primitive times, the heathen
   philosophers very much derided the Christians upon account of this
   strange doctrine of the resurrection, looking always upon this article
   of their faith as a ridiculous and impossible assertion.

   So easy is it for prejudice to blind the minds of men, and to represent
   every thing to them, which hath a great appearance of difficulty in it,
   as impossible.

   But I shall endeavour to shew, that if the matter be thoroughly
   examined, there is no ground for any such apprehension. I proceed
   therefore to the

   Second proposition; namely, That this apprehension, that it is an
   incredible thing that God should raise the dead, is very unreasonable:
   "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should
   raise the dead?" That is, there is no sufficient reason, why any man
   should look upon the resurrection of the dead as a thing impossible to
   the power of God; the only reason why they thought it incredible, being
   because they judged it impossible: so that nothing can be vainer, than
   for men to pretend to believe the resurrection, and yet at the same
   time to grant it to be a thing in reason impossible, because no man can
   believe that which he thinks to be incredible; and the impossibility of
   a thing is the best reason any man can have to think a thing
   incredible. So that the meaning of St. Paul's question is, "Why should
   it be thought a thing" impossible, "that God should raise the dead?"

   To come then to the business: I shall endeavour to shew, that there is
   no sufficient reason why men should look upon the resurrection of the
   dead as a thing impossible to God: "Why should it be thought a thing
   incredible (that is, impossible) with you, that God should raise the
   dead? Which question implies in it these three things:

   I. That it is above the power of nature to raise the dead.

   II. But it is not above the power of God to raise the dead. And,

   III. That God should be able to do this, is by no means incredible to
   natural reason.

   I. This question implies, that it is above the power of nature to raise
   the dead; and therefore the apostle puts the question very cautiously,
   "Why should it be thought incredible, that God should raise the dead?"
   By which he seems to grant, that it is impossible to any natural power
   to raise the dead; which is granted on all hands.

   II. But this question does plainly imply, that it is not above the
   power of God to do this. Though the raising of the dead to life be a
   thing above the power of nature, yet why should it be thought
   incredible, that God, who is the author of nature, should be able to do
   this? And, indeed, the apostle's put ting the question in this manner,
   takes away the main ground of this objection against the resurrection,
   from the impossibility of the thing. For the main reason, why it was
   looked upon as impossible, was, because it was contrary to the course
   of nature, that there should be any return from a perfect privation to
   a habit, and that a body perfectly dead should be restored to life
   again: but for all this, no man that believes a God, who made the
   world, and this natural frame of things, but must think it very
   reasonable to believe, that he can do things far above the power of any
   thing that he hath made.

   III. This question implies, that it is not a thing incredible to
   natural reason, that God should be able to raise the dead. I do not
   say, that by natural light we can discover that God will raise the
   dead; for that, depending merely upon the will of God, can no otherwise
   be certainly known than by Divine revelation: but that God can do this,
   is not at all incredible to natural reason. And this is sufficiently
   implied in the question which St. Paul asks, in which he appeals to
   Festus and Agrippa, neither of them Christians; "Why should it be
   thought a thing in credible with you, that God should raise the dead?"
   And why should he appeal to them concerning the credibility of this
   matter, if it be a thing incredible to natural reason?

   That it is not, I shall first endeavour to prove, and then to answer
   the chief objections against the possibility of it.

   And I prove it thus: it is not incredible to natural reason, that God
   made the world, and all the creatures in it; that mankind is his
   offspring; and that "he gives us life, and breath, and all things."
   This was acknowledged and firmly believed by many of the heathens. And,
   indeed, whoever believes that the being of God may be known by natural
   light, must grant, that it may be known by the natural light of reason,
   that God made the world; because one of the chief arguments for the
   being of a God, is taken from those visible effects of wisdom, and
   power, and goodness, which we see in the frame of the world. Now he
   that can do the greater, can undoubtedly do the less; he that made all
   things of nothing, can much more raise a body out of the dust; he who
   at first gave life to so many inanimate beings, can easily restore that
   which is dead to life again. It is an excellent saying of one of the
   Jewish rabbies "That he who made that which was not, to be, can
   certainly make that which once was, to be again." This hath the force
   of a demonstration; for no man that believes that God hath done the
   one, can make any doubt but that he can if he please do the other.

   This seems to be so very clear, that they must be strong objections
   indeed, that can render it incredible.

   There are but two that I know of, that are of any consideration, and I
   shall not be afraid to represent them to you with their utmost
   advantage; and they are these:

   First, Against the resurrection in general: it is pretended impossible,
   after the bodies of men are resolved into dust, to recollect all the
   dispersed parts, and bring them together, to be united into one body.

   The second is levelled against the resurrection in some particular
   instances, and pretends it to be impossible in some cases only; viz.
   when that which was the matter of one man's body, does afterwards
   become the matter of another man's body; in which case, say they, it is
   impossible that both these should, at the resurrection, each have their
   own body.

   The difficulty of both these objections is perfectly avoided by those
   who hold, that it is not necessary that our bodies at the resurrection
   should consist of the very same parts of matter that they did before;
   there being no such great difference between one parcel of dust and
   another; neither in respect of the power of God, which can as easily
   command this parcel of dust as that, to become a living body, and being
   united to the soul, to rise up and walk: so that the miracle of the
   resurrection will be all one in the main, whether our bodies be made of
   the very same matter they were before, or not. Nor will there be any
   difference as to us; for whatever matter our bodies be made of, when
   they are once re-united to our souls, they will be then as much our
   own, as if they had been made of the very same matter of which they
   consisted before. Besides that, the change which the resurrection will
   make in our bodies will be so great, that we could not know them to be
   the same though they were so.

   Now upon this supposition, which seems philosophical enough, the force
   of both these objections is wholly declined. But there is no need to
   fly to this refuge; and therefore I will take this article of the
   resurrection in the strictest sense, for the raising of a body to life,
   consisting of the same individual matter that it did before; and in
   this sense, I think it hath generally been received by Christians, not
   with out ground, from Scripture. I will only mention one text, which
   seems very strongly to imply it: (Rev. xx. 13.) "And the sea gave up
   the dead which were in it; and death and the grave delivered up the
   dead which were in them; and they were judged every man according to
   his works." Now why should the sea and the grave be said to deliver up
   their dead, if there were not a resurrection of the same body; but any
   dust formed into a living body, and united to the soul, would serve the
   turn? We will therefore take it for granted, that the very same body
   shall be raised. And I doubt not even in this sense, to vindicate the
   possibility of the resurrection from both these objections.

   First, Against the resurrection, in general, of the same body; it is
   pretended impossible, after the bodies of men are mouldered into dust,
   and by infinite accidents have been scattered up and down the world,
   and have undergone a thousand changes, to recollect and rally together
   the very same parts of which they consisted before. This the heathens
   used to object to the primitive Christians; for which reason they also
   used to burn the bodies of the martyrs, and to scatter their ashes in
   the air, to be blown about by the wind, in derision of their hopes of a
   resurrection.

   I know not how strong malice might make this objection to appear, but
   surely in reason it is very weak: for it wholly depends upon a gross
   mistake of the nature of God and his providence, as if it did not
   extend to the smallest things; as if God did not know all things that
   he hath made, and had them not always in his view, and perfectly under
   his command; and as if it were a trouble and burden to in finite
   knowledge and power, to understand and order the least things: whereas
   infinite knowledge and power can know and manage all things, with as
   much ease, as we can understand and order any one thing.

   So that this objection is grounded upon a low and false apprehension of
   the Divine nature, and is only fit for Epicurus's herd, who fancied to
   themselves a sort of slothful and unthinking deities, whose happiness
   consisted in their laziness, and a privilege to do nothing. I proceed
   therefore to the

   Second objection, which is more close and pressing; and this is
   levelled against the resurrection in. some particular instances. I will
   mention but two, by which all the rest may be measured and answered.

   One is, of those who are drowned in the sea, and their bodies eaten up
   by fishes, and turned into their nourishment; and those fishes,
   perhaps, eaten after wards by men, and converted into the substance of
   their bodies.

   The other is of the cannibals; some of whom, as credible relations tell
   us, have lived wholly, or chiefly, of the flesh of men; and
   consequently the whole, or the greatest part, of the substance of their
   bodies is made of the bodies of other men. In these and the like cases,
   wherein one man's body is sup posed to be turned into the substance of
   another man's body, how should both these at the resurrection each
   recover his own body? So that this objection is like that of the
   Sadducees to our Saviour, concerning a woman that had seven husbands;
   they ask, "Whose wife of the seven shall she be at the resurrection?"
   So here, when several have had the same body, Whose shall it be at the
   resurrection? And how shall they be supplied that have it not?

   This is the objection; and, in order to the answering of it, I shall
   premise these two things:

   I. That the body of man is not a constant and permanent thing, always
   continuing in the same state, and consisting of the same matter; but a
   successive thing, which is continually spending, and continually
   renewing itself; every day losing some thing of the matter which it had
   before, and gaining new: so that most men have new bodies oftener than
   they have new clothes, only with this difference, that we change our
   clothes commonly at once, but our bodies by degrees.

   And this is undeniably certain from experience. For so much as our
   bodies grow, so much new matter is added to them, over and besides the
   repairing of what is continually spent; and after a man be come to his
   full growth, so much of his food as every day turns into nourishment,
   so much of his yester day's body is usually wasted, and carried off by
   in sensible perspiration; that is, breathed out at the pores of his
   body; which, according to the static experiment of Sanctorius, a
   learned physician, who, for several years together, weighed himself
   exactly every day, is (as I remember) according to the proportion of
   five to eight, of all that a man eats and drinks. Now, according to
   this proportion, every man must change his body several times in a
   year.

   It is true, indeed, the more solid parts of the body, as the bones, do
   not change so often as the fluid and fleshy; but that they also do
   change is certain, because they grow, and whatever grows is nourished
   and spends, because otherwise it would not need to be repaired.

   II. The body which a man hath at any time of his life, is as much his
   own body, as that which he hath at his death; so that, if the very
   matter of his body, which a man had any time of his life, be raised, it
   is as much his own and the same body, as that which he had at his
   death, and commonly much more perfect; because they who die of
   lingering sickness, or old age, are usually mere skeletons when they
   die; so that there is no reason to suppose, that the very matter of
   which our bodies consist at the time of our death, shall be that which
   shall be raised; that being commonly the worst, and most imperfect body
   of all the rest.

   These two things being premised, the answer to this objection cannot be
   difficult. For as to the more solid and firm parts of the body, as the
   skull and bones, it is not pretended that the cannibals ate them; and
   if they did, so much of the matter, even of these solid parts, wastes
   away in a few years, as, being collected together, would supply them
   many times over. As for the fleshy and fluid parts, these are so very
   often changed and renewed, that we can allow the cannibals to eat them
   all up, and to turn them all into nourishment, and yet no man need
   contend for want of a body of his own at the resurrection; viz. any of
   those bodies which he had ten or twenty years before, which are every
   whit as good, and as much his own, as that which was eaten.

   You will pardon me, I hope, that I have dwelt so long upon so
   contentious an argument, when you consider how necessary what I have
   said is to the vindicating of so great an article of our religion; and
   especially in this evil age of unbelief, when greater matters than this
   are called in question.

   Having thus shewn that the resurrection is not a thing incredible to
   natural reason, I should now proceed to shew the certainty of it from
   Divine revelation. For, as reason tells us, it is not impossible; so
   the word of God hath assured us, that it is certain. The texts of
   Scripture are so many and clear to this purpose, and so well known to
   all Christians, that I will produce none. I shall only tell you, that
   as it is expressly revealed in the gospel, so our blessed Saviour, for
   the confirmation of our faith, and the comfort and encouragement of our
   hope, hath given us the experiment of it in his own resurrection, which
   is "the earnest and first-fruits" of ours. So St. Paul tells us, that
   "Christ is risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them
   that slept." And that Christ did really rise from the dead, we have as
   good evidence, as for any ancient matter of fact, which we do most
   firmly believe; and more and greater evidence than this the thing is
   not capable of; and because it is not, no reasonable man ought to
   require it.

   Now what remains, but to conclude this discourse with those practical
   inferences which our apostle makes from this doctrine of the
   resurrection? and I shall mention these two:

   The first, for our support and comfort under the infirmities and
   miseries of this mortal life.

   The second, for the encouragement of obedience and a good life.

   I. For our comfort and support under the infirmities and miseries of
   this mortal state. The consideration of the glorious change of our
   bodies at the resurrection of the just, cannot but be a great comfort
   to us, under all bodily pain and sufferings.

   One of the greatest burdens of human nature, is the frailty and
   infirmity of our bodies, the necessities they are frequently pressed
   withal, the manifold diseases they are liable to, and the dangers and
   terrors of death, to which they are continually subject and enslaved.
   But the time is coming, if we be careful to prepare ourselves for it,
   when we shall be clothed with other kind of bodies, free from all these
   miseries and inconveniencies which flesh and blood is subject to. "For
   these vile bodies shall be changed and fashioned like to the glorious
   body of the Son of God." When our bodies shall be raised to a new life,
   they shall become incorruptible; "For this corruptible must put on
   incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality; and then shall
   come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in
   victory." When this last enemy is conquered, there shall be no fleshly
   lusts, nor brutish passions, "to fight against the soul; no law in our
   members, to war against the law of our minds;" no disease to torment
   us, no danger of death to amaze and terrify us. Then all the passions
   and appetites of our outward man shall be subject to the reason of our
   minds, and our bodies shall partake of the immortality of our souls. It
   is but a very little while that our spirits shall be crushed and
   clogged with these heavy and sluggish bodies: at the resurrection they
   shall be refined from all dregs of corruption, and become spiritual,
   and in corruptible, and glorious, and every way suited to the activity
   and perfection of a glorified soul, and "the spirits of just men made
   perfect."

   II. For the encouragement of obedience and a good life. Let the belief
   of this great article of our faith have the same influence upon us,
   which St. Paul tells us it had upon him: (Acts xxiv. 15, 16.) "I have
   hope towards God, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both
   of the just and un just; and herein do I exercise myself, always to
   have a conscience void of offence towards God and towards men." The
   firm belief of a resurrection to another life, should make every one of
   us very careful how we demean ourselves in this life, and afraid to do
   any thing, or to neglect any thing, that may defeat our hopes of a
   blessed immortality, and expose us to the extreme and endless misery of
   body and soul in another life.

   Particularly, it should be an argument to us, "to glorify God in our
   bodies, and in our spirits;" and to use the members of the one, and the
   faculties of the other, as instruments of righteousness, unto holiness.
   We should reverence ourselves, and take heed, not only how we defile
   our souls by sinful passions, but how we dishonour our bodies by
   sensual and brutish lusts; since God hath designed so great an honour
   and happiness for both at the resurrection.

   So often as we think of a blessed resurrection to eternal life, and the
   happy consequences of it; the thoughts of so glorious a reward should
   make us diligent and unwearied in the service of so good a Master, and
   so great a Prince, who can and will prefer us to infinitely greater
   honours, than any that are to be had in this world. This inference the
   apostle makes from the doctrine of the resurrection: (1 Cor. xv. 58.)
   "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable, always
   abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye know, that your
   labour shall not be in vain in the Lord."

   Nay, we may begin this blessed state while we are upon earth, by
   settling our "hearts and affections upon the things that are above,"
   and "having our conversations in heaven, from whence also we look for a
   Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile bodies, that
   they may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the
   working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself."

   "Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus
   Christ, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the
   everlasting covenant, make us perfect in every good work to do his
   will, working in us always that which is pleasing in his sight, through
   Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever. Amen."

SERMON CXCIV.

  THE RESURRECTION OF OUR SAVIOUR CONSIDERED, AS AN ARGUMENT FOR SEEKING THINGS
  ABOVE.

   If ye then be risen with Christy seek those things which are above,
   where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affections on
   things above, not on things on the earth.--Col. iii. 1, 2.

   THE apostle in this Epistle (as his manner is in all the rest), having
   laid the doctrine of the gospel for a foundation, and endeavoured to
   rectify some errors, both in doctrine and practice, which the
   Christians at Colosse were seduced into, by the guile and arts of false
   teachers and apostles; as particularly the worship of angels, and, out
   of a pretence of humility, addressing themselves to God by their
   mediation, which is the particular scope and design of this Epistle:
   the apostle, I say, having in the former part of if endeavoured to set
   them right in this mat ter, and to establish their minds in the faith
   and doctrine of Christ, in the latter part of it exhorts them to a
   conversation answerable to the doctrine of Christ, to a holy and
   heavenly life, at the be ginning of this third chapter: "If ye then be
   risen with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ
   sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above,
   not on things on the earth."

   This inference is drawn from what he had said at a good distance
   before; namely, at the 12th verse of the former chapter; "Being buried
   with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him, through the
   faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead."
   "Being buried with him in baptism:" for the full understanding of this
   expression, we must have recourse to that parallel text, (Rom. vi.
   3-5.) which will explain to us the meaning of this phrase: "Know ye not
   that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized
   into his death? therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death,
   that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
   Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have
   been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in
   the likeness of his resurrection." Where we see, that "to be baptized
   into the death and resurrection of Christ," is to be baptized into the
   similitude and likeness of them; and the resemblance is this;--that as
   Christ being dead was buried in the grave, and after some stay in it,
   that is, for three days, he was raised again out of it by the glorious
   power of God, to a new and heavenly life, being not long after taken up
   into heaven to live at the right hand of God; so Christians, when they
   were baptized, were immersed into the water three times, their bodies
   being covered all over with it; which is therefore called, our being
   "buried with him by baptism into death;" and after some short stay
   under water, were raised, or taken up again out of it, as if they had
   been recovered to a new life; by all which was spiritually signified,
   our dying to sin, and being raised to a Divine and heavenly life,
   "through the faith of the operation of God;" that is, by that Divine
   and supernatural power, which raised up Christ from the dead. So that
   Christians from thenceforth were to "reckon themselves dead unto sin;
   but alive unto God through Jesus Christ," as the apostle speaks, (Rom.
   vi. 11.)

   Now upon this ground, that we are "buried with Christ in baptism," and
   "risen with him to a new and heavenly life," the apostle founds the
   exhortation in the text, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek the
   things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.
   Set your affections on things above; not on things on the earth." So
   that the words are an earnest exhortation to a Divine life, and a
   spiritual and heavenly conversation. In which there are two things to
   be considered:

   First, The duty we are exhorted to, which is heavenly-mindedness. "Seek
   the things which are above;" and "Set your affections on things above."

   Secondly, The arguments by which the apostle urgeth and presseth this
   exhortation. "If ye be risen with Christ, seek the things which are
   above;" and "Seek the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at
   the right hand of God." So that my work will be,

   First, To shew the nature of the duty to which we are exhorted. And,

   Secondly, The force of the arguments which are used to persuade us to
   it.

   First, For the nature of the duty to which we are exhorted; and it is
   expressed both affirmatively and negatively.

   1. Affirmatively; and the apostle useth two several expressions. "Seek
   the things which are above;" and, "Set your affections on things
   above."

   2. Negatively; "And not on things on the earth." And this seems to be
   added, not only to explain and ascertain the object, and to add
   vehemence and earnestness to the exhortation; but likewise to set off
   the excellency of the object, by way of opposition and comparison. On
   the things that are above, and not upon those pitiful and inferior
   things which are upon the earth. And likewise to shew the in
   consistency of these, and the impossibility of seeking and setting our
   affections upon both in an intense degree. For that would be to have
   two chief ends, to love God and mammon; to serve two masters, which our
   Saviour hath told us is impossible. But this I shall use afterwards, as
   an argument to enforce the exhortation.

   To explain the nature of this duty, I shall consider the act and the
   object.

   I. For the act, here are two words used to express it, zeteite and
   phroneite, seek, and set your affections; and in these two words, these
   four things seem to be comprehended--an act of our under standings
   about these things; the ardency of our affections; and the activity of
   our endeavours in the pursuit of them; and a clear preference of the
   things which are above, to the things of the earth, when they come in
   competition. For these two words do comprehend, not only the power of
   our understandings, and wills, and affections, and an earnest attention
   and application of mind to these things; but the activity of our
   endeavours about them.

   1. Here is implied an act of our understandings, that we should mind
   and think upon these things, that we should often consider them, and
   meditate upon them; that heaven should be much in our thoughts, and the
   glory and excellency of that state which we hope to attain to, and by
   what ways and means we may come to be made partakers of that blessed
   inheritance.

   2; It implies, likewise, an act of our affections; that we heartily
   love and desire the things that are above, with that ardency and
   vehemency of affection, which is proportionable to the worth and
   excellency of them. And both these are included in the word phroneite,
   which is sometimes translated to mind, sometimes to set our affections
   upon a thing.

   3. Activity and industry in the prosecution of these things, if by any
   means we may attain them. And this is implied in the word zeteite,
   "seek the things which are above." When we know there are such
   treasures in heaven, so great a reward laid up for good men, joys so
   unspeakable and full of glory, and when our understandings have dwelt
   so long upon these things as to work upon our affections, these, like
   so many springs of motion, will set our endeavours on work, for the
   obtaining of what we so much love and desire, and will make us
   inquisitive, with the young man in the gospel, "What good thing we
   shall do, that we may inherit eternal life;" by what means we may best
   secure our title to heaven and happiness; and very industrious to
   acquire those qualities and dispositions, which will fit us for heaven,
   and the blessed sight and enjoyment of God; nay, by which we may begin
   this happy state here, by our conversation in heaven, whilst we are
   sojourning here below, as "pilgrims and strangers in the earth."

   4. It implies a clear preference of the things above to the things of
   the earth, when they come in competition. And in this sense the word
   phronein is observed to be used in good authors, for taking part with,
   and adhering to, one side, when two parties or interests come in
   competition. And, indeed, this phrase and form of speech, when the
   thing is expressed affirmatively and negatively, is very often used by
   way of comparison, when two things come in competition. "Lay not up for
   yourselves treasures upon earth: but lay up for yourselves treasures in
   heaven. Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that which
   endureth to eternal life." So here, "Set your affections on things
   above, not on things on the earth." When heaven and earth come in
   competition, the happiness of the next life, and the enjoyments of
   this, the interest of your souls, and of your bodies, "the things which
   are not seen, and are eternal, and the things which are seen, and are
   but temporal;" a holy, and heavenly, and virtuous life, and a sensual
   and sinful course, "choose the better part," stick to that which is the
   true and lasting interest; prefer heaven before earth, and the care of
   your souls to that of your bodies, things eternal to things temporal,
   and a holy and virtuous life, which leads to heaven, to those sinful
   and vicious practices which will sink men into perdition. For that this
   also the apostle means by "things on the earth," sinful lusts and
   practices, seems very probable from what follows: (ver. 5.) "Mortify,
   therefore, your members, which are upon the earth."

   II. Let us consider the object of this act, what it is that we are to
   seek and set our affections upon; and that is "the things which are
   above."

   1. The glorious God and Father of all, and his blessed and eternal Son,
   our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit of God; these are the great
   objects of our contemplation and adoration. And then the holy angels,
   and "the spirits of just men made perfect," who are examples to us, of
   doing the will of God here on earth, as it is done by them in heaven.

   2. The blessed state and condition which we aspire after in the next
   life, with all the joys and glories of it, "such as eye hath not seen,
   nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man."

   3. The dispositions to be acquired, and the actions and duties to be
   performed by us, as necessary qualifications and means for the
   obtaining of this happiness, and bringing us to the possession of it;
   all these are comprehended in the latitude of the object, "the things
   which are above."

   And to seek, and mind, and set our affections upon these, is to do
   those things, which the consideration of each of these respectively
   calls for; so to meditate on God and mind him, as to fear, and love,
   and serve him; to seek his glory as our last end, and the enjoyment of
   him as our chief good; to seek his favour above all things, and to sue
   to him as the fountain of all grace, and "the giver of every good and
   perfect gift," and of all blessings temporal, spiritual, and eternal,
   by the powerful intercession of his Son, the great and only Mediator
   between God and man, to be obtained for us, and to be wrought in us, by
   the powerful virtue and operation of the Holy Spirit. So to mind the
   angels and blessed saints above, as to aspire after their society, by
   imitating their virtues, and "being followers of those, who through
   faith and patience have inherited the promises." So to meditate on our
   future blessedness, as to raise our hearts and affections above this
   world, and effectually to engage us to fit ourselves for that blessed
   state and condition, that we may be "meet to be made partakers of that
   glorious inheritance." And, lastly, so to mind all the duties and means
   necessary and conducing to our salvation, as effectually to perform
   them; to order our lives, and all the actions of them, with a regard to
   eternity; in a word, to omit and neglect nothing that may further and
   promote the great design of our eternal salvation, and to do nothing
   that may contradict or hinder it. This is to seek and "set our
   affections upon the things that are above," And thus I have done with
   the first thing I propounded, the nature of the duty which we are
   exhorted to. I proceed to the

   Second thing I propounded, which was, to consider the force of the
   arguments which are used to persuade us to it. Here are three arguments
   in the text to this purpose; two of them are express, and the third of
   them implied.

   L "If ye be risen with Christ, seek the things which are above."

   II. "Seek the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right
   hand of God."

   III. The transcendent and incomparable excellency of the things above,
   in comparison of earthly things. This is intimated in the opposition,
   "set your affections on the things which are above; and not on things
   on the earth." I shall briefly shew the force of each of these
   arguments.

   I. "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek the things which are above."
   That is, if ye believe his resurrection, if ye will be conformed to him
   in it, if ye be made partakers of the power and virtue of it.

   1. If ye believe the resurrection of Christ. The resurrection of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, was the great seal of his ministry, and confirmation
   of his doctrine: and one great branch of his doctrine was
   heavenly-mindedness, that we should "lay up for ourselves treasures in
   heaven, because where our treasure is, there will our hearts be also;"
   that we should "first seek the kingdom of God, and the righteousness
   thereof."

   2. If we will bear a conformity and resemblance to him in his
   resurrection. He is our great pattern and example which the gospel
   propounds to us; and that we may have the nearer conformity to him, the
   apostle doth not only propose the virtues of his life to our imitation,
   but where we cannot literally imitate him, the apostle urgeth spiritual
   conformity, that those things which he did and suffered in his body, we
   should do and suffer spiritually; as Christ "died for sin," so we
   should "die to sin;" as he literally "rose again from the dead, so, in
   conformity to him, we should be spiritually "raised to newness of
   life." "As he ascended into heaven," so we should "ascend thither also
   in our hearts and affections." (Col. ii. 12.) "Buried with him in
   baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him, through the faith of the
   operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead." (Rom. vi. 4, 5.)
   "Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as
   Christ was raised up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even so
   we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted
   together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness
   of his resurrection." To be raised from the dead, is in order to a new
   life. So the apostle tells us: (ver. 9-11.) "Knowing that Christ being
   raised from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over
   him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth,
   he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead,
   indeed, unto sin; but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ our Lord."
   As the resurrection of Christ was in order to a better and happier
   life, to his ascension into heaven, and his living with God: so, in
   conformity to Christ, our spiritual resurrection should be in order to
   a heavenly and Divine life. And what is the meaning of all this? but
   that men are apt to imitate those whom they love, and do affect to
   resemble them as much as they can. And therefore, to endear our duty to
   us, the mortification of our lusts, and a holy life, the apostle tells
   us, that hereby we bear a conformity to Christ, the great object of our
   love and imitation.

   3. If ye be made partakers of the power and virtue of his resurrection.
   The resurrection of Christ is not only a pattern, but hath a power and
   efficacy in it, to raise us to a spiritual and heavenly life. When
   Christ rose, he did not rise alone, but many of the bodies of the
   saints who were dead rose with him, to signify to us the power of his
   resurrection. It communicated a virtue to those who had an interest in
   the merits of his death and sufferings, whereby they are enabled to
   live a new and heavenly life. (John xi. 25.) "I am the resurrection and
   the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
   live." (Eph. i. 19.) "And what is the exceeding greatness of his power
   to us-ward, who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
   which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead." (Phil.
   iii. 10, 11.) "That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection,
   and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his
   death; if by any means I may attain the resurrection from the dead."
   (Col. ii. 1, 3.) "And you being dead in your sins, and the
   uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him." Now
   this power is derived to us by "believing on him who raised up Jesus
   from the dead, that he is also able to raise us, who are dead in
   trespasses and sins, to a Divine and heavenly life." The

   Second argument is contained in these words--"Seek the things which are
   above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God." Which words do
   declare to us the exaltation of Christ's human nature, and his being
   advanced to be the king and governor of his church, having all power
   and judgment committed to him. (Luke xxiv. 26.) Christ's ascension, and
   his sitting at the right hand of God, is called, his entering into his
   glory: "Ought he not to have suffered these things, and then to enter
   into his glory?" That is, to be invested with all power and authority
   for the good of the church. But most particularly the apostle describes
   this: (Eph. i. 20-22.) "And set him at his own right hand in heavenly
   places, far above all principalities, and powers, and might, and
   dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but
   that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and
   given him to be head over all things to the church."

   And now the force of this argument is from the relation that is between
   the head and the members, between Christ and Christians. The members
   have an affection for the head, which makes them aspire heavenwards;
   and the head hath an influence upon the members. "If I be lifted up
   from the earth (says our Lord), I will draw all men unto me." This is
   spoken of his crucifixion, signifying what death he should die, as the
   text tells us, (John xii. 32, 33.) But it is proportionably true of his
   ascension, and sitting at the right hand of God; for there is a power
   and virtue in the resurrection of Christ, and in his ascension into
   heaven, as well as in his death, to draw all men to him. The gift of
   God's Holy Spirit is the fruit of his ascension and exaltation "at the
   right hand of the Majesty on high:" and it is by the powerful operation
   of the Spirit of God upon our hearts, that we are raised to newness of
   life, and our affections fixed upon heavenly thing's. We are naturally
   bowed down to the earth, and inclined to the things of this world,
   Curvæ in terris animæ, et cælestium inanes: but our glorified Saviour,
   sitting at the right hand of God, by the power of his Spirit, draws our
   affections to him. The

   Third and last argument, which is but implied in the text, is the
   transcendent and incomparable excellency of heavenly things, above
   things on the earth, which the apostle intimates by the opposition;
   "Set your affections on things above; not on things on the earth."
   Earthly things are perishing and transitory, gross and unsatisfactory,
   and cannot be the felicity of an immortal soul, being neither suited to
   the spiritual nature, nor to the immortal duration of our souls: they
   can neither satisfy us while we live, nor preserve us from death, nor
   comfort us in it, nor accompany us into the other world, nor contribute
   any thing to our happiness there; and if they can do nothing towards
   our happiness, why should we set our hearts upon them? They that seek
   for happiness in earthly things, are like the women sitting over our
   Saviour's sepulchre, with their faces bowed down to the earth--they
   seek the living among the dead: our happiness is not here, it is risen,
   it is above. Let our hearts ascend thither, where our happiness and our
   treasure is. Why should we bestow our affections upon these low and
   mean things, when there are incomparably better objects to fix them
   upon?

   The inference from all this shall be to engage and persuade us by all
   these arguments and considerations, "to seek and mind the things which
   are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God;" and "to have
   our conversation there, where our Saviour is, and from whence also we
   look for him again, to change these vile bodies, that they may be made
   like unto his glorious body, according to the working of that mighty
   power, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself." Let all our
   actions have relation to another world, and our conversation declare,
   that we are "mindful of another country, that is a heavenly." Is Christ
   our head risen and ascended into heaven? Let us in our hearts and
   affections follow him thither, and patiently wait until he receive our
   souls, and raise our bodies, and take us wholly to himself, that we may
   be "for ever with the Lord."

   The resurrection of Christ is a demonstration of a future state after
   this life, and a pledge of a blessed immortality in another world. For
   our Lord by his resurrection from the dead, hath conquered death, and
   abolished it, "and brought life and immortality to light." He is "the
   first-fruits of them that slept," and his resurrection is an earnest
   and assurance of ours; and from thence the apostle makes this
   inference, "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and
   unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye
   know, that your labour shall not be in vain in the Lord." The belief of
   a future state after this life, should put us upon the most earnest and
   vigorous endeavours to secure this happy condition to ourselves: "If by
   any means (as the apostle expressed! it,) we may attain the
   resurrection of the dead." It should raise us above the world and the
   lusts of it, above all the terrors and temptations of it.

   As, on the one hand, the serious thoughts of our mortality should check
   our eager pursuit of this world; so, on the other hand, the belief of a
   life to come should quicken our endeavours for the obtaining it: seeing
   we hope for so happy a state, we should prepare ourselves for it by
   purity, and holiness of heart and life, by perseverance, and "a patient
   continuance in well-doing. What manner of persons ought we to be, in
   all holy conversation and godliness," who have such hopes and
   expectations? "Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself,
   even as he is pure." Now that "life and immortality are brought to
   light by the gospel," what greater, what other design can any man
   propose to himself, than to be happy for ever? For such a prize, who
   would not strive, and run, and take any pains? Who would not deny
   himself "the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season;" resist
   temptations, and conflict with difficulties, and glory in tribulations
   and sufferings, and be constant and "faithful to the death, in hope of
   that eternal life, which God that cannot lie hath promised?"

   In our pursuit of the things of this world, we usually prevent
   enjoyment by expectation: we anticipate our own happiness, and eat out
   the heart and sweetness of worldly pleasures, by delightful
   forethoughts of them; so that when we come to possess them, they do not
   answer the expectation, nor satisfy the desires which were raised about
   them, and they vanish into nothing: but the things which are above, are
   so great, so solid, so durable, so glorious, that we cannot raise our
   thoughts to an equal height with them; we cannot enlarge our desires
   beyond a possibility of satisfaction. Our hearts are greater than the
   world; but God is greater than our hearts; and the happiness which he
   hath laid up for us, is like himself incomprehensibly great and
   glorious. Let the thoughts of this raise us above this world, and
   inspire us with greater thoughts and designs, than the care and
   concernments of this present life.

   We all profess most firmly to believe, that after a few days we shall
   leave this world, and all the enjoyments of it, and go to the place
   from whence we shall not return; that we shall enter upon an un
   changeable state of happiness or misery, according as we have demeaned
   ourselves in this present life; that great care and diligence is
   necessary to "work out our own salvation;" that there must be a great
   preparation of ourselves, by unspotted purity of heart and life, to
   make ourselves "meet for an inheritance with them that are sanctified;"
   that we must labour, and strive, and run, and fight, "and give all
   diligence, to make our calling and election sure;" that we had need to
   "watch and pray always, that we may be accounted worthy to escape the
   judgment of the great day, and to stand before the Son of man." Such
   thoughts as these should continually possess our souls, and heaven
   should be always in our eye, as if, with St. Stephen, "We saw the
   heavens opened, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God," to see
   how we behave ourselves here below; and when "we have fought a good
   fight, and finished our course, and kept the faith, to receive us to
   himself, that where he is, there we may be also."

   "To whom, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory
   now and for evermore. Amen."

SERMON CXCV.

  THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND BENEFITS OF OUR SAVIOUR S ASCENSION.

   And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken
   up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked
   steadfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them
   in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
   gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus which is taken up from you into
   heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into
   heaven.--Acts i. 9-11.

   THERE are two occasions of this day [3] accidentally meeting together,
   which bear some resemblance to one another; the ascension of our
   blessed Saviour into heaven, and his exaltation in his kingdom, being
   "crowned with glory and honour, and set on the right hand of the
   Majesty on high:" and the restoration of our sovereign to his just
   rights, and royal state and dignity here upon earth, by a miraculous
   providence of God, and, as it were, by a kind of resurrection from the
   dead.

   The first of these being of a more spiritual and excellent nature,
   shall be the subject of my present discourse, not forgetting the other
   in the application of it.

   The great foundation of our religion is the history of our Saviour, of
   his incarnation, and miracles, and life, of his resurrection from the
   dead, and ascension into heaven, and intercession for us at the right
   hand of God; and the doctrines and articles concerning these, make up
   the main body of the Christian faith: and, therefore, nothing can be
   more useful than the explication of these, and a serious consideration
   and meditation upon them.

   In these words you have an account of our Saviour's ascension into
   heaven; concerning which, we will consider these three things:

   First, The circumstances foregoing his ascension.

   Secondly, The circumstances of his ascension.

   Thirdly, The consequent benefits and advantages of it.

   First, The circumstances foregoing his ascension: "And when he had
   spoken these things, he was taken up." This refers to the discourse
   which our Saviour had with his apostles, immediately before he was
   taken up from them into heaven, of which we have an account in the
   verses before the text, (ver. 4.) Being assembled with them, and just
   ready to take his leave of them, he commands them "that they should not
   depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which
   they had heard of him:" that is, they should not disperse themselves,
   till the Holy Ghost, which he had promised to send from his Father, was
   come upon them, in those miraculous gifts and powers, where by they
   should be qualified for the preaching of the gospel to the world.

   And when our Saviour had given them this charge, they put a question to
   him, concerning a thing which, notwithstanding he had so plainly
   declared to them that "his kingdom was not of this world," did still
   run in their minds, about the temporal reign of the Messias, and a
   glorious kingdom by him to be set up among the Jews; (ver. 6.) "They
   asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom
   to Israel?" To this our Saviour gives them no direct answer, neither
   that he would nor that he would not do what they expected, but gently
   reprehends their curiosity; (ver. 7.) "It is not for you to know the
   times and seasons, which the Father hath put into his own power." And
   instead of satisfying them in things that did not concern them, he
   discourseth to them about those things which did concern them; namely,
   how they should be qualified and sent forth to preach the gospel to the
   world: (ver. 8.) "But ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost
   is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem,
   and in all Judea, and Samaria, and unto the utmost parts of the earth.
   And when he had spoken these things, he was taken up." These are the
   circumstances preceding his ascension.

   Secondly, We will consider the circumstances of his ascension; and they
   are these four:

   I. That our Saviour was taken up, while he was blessing his disciples;
   (Luke xxiv. 51.) "And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was
   parted from them, and carried up into heaven."

   II. That he was taken up in the view of his disciples, and while their
   eyes were attentively fixed upon him: "while they beheld, he was taken
   up," (ver. 9.) And (ver. 10.) it is said, "they looked steadfastly
   towards heaven, as he went up."

   III. That he was taken up in a cloud: "and a cloud received him out of
   their sight."

   IV. The place whither he went: (ver. 11.) "The same Jesus which is
   taken up from you into heaven;" which is elsewhere more particularly
   expressed, by declaring the dignity to which he was exalted in heaven,
   "being set down on the right hand of God," and "having all power in
   heaven and in earth committed to him." These are the chief
   circumstances of his ascension, which I shall speak briefly to.

   I. That our blessed Saviour was taken up while he was blessing his
   disciples. This St. Luke does not mention here in the history of the
   Acts, having mentioned it before in his gospel, to which he refers us;
   (Luke xxiv. 50, 51.) speaking of our Saviour and his apostles; "And he
   led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed
   them." Lifting up of the hands was a ceremony used among the Jews, in
   blessing the people. Lev. ix. 22. it is said there, that "Aaron lifted
   up his hands towards the people, and blessed them." So our Saviour
   here, in imitation of the usual ceremonies among the Jews: "And it came
   to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up
   into heaven." The first tidings of our Saviour's birth were attended
   with praises to God, and blessings to men; "Glory to God on high, peace
   on earth, and good-will towards men." And when he died, he breathed out
   his soul in blessings to his enemies; in the height of his sufferings
   he was full of hearty prayers, and good wishes, for those who were the
   cause of them: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."
   And after his resurrection from the dead, just as he left the world, he
   was taken out of it, and translated into heaven, with a blessing in his
   mouth: "while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up
   into heaven." And, indeed, his whole life, all that he did, and all
   that he suffered, his coming into the world, and his going out of it,
   was all a blessing to mankind; "God sent him to bless us, in turning us
   away every one from his iniquity." He was always wishing well to us,
   and doing well for us; "he went about doing good."

   A blessed pattern to us, "leaving us an example, that we should follow
   his steps:" a lovely and desirable example; in imitation whereof, we
   should endeavour that our whole life may be a blessing and benefit to
   mankind; and that when we leave the world, we may be found so doing as
   our Lord did, doing the work of heaven while we are going thither.

   II. He was taken up in the view of his disciples, and while their eyes
   were attentively fixed upon him: "while they beheld, he was taken up,"
   (ver. 9.) And (ver. 10.) it is said, "they looked steadfastly toward
   heaven, as he went up." After the apostles were fully convinced, by
   several appearances of our Saviour to them, and familiar conversation
   with them, that he was indeed risen from the dead; that they might be
   fully satisfied that he came from God, and went to him, he was in their
   sight, while he was speaking to them, taken up into heaven. And this is
   no small confirmation of the truth of our religion, that our Saviour
   did not only work the greatest miracles while he was alive, and after
   death rose again, and conversed among men; but was visibly taken up
   into heaven. So that if all things be duly considered, never did any
   man give so many evidences of his being sent from God, as our blessed
   Saviour did. He delivered the truth of God with a Divine authority; and
   did the works of God with all imaginable evidence of a Divine power;
   and with a Divine patience submitted to the will of God, enduring the
   greatest sufferings; and by the mighty power of God was raised from the
   dead; and in a visible manner, by the same Divine power, taken up into
   heaven.

   III. He was taken up in a cloud: "He was taken up, and a cloud received
   him out of their sight." Which circumstance, though it do not seem very
   material; yet does it fitly represent to us the difference between the
   two dispensations, of the law, and of the gospel. Elias was carried up
   by a whirl wind into heaven, in a fiery chariot, with horses of fire:
   but our Saviour in a cloud; to signify to us, the coolness and calmness
   of the gospel-dispensation, in comparison of that of the law; which
   difference our Saviour had before observed to his disciples, upon a
   remarkable occasion, (Luke ix. 54, 55.) When they would have called for
   fire from heaven, to have consumed the Samaritans for refusing to
   entertain our Saviour, as Elias had done in a like case, our Saviour
   severely reproves that fierce spirit of theirs, as by no means suitable
   to the gospel: "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of: for the
   Son of man came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them." And just
   answer able to the difference between the spirit of Elias and our
   Saviour, was the different manner of their translation into heaven; the
   one gently received up in a cloud; the other violently taken up by a
   whirlwind, carried in a chariot of fire drawn by horses of fire.

   And there is likewise another difference not altogether unworthy of our
   observation. The blessing which Elijah left to Elisha at his parting
   from him, and the promise of his spirit to be imparted to him, is
   conceived in very doubtful words: (2 Kings ii. 9.) "Elijah said to
   Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.
   And Elisha said, Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he
   said, Thou hast asked a hard thing; nevertheless, if thou see me when I
   am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if thou see me not,
   it shall not be so." This was very doubtful, suitable to the obscurity
   of the law: but our Saviour, when he parted from his disciples, makes a
   plain and absolute promise of the Holy Ghost to them, answerable to the
   clearness and grace of the gospel: "Ye shall be baptized with the Holy
   Ghost not many days hence." So wisely did God order all circumstances
   concerning our Saviour, that every thing belonging to him, every action
   that he did, and every circumstance of it, might have some important
   signification.

   IV. The last circumstance of our Saviour's ascension, is the place
   whither he went; (ver. 11.) "This same Jesus which is taken up from you
   into heaven." And this is elsewhere more particularly expressed, by
   declaring the dignity to which he was exalted in heaven; "being set
   down on the right hand of God," and "having all power in heaven and
   earth committed to him." (Mark xvi. 19.) "He was received up into
   heaven, and sat on the right hand of God:" which phrase signifies our
   Saviour's being advanced in his human nature, to an honour and dignity
   next to that of the Divine Majesty; the right hand being esteemed the
   place of greatest honour. This exaltation of Christ, the apostle tells
   us, was conferred upon him as a reward of his great humiliation and
   sufferings; (Heb. xii. 2.) "Who for the joy that was set before him
   endured the cross, and despised the shame, and is set down at the right
   hand of the throne of God." And by virtue of this exaltation, the
   apostle proves him to be exalted in his human nature above the angels.
   (Heb. i. 3, 4.) "When he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down on
   the right hand of the Majesty on high, being made so much better than
   the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name
   than they;" that is, being advanced to a higher dignity; for name among
   the Hebrews signifies dignity and honour. So the apostle useth the word
   name: (Phil. ii. 9-11.) "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him,
   and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of
   Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth,
   and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that
   Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." So, likewise,
   (Eph. i. 20, 21.) "Whom he raised from the dead, and set at his own
   right hand in heavenly places, far above all principalities, and
   powers, and might, and do minion, and every name that is named, not
   only in this world, but in that which is to come." And now, wherein
   this dignity doth consist, the same apostle tells us in the next words;
   that he "hath put all things tinder his feet, and given him to be head
   over all things to the church;" which is the same with what our Saviour
   told his apostles before his ascension--"all power is given me in
   heaven and in earth;" that is, God hath committed the government of the
   world into his hands, for the benefit and advantage of his church here
   in this world, and for the dispensing of rewards and punishments to
   good and bad men in the next life.

   And though the apostles did only see him taken up, and received in a
   cloud out of their sight, and were not witnesses of his advancement and
   exaltation at the right hand of God; yet they had, and we have,
   sufficient assurance of it, both by what our Saviour declared before
   his ascension, and by the effects which followed after. Before he
   ascended, he told them whither he was going, and what power and dignity
   would be conferred upon him, that all power in heaven and earth was
   committed to him; and that, as an evidence of this exaltation at the
   right hand of God, and the power there conferred upon him, he would in
   a few days send down the Holy Ghost upon them in a sensible manner, and
   in great and sensible effects, enabling them to speak with tongues and
   to work all sorts of miracles. After this he was in their sight taken
   up from them, and carried towards heaven; and ten days after, the Holy
   Ghost, according to his promise, came down upon them in miraculous
   powers and gifts. So that here was abundant evidence to them of his
   exaltation in heaven, they having seen him taken up, and carried
   thitherwards, and after this finding the wonderful effects of his being
   there, and of the power which was conferred upon him.

   The third and last thing to be spoken to, is the consequent benefits of
   our Saviour's ascension and exaltation; and they are chiefly these
   three:--The sending of the Holy Ghost; his powerful intercession for us
   at the right hand of God; and the confirmation of our faith, as to the
   truth of his doctrine in general, and particularly as to his coming to
   judgment.

   I, The sending of the Holy Ghost in miraculous powers and gifts upon
   the apostles, to qualify them for the speedy and effectual propagation
   of the gospel, and to give credit to them in the preaching of it. By
   the gift of tongues they were enabled to preach the gospel to all
   nations; and by the other miraculous powers, God bare witness to the
   testimony which they gave of our Saviour's doctrine and resurrection.
   And this was a great benefit; for to this we owe the great blessing of
   the gospel, and the spreading of the Christian religion through the
   world; and this was properly the fruit of our Saviour's ascension into
   heaven, and his exaltation at the right hand of God, and of that royal
   power and majesty which he was invested withal. God, in his wise
   dispensation of things, having so ordered, that this dignity and power
   should be the reward of our Saviour's obedience and sufferings; which
   may serve to explain to us that passage: (John vii. 39.) "This spake he
   of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the
   Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified." The
   giving of these gifts of the Holy Ghost, was purposely reserved by God,
   to be an instance of that power and glory wherewith our Saviour was to
   be invested upon his ascension into heaven, and exaltation at the right
   hand of God; and therefore our Saviour tells his disciples, that they
   ought not to be troubled at his departure, because, until he had left
   them, the Holy Ghost would not come; (John xvi. 7.) "I tell you the
   truth, it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away,
   the Comforter will not come unto you."

   II. Another mighty benefit of our Saviour's ascension and exaltation
   is, his powerful intercession for us at the right hand of God. And this
   is a mighty advantage and comfort, to have a perpetual patron and
   advocate at the right hand of God, to plead our cause, to solicit our
   concernments, and. represent our wants, and to offer up our prayers and
   requests to God, in the virtue of his meritorious sacrifice; to have so
   good a friend in the court of heaven, in such power and favour with the
   great King of the world. This under the law was shadowed by the
   high-priest's going into the holy of holies, once every year alone,
   carrying blood with him, to offer for the sins of the people;
   answerably to which, our Saviour is once for all entered into the
   heavens, to intercede with God for us, by the representation of that
   sacrifice which he offered for our sins, and of that blood which was
   shed for us. So the apostle tells us, (Heb. ix. 24.) that "Christ is
   not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures
   of the true; but into heaven itself, to appear in the presence of God
   for us." And this is a mighty comfort to us under the guilt of our
   sins, that "we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous, who is a propitiation for our sins, and for the sins of the
   whole world." This is a great comfort under all trials and temptations,
   that "we have not a high-priest that cannot be touched with a sense of
   our infirmities; but was, in all points, tempted like as we are." He
   that is our mediator and intercessor, knows by experience the
   infirmities of our nature, and hath learned by his own sufferings to
   compassionate ours.

   And this is a mighty encouragement to our prayers, and gives us
   confidence and hopes of good success in our addresses to God, that they
   are offered by so powerful and prevalent a hand. So the apostle
   reasons: (Heb. iv. 14, 16.) "Seeing then we have a great high-priest
   that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God; let us come
   boldly to the throng of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace
   to help in time of need."

   In a word, this may animate us against all the enemies of our
   salvation, because he that hath all power in heaven and earth is
   concerned for us, and is continually soliciting our cause with God:
   (Heb. vii. 25.) "Wherefore he is able to save them to the utmost, who
   come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for
   us."

   III. The ascension of our Saviour into heaven, is a mighty confirmation
   of our faith, both as to the truth of his doctrine in general, and
   particularly as to his coming again at the end of the world, to judge
   the quick and the dead, to reward the righteous, and to punish the
   sinners and ungodly.

   1. As to the truth of his doctrine in general. If after all the
   miracles of his life, and his resurrection from the dead, any man can
   doubt whether he came from God, and was sent by him to teach the world;
   yet this, methinks, is evidence beyond all exception, that God took him
   to himself, that he was visibly taken up into heaven; and though the
   witnesses of his ascension did not see him in heaven, yet the sending
   of the Holy Ghost, according to his promise, was an abundant evidence
   that he was received up into glory. Upon this account it is that our
   Saviour says, that the coining of the Holy Ghost should convince the
   world of sin, for not believing in him; because the sending of the Holy
   Ghost was an evidence that he was in glory; and his being taken up into
   glory, was a demonstration that he was a true prophet, and sent from
   God, and consequently that they were guilty of a great sin, who did not
   believe in him. And,

   2. This likewise is a great confirmation of our faith, as to our
   Saviour's coming again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and
   the dead. St. Peter tells us, (Acts x. 42.) that our Saviour, after his
   resurrection, did particularly give in charge to his apostles, "to
   testify to the people, that it was he that was ordained of God to be
   the judge of quick and dead." And what argument more proper to persuade
   them of this, than to see him visibly taken up into heaven; and, at the
   very time of his ascension, to be admonished by angels, that this same
   person, whom they saw carried up into heaven, should, in the same
   visible manner, come down from heaven again at the end of the world? So
   the text tells us, that "while the apostles looked steadfastly toward
   heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,
   (that is, two angels in the appearance of men) which said, Ye men of
   Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus which is
   taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have
   seen him go into heaven;" that is, in a visible manner, and in a cloud.
   For as "he was received up in a cloud out of their sight;" so at his
   return to judge the world, men shall "see the Son of man coming in the
   clouds of heaven," (Matt. xxiv. 30.) And this is a great confirmation
   of our faith of a future judgment; that our Saviour, immediately after
   his resurrection, declared himself to be "appointed by God judge of
   quick and dead;" and when he was ascended, the angels declared that "he
   should come again in like manner as they had seen him taken up." So
   that they who believe his ascension, cannot doubt of his return to
   judgment; nothing being more credible, than the saying of one whom God
   raised from the dead, and visibly took to himself.

   And now to make some reflection upon what hath been delivered. The
   consideration of our Saviour's ascension into heaven, and exaltation at
   the right hand of God, is very comfortable to all true Christians, in
   these two respects:

   I. In respect of our condition in this world.

   II. In respect of the happiness of the next world.

   I. In respect of our condition in this world. The church of Christ, and
   every particular member of it, every true Christian, is exposed to a
   great many troubles and dangers in this world: but it is matter of
   great comfort to us, in the consideration of all the evils we are
   liable to, that we are under his patron age and protection, who hath
   "all power given him in heaven and earth." He who is the head and
   defender of the church, "is set down on the right hand of the majesty
   of God, exalted far above principalities, and powers, and might, and
   dominion, and every name that is named, in this world, and that which
   is to come;" so that the true church of Christ need not fear either the
   powers of this world, or the malice of devils, because we have a sure
   friend, who is greater than all these, whom God hath made his
   vicegerent, and hath "put all things under his feet," and hath given
   the government of the world, and of all creatures, into his hands, for
   the good and benefit of his church; who is able to protect his church,
   and every true member of it, against all the injuries of earth, and the
   malice of hell; and if he permit us at any time to fall into
   sufferings, he is able to support us under them, and reward us for
   them: and "if he be for us, who can be against us?" He that "died, yea
   rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, and
   maketh intercession for us." (Rom. xiv.9.) "For this end, Christ both
   died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and
   living;" and now that he is in heaven, and clothed with majesty and
   glory, he is not less concerned for us, than when he conversed with us
   upon earth, and suffered and died for us: for he is there in our
   nature, that nature in which he suffered more than any of us can do;
   and therefore we may with confidence make our application to him in all
   our distresses and difficulties, because he is nearly allied to us,
   "Bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh," and was once tempted like
   ourselves, and from the experience of his own trials and sufferings,
   still retains a quick sense of the frailties and infirmities of
   mortality. This consideration the apostle to the Hebrews makes use of,
   to support Christians under all their persecutions for the profession
   of Christianity. (Heb. iv. 14, 15.) "Seeing then we have a great
   high-priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God; let
   us hold fast our profession. For we have not a high-priest that cannot
   be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points
   tempted like as we are, yet without sin."

   II. The consideration of Christ's ascension and exaltation, is likewise
   matter of comfort to us, in respect of the happiness which we hope for
   in the next world. No religion that ever was in the world hath given
   men so sensible a demonstration of a future life, and a blessed
   immortality in another world, as the Christian religion hath done, by
   the resurrection of our blessed Saviour from the dead, and his visible
   ascension into heaven. This is a sensible argument, and levelled to the
   capacities of all mankind. The reasonings of the philosophers
   concerning the immortality of men's souls, and a future state after
   this life, besides the uncertainty of them, have also this
   disadvantage--that they are only calculated for the more refined and
   speculative part of mankind: but every man is capable of the force of
   this argument, that he who declared to the world another life after
   this, and the happy condition of good men in another world, was himself
   raised from the dead, and visibly taken up into heaven. And now it is
   no difficult matter for us to believe that God will raise us, and
   advance us to glory and happiness, when we consider what an earnest he
   hath given us of this, by "the working of that mighty power which he
   wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his
   own right hand, in heavenly places."

   If then we believe that "Christ is ascended into heaven, and sits at
   the right hand of God," let this raise our minds above the vain
   delights and perishing enjoyments of this world, to the consideration
   of those better and more glorious things that are above; Jet us often
   ascend thither in our thoughts, whither "our Saviour is gone before us,
   to prepare a place for us;" and from whence he hath promised to come
   again, at the end of the world, "to receive us to himself, that where
   he is, there we may be also."

   But then we must endeavour to live as he did, if we hope to go to him
   when we die. "Every man that hath this hope in him, purifies himself,
   even as he is pure." Let us then "have our conversation in heaven, from
   whence also we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
   change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
   body, according to the working of that mighty power, whereby he is able
   to subdue all things to himself."

   To conclude: Let us heartily thank God for the whole dispensation of
   our salvation, by the incarnation and doctrine, by the holy life and
   meritorious death of our blessed Saviour, and by that demonstration of
   God's mighty power and goodness, "which he wrought in Christ, when he
   raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in heavenly
   places, far above all principalities, and powers, and might, and
   dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but
   also in that which is to come; having put all things under his feet,
   and given him to be the head over all things to the church, which is
   his body."

   The consideration whereof is (as you have heard) a mighty consolation
   unto us under all the troubles and dangers to which the church of
   Christ is exposed in this world. He who hath "all power committed to
   him" by God, and is made "head over all things for" the benefit and
   advantage of "the church," we may be sure, will have a particular care
   of it, and tender it as his "own body: v and as he is able, he is ready
   upon all occasions to protect and defend his own religion, and the true
   professors of it, against all the fury and malice of men and devils, so
   that the "gates of hell," the strongest combinations and deepest
   conspiracies of all the powers of darkness, "shall not" finally
   "prevail against it." Here is the foundation of our hopes and
   confidence, that our Redeemer is strong, and that God hath given him a
   kingdom and power that is paramount and superior to all earthly
   kingdoms and powers; and though they should conspire together, and be
   of one mind, unite all their force, and "give their power and strength
   unto the beast, to make war with the Lamb and his company," that is,
   the true church and faithful servants of Christ; yet "the Lamb shall
   overcome them," because "he is Lord of lords, and King of kings."

   And let us likewise bless God for the wonderful restoration of his
   Majesty to the government of these kingdoms, who, under Christ, is the
   great defender of our faith and religion; and let us pay that duty and
   obedience, which becomes us, to a prince whom God hath so miraculously
   preserved and restored; and pour out our most fervent prayers to God,
   that he would long preserve him, and protect his person from all
   dangers, who is the great security of our religion, [4] and the life of
   all our hopes, and as truly as any prince ever was to any people, the
   light of our eyes, and the breath of our nostrils; and that God would
   make him "wise as an angel of God, to go in and out before this great
   people;" and grant to him, and all the people of this land, "to know in
   this our day the things that be long to our peace, before they be hid
   from our eyes."

SERMON CXCVI.

  OF THE GIFT OF TONGUES CONFERRED ON THE APOSTLES.

   And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
   accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of
   a mighty rushing wind, and it filled all the house where they were
   sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire,
   and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
   Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
   utterance.--Acts ii. 1-4.

   ONE of the chief designs of the dispensation of God towards the Jews,
   and of the giving of the law to them by Moses, was, to be a type of the
   Christian church, and of the dispensation of the gospel by the Son of
   God; and therefore no wonder, if there be a great correspondence
   between them, and that the Divine Providence should so order the event
   of things, that the seasons of dispensing the great evangelical
   blessings should happen at the same times, when the great blessings of
   the law, which were the types of them, were dispensed and commemorated.
   Thus our Saviour, who was the Lamb of God, was slain and offered up at
   the same time that the passover was kept, and the paschal lamb was
   slain and offered up among the Jews; and the redemption of the world
   from the slavery of sin and Satan, is celebrated by Christians at the
   very same season of the year, when the deliverance of the Israelites
   from the Egyptian slavery was commemorated by them: and as at the time
   of Pentecost (which was fifty days after) the Jews were appointed to
   rejoice before the Lord, and to offer their first-fruits by way of
   grateful acknowledgment to God for the fruits of the earth, then newly
   gathered in; so did God likewise at the same time impart the
   first-fruits of the Holy Spirit to the apostles, who were to be the
   first and chief labourers in that spiritual harvest, to which they were
   appointed by the Lord of the harvest: and, which is yet more remark
   able, at the same season that the law was delivered to the Jews from
   Mount Sinai, and the first covenant established, namely, at the time of
   Pentecost, as is commonly supposed by the Jewish doctors, and as may
   probably be collected from the text; (Exod. xix. 1.) I say, at that
   very time the gospel, which contains the terms of the new covenant,
   began to be published from Mount Sion, in as wonderful, though not so
   terrible a manner, as the law was given from Mount Sinai. And thus it
   was fore told by the ancient prophets, (Isa. ii. 3. and Micah iv. 2.)
   that "out of Sion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord
   from Jerusalem."

   I shall briefly explain the words, and as I pass along make some short
   observations upon them, and then fix upon that which is mainly intended
   in them; viz. This first and most miraculous gift of the Holy Ghost,
   which was conferred upon the apostles when they were assembled together
   at Jerusalem upon the day of Pentecost. [5]

   "When the day of Pentecost was fully come," that is, when the fifty
   days after Easter were fulfilled, upon the fiftieth day, which was
   called the day of Pentecost, "they were all with one accord in one
   place." "They were all;" that is, all the twelve apostles; for upon
   them it was that the gift of tongues was bestowed; because they were
   appointed to be the chief publishers of the gospel, having been
   eye-witnesses of our Saviour's miracles, and particularly of his
   resurrection from the dead. There is no mention of any other in this
   chapter, but only of the twelve apostles: (ver. 14.) we find Peter and
   the eleven spoken of; and (ver. 37.) it is said, that "the multitude,"
   who were astonished at this miracle, "spake to Peter and the rest of
   the apostles."

   "They were all with one accord in one place." Unity is an excellent
   qualification and disposition for the Holy Spirit of God and his gifts;
   for which reason, the peace and good agreement of Christians is called
   by St. Paul, "the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace." When the
   apostles were "of one heart, and one mind," then the Holy Spirit of God
   came down upon them in this wonderful manner.

   (Ver. 2.) "And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing
   mighty wind." As they were together "waiting for the promise of the
   Father," all on the sudden there came a sound as of a strong gust of
   wind. This was a fit emblem of the Divine Spirit; for to this our
   Saviour had compared it, in his discourse to Nicodemus: (John iii. 8.)
   "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou nearest the sound thereof,
   but canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth: so is every
   one that is born of the Spirit."

   "As of a rushing mighty wind." To signify to us, that the publication
   of the gospel was attended with the same Divine presence and power,
   that the giving of the law was; but not with the same circumstances of
   terror, which the apostle to the Hebrews describes, when he sets forth
   to us the difference between Mount Sinai and Mount Sion, that is,
   between the two dispensations of the law and the gospel. (Heb. xii. 18,
   19.) Speaking of Mount Sinai, from which the law was given, "Ye are not
   come (says he) unto the mount, that might be touched, and that burned
   with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, and the sound
   of a trumpet, and the voice of words;" that is, that terrible voice of
   God, wherein the ten words of the law were delivered; which voice then
   shook the earth, as the apostle tells us: (ver. 26.) "A voice so
   terrible, that they who heard it, earnestly begged that they might hear
   it no more." These were all circumstances of great horror: but at the
   coming down of the Holy Ghost, here was no trumpet nor terrifying
   voice; no thunder, nor darkness, nor tempest; only the sound, as it
   were, of a strong gust of wind, as a sensible signification of a Divine
   presence and power.

   "And it filled all the house where they were sit ting." The whole
   house, to represent the world, which was to be filled with the sound of
   the gospel; according to that of the Psalmist, cited by St. Paul, (Rom.
   x. 18.) where, speaking of the general publication of the gospel,
   "their sound (says he) went out into all the earth, and their words
   unto the end of the world."

   "It filled all the house." This is that which (ver. 5. of the former
   chapter,) our Saviour calls baptizing the apostles with the Holy Ghost,
   so that they who sat in the house were, as it were, immersed in the
   Holy Ghost, as they who were baptized with water were overwhelmed and
   covered all over with water, which is the proper notion of baptism.

   (Ver. 3.) "And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, as it were of
   fire, and sat upon each of them." "Cloven tongues," to signify the
   diversity and distribution of them; this gift being imparted to every
   one of the apostles: for it is said, that these tongues "sat upon each
   of them."

   "Cloven tongues, as it were of fire," to signify the penetrating virtue
   and efficacy of their preaching. And this is that which John the
   Baptist calls "baptizing with the Holy Ghost, and with fire," meaning
   the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles, in the form of fiery
   tongues; "divided," to signify the diversity of them. At first, men
   were all of one language; and the confusion and division of tongues,
   was a curse and punishment upon them, and the cause of their dispersion
   through the world; but now, God by the gift of several tongues designed
   to gather mankind together, and to unite them in one religion.

   "And it sat upon each of them." These cloven fiery tongues sat upon
   each of the apostles, that is, remained visibly upon them for some
   time; to signify the permanency of this gift of tongues. It was not
   like several of the other miraculous gifts, which did not constantly
   reside upon them; for they had them not at all times, nor when they
   pleased, but as God was pleased to dispense and communicate them: but
   this gift of tongues was constant, because they had continual use of
   it; and it was common to all the apostles, because they were to be the
   publishers of the gospel, and the witnesses of our Lord's resurrection,
   which was the greatest miracle whereby the gospel was to be confirmed.

   (Ver. 4.) "And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to
   speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance." "And
   began to speak with other tongues:" the Vulgar translation renders it,
   variis linguis, with divers tongues; that is, they spake several
   languages besides their own mother tongue; or, as it is expressed in
   our Saviour's promise to the apostles, (Mark xvi. 17.) "with new
   tongues." "These signs," says our Lord before his ascension, "shall
   follow them that believe; they shall speak with new tongues;" that is,
   they should all on the sudden speak languages which they had never
   learned, nor had any knowledge of before.

   I know not who was the first author of that conceit, that the miracle
   was not in the speakers, but in the hearers; that is, the apostles
   spake in their own mother tongue (the Syriac), and the hearers of
   several nations heard them every one in their own language; which
   indeed must be acknowledged to be as great a miracle, or greater, than
   if the apostles had spoken so many different languages: but this seems
   to be a very groundless and unreasonable conceit, and very contrary to
   this relation of this miraculous gift, and to all the circumstances of
   it. For the text expressly says, that they spake "with other tongues;"
   that is, in languages different from their mother tongue, in which they
   spake before, otherwise they could not be called other, or new tongues.
   And (1 Cor. xii. 28.) the apostle, among the several gifts which God
   hath bestowed upon the church, mentions diversity of tongues; which had
   not been true, if the apostles had all spoken in one language. And
   (ver. 30.) he makes a difference between the gift of speaking several
   languages, and interpreting things spoken in divers tongues. "Do all
   (says he) speak with tongues? Do all interpret?" But if what the
   apostles had spoken in one language, had been heard of those of several
   nations in their own language, there had been no need of
   interpretation. And, (chap. xiv. 2.) "He that speaketh in an unknown
   tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for n man heareth him;"
   that is, no man understandeth what he saith, God only knows it; whereas
   if they heard every one in their own language, they all under stood
   what was said. And, (ver. 13.) "Wherefore let him that speaketh in an
   unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret." But what need of that, if
   every one heard what was spoken in his own tongue? and (ver. 16.) the
   apostle says, that "he that was unlearned, could not say Amen at giving
   of thanks in an unknown tongue;" because a he understood not what was
   said." And, (ver. 27.) "If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it
   be by two, or at most by three, and that by course, and let one
   interpret." All which plainly contradicts that foolish conceit, that
   the miracle of the gift of tongues was not in the speakers, but the
   hearers.

   That which seems to have given occasion to this error, was, that they
   could not understand how any man should at the same time speak divers
   languages: but there is no ground at all to suppose so; because it is
   not said, that any of the apostles did at the same time speak several
   languages, (which is impossible) but that the apostles spake several
   languages, so that the several nations then present heard some or other
   of the apostles speaking in their own language. So that, to trouble
   ourselves no farther about this idle conceit, the miracle was not, that
   every one of the apostles did speak several languages at the same time;
   but they all spake, on a sudden, languages which they had never learned
   before; so that the people of several nations, that were then present,
   did then hear some or other of the apostles speaking to them in their
   own language.

   Having thus explained the several expressions and passages in the text,

   I come now to speak to the main argument contained in them; viz. This
   miraculous gift which was conferred on the apostles, of speaking, all
   on the sudden, the languages of all nations, with whom they had
   occasion to converse, though they had never learned them before.

   And in the handling of this argument, these following particulars will
   be fit to be considered, and inquired into by us:

   First, The strangeness of this gift or miracle.

   Secondly, The clear evidence of this miracle, that it was real, and
   that there was no manner of imposture or deceit in it, nor could there
   be any suspicion of it.

   Thirdly, The wonderful effect of it immediately, and upon the spot,
   upon the very day, and in the place where it was first wrought.

   Fourthly, The great necessity and usefulness of it.

   Fifthly, The reason why it was the first of all the miraculous gifts,
   and so visibly conferred upon the apostles, before any of the rest.

   Sixthly, and lastly, I shall inquire, whether there be any necessity
   now, and consequently any possibility, of the renewing this miracle, in
   order to the conversion of the infidel world, and those many and great
   nations in the remoter parts of the world, which do still continue
   strangers and enemies to the Christian religion.

   First, The strangeness of this gift or miracle. It was of that nature,
   that the like was never known in the world, neither before nor since
   the first ages of Christianity, upon any occasion whatsoever; nor can
   we well imagine any other sort of miracle that could probably affect
   men more, and strike them with greater wonder and admiration, and have
   been a more sensible demonstration of a Divine power and presence
   accompanying the apostles, than to see and hear them all on the sudden
   perfectly to speak so many languages, which they had never learned
   before.

   Especially, if all the circumstances of the thing be duly weighed and
   considered; that they who pretended to be endowed with this gift, were
   not strangers newly arrived and come to Jerusalem, who before they came
   thither might possibly, by great study and pains, have attained to the
   knowledge and skill of several languages (each of them, suppose, two
   languages apiece), and have craftily combined together to impose upon
   the world, by the pretence and ostentation of such a miracle: but these
   persons were known to all that dwelt in Jerusalem, and had for a long
   time been taken notice of, as the disciples and followers of Jesus, who
   was lately crucified among them; their education was known, and the
   meanness of their condition, that they were simple and illiterate
   persons, who never had the advantage or opportunity of attaining to
   this skill in an ordinary way; and, therefore, it must be concluded to
   have been an extraordinary and supernatural gift.

   Besides that, this miracle was very publicly wrought, and the noise of
   it in a few hours drew together the strangers of several nations, who,
   being become proselytes of the Jewish religion, dwelt at Jerusalem;
   these all coming together, upon the noise and fame of this miracle,
   found it to be true; and, as appears from the history, were so well
   satisfied of the reality of it, that a very great number, upon the
   occasion of it, and upon that very day, became proselytes to the
   Christian religion, and joined themselves to the apostles and their
   followers (who were then but few in number), and were presently
   admitted into the Christian church by baptism, the usual ceremony of
   admitting proselytes among the Jews. This was a present and great
   effect, and is a great evidence and confirmation of the truth and
   reality of the thing: but this I shall have occasion to speak more
   fully to, when I come to the fifth particular which I proposed.

   I add farther, that our Saviour seems to have reckoned this as one of
   the greatest of miracles, and therefore to have reserved it, for an
   instance and demonstration of the glorious power which he was invested
   withal, after his ascension into heaven, as may very probably be
   collected from that declaration and promise which he made to his
   apostles, a little before his departure from them: (John xiv. 12.)
   "Verily, verily, I say unto yon, he that believeth on me, the works
   that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do,
   because I go unto my Father;" that is, in order to the sending of the
   Holy Ghost, "to endow them with power from on high," to qualify them
   for the publishing of the gospel, which they were forbidden to enter
   upon till this promise was made good to them. But what were these
   greater works, which he here promiseth to enable them to do, after he
   was gone to his Father? For he expressly promiseth, that they shall not
   only do the works which he had done, but greater works than those: and
   what could these be? Our Saviour had wrought many and great miracles
   almost in all kinds imaginable; he had cast out devils, and healed all
   sorts of infirmities and diseases; he had changed nature, by turning
   water into wine, and had stopped the course of it, by stilling the
   winds and the sea by his word; and he had raised the dead: and now what
   work could that be which was greater than any of these? Even that which
   I am speaking of, the miraculous power of speaking all languages,
   without learning them; a thing never heard of in the world before. And
   this was the first sensible effect of the coming of the Holy Ghost upon
   them, the first miraculous power with which he endowed his apostles,
   after he was ascended into heaven, and gone to his Father; an evident
   testimony of the glory and power which he was in vested withal, after
   he was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God, to
   signify both the honour and power which was conferred upon him, in that
   he enabled his apostles, when he was absent from them, to do that
   which, whilst he was present with them, he had never enabled them to
   do, nor ever did himself; all which tends to advance this miracle, and
   to shew the greatness and strangeness of it above any other. And unless
   we fix it upon this miracle, it will be hard, if not impossible, to
   give a good account of the accomplishing of that solemn promise of our
   Saviour to his disciples, after he should be gone to his Father; that
   is, after his ascension into heaven; "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and
   greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father." Now
   what miraculous work can be instanced in, that was done by the
   apostles, and was greater than any our Saviour did, when he was upon
   earth; but this only of speaking all languages on the sudden, without
   ever having learned them? Which consideration alone does confirm me
   past all doubt, that our Saviour in this promise meant the miraculous
   gift of tongues, which was the first gift that was conferred upon them,
   after he was ascended into heaven, and gone to his Father. I proceed,

   Secondly, To consider the clear evidence of this miracle, that it was
   real, and that there could be no suspicion of any manner of imposture
   and deceit in it.

   It was publicly wrought before many witnesses, and those the most
   competent of all other, because they were highly prejudiced against the
   apostles, and great enemies to them, as being the disciples of him whom
   they had so lately crucified as an impostor. They gave clear proof of
   this miraculous power in the presence of great multitudes of several
   nations, who heard them every one speaking to them in their own
   language: and besides the present demonstration of this miraculous
   gift, to those of several nations that dwelt at Jerusalem, they gave
   evidence of it in all places and nations whither they went preaching
   the gospel; so that this miracle accompanied and continued with them,
   till the gospel was made known to a great part of the then known world,
   and lasted for a whole age, and till there was no farther need and use
   of it.

   But it may be said, that though this was sufficiently evident to them
   that dwelt at Jerusalem, who knew the apostles, and the circumstances
   of their education; yet it was not so credible to others, who lived
   remote from Jerusalem, and neither knew the apostles, nor the manner of
   their education, nor were witnesses of the miraculous rise and
   beginning of this gift of tongues. These could only hear them speak in
   their language; but whether their knowledge of this language had been
   acquired by study, or was supernatural and infused, for this they had
   only common fame, and the apostles own word, which may seem to have
   been but a slender evidence for a thing so strange. And so it must be
   acknowledged to be, if the apostles affirmation, that this gift was
   supernaturally conferred upon them, had not been otherwise countenanced
   and supported; as it was in a very extraordinary and remarkable manner,
   by their being endowed with a power to work other miracles of all
   kinds, which they did every where, and very frequently, upon all
   occasions. And this was sufficient to give credit to what they
   affirmed, concerning the supernatural gift of tongues: for when they
   saw them work other miracles of all sorts, they had no reason to doubt
   of the truth and reality of this miraculous gift of tongues, which was
   abundantly confirmed by the other miraculous powers with which they
   were endowed. So that the gospel, wherever it came, carried its own
   evidence along with it, and was confirmed by the very manner of its
   conveyance and delivery; and well might men entertain it as a Divine
   doctrine, when the very manner and means, whereby it was conveyed to
   the world, was so strange and astonishing a miracle, as was never
   wrought in the world before, upon any occasion whatsoever. And this
   will yet be farther evident, if we consider, in the

   Third place, The wonderful effect which this miracle immediately had
   upon the spot, and on the very day when it first appeared.

   It had so glaring an evidence, and carried such conviction in it, that
   the doctrine which they who were endowed with miraculous gifts did
   preach, was immediately received and entertained by a very great number
   of the hearers; who, upon the conviction of this great miracle, became
   proselytes to this new religion, and were solemnly admitted to the
   profession of it by baptism; as we read, ver. 41. of this chapter;
   where, after St. Peter had made an end of his sermon to the people upon
   this occasion, it is said, "Then they that gladly received his word
   were baptized; and the same day there were added unto them about three
   thousand souls." Here was a mighty effect, three thousand converted at
   one sermon, being convinced by the evidence of this miracle. And it is
   a very immediate effect; for it is said, that "the same day three
   thousand were added to the church." Here was an effect proportionable
   to the greatness and strangeness of its cause; a mighty victory gained
   over the prejudices of men, and the powers of darkness, by the light
   and conviction of this miracle, which our Saviour seems to have kept in
   reserve for this great occasion, when his gospel and religion was to be
   first published, and to make its solemn entrance into the world. Here
   was a large portion of first-fruits, and a great earnest of that
   spiritual harvest, which the apostles had began to reap; of which the
   first-fruits among the Jews were a type: for their harvest also was at
   this very season of the year; as I noted before.

   Fourthly, We will consider the great usefulness of this miraculous
   gift, for the more easy and speedy conveyance of the doctrine of
   Christianity, and the diffusing and spreading the knowledge of it in
   the world; and this, if we consider it, not as a miracle, but only as a
   means so very convenient to this purpose, that, by the advantage of it,
   the gospel made a greater progress in the space of a few years, than in
   human probability could have been made without it in many ages: and it
   was spread farther in thirty years, than could in reason have been
   expected in fifteen hundred, by natural and ordinary means: "So
   mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed;" being carried on in so
   powerful and supernatural a manner.

   Fifthly, We will consider, why this was the first miraculous gift
   conferred upon the apostles more visibly, and before any of the rest.
   The other miraculous powers were only visible in their effects; but
   this was visible, not only in the effects of it, but likewise in the
   cause and the manner of its being conferred: "for the Holy Spirit
   rested upon them, in the form of fiery cloven tongues;" to signify, not
   only the diversity of languages which they should be enabled to speak,
   but the quick and piercing efficacy of their speech. The reason of all
   which seems to be, because this was the greatest of all miracles, and
   therefore fit to be first: for, as I shewed before, this, in the
   judgment of our Saviour, (who best understood the different degrees of
   miracles) was greater than any of those which he himself in his
   life-time had wrought; and, likewise, because this miracle was of
   greater use than any of the rest, and more necessary to the effectual
   discharge of their apostolical office, and to the easy success and more
   speedy effect of it. For by this miraculous gift more especially, the
   apostles were, as it were, consecrated to their office, and made
   capable to discharge it with ease and effect; their office being to
   publish the doctrine of the gospel to the world, and to be witnesses of
   our Saviour's resurrection from the dead, which was to be the great
   confirmation of his doctrine; neither of which they could, with any
   probability of effect and success, have done without this miraculous
   gift: for what slow progress must they have made, and how little could
   they have advanced in this work, had they either done all by
   interpreters, or been put to have learned the languages of the several
   nations, to which they had been to preach, before they could have
   published this doctrine among them?

   The Jews, who were very zealous of their religion, (which was likewise
   from God, and was attested by miracles) upon occasion of several
   calamities which befel them, and carried them into captivity, were
   dispersed in several nations; and yet how slowly, for want of this
   gift, did they gain proselytes to their religion? and how few did they
   convert to it in the space of four or five hundred years? by which we
   may judge how little Christianity would have gained upon the world, had
   it not been countenanced and assisted from heaven in this miraculous
   manner. I come now to the

   Sixth and last thing which I proposed to inquire into; namely, Whether
   there be any necessity now, and, consequently, probability, of the
   renewing of this miracle, in order to the conversion of infidels, and
   the gaining over of those many and great nations in the remoter parts
   of the world, who are still strangers and enemies to the Christian
   religion.

   That which would induce a man to hope well in this case, is, that
   without some such miraculous gift there is little or no probability of
   the conversion of infidel nations: unless God should be pleased, by
   some unexpected means, to bring over to Christianity some powerful
   prince of great reputation for his wisdom and virtue; who, by the
   influence of his example, and by his favour and countenance, might give
   advantages to the planting of it among his subjects. And yet,
   considering the inveterate and violent prejudices of men against a new
   religion, such an attempt would, in all human probability, be more
   likely to end in the ruin of the prince, and the overturning of his
   government, than in the establishing of a new religion. Of which kind
   there have been several instances very remarkable in Japan and
   Æthiopia, and perhaps in places and times nearer to us, and within our
   own memory.

   But if any such thing should be attempted by private persons, the
   undertaking would meet with such insuperable obstacles, not only from
   the prejudices and interests of men, but from the great difficulty of
   gaining languages so different from our own, that it must in all
   likelihood have a very slow progress, and at last fall to the ground,
   for want of proper and effectual means to carry it on. For though the
   morality of the Christian religion be admirable, and very apt to
   recommend itself to the unbiassed and impartial reason of mankind (if
   any such thing were any where to be found), yet, [6] the death of the
   Son of God is such a stumbling-block, as is very hard for human reason
   to get over. Of which the Jesuits in China were so sensible, that,
   according to their usual sincerity, they thought best to conceal that
   most essential part of the Christian doctrine which relates to the
   death and sufferings of our Saviour. So I am sure St. Paul took it to
   be, when he tells the Corinthians, that "he determined to know nothing
   among them, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified." This, it seems, he
   looked upon as the most material and valuable part of the Christian
   religion, and of greatest consequence to be known by us. But the
   Jesuits, it seems, thought otherwise, and therefore concealed it from
   their converts: for which most shameful and unchristian practice,
   several of them were very lately under prosecution at Rome.

   Besides all this, [7] the matters of fact upon which the truth of
   Christianity does necessarily depend, as the birth, and life, and
   miracles, and death, and resurrection of our blessed Saviour, and his
   visible ascension into heaven: I say, these matters of fact, though we
   have a most credible history and relation of them brought down to us,
   do not carry so strong and sensible a conviction in them, to those who
   never heard of them before, as to be able to conquer and bear down a
   violent prejudice: nor is it in reason to be expected, that these
   things should easily be admitted by those, who are utter strangers to
   our history of former times, and consequently not fit to judge of what
   value they are.

   I speak not this to discourage any from using their best endeavours to
   propagate our religion among infidels, where the providence of God
   opens a door, and gives any opportunity for it. Among the many bad
   things that have been clone in the church of Rome, there is one thing
   very much to their honour--that they have been at very great charge and
   pains in their missions for the conversion of the infidel nations,
   especially in the eastern parts of the world, to that which they
   account the true Christian religion. And if the matter had been as
   honestly managed, as I hope it was piously intended, and their charity
   and zeal had been equally warm for the conversion of the northern
   infidels, where there is nothing to be met with but frost and cold, as
   it hath been for the conversion of those parts of the world where gold
   and spices abound, it had deserved great praise, notwithstanding their
   mistakes in religion, and the great mixture of errors and corruptions
   in it.

   And it is no small reproach to the protestant religion, that there hath
   not appeared an equal zeal among us for this purpose: and that to our
   un wearied endeavours to promote the interest of trade in foreign
   parts, there hath not been joined a like zeal and industry for the
   propagating of the Christian religion; which might surely be attempted,
   with more than ordinary advantage, in those places where we have so
   free a commerce.

   It is not good for men to be confident, where they are not certain; but
   [8] it seems to me not impossible, if the conversion of infidels to
   Christianity were sincerely and vigorously attempted by men of honest
   minds, who would make it their business to instruct those who are
   strangers to our religion in the pure doctrine of Christianity, free
   from all human mixtures and corruptions: it seems to me, in this case,
   not at all improbable, that God would extraordinarily countenance such
   an attempt, by all fitting assistance, as he did the first publication
   of the gospel: for as the wisdom of God is not wont to do that which is
   superfluous, so neither is it wanting in that which is necessary. And
   from what hath been said upon this argument, the necessity seems to be
   much the same that it was at first.

   I would not be mistaken in what I have said about this matter; I do not
   deliver it as positive, but only as probable, divinity; no-wise
   contrary to Scripture, and very agreeable to reason.

   Thus much may suffice to have spoken concerning this miraculous gift of
   tongues, conferred upon the apostles at the time of Pentecost.

SERMON CXCVII.

  OF THE COMING OF THE HOLY GHOST, AS AN ADVOCATE FOR CHRIST.

   Nevertheless, I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go
   away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but
   if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will
   reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.--John
   xvi. 7, 8.

   THESE words are part of our Saviour's last sermon, -which he made to
   his disciples a little before he left the world: and this sermon is
   only recorded by this evangelist, who hath set it down at large in the
   14th, 15th, and 16th chapters of his Gospel. The main scope of it is
   first, to persuade them to the obedience and practice of that holy
   doctrine, which he had delivered to them while he was with them; and
   then, because their hearts were full of sorrow at the thoughts of his
   departure from them, knowing that for his sake they should be
   ill-treated by the world, he arms them against these discouragements;
   he promiseth, not long after his departure from them, to send down his
   Holy Spirit upon them in miraculous powers and gifts, as a testimony to
   the world of the truth of his doctrine, and a clear conviction that he
   came from God; (ver. 26. of the 15th chapter.) "But when the Comforter
   (or rather the advocate) is come, whom I will send unto you from the
   Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he
   shall testify of me. And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have
   been with me from the beginning." The testimony which the Holy Spirit
   should give to them, should give credit and strength to their
   testimony.

   And this consideration he makes use of to comfort them under the sad
   thoughts of his departure, because his absence would be abundantly
   recompensed to them, by the coming of the Holy Ghost, which could not
   be until he had left the world; because this Comforter, or advocate,
   was to be sent in his name, to come upon his account, and in his stead,
   to supply his absence. So that though they were greatly troubled at the
   thoughts of his departure, there was no cause for it, when all things
   were considered; for, in truth, it was for their advantage, that he
   should depart from them: (ver. 6-8. of this chapter:) "But because I
   have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
   Nevertheless, I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you, that I go
   away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but
   if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will
   reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment."

   From which words, I shall consider these two things:

   First, The necessity of Christ's leaving the world, in order to the
   coming of the Holy Ghost; "If I go not away, the Comforter will not
   come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."

   Secondly, The happy consequence and effect of the coming of the Holy
   Ghost: "And when he is come, he shall reprove the world of sin, and of
   righteousness, and of judgment." I shall as briefly as I can explain
   both these.

   First, The necessity of Christ's leaving the world, in order to the
   coming of the Holy Ghost: "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth; it is
   expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter
   will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."
   That it is the Holy Ghost which is here spoken of, and that as a
   person, and not as a quality, or power, or virtue, is plain from our
   Saviour's discourse all along this sermon, in which he is spoken of
   under the notion of a person, and that in as plain and express terms as
   Christ himself is. As the Father sent Christ, so is he said to send the
   Holy Ghost; as Christ is said to depart, so the Holy Ghost is said to
   come; as Christ is called an advocate, so the Holy Ghost is said to be
   another advocate; Christ our advocate to plead our cause with God, he
   Christ's advocate to plead his cause with the world: (chap. xiv. 16,
   17.) "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
   Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever." And who is that? "Even
   the Spirit of truth." And (chap. xv. 26.) "But when the Comforter is
   come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of
   truth." And in the verse immediately after the text, "Howbeit, when he,
   the Spirit of truth is come." But expressly, (chap. xiv. 26.) he is
   called the Holy Ghost: But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
   the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things."

   All the difficulty is concerning the word para'kletos, which our
   translation renders "the Comforter." It is true, indeed, that the verb
   parakalein is of a very large and unlimited signification; it sometimes
   signifies to comfort, very frequently to preach, teach, and exhort, and
   sometimes to plead as an advocate the cause of another. And this seems
   to be the proper notion of the word para'kletos in this place, "the
   advocate or patron of a cause," one that pleads for the party accused.
   And in this sense, and no other, Christ is called our para'kletos, or
   "advocate with the Father:" (1 John ii. 1.) "If any man sin, we have an
   advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." And as Christ is
   our advocate with the Father in heaven; so the Spirit is Christ's
   advocate here on earth, and pleads his cause with the world. And it is
   very observable, that this very word paraclete, though it be not a
   Hebrew, but a Greek word, is frequently used both by the Chaldee
   paraphrast, and other Jewish writers, in this sense of an advocate. And
   that this notion of the word agrees best with this place, I shall
   clearly shew, when I come to the second head of my discourse; namely,
   To shew the happy consequence and effect of the corning of the Holy
   Ghost, viz. the convincing of the world how injuriously they had dealt
   with Christ, and the clear vindication of his innocency, which is the
   proper office and work of an advocate.

   Having thus fixed the notion of the word para'kletos in this place, we
   will now inquire what necessity or expediency there was, that Christ
   should leave the world, in order to the coming of the Holy Ghost: "It
   is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the advocate
   will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you."

   And of this I shall give an account in these two particulars:

   I. From the method of the Divine dispensation, in the redemption and
   .salvation of man by Jesus Christ.

   II. From the rational suitableness and congruity of this dispensation.

   I. From the method of the Divine dispensation in the redemption and
   salvation of man by Jesus Christ. Thus the Scripture tells us, that God
   in his infinite wisdom had designed and ordered things that the Son of
   God should come into the world, and live in a mean and abject
   condition; that he should be despised and rejected of men, persecuted
   and put to death; and that, as a reward of all this submission and
   suffering, he should be raised again from the dead, taken up into
   heaven, and placed "on the right hand of the Majesty on high;" and that
   in the triumph of his ascension, he should lead captive death and hell,
   and all the powers of darkness; and being entered into the highest
   heavens, and set on the right hand of God, as an act of power and
   royalty, he should send down his Holy Spirit in miraculous gifts upon
   men, for the conviction of the world, that the doctrine which he
   commanded his apostles to publish to all nations was from God. And
   therefore the apostle St. Paul tells us expressly, that the
   communication of these gifts of the Spirit was the proper effect and
   consequent of our Lord's exaltation, and one of the first acts of
   royalty which he exercised, after he was possessed of his glorious
   kingdom; (Ephes. iv. 7, 8.) where, speaking of the various gifts of the
   Spirit, "Unto every one of us (saith he) is given grace, according to
   the measure of the gift of Christ." For which he cites the prediction
   of David; (Psal. lxviii. 18.) "Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up
   on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men." And, "he
   gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some
   pastors and teachers." So that we plainly see, that this was the
   dispensation of God, and the method which his wisdom hath pitched upon,
   that our Lord should first leave the world, and be taken up into glory,
   and then send down the Holy Ghost, in the plentiful effusion of
   miraculous gifts. So this evangelist expressly tells us in another
   place, which gives great light to the text; (John vii. 39.) "But (says
   he) spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
   receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not
   yet glorified." Implying that, according to the Divine disposal, it was
   ordered, first, that Christ should be glorified, and being invested in
   his kingdom and glory, that then he should do acts of grace, and, like
   a king at his coronation, scatter and dispense his gifts among men, by
   sending down his Holy Spirit among them. And accordingly we find St.
   Peter, (Acts ii.) after that the Holy Ghost came down upon them, giving
   this account of it; (ver. 32, 33.) "This Jesus hath God raised up,
   whereof we are all witnesses: therefore being by the right hand of God
   exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy
   Ghost, he hath shed forth that which ye now see and hear;" meaning the
   gift of tongues; so that he resolves it into the dispensation of God,
   who had thus designed and ordered things. And therefore, in the

   Second place, I shall shew, that this dispensation is very congruous
   and suitable to the Divine wisdom. For as it was convenient, that the
   Son of God should assume our nature, and come into the world, and dwell
   among us, that he might reform mankind, by the purity of his doctrine,
   and the pat tern of his holy life; and likewise that he should suffer
   death, for the expiation of sin: in such a manner as might not only
   advance the mercy, but assert and vindicate the holiness of God, and
   testify his great hatred and displeasure against sin: so likewise,
   after he had thus abased himself to the lowest degree of meanness and
   suffering, it was very suitable to the Divine goodness, to reward such
   great sufferings with great glory, by raising him from the dead, and
   taking him up into heaven; but it was not fit, when he had left the
   world, that the great work for which he came into it should be given
   over, and come to nothing, for want of effectual prosecution, without
   any fruit and effect of so much sweat and blood. And, therefore, though
   it had "pleased the Lord to bruise him, and put him to grief," as the
   prophet expresseth it, yet the Divine wisdom hath so ordered things,
   that, after "he had made his soul an offering for sin, he should see
   his seed, and prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord should
   prosper in his hands;" that he should see some fruit of "the travail of
   his soul, and be satisfied," as the prophet foretels, (Isa. liii. 10.)
   So that, as it was expedient, that he should die and depart this life;
   so it was also requisite afterwards, that he who had begun this great
   and good work of the redemption and salvation of man, should take care
   to have it still prosecuted and carried on: and accordingly, when he
   was ascended into heaven, he still promotes the same design, per
   vicariam vim spiritus sancti, as Tertullian calls it, by sending the
   Holy Ghost, as his deputy, for the managing of this work, and the
   propagating and establishing of that religion which he had planted in
   the world.

   God foresaw that the greatest part of the Jewish nation would reject
   Christ and his doctrine, and that they would put him to death, as a
   deceiver and impostor; and because it was expedient, that there should
   be such an expiatory sacrifice for sin, and that "one man should die
   for all men," God was willing to permit his Son to be thus
   dishonourably and unjustly treated, "and by wicked hands to be
   crucified and slain;" because he knew very well, how to make the malice
   of men subservient to his own gracious purpose and design; but yet he
   was not willing, that so much innocency and goodness should always lie
   under this reproach; from which, if he had not been vindicated, the
   design of the gospel had fallen to the ground, and presently come to
   nothing: and therefore, as a reward of his obedience and submission to
   the will of God, in these dreadful sufferings, in this cruel and
   dishonourable usage, God furnished him with this means of vindicating
   himself and his doctrine; he gave him power to send his Holy Spirit
   into the world, who should distribute miraculous gifts among his
   apostles and followers, that so both he and his doctrine might be
   effectually vindicated to the world, and a way made for the more speedy
   spreading and propagating of it.

   So that we plainly see, that the wisdom of God had so ordered this
   whole dispensation, that every part of it, the birth, the life, and
   death, and resurrection, and ascension of our Lord, and the sending of
   the Holy Ghost, are all subservient to one another, and to the whole
   design; viz. the reformation and salvation of mankind.

   I have done with the first thing I propounded, the necessity of
   Christ's leaving the world, in order to the coming of the Holy Ghost. I
   shall now proceed to the

   Second thing I proposed, the happy consequence and effects of the
   coming of the Holy Ghost. "When he is come he will reprove the world of
   sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment." There is a great
   difficulty in these words, and therefore I shall endeavour, as well as
   I can, to explain them r and then draw some useful inferences from the
   main doctrine contained in them.

   For the explication of them. "And when he," that is, the Holy Ghost,
   the advocate mentioned before, "shall come," that is, when the promise
   of the Father concerning the coming of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles
   shall be accomplished, "he shall reprove the world;" the word is
   ele'nxei, which I think may much more properly be rendered convince--he
   shall convince the world. And so it is used by this evangelist: (John
   viii. 46.) "Which of you (says our Saviour) convinceth me of sin?" The
   very phrase used in the text, "He shall convince the world of sin." And
   the same word is also used in the same sense by St. Paul, (Tit. i. 9.)
   elenchein antilegontas, "to convince gainsayers." And this certainly is
   much more agreeable to the scope of this place. For though to "reprove
   the world of sin" be a current expression, yet to "reprove the world of
   righteousness, and of judgment," are very hard phrases, and I doubt not
   intelligible; but to convince an adversary, or to satisfy a court, of
   the falsehood of the accusation and charge brought against the party
   accused, that is to vindicate and justify him in his cause, this is the
   proper act of an advocate.

   So that the great end of the coming of the Holy Ghost, who is here
   called the advocate, is to convince the world. "He shall convince the
   world;" that is, both Jews and gentiles, who joined in their enmity
   against Christ, and agreed to put him to death: in these three points
   concerning sin, and righteousness, and judgment. The expression is
   short, and somewhat obscure, and seems (as Grotius and other learned
   men have not improbably thought) to allude to the three sorts of causes
   and actions among the Jews.

   In the first, to public actions concerning criminal matters, among
   which was the case of believing or rejecting prophets. "He shall
   convince the world of sin, because they believed not in me;" that is,
   he shall convince the world that I was a true prophet sent from God,
   and no impostor; and consequently, that they were guilty of a great
   contempt of God, and a horrible murder, in putting me to death.

   In the second, there seems to be an allusion to that sort of private
   actions, which referred to the vindicating of innocency from false
   testimony and accusation, which are called by the name of
   righteousness. "He shall convince the world of righteousness."

   In the third, to that sort of actions, which referred to the
   vindication and punishment of injuries, by way of retaliation upon him
   that did the injury, and which are called kri'seis, or judgments. "He
   shall convince the world of judgment, because the prince of this world
   is judged."

   But to explain these things more particularly.

   1. He shall convince the world of sin, because they believe not on me;"
   that is, of the great sin that they were guilty of, in rejecting this
   great prophet, and condemning him as a seducer and impostor. And of
   this they would remarkably be convinced, when they should see the
   predictions of Christ fulfilled, particularly that of sending the Holy
   Ghost, and of that terrible vengeance which should afterwards be
   executed on the Jewish nation, for rejecting the Son of God. The first
   of these we find eminently fulfilled upon the coming of the Holy Ghost
   upon the apostles on the day of Pentecost, (Acts ii.) For when the
   apostles by a sudden inspiration spake with other tongues, the Jews and
   proselytes, who saw and heard them, were very much amazed at it, (ver.
   7.) And from this miraculous power of the Holy Ghost so visible upon
   them, St. Peter takes occasion to convince the Jews, of their great sin
   in rejecting the Messias, and putting him to death: (ver. 32, 33.)
   "This Jesus (saith he) hath God raised up, whereof we are all
   witnesses: wherefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
   received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed
   forth this, which ye now see and hear." From whence he concludes, (ver.
   36.) "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
   hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
   Christ." That is, by this you may be convinced, that he whom you
   crucified, as a false prophet, was the true Messias. Upon this we find,
   (ver. 37.) that "when the Jews heard this, they were pricked at their
   hearts; and said unto Peter, and the rest of the apostles, Men and
   brethren, what shall we do to be saved?" Thus you see the first effect
   which our Saviour foretold of the coining of the Holy Ghost, fulfilled
   in a most eminent manner; for upon this sermon, three thou sand of the
   Jews being "convinced of their great sin, in not believing on him, were
   baptized in his name."

   II. "He shall convince the world of righteousness;" that is, of the
   innocency of that holy and just person, whom they had condemned as a
   malefactor. "Of righteousness, because I go to the Father;" that is,
   this shall be an evidence to the world of my innocency of those crimes,
   with which I was charged; that I am taken up into heaven, and seated at
   the right hand of God, where I shall remain for ever, out of the reach
   of their malice and injury. "Because, I go to the Father, and ye see me
   no more;" that is, I shall be there, where their malice cannot reach
   me. For so he tells the pharisees when they came to apprehend him:
   (John vii. 33, 34.) "Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go
   unto him that sent me: ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and
   where I am, thither ye can not come."

   And this vindication of his innocency, was begun by the miracles which
   immediately followed his death, upon which "the centurion glorified
   God," saying, "Certainly, this was the Son of God," as St. Matthew hath
   it; or, as St. Luke, "this was a righteous man," (Luke xxiii. 47.) And
   not only the centurion, but all the people: (ver. 48.) "And all the
   people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which
   were done, smote their breasts, and returned." But the great,
   vindication of his innocency was his resurrection, which delivered him
   from that unjust sentence of death which was passed upon him, by
   raising him up to life again. And this is particularly ascribed to the
   Holy Ghost: (Rom. i. 4.) "And was mightily demonstrated to be the Son
   of God, by the Spirit of holiness, in his resurrection from the dead."
   Especially if we consider, that he was afterwards taken up visibly into
   heaven, and there invested with royal power and dignity, of which he
   gave plentiful evidence, in the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost,
   poured forth upon the apostles: which was a standing demonstration to
   the world of his innocency and righteousness, since God had taken him
   up to himself, and "set him on his own right hand," and "committed all
   power to him in heaven and earth."

   III. "He shall convince the world of judgment, because the prince of
   this world is judged." He that usurped the authority of God in the
   world, and by his instruments had procured Christ to be condemned as a
   counterfeit king, is himself dethroned and condemned; "the prince of
   this world is judged." He that thought to have destroyed the Son of
   God, by putting him to death, is by this very means destroyed himself.
   So the apostle tells us, (Heb. ii. 14.) that "Christ through his
   death," that is, upon occasion of his death, and his resurrection from
   the dead consequent upon it, "hath destroyed him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil."

   But most remarkably was the prince of this world judged and cast out,
   when, after he had so long usurped the name and worship of God in the
   world, he was, by that mighty power of the Spirit of God, which
   accompanied the preaching of the gospel, thrown out of his kingdom; and
   wherever the doctrine of Christ came, the idolatry of the world was not
   able to stand before it, but fell down, like Dagon before the ark. And
   that this is the meaning of judgment here, is plain from the same
   evangelist; (chap. xii. 31, 32.) "Now is the judgment of this world;
   now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And if I be lifted up
   from the earth, I will draw all men unto me." Where our Saviour
   explains the judgment of this world, by the casting out Satan out of
   that power and authority which he had usurped in the heathen world by
   his idolatrous worship. And, therefore, our Saviour foretels, that when
   he was "lifted up from the earth/ that is, after he was crucified, and
   raised from the dead, and taken up into heaven, he "would draw all men
   to him;" that is, his religion should prevail wonder fully in the
   world, and be entertained in all nations. And this was most remarkably
   accomplished, by the wonderful progress of the gospel, and speedy
   downfall of idolatry in the world, "not by might, nor by power, but by
   the Spirit of the Lord." The acknowledgment of Porphyry, that bitter
   enemy of Christianity, as it is reported to us by Eusebius, is very
   remarkable: "That since one Jesus began to be worshipped, they found no
   public benefit from their gods; their miracles and their oracles
   ceased." This our Saviour foresaw, and foretold, when he appointed and
   sent forth the seventy disciples to preach the gospel: (Luke x. 18.) "I
   beheld Satan like lightning to fall from heaven;" to express to us the
   sudden demolishing of his kingdom, and the quick and speedy overthrow
   of idolatry in the world. And thus I have explained, as briefly as I
   could, this difficult passage, concerning the Holy Ghost's "convincing
   the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment."

   I shall only draw two or three inferences from what hath been
   delivered, and so conclude.

   I. We have great reason to adore the wisdom and goodness of God, in the
   dispensation of the gospel; that, by the sending down of his Holy
   Spirit, to endow the first publishers of his heavenly doctrine, with
   such miraculous powers and gifts, he hath given such abundant testimony
   to the truth of our religion, and such firm grounds for our faith to
   rely upon. Had God left the Christian religion to have been propagated
   only by its own rational force upon the minds of men, what a slow
   progress would it in all probability have made? How little belief would
   the apostles naked testimony of our Lord's resurrection from the dead,
   without any other demonstration or proof, have gained while they were
   alive, much less after their death? how unable would their doctrine,
   destitute of Divine testimony, as well as of all human advantages, have
   been to have contested with the lusts and interests of men, the wit of
   the philosophers, and the powers of the princes of this world, which
   all set themselves against it? How could it, with any hope of success,
   have encountered the malice of men and devils, which was so active and
   busy, by all possible violence and by all imaginable arts, to root it
   out of the world? Had the apostles of our Lord only gone forth, in the
   strength of their own interest and eloquence (which in poor and
   unlearned men must needs be very small), how little could they have
   contributed to the carrying on so great and difficult a work? Nay, had
   they not been supported, and borne up in their spirits by a mighty
   strength above their own, had not their commission been sealed by the
   miraculous power of the Holy Ghost, which upon all occasions shewed
   forth itself in them, to the wonder and astonishment of men, and was a
   testimony from heaven to them, that they were the ambassadors of God to
   men, specially empowered and commissioned by him for that work, they
   could not but have been discouraged by the opposition and difficulties
   they met withal; and they might with Moses have declined the service,
   and desired God to send his message by others, that were fitter and
   better qualified to deliver it; and after some vain and unsuccessful
   attempts, to propagate the belief of their doctrine, they would have
   given it over, and been ashamed of their rash undertaking. So St. Paul
   intimates, that had not the mighty power of God accompanied their
   preaching, and made it effectual to the conversion and salvation of
   men, they would have been tempted to have been ashamed of the gospel of
   Christ.

   But then we must remember, that it is the doctrine of Christ which is
   thus confirmed, and not the doctrines and traditions of men. For had
   the concealment of the doctrine of Christ, and the serving of God in an
   unknown tongue, been any part of the apostles doctrine, the gift of
   tongues had not been a confirmation of this doctrine, but a contra
   diction to it; had they preached transubstantiation, and the renouncing
   of our senses in order to the belief of it, miracles could have given
   no credit to it: for that which depends upon the certainty of sense (as
   miracles do) cannot be a competent argument to prove that which is
   contrary to sense; for that which makes me sure of the miracle which
   should prove this doctrine, does at the same time make me equally sure
   that this doctrine is not true. If there were no other evidence, that
   transubstantiation is no part of the Christian doctrine, this to a wise
   man would be sufficient, that what proves the one, overthrows the
   other; and that miracles, which are certainly the best and highest
   external proof of Christianity, are the worst proof in the world of
   transubstantiation, unless a man can renounce his senses, at the same
   time that he relies upon them; for a man cannot believe a miracle,
   without relying upon his senses; nor transubstantiation, without
   renouncing them: and never were any two things so ill coupled together,
   as the doctrine of Christianity and that of transubstantiation, because
   they draw several ways, and are ready to strangle one another. The main
   evidence and confirmation of the Christian doctrine, which is miracles,
   is resolved into the certainty and testimony of our senses; but this
   evidence is clear and point blank against transubstantiation.

   II. The consideration of what hath been said, convinceth men of the
   great sin of infidelity, and the unreasonableness of it, after so clear
   conviction and demonstration as God hath given to the world of the
   truth of Christianity. That the gospel was planted and propagated in
   the world in so wonderful a manner, and prevailed, notwithstanding all
   the opposition that was made against it: the remarkable and terrible
   destruction of Jerusalem, according to our Saviour's prediction: the
   several attempts of rebuilding the temple, particularly by Julian the
   apostate, in despite to Christianity, and to confute our Saviour's
   prediction, so remarkably frustrated, and resisted from heaven, by tire
   flaming out of the foundation, and consuming the workmen, so that they
   were forced to desist; and this recorded by a heathen historian,
   Ammianus Marcellinus: the dispersion of the Jewish nation, and their
   continuing for so many ages separate and distinct from all other
   people, for a standing accomplishment of our Saviour's prophecy, and a
   testimony to all ages of the truth of Christianity:--these, with many
   more arguments I might mention, are a clear evidence to any one that
   does not obstinately wink and shut his eyes against the light, that the
   doctrine of Christianity came from God.

   III. They who believe the gospel are inexcusable if they do not obey
   it, and live according to it. This is the great end of all the miracles
   which God hath wrought for the confirmation of Christianity; that, by
   the belief of the gospel, men might be brought "to the obedience of
   faith," and live conformably to the precepts of that holy religion,
   which the Son of God, by so many miracles, hath planted and preserved
   in the world. The infidelity of men will be a heavy charge upon them,
   at the judgment of the great day, and God will condemn them for it: but
   we that profess to believe the gospel, and live contrary to it, shall
   not only be condemned by the judgment of God, but by the sentence of
   our own consciences. Our profession to believe the gospel, will be an
   aggravation of our disobedience to it, and every article of our creed
   will be a sore charge against us; and that faith, which was ordained to
   justify us, will be our great condemnation at the great day.

   Therefore, as the apostle to the Hebrews argues, "We ought to give the
   more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time
   we fall away," either by infidelity or impiety of life; "for if the
   word spoken by angels was steadfast," that is, if disobedience to the
   law of Moses was so severely punished, "and every transgression and
   disobedience received a just recompence of reward: how shall we escape,
   if we neglect so great salvation, which was at first spoken by the
   Lord, and was confirmed afterwards by them that heard him? God also
   bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers
   miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost." For, "if we sin wilfully, after
   we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more
   sacrifice for sin, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and
   fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. He that despised
   Moses died without mercy, under two or three witnesses. Of how much
   sorer punishment shall we be thought worthy, if we tread under foot the
   Son of God; and count the blood of the covenant, whereby we are
   sanctified, an unholy thing, and offer despite to the Spirit of grace!
   It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God! But,
   beloved, I hope better things of you, and things that accompany
   salvation, though I thus speak, and that you are not of the number of
   those who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the
   saving of your souls."

SERMON CXCVI1I.

  OF THE COMING OF THE HOLY GHOST, AS A GUIDE TO THE APOSTLES.

   I have yet many things to say unto you, but you can not Lear them now.
   Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into
   all truth.--John xvi. 12, 13.

   OUR Saviour having before declared to his disciples the great
   expediency of his leaving the world, in order to the coming of the Holy
   Ghost, (ver. 7.) he tells them, in the next place, what the office of
   the Holy Ghost should be. In reference to Christ, he should be an
   advocate: and in reference to them, he should be a guide or teacher.

   1. In reference to Christ, he should be an advocate to plead the cause
   of Christ and of his doctrine, and to vindicate them to the world:
   (ver. 8-11.) "And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin,
   and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they believed
   not in me; of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me
   no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged." All
   which I have formerly handled and explained at large.

   2. In regard to the apostles; the Holy Ghost is promised to be a guide
   and teacher, to reveal to them, and instruct them in some truths which
   our Saviour, whilst he was with them, had not so fully acquainted them
   withal, because of their present incapacity and unfitness at that time
   to receive them. "I have many things to say unto you, but you can not
   bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will
   guide you into all truth."

   In the handling of these words, I shall do these two things:

   First, I shall endeavour to explain the meaning of them.

   Secondly I shall draw some inferences from them.

   First, I shall begin with the explication of them; in order whereunto,
   it will be requisite to inquire into these two things:

   I. What those things probably were, which our Saviour did not reveal
   and declare to his disciples, because they could not then bear them.

   II. What is the meaning of this promise, that "the Spirit of truth
   shall guide them into all truth."

   I. What those things probably were, which our Saviour did not reveal
   and declare to his disciples, because they could not then bear them.
   Our Saviour does not express particularly what those things were, nor
   can it be expected he should have done so: for then he had declared
   them to them, which he tells us he would not do: but the text gives us
   two marks to direct our inquiry concerning them.

   1. That they were such things as the disciples at that time were
   incapable of. "I have many things yet to say unto you, but ye cannot
   bear them now." So that it seems they were such truths, as the
   disciples were prejudiced against upon some account or other; most
   probably by reason of their education in the Jewish religion, and some
   principles which they had imbibed from the teachers and interpreters of
   their law.

   2. They were such truths as, after the Holy Ghost did descend upon
   them, they should be instructed in. So that if we can find out what
   those truths were which the disciples were fully instructed in after
   the coming of the Holy Ghost, which either were not at all, or not so
   clearly revealed to them before, because of their prejudice against
   them; we may then certainly conclude, that these were the things which
   our Saviour here speaks of, when he says, "I have many things to say
   unto you, but ye cannot bear them now."

   And upon inquiry into this matter by these two marks, it will appear
   that they were principally these three:

   1. That our Saviour did not design the setting up of any temporal
   kingdom in this world; but that his kingdom and government was to be
   spiritual, not managed by any external force or compulsion, or by laws,
   the violation whereof he would vindicate by the temporal sword; but
   bylaws, the sanction and penalty whereof should take hold of the minds
   and spirits of men, and relate unto another world.

   And this was a truth which the disciples were incapable of, whilst our
   Saviour was here upon earth; against which they were so prejudiced by
   the general tradition which the Jews had entertained, that the Messias
   was to be a great temporal prince, and to subdue all nations to them,
   that they were in a continual expectation, when he would lay aside his
   mean condition, and appear in that glory and majesty which they
   expected; when like the sun he would break through all those clouds
   wherewith he was muffled and obscured, and shine forth in his full
   strength and glory. For it appears very plain, that they had a
   hankering expectation after some such thing, and that after he had so
   plainly declared to them his death and sufferings. For the text tells
   us, that "they could not understand these things, but they were hid
   from them;" that is, they were so possessed with the conceit of his
   temporal kingdom, that they could not imagine that any such thing could
   befal him. And to shew how deeply this conceit was rooted in them,
   immediately after Christ had told them so plainly of his sufferings,
   James and John put up a petition to him, that one of them might sit on
   his right hand, and the other on his left, in his kingdom. This opinion
   of his temporal kingdom did so run in their minds, that they could not
   understand any thing that seemed to contradict it.

   And though our Saviour had so expressly declared, but a little before
   his death, that his "kingdom was not of this world," and therefore he
   should make no resistance to the violence that was offered to him, yea,
   though the disciples saw him put to death; yet they did not lay aside
   this opinion, but still expected that he would rise again, and then
   begin his kingdom in this world. For so we find the two disciples
   discoursing together, as they were going to Emmaus: (Luke xxiv. 21.)
   "We trusted," say they one to another, "that it had been he which
   should have redeemed Israel." And, after his resurrection, this was
   that which lay uppermost in their minds, and which their thoughts were
   still upon; as appears by that question which they put to him just
   before his ascension, as St. Luke tells us: (Acts i. 6.) "When
   therefore they were come together, they asked of him, saying, Wilt thou
   at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"

   No wonder then, if, being possessed with so strong a prejudice about
   this matter, our Saviour did not strive to convince them of it, whilst
   he was upon earth; because they could not then have borne it: but we
   find that, after the coming of the Holy Ghost, they were fully
   instructed in it, and quitted the conceit which they had formerly
   entertained, and were satisfied that he was ascended into heaven, and
   "set at the right hand of the majesty of God;" and that from thence he
   had sent his Spirit to instruct and govern his church, and that this
   was the kingdom of the Messias.

   They were so possessed before with another apprehension, that they
   would almost have rejected him, had they understood that the Messias
   was to have no other kingdom than this; but after that glorious
   confirmation was given to him, by his resurrection from the dead, and
   visible ascension into heaven, and the descent of the Holy Ghost in
   such wonderful and miraculous gifts, then at last they were capable of
   understanding and receiving this truth, which could not sink into their
   hearts before.

   2. Another truth which our Saviour here probably intended, was the
   abrogating the Jewish dispensation. And this likewise they must needs
   be extremely prejudiced against; because their law was given by God,
   and looked upon by them, not as a temporary, but a perpetual
   institution. And this truth we find that the apostles were afterwards
   instructed in, when the Holy Ghost was come upon them. And, therefore,
   in the council at Jerusalem, the apostles released the gentiles from
   the observance of Moses's law, as a thing which they were perfectly
   instructed in by the Holy Ghost. (Acts xv. 28.) "It hath seemed good to
   the Holy Ghost, and to us," &c.

   3. Another truth which our Saviour probably here intended, was, that
   the salvation of the Messias belonged to the gentiles as well as to the
   Jews. The Jews had a strong conceit of their own privileges, and looked
   upon all the world, besides themselves, as a company of reprobates,
   that had no share or interest in the promise of God, or in those great
   blessings which their Messias was to bring to the world. And we find
   that the disciples had so deeply imbibed this prejudice in their
   education, that they wondered at our Saviour, when they found him
   talking with the Samaritan woman. And though before his ascension he
   had given them an express command to "go and teach all nations," yet it
   seems it was a good while before they understood this command in the
   latitude in which our Saviour in tended it. For it is plain, from the
   history of the Acts, that until Peter was sent to Cornelius, and better
   instructed in this matter by a vision from heaven, they had not at all
   preached the gospel to the gentiles, being persuaded that it was
   unlawful to do it: but, by the command of our Saviour to "go and teach
   all nations," they understood that they were to preach to the Jews
   dispersed in all nations. But after this vision to Peter, and when they
   saw that the Holy Ghost fell upon the gentiles, in the same manner that
   it had done upon them, then, and not before, they were instructed in
   this truth.

   That these are all or some of the principal of those truths which our
   Saviour here means, when he says, that he had yet many things to say
   unto his disciples, which they could not then bear, does, I hope,
   sufficiently appear; because they were such truths as the disciples
   were most vehemently prejudiced against, and which afterwards they were
   fully instructed in by the descent of the Holy Ghost, and not before.

   II. I shall inquire what is the meaning of this promise in the text,
   that "the Spirit of truth will guide them into all truth."

   That these words are not to be understood in the greatest latitude
   which they are capable of, I think any one will grant. For certainly no
   man ever sup posed, that our Saviour here promised that his Spirit
   should lead his disciples into the knowledge of all natural truths, and
   instruct them in all the depths of philosophy, and in the mysteries of
   all arts and sciences. Plain it is then, that some limitation must be
   put upon this general and universal promise of "leading them into all
   truth." All the difficulty is, how far it is to be limited, and what
   bounds are to be set to this general promise.

   Now in all reason it ought to be limited by the context; and if we go
   that way, which is the only reasonable way of limiting general words,
   then the plain meaning of this promise will be this: that because our
   Saviour had forborne to reveal several truths to his disciples, which
   they were not then capable of, he would supply this difficulty after
   wards by his Holy Spirit, who, after that he was risen from the dead,
   and ascended into heaven, should descend upon them, and instruct them
   fully in those truths, which he, in condescension to their prejudice
   and incapacity, had in his life-time for borne to do; that is, he would
   take a fitter season to instruct them fully by his Spirit, in all those
   truths which, whilst he was upon earth, they were not so capable of
   receiving. "I have yet many things to say unto you:" that is, besides
   what I have already declared to you, there are several other things,
   which ye are not now so capable of receiving, which the Holy Ghost,
   whom I will send in my name, shall take a more convenient time to
   instruct you in. And our Saviour speaks much to the same purpose: (John
   xv. 25, 26.) "These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present
   with you; but the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
   will send in my name, he will teach you all things;" that is, he shall
   make up and supply what is wanting, and instruct you in those things
   which ye are not now so capable of receiving.

   I shall now, in the second place, make some inferences from the words
   thus explained. As,

   First, That it is not necessary at all times to preach all truths,
   which are of importance to be [9] known. For these were great truths
   which our Saviour forbore for some time to reveal to his disciples, and
   were of great importance to the planting and propagating of the gospel:
   and yet he thought it better at present to forbear the pressing of
   them, than by an unseasonable declaration of them to do no good, but
   only stir up prejudice against himself, and those other necessary
   truths which he had instructed them in.

   Secondly, That there ought to be a due regard had to what people can
   bear; and where men are possessed with a violent prejudice against some
   truths, we ought, in imitation of our Saviour's example, patiently to
   expect and endeavour the removal of that prejudice; and, first, to
   apply all fit ting means for the conquering and subduing it, be fore we
   expose truth to be rejected by those who have taken up a violent
   prejudice against it. And this rule holds universally, where we have to
   deal with persons who are tractable and willing to learn, but do at
   present lie under some prejudice of education, or some false principles
   which they entertained unawares, which, by time and patience, and
   gradual progress of truth, may be removed, but are not to be conquered
   and borne down at once. There are some prejudices which cannot be
   plucked out of the minds of men at once, but yet may be so loosened by
   degrees, that they will fall off of themselves; as there are many knots
   untied with patience and leisure, which by a violent pulling are fixed
   so much the faster.

   And this course we find the apostles took, in imitation of our Saviour;
   (1 Cor. iii. 2.) "I have fed you (saith St. Paul there) with milk, and
   not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it." He was
   contented to instil truth into them by degrees, and as they were
   capable of it. The minds of most men are strait and narrow, and cannot
   receive that at once which may be instilled by degrees; like
   narrow-mouthed vessels, into which liquor may be poured by degrees; but
   if we strive to put it in faster than they can receive it, it runs by,
   and is lost.

   But where men are not of a teachable disposition, but the prejudice
   against truth is wilful and affected, there we are bound to propose
   great and important truths to men, notwithstanding their prejudice
   against them, and to urge upon them those things which are necessary
   and fit for them to know, "whether they will hear, or whether they will
   forbear." And if in that case they will resist truth, fairly and with
   full evidence proposed to them, they do it at their peril. God is not
   obliged to do more, than to offer men sufficient means of conviction;
   and if they will be obstinate and pertinacious, God is not bound in
   that case to provide any farther remedy.

   III. Another inference, and which I principally intended from this
   text, is this: that from the explication which I have given of this
   promise of our Saviour's, of sending his Spirit to lead his disciples
   into all truth, it very plainly appears, that there is no ground or
   colour of ground from this text, for the pretended infallibility of the
   Romish church: and yet this is one of those texts, which their great
   masters of controversy do urge us withal, for the proof of their
   infallibility; a sign that they are much at a loss for good arguments
   to prove it by, otherwise they would never summon a text so very remote
   from their purpose. And how far this text is from proving their church
   to be infallible, will very clearly appear, if we consider these five
   things:

   1. That the plain and obvious sense of this promise (as I have already
   shewn) is this; that because there was some truths fit for the apostles
   to know, which they were not at that time capable of receiving, whilst
   our Saviour was upon earth, there fore, after his ascension, he would
   send his Holy Spirit to instruct them in those things, and to guide
   them into all those truths, which it was not then, seasonable to
   acquaint them withal. Now by what art can any man infer from hence,
   that our Saviour would give the infallible assistance of his Holy
   Spirit to the church of Rome, to the end of the world?

   2. Let it also be considered, that this promise was made personally to
   the apostles, and therefore ought not to be extended beyond them,
   unless it evidently appear, that it ought to be so extended; unless it
   evidently appear, either from the tenor of the promise, or from some
   other reason, that it was the intention of the promiser that this
   should equally extend to others as well as to them. It is true, that
   this promise was made to the apostles, not merely for their own sakes,
   but for the benefit of the church; for God thereby promiseth, that his
   Spirit should reveal those truths to them, that they might declare them
   to the church: but it does not from hence follow, that any other
   persons, in succeeding ages of the church, should have the same
   immediate assistance of the Holy Ghost which the apostles had; because,
   being once revealed to the church, there was no need of a new
   revelation of those truths in every age.

   3. There is nothing in the tenor of this promise, nor any other reason,
   from whence it may appear, that this promise ought to be extended any
   farther than to the persons to whom it was made; because this promise
   was made with a peculiar respect to the apostles, and their employment,
   and for reasons proper to the first state of the church; and not common
   to all ages; therefore it cannot with reason be extended to all
   after-ages of the church.

   Let it be granted, then, that this promise, taken together with other
   promises of our Saviour made to the apostles, does signify an
   infallible assistance to them, so as to secure them from error, in the
   delivery of the doctrine of Christ; yet why should any church
   afterwards, much less the church of Rome, apart from all others,
   pretend to be heir general to the apostles in this infallible
   assistance? the apostles gave sufficient evidence of their
   infallibility, by the miracles which they wrought: and let the pope and
   general councils give this testimony of their infallibility, and we are
   ready to acknowledge it. There was reason why this assistance should be
   afforded to the apostles in the first preaching of the gospel; but
   after it was planted, and the doctrine of Christianity consigned to
   writing, there was no need of such an infallible assistance afterwards.

   But they of the church of Rome tell us, that this infallible assistance
   was necessary after wards for the perpetuity of the church, and for the
   government of it, and for the decision of controversies amongst
   Christians. To this I answer two things:

   First, If this infallible assistance be necessary to these ends, then
   it is also necessary, that it should have been declared, what that
   church or society is, which was to be so infallible; else how should
   men know, whither to have recourse for the government of the church,
   and the decision of controversies in matters of difficulty? As good the
   Christian church be without infallibility, as that no man should know
   where it is.

   And will any man have the confidence to say, that God hath any where in
   Scripture declared, that the church of Rome hath this infallibility
   annexed to her? Hath the Scripture any where told us, that the church
   of Rome is the catholic church; that is, that a particular church is
   the church universal; if we should suppose the universal church to be
   infallible in matters of faith and practice, is it any where said in
   the Bible, that the pope, or a general council, or both together are
   infallible? Are we any where there directed to have recourse to Rome,
   and the bishop of that city, either with or without a general council,
   for the determination of controversies in religion? And yet if
   infallibility be necessary for the ends mentioned, then certainly it is
   as necessary, that we should have been plainly directed where to find
   it, that we may make use of it upon occasion. What man living can
   persuade himself, that the belief of the infallibility of the Romish
   church; that is, of the pope, or of the pope and council, should be so
   fundamental an article of faith as they would make it; and yet that
   neither Christ nor his apostles should say one word about it? How comes
   it to pass, that when there were so many schisms and dissensions in the
   primitive church, St. Paul should never so much as once mention this
   effectual remedy of all those evils, to send them to St. Peter, who was
   the only infallible judge of controversies? If Christ had appointed
   this way, then certainly St. Paul could not have been ignorant of it.
   Besides that, it would have been an excellent direction to the church
   in after ages, what to have done in the like cases; if our Saviour, or
   any of his apostles, would have given us the least signification, that
   the heir of infallibility had been fixed at Rome, and that thither we
   were to have recourse for the deciding of all differences in religion.

   Especially it must needs seem very wonderful, that St. Paul in his
   Epistle to the Roman church, should not acquaint them what a singular
   privilege that church had above all other churches, that it was the
   seat of infallibility, and that the bishop of that church was the great
   judge of controversies, and that there could no difference arise among
   them, about any matter of faith, but they might speedily have it
   decided from that chair. Nay, on the contrary, there are shrewd
   intimations given, that the church of Rome herself should apostatize
   from the faith, and that her haughtiness would be her ruin. (Rom. xi.
   20, 21.) Where, speaking of the Jews, that were broken off by their
   unbelief, he gives this caution to the church of Rome; "Well: because
   of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not
   high-minded, but fear. For if God spared not the natural branches; take
   heed lest he also spare not thee." "Be not high-minded, but fear." What
   needed they to fear, who had the privilege of infallibility? Their
   faith must needs be unshaken. But St. Paul seems to think that church
   to be in as much danger of falling from the faith, as any other. From
   whence we may certainly conclude, that he knew nothing of its
   infallibility. Nay, he seems to have foreseen their arrogant pretence
   to it, and that that very thing would be the occasion of their falling,
   when he gives them that caution, "Be not high-minded, but fear." For
   what greater instance could there possibly be of a proud and high mind,
   than to assume to themselves to be infallible? But,

   Secondly, The ends mentioned may be sufficiently attained without
   infallibility. As for the perpetuity of the church, that may continue
   to the end of the world, by virtue of the infallibility of Christ's
   promise, though there be no infallibility either in the church of Rome,
   or any where else. For setting aside Christ's promise, the church may
   fail; and his promise signifies only that it shall not fail, not that
   it cannot. All that can be inferred from the promise of Christ,
   concerning the perpetuity of the church, is only the certainty of the
   event, but not the infallibility of the cause; not that the church
   shall be infallible, but only that it shall not fail.

   In like manner for the government of the church, and decision of
   controversies, there is no need of infallibility; because the church
   may be governed well enough, as other societies are, without an in
   fallibility: and all controversies that are necessary to be decided,
   may be decided by the infallible rule of faith, the Holy Scriptures,
   which are plain in all things necessary; and there is no necessity,
   that controversies about matters not necessary should be decided.

   To conclude this point; if the pope and a general council be the seat
   of infallibility, (which is the most general opinion in the church of
   Home) then how was the Christian church governed, and controversies
   decided, before the council of Nice, which was the first general
   council; that is, for three hundred years? And if the church did well
   enough for three hundred years without an infallible judge, this is a
   demonstration that there is no absolute need of it.

   4. This promise here in the text signifies a revelation of some new
   truths to the apostles, which they were not instructed in before, and
   therefore cannot belong to any church in after-ages. For the church of
   Rome herself does not pretend to any revelation of objects of faith not
   known before, and therefore can challenge nothing by virtue of this
   promise.

   5. Suppose infallible assistance were here promised to the church in
   all ages, and that the church of Rome were the catholic church, and
   that the pope and a council were the Roman church, and consequently the
   catholic: I say, suppose all this granted; yet the church of Rome,
   according to her principles, can never be certain that this is the
   meaning of this promise. For they profess to receive both the Scripture
   and the interpretation of it from the church, and consequently to
   believe this text to be scripture, and this to be the meaning of this
   text, because their church which is infallible tells them so: and if
   so, then they do not believe their church to be infallible, because
   this text says so; but they believe this to be the meaning of this
   text, because their church is infallible and tells them so. So that of
   necessity they must first believe their church to be infallible, before
   they can prove it from this or any other text; and consequently, they
   must either prove things in a circle, or else take the meaning of this
   text of the infallibility of their church for granted, without any
   proof. And thus much may suffice to have spoken to this text.

SERMON CXCIX.

  OF THE ORDINARY INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST, ON THE MINDS OF CHRISTIANS.

   But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
   receive. For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was
   not yet glorified.--John vii. 39.

   OUR blessed Saviour (who used from all sorts of objects and occurrences
   to discourse of heavenly and spiritual things) being present at the
   feast of tabernacles, in which it was the custom of the Jews, from the
   fountain Siloam, to fetch water with great pomp and ceremony, and to
   bring it into the temple with sound of trumpet, and to offer it,
   singing those words of the prophet Isaiah, "They shall draw waters with
   joy out of the wells of salvation:" I say, our Saviour being present at
   this feast, takes occasion from these waters, which they brought into
   the temple with so much joy, to proclaim those spiritual benefits which
   Christians should be made partakers of by the Holy Ghost, and which are
   in Scripture represented by waters flowing from a living fountain. "In
   the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
   saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink. He that
   believeth on me, as the scripture saith," that is, according to the
   tenor of several passages in the prophets, "out of his belly shall flow
   rivers of living water;" and then the evangelist adds, by way of
   farther explication of our Saviour's meaning, "but this he spake of the
   Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive. For the Holy
   Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified." In which
   words we have these three things considerable:

   First, The gift itself; which is here called the Spirit, or the Holy
   Ghost.

   Secondly, The persons upon whom this gift was to be conferred; and
   those are believers, such as should believe and embrace the gospel.
   "This he spake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
   receive."

   Thirdly, The particular time and season of the first conferring of this
   gift: and this was not to be till after our Saviour's ascension into
   heaven, and being received up into glory, implied in those words, "the
   Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified." I
   shall as briefly as I can explain these three things.

   First, The gift itself, which is here called the Spirit, or the Holy
   Ghost. By which we are to understand a special power and presence of
   the Holy Ghost with believers, the immediate operation and assistance
   of the Divine Spirit communicated and imparted to them; and this
   comprehends in it these two things:

   1. Those extraordinary and miraculous gifts which were bestowed upon
   the apostles and primitive Christians, in order to the planting and
   propagating of the Christian religion in the world, and for the use and
   benefit of the church, while it was under persecution, and destitute of
   all secular countenance and assistance; and of those ordinary human
   advantages which are sufficient to preserve and maintain a religion,
   after it is once firmly settled, and generally entertained. And these
   gifts were in a very remarkable manner, and such as no religion that
   ever was in the world can pretend to the like, conferred upon the first
   preachers of the Christian doctrine, and planters of it in the world;
   and they were in a high degree necessary to give credit and countenance
   to this religion at its first appearance, and to awaken the drowsy
   world to an attentive consideration of it; to conquer the prejudices of
   men against a new religion; and to support and bear up the teachers and
   publishers of this doctrine, against that violent opposition and
   persecution which would certainly be raised against it; and likewise to
   supply the want of secular power and authority to give countenance and
   assistance to it.

   For these, and such-like ends and reasons, God was pleased, at that
   time, not only to endue the apostles and first preachers of
   Christianity with all sorts of miraculous powers, but even the
   generality of Christians with several extraordinary gifts; and also to
   accompany the outward preaching of the gospel with a very extraordinary
   influence of God's Spirit upon the minds of men; to make way for the
   entertainment of it, by opening their understandings, and enlightening
   their minds to discern spiritual things, by subduing their prejudices,
   and conquering their lusts, and the vicious and perverse inclinations
   of their wills, to the obedience of faith, by raising their minds above
   the world, above all the allurements and enjoyments of it, and above
   all the threatenings and (errors of it, and giving men courage and
   resolution to embrace this profession, and with constancy to adhere to
   it, notwithstanding all the dangers and sufferings which attended it.

   1 shall not now treat of these miraculous gifts particularly, having
   had frequent occasion heretofore [10] to discourse at large of the
   nature, and several kinds, and particular use and ends of them. I shall
   only observe to you, that this power of miracles, and this
   extraordinary influence of the Spirit of God upon the minds of men, was
   not intended always to continue in the church, but only so long as
   there should he need and occasion for it; that is, till the Christian
   religion was fully propagated and planted, and the fury of persecution
   abated, and till Christianity had the favour and countenance of the
   civil authority, and the prejudice of education on its side. For when
   by this means it came to stand upon equal terms of advantage with other
   religions, God then withdrew his extraordinary assistance, and left it
   to be maintained and supported by more human and ordinary ways, and, in
   a great measure, by its own rational force and power upon the minds of
   men.

   2. The gift of the Holy Ghost doth likewise signify and comprehend in
   it a more than ordinary and gentle influence of God's Spirit upon the
   minds of men, to all holy and good purposes: by which I mean, an
   immediate operation and assistance of the Holy Ghost afforded to men,
   to relieve the weakness and impotence of human nature, to help and
   strengthen us to the performance of what the gospel requires of us. And
   this I shall have occasion to explain more particularly, when I have
   gone over the other parts of the text.

   Secondly, You have here the qualification of the persons who were to be
   made partakers of this gift; and that is, believing and embracing the
   gospel: "This he spake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
   should receive."

   The extraordinary and miraculous gifts of the Spirit were not conferred
   on any but those who embraced the faith of Christ, and made profession
   of the Christian religion. Not that all Christians were endowed with
   those extraordinary gifts, much less all in an equal degree. But they
   were distributed (as St. Paul tells us) in such manner and measure as
   the wisdom of God thought fit, and as was most for the use and
   edification of the church. But all were partakers of the Holy Ghost, in
   respect of his more ordinary influence and assistance, and this gift
   all Christians received upon their embracing and owning the Christian
   religion. Thus (Acts v. 32.) the Holy Ghost is said to be "given by God
   to them that obey him." And (Gal. iii. 14.) we are said "to receive the
   promise of the Spirit through faith." And (Ephes. i. 13.) "In whom,
   also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
   promise."

   And because this profession of faith was made in baptism, whereby men
   are solemnly initiated into the Christian religion, hence it is, that
   this gift of the Holy Ghost is in Scripture promised, and said to be
   conferred in baptism: (Acts ii. 31.) "Then Peter said unto them,
   Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ,
   for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
   Ghost." And (Heb. vi. 4.) the apostle, speaking of those who had
   solemnly taken upon them the profession of Christianity, thus describes
   them; "Those who were once enlightened, (that is, baptized, for so
   baptism is frequently by the ancients called illumination) those who
   were once baptized, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made
   partakers of the Holy Ghost;" implying, that this heavenly gift of
   God's Holy Spirit was conferred upon Christians in their baptism; and
   hence it is, that "baptizing with water and the Holy Ghost" were
   frequently put together, water being the outward symbol, and the Holy
   Ghost the in ward grace, conferred in baptism. So likewise the apostle
   joins together, "the laver of regeneration, and the renewing of the
   Holy Ghost." (Tit. iii. 5.)

   All which considered, I cannot imagine why so great a scruple should be
   made of those expressions which our church useth in the office of
   baptism of children; M being regenerated and born again by baptism,"
   and "being thereby made the children of God, and heirs of eternal
   life." That is, by entering into this covenant, they are put into a
   state and capacity of all the blessings of the gospel, if they do not
   neglect the condition which that covenant requires on their part. For
   all this is in truth no other but what the Scripture says of baptism,
   and ascribes to it, when it calls it, "the laver of regeneration," when
   it declares the Spirit to be conferred in baptism, and when it says,
   that "as many as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God, and
   that the sons of God are heirs of eternal life." So that I cannot see
   that our church, in her highest expressions concerning the benefits and
   effects of baptism, says any thing but what is very agreeable, both to
   the expressions and sense of Scripture. And thus, not only the ancient
   fathers spake of this matter, but so likewise do all the liturgies of
   the reformed churches, in the offices and forms appointed by them for
   the administration of baptism; so that it seems a very affected
   singularity to take exceptions at such expressions as have constantly
   been, and still are, generally used in all Christian churches. The

   Third thing considerable in the text is, the particular time and season
   of the conferring of this gift of the Holy Ghost; and that was after
   our Saviour's ascension into heaven, and being received up into glory,
   implied in those words, "the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because
   Jesus was not yet glorified;" signifying to us, that this effusion of
   the Spirit was not to be till after our Saviour's ascension into
   heaven.

   But was not the Holy Ghost given to the prophets of old? and were not
   good men in former ages of the world under the ordinary influence and
   assistance of the Divine grace and Spirit? why is it then said, that
   the "Holy Ghost was not yet given?"

   The answer to this is easy: that our Saviour here speaks of that
   general and plentiful effusion of the Holy Ghost, which was promised to
   the latter days, that is, to the gospel age; the like to which, both
   for the universal communication of this gift, and for the extraordinary
   degree and measure of its participation, had never been in the world
   before; and of this it is that the evangelist speaks, when he dates the
   time of it from after our Saviour's ascension into heaven. Now why the
   dispensation of this gift of the Holy Ghost was particularly limited to
   this time, though it is not necessary we should know the reasons of it,
   yet there are three obvious ones, which may give us full satisfaction
   in this matter.

   1. Because it was not so necessary before, in our Saviour's life-time:
   for during his continuance in the world, and conversation with his
   disciples, his presence supplied all other defects; but when he left
   them, they were, as he calls them, orphans, destitute of help, comfort,
   and protection; and therefore it was requisite, that, upon his
   departure from them, this Comforter and advocate should come to "abide
   and continue with them for ever." But this does not seem to reach fully
   the reason assigned in the text, why "the Spirit was not yet given,
   because Jesus was not yet glorified." Therefore,

   2. It seems very convenient, not only that our Saviour should be
   visibly taken up into heaven, but that after he was ascended thither,
   he should give some remarkable testimony to the world, of the power and
   dignity to which he was there advanced; and that as a king he should
   give some evidence of his authority and majesty, at his solemn
   inauguration into his kingdom, by dispensing plentifully spiritual
   gifts, as the princes of this world are wont at such a time to scatter
   temporal favours and benefits. And this the Scripture takes notice of,
   as an evidence and testimony of his royal dignity, and glorious
   exaltation at the right hand of God, (Acts v. 31, 32.) "Him hath God
   exalted (speaking of our blessed Lord) with his own right hand, to be a
   Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto Israel, and forgiveness
   of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things; and so also is the
   Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him." Where you see
   that the gift of the Holy Ghost is mentioned as a testimony of our
   Saviour's being "exalted as a Prince at the right hand of God." But
   more expressly St. Paul, (Eph. iv. 8.) applied to our Saviour these
   words of the Psalmist, Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high,
   he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."

   3. After our Saviours ascension, there was the greatest occasion that
   ever was for the bestowing of this gift of the Holy Ghost, considering
   what kind of persons they were that were appointed to publish the
   gospel to the world: and that this great work being to be carried on by
   instruments in all appearance so weak, and mean, and contemptible,
   there was an absolute necessity of an extraordinary testimony to be
   given from heaven to the Divinity of this new doctrine, and of a Divine
   power and presence going along with it, to encourage and support those
   weak instruments in carrying on of this work, against the mighty
   opposition and persecution it was likely to meet withal, and against
   such difficulties and obstacles as were plainly insuperable by any
   human power and means. For as there never was a work of greater
   consequence and difficulty than this undertaking; so could this Divine
   power and assistance never have appeared and manifested itself, upon a
   litter and more worthy occasion. Since our Saviour, according to the
   wise counsel of God, intended, that after his ascension into heaven,
   his gospel should be published to the world, it was highly requisite
   that the minds of men should be prepared for it, and way made for the
   more ready entertainment and easy passage of it, by some signal
   testimony of the Divine presence attending the first publishers of it,
   and by circumstances, though not so full of terror and amazement as
   those which did accompany the giving of the law, yet really of greater
   force and efficacy, and more apt to convince the world of the truth of
   this doctrine, and to insinuate it more effectually into the hearts and
   consciences of men.

   And now that I have given you a brief account of the three particulars,
   which from this text offer themselves to our consideration, I shall
   return back to that which I intended more especially to insist upon;
   and that is, the more ordinary influence of the Holy Spirit of God upon
   the minds of those who believe and embrace the Christian doctrine; and
   this I shall endeavour to explain to you under these four heads:

   First, I shall open to you the nature of it.

   Secondly, The necessity of it, to enable us to perform the condition of
   the gospel covenant.

   Thirdly, The blessed effects of it.

   Fourthly, The extent of it as to persons and times.

   First, I shall endeavour to open to you the nature of this gift of the
   Holy Ghost, understanding by it the ordinary influence of the Holy
   Spirit of God upon the hearts and minds of believers. And I doubt not
   but that the Scripture means by it an immediate influence and operation
   of the Holy Spirit of God upon the minds of men, an inward power,
   strength, and assistance, communicated to Christians, to all the
   purposes of holiness and obedience, enabling them to be such "manner of
   persons, in all holy conversation and godliness," as the gospel
   requires: and not only that this strength and assistance is offered and
   afforded to us, "to work in us, both to will and to do" all that is
   necessary to salvation, if we put no obstacle thereto, and do not
   resist the Spirit of God, and the blessed motions of it; but, likewise,
   that this power does continually dwell and reside in all true
   Christians, if we do not grieve the Spirit of God, and provoke him to
   withdraw himself from us.

   And this is sufficiently declared in several places of the New
   Testament, where we are said to be "assisted by a Divine power, and
   strengthened with all might by the Spirit in the inner man; to walk in
   the Spirit, to be led by the Spirit, and by the Spirit to mortify the
   deeds of the flesh;" and likewise in those texts, wherein the Spirit of
   God is said "to work mightily in them that believe, to dwell in them,
   to sanctify and renew them," with many such-like expressions,
   frequently to be met with in the writings of the apostles. By all
   which, unless we offer notorious violence to the plain and obvious
   sense of them, we must necessarily understand something more than the
   confirmation which was given to the Christian doctrine, by the miracles
   that were wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost; which doctrine being
   thus confirmed, does by way of rational conviction work upon the minds
   of men, and change their wills, without any internal operation and
   immediate assistance of the Holy Ghost. Such a remote influence of the
   Spirit of God upon men as this is, does by no means seem to answer the
   fulness of those phrases and expressions, which the Scripture so
   frequently useth concerning it; and if any man do but seriously weigh
   and consider them, nothing less than an immediate influence of the
   Spirit of God upon our hearts, and a real strength and power thereby
   communicated to us, can be imagined to satisfy the proper sense and
   meaning of the several expressions which I have mentioned.

   And that the Scripture, by the promise of the Spirit, and the various
   expressions concerning it, does mean this ordinary assistance common to
   all Christians in all times, and not only the extraordinary and
   miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost, which were peculiar to the first
   ages of Christianity, seems to me to be very plain; because the
   Scripture makes the gift of the Spirit to be common to all believers,
   and to be given to all that are baptized, and this in all ages of the
   church; as appears from those words of St. Peter: (Acts ii. 38, 39.)
   "Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized, every one of you,
   in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall
   receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to
   your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord
   our God shall call." This promise is "the promise of the Holy Ghost,"
   which, he says, is made to them and their posterity, that in all
   succeeding ages should be gained to the faith of Christ. So that this
   "promise of the Holy Ghost," which St. Peter speaks of, and declares to
   be conferred in baptism, does not respect only the first ages of
   Christianity, but all succeeding generations; and therefore cannot be
   understood of the power of miracles, because that is long since ceased
   in the Christian church.

   And this appears yet more evidently, in that the Scripture makes the
   want of the Spirit a sign that a man is no true and sincere Christian:
   "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his;" and, on
   the contrary, makes our having the Spirit of God, a mark of a child of
   God; "As many as are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God:" but
   our Saviour hath assured us, that men may have the miraculous gifts of
   the Spirit of God, may "prophecy in Christ's name, and cast out devils
   in his name, and in his name do many wondrous works," and yet be
   "workers of iniquity, and shut out of the kingdom of God." And, on the
   other hand, men may not have these miraculous gifts, and yet be the
   children of God. But this will yet more fully appear, if we consider,
   in the

   Second place, The great necessity of such an immediate influence and
   assistance of the Spirit of God, to enable Christians to perform the
   condition of the covenant of the gospel. The great corruption and
   degeneracy of human nature, and the impotency and weakness consequent
   thereupon, is not only matter of Divine revelation, but hath always
   been the general apprehension, and acknowledgment, and the sad
   complaint, of the wisest part of mankind: and, indeed, every man may
   feel it in himself, and observe it in others. Now for our relief and
   recovery out of this miserable and degenerate state, God was pleased,
   in great pity and commiseration to mankind, to send his Son into the
   world, to reveal his will and our duty anew to us, for our direction in
   the way to life and happiness; and by the sacrifice of himself to make
   a perfect expiation of sin; and to proclaim forgiveness of sins to us,
   for the encouragement of our repentance, and return to our duty; and,
   in a word, to offer new terms of life and happiness to us, upon the
   conditions of faith, and repentance, and new obedience.

   But after all this is done for us, we are still with out strength, our
   nature being depraved, and sunk into that impotency and weakness, that,
   without the powerful assistance of Divine grace, we are utterly unable
   to perform those most equal and reasonable conditions which the gospel
   requires of us, being, as the Scripture expresseth it, "dead in
   trespasses and sins, and estranged from the life of God, through the
   darkness that is in us, and the blindness of our hearts;" being
   enslaved to vitious habits, and having a carnal mind, which is enmity
   to God, and renders us incapable to receive or relish Divine and
   spiritual things. So that, notwithstanding all that our blessed Saviour
   hath done and suffered for us, and all the merciful overtures of pardon
   and happiness, which the gospel makes to us, all this will signify
   nothing to our benefit and advantage, unless our impotency be relieved,
   and new life and strength be conveyed to us, to awaken and excite us to
   that which is good, to enable us to mortify and subdue our evil and
   corrupt inclinations, to break off our vitious habits, and to walk in
   the ways of God's commandments. For "we are not sufficient of
   ourselves, as of ourselves," for any of these things; "but our
   sufficiency is of God. Without Christ we can do nothing;" and it is
   only through him strengthening of us, that we are able to do all those
   things which are necessary to be done by us, in order to the obtaining
   of that happiness and salvation which the gospel hath promised, and our
   Saviour hath purchased for us. And therefore our merciful Redeemer,
   that he might not leave his work imperfect, hath sent his blessed
   Spirit into our hearts, to enlighten the eyes of our minds, and to open
   and dispose our understandings for the receiving of Divine and
   spiritual truths; to conquer, likewise, the perverseness and
   stubbornness of our wills, and to set us at liberty from the slavery of
   our lusts; (for "where the Spirit of God is," as St. Paul tells us,
   "there is liberty;") "to renew our natures, and to purify our hearts,
   to mortify our corrupt affections, and to assist us to every good word
   and work;" to strengthen us against temptations, to support us under
   sufferings and persecutions, and, in a word, to keep us by this mighty
   power of God, and gracious assistance of his Holy Spirit, "through
   faith unto salvation." So that whosoever shall but duly weigh and
   consider his own darkness and ignorance, the strange and unreasonable
   prejudices of a corrupt mind against Divine truth, and against the
   practice of holiness and virtue, the strong bias of men's natural
   inclinations to that which is evil, the mighty force and power of evil
   and inveterate habits within us, and the strength and violence of
   manifold temptations without us, together with the great difficulties
   and discouragements of piety and virtue, especially when they are
   attended with grievous sufferings and fiery trials, for righteousness
   sake; I say, he that considers all this, will easily discern, and
   readily acknowledge, how great a necessity there is of the grace and
   assistance of God's Holy Spirit, to all the purposes of a firm faith,
   and a sincere repentance, and a constant and universal obedience to the
   holy laws and precepts of the gospel, to rescue us from the power and
   dominion of sin, to raise us to a new life, to engage us in a holy
   course, and to fortify our resolutions against sin, and to enable us to
   persevere, and patiently continue in doing and suffering the will of
   God.

   It is this gracious influence, and continual assistance of God's Holy
   Spirit residing and dwelling in us, which secures all the other
   blessings and benefits of the gospel to us, and conducts us safely
   through all the temptations of this world, and the difficulties of a
   Christian course, to the end of our faith, the eternal salvation of our
   souls. For which reason, the Spirit of God dwelling in good men, and
   evidencing itself by its genuine fruits and effects, the graces and
   virtues of a good life, is said to be the pledge and earnest of our
   future inheritance, and of a blessed resurrection to eternal life, and
   "to seal us up to the day of redemption:" (Rom. viii. 11.) "But if the
   Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you; he that
   raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies,
   by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." For the same reason the apostle
   makes the Spirit of God, by which Christians are governed and led, to
   be the mark of their adoption, and being "the children of God, and
   heirs of eternal life;" (ver. 14.) "For as many as are led by the
   Spirit of God, are the sons of God!" And, (ver. 16, 17.) "The Spirit
   itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of
   God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ." And elsewhere the apostle useth it for an argument, why we
   should be careful not to resist, or quench the motions of God's blessed
   Spirit; because by this mark we are sealed to eternal life. "And quench
   not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
   redemption." I should now have proceeded, in the

   Third place, To shew the blessed effects of the influence of the Holy
   Spirit dwelling and residing in us: but that, together with the extent
   of this gift of the Holy Ghost, as to persons and times, I shall refer
   to another opportunity.

SERMON CC.

  OF THE ORDINARY INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST, ON THE MINDS OF CHRISTIANS.

   But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should
   receive. For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was
   not yet glorified.--John vii. 39.

   IN my former discourse from these words, I observed, that the gift of
   the Spirit, or the Holy Ghost, comprehends under it two things.

   First, Those extraordinary and miraculous gifts, which were bestowed
   upon the apostles and primitive Christians, in order to the planting
   and propagating of the Christian religion in the world; together with
   that extraordinary influence of God's Spirit upon the minds of
   believers, which accompanied the first preaching of the gospel.

   Secondly, The more ordinary and gentle influence of the Spirit of God,
   upon the minds of all those who believe and embrace the gospel.

   The latter of these I proposed to speak to more particularly and fully,
   and that under these four heads:

   First, To open the nature of this influence.

   Secondly, To shew the necessity of it, to enable us to perform the
   condition of the gospel-covenant.

   Thirdly, To consider the blessed effects of it.

   Fourthly, To consider the extent of it, as to persons and times.

   The two first of these I have spoken to, and now proceed to what
   remains; viz.

   Thirdly, To consider the blessed effects of this gift of the Holy
   Ghost. And they are many and great.

   I shall enumerate them as briefly as I can, not in tending to insist
   long upon them. And in general, all the good that is in us, and
   proceeds from us, all good thoughts and inclinations, all good purposes
   and resolutions, all good works and actions, are in Scripture every
   where ascribed to the dictates and motions, to the influence and
   assistance, of the Holy Spirit of God. It is he that works in us, both
   to will and to do of his own mere goodness. All our strength and
   sufficiency is from him. To his blessed inspirations and aids we owe
   all good inclinations, our beginning, and our progress, and our
   perseverance, in virtue and goodness. And though the Spirit be said to
   be given to them that do already believe, that is, so as to dwell and
   reside, to take up his constant habitation and abode only in those who
   have already sincerely embraced the Christian faith; yet this doth not
   exclude a preventing influence and operation of God's Holy Spirit upon
   the minds of those to whom the gospel is offered disposing them to
   embrace and entertain it, and by this means working faith in them. And
   in this sense it is, that faith in Scripture is said to be the gift of
   God, because it is first wrought in them by the influence and operation
   of that blessed Spirit, which is promised to dwell and reside in them
   after they have believed, and sincerely embraced, the Christian
   religion.

   More particularly these blessed fruits and effects are constantly in
   Scripture attributed to the Holy Spirit of God:--

   1. Our sanctification. We are said to be renewed by the Holy Ghost, and
   by the Spirit to mortify the deeds of the flesh. That great change
   which is wrought in man, which in Scripture is called by the several
   names of regeneration and a new birth, of the new creature, and the new
   man, is constantly ascribed to the Spirit of God, as the author of it.

   2. The conduct of our whole Christian course, and all the actions of
   it, and our constancy and perseverance in it, are likewise ascribed to
   the same blessed cause. We are said to be "led by the Spirit, and to
   walk in the Spirit;" that is, to be guided and assisted in all that we
   do by this blessed principle, which does, as it were, act and animate
   all good men; and we are said to be "kept by the mighty power of God,"
   that is, by the powerful operation of God's Holy Spirit, "through faith
   unto salvation."

   3. All particular graces and virtues are likewise said to be the fruit
   of the Spirit. (Gal. v. 22.) "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
   peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith (or rather
   fidelity), meekness, temperance." And, (Ephes. v. 9.) "The fruit of the
   Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth." And charity,
   which is the sum almost of all other graces and virtues, is said to be
   planted and wrought in us by the Spirit: (1 Pet. i. 22.) "Seeing ye
   have purified your souls in obeying the truth, through the Spirit, unto
   charity, or unfeigned love of the brethren."

   4. By the same Spirit we are said to be made partakers of that great
   and glorious privilege of adoption, and are advanced to that high
   honour and dignity of being called the sons of God; (Rom. viii. 14.)
   "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the sons of God," and
   consequently heirs of a blessed resurrection to eternal life. For so
   the apostle reasons: (ver. 16, 17.) "The Spirit itself beareth witness
   with our spirit," that is, is a testimony within us, "that we are the
   children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and
   joint-heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may
   be also glorified together." So that the Holy Spirit of God, which is
   conferred upon all sincere Christians, and does reside in them, is a
   mark or seal of their being the children of God, and a pledge or
   earnest of the blessed inheritance of eternal life, as the Scripture
   very plainly and frequently declares: (2 Cor. i. 21, 22.) "Now he which
   establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who
   hath also sealed us," or set his signature and mark upon us; and what
   this is, he explains in the next words; "and he hath given us the
   earnest or pledge of the Spirit in our hearts." (Eph. i. 13, 14.) "In
   whom, also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy
   Spirit of promise; which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the
   redemption of the purchased possession." And (chap. iv. 30.) "And
   grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day
   of redemption."

   5. By this Spirit we have free access to God in prayer, in confidence
   that we shall have our petitions granted: (Ephes. ii. 18.) "For through
   him," that is, through Jesus Christ, "we both have an access by one
   Spirit unto the Father." By the same Spirit, likewise, we are assisted
   in our prayers to God, and directed what to ask of him. So St. Paul
   tells us, (Rom. viii. 26.) that "we do not know what to pray for as we
   ought; but the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, and intercedeth for us;"
   that is, suggests to us such petitions and requests as are fit for us
   to put up to God.

   6. By the same Spirit, joy and peace in believing, and from the
   testimony of a good conscience, great consolation and good hope through
   grace, are frequently instilled into us, and shed abroad in our hearts.
   Hence are those expressions so frequent in Scripture, of "the
   consolations of the Spirit," of "peace and joy in the Holy Ghost,"
   which, as it is the natural fruit of righteousness, so it is likewise
   produced and increased in us, by the secret operation and influence of
   God's Holy Spirit.

   7. And lastly, By the same Spirit, Christians are supported and borne
   up, cheered and comforted in all their troubles and afflictions, and
   that in a very extraordinary and supernatural manner, when they fall
   under great tribulations and sufferings for righteousness' sake. And
   this influence and assistance of the Divine Spirit, was very visible
   and remarkable among the primitive Christians, who were so terribly
   exposed to the most fierce and cruel persecutions: and may
   proportionably be expected in all cases of extraordinary suffering for
   the testimony of God's truth.

   And though this influence and assistance, this conduct and guidance of
   the Divine Spirit, be commonly very gentle and secret, and do usually
   work upon us in so imperceptible a manner, that it is very hard, if not
   impossible, particularly to distinguish between the motions of God's
   Spirit and those of our own minds, between the immediate suggestions of
   the Holy Ghost and the dictates of our own reason; yet we are in
   general sufficiently assured of it, partly from the effects themselves,
   but principally from the express promise and declarations of Scripture,
   that Christians are acted by a supernatural principle, and secretly
   assisted by the influence of a Spirit above our own: and, therefore, we
   have reason, as the Scripture constantly does, to ascribe all the good
   that is in us, or that is done by us, to this gracious assistance and
   powerful influence of the Holy Spirit of God upon our minds, and
   thankfully to acknowledge, that in us, that is, in our flesh, in our
   carnal minds considered as destitute of the Spirit of God, "there
   dwells nothing that is good;" and that "by the grace of God we are what
   we are," and are enabled to do all the good we do, "through Christ
   strengthening of us by his Spirit in the inner man." I proceed to the

   Fourth and last thing I proposed to consider; viz. The extent of this
   gift of the Holy Spirit of God, as to persons and times. And, in short,
   this gift is bestowed upon every particular Christian, every sincere
   believer; for we receive the promise of the Spirit by faith: and, "if
   any man," says the apostle, (Rom. viii. 9.) "have not the Spirit of
   Christ, he is none of his;" that is, he does not be long to him, he is
   no true Christian. And, (1 Cor. iii. 16.) "Know ye not," says the same
   apostle, speaking of all Christians in general, "know ye not that ye
   are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"

   And that this gift extends to all persons, in all times and ages of the
   church, to all that sincerely embrace the Christian profession, and are
   admitted into it by baptism, is plain from that discourse of St. Peter,
   which I had occasion to mention before: (Acts ii. 38.) "Repent and be
   baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
   remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
   And that this was not a favour and privilege peculiar to the first ages
   of Christianity but common to all succeeding times, is evident from
   what follows; (ver. 39.) "But the promise," that is, the great promise
   of the Holy Ghost, "is unto you, and to your children, and to all that
   are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." That is,
   this promise of the Spirit extends to all those who shall hereafter
   embrace the Christian profession.

   And in this sense, our Saviour makes good that promise which he made to
   the apostles, to be with them always in the work of making disciples,
   and baptizing them, to the end of the world; that is, he would
   accompany the labours of the pastors and teachers of his church in all
   ages, with such a presence and influence of his Spirit upon those that
   were taught and baptized, as should be suitable to the occasions and
   necessities of the church, both the pastors and the members of it, unto
   the end of the world. In a word, this gift of God's Holy Spirit is
   bestowed upon all those who by baptism are admitted into Christ's
   religion; and if it be cherished and complied with, and the blessed
   motions of it be not resisted and quenched by us, it will abide and
   continue with us, and produce those blessed fruits and effects which I
   have before mentioned.

   Having thus explained the several particulars contained in the text,
   all that now remains is, to make some useful inferences from the whole;
   and they shall be these following, and I shall be very brief in them.

   I. What an encouragement is here to our duty, that we have such a
   mighty aid and assistance promised and afforded to us in the gospel! So
   that the apostle doth with great reason exhort, (2 Cor. vii. 1.)
   "Having therefore these promises, dearly be loved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God." And we are utterly inexcusable, if we do
   not make use of that grace which is promised, and ready to be afforded
   to us to this end; it is our own fault if sin still have dominion over
   us, and reign in our mortal bodies, that we should obey it in the lusts
   of it.

   II. What great cause have we thankfully to acknowledge the wonderful
   goodness of God to us, in bestowing such an invaluable gift upon us, as
   this of the Holy Spirit, by whose grace and assistance alone we are
   made partakers of all the other blessings and benefits of the gospel!
   Had we been still left without strength, that great salvation which
   Christ hath purchased for us, and which the gospel offers, would have
   signified nothing to us, for want of power to have performed the
   conditions, which the gospel requires of all that hope for eternal life
   and salvation.

   III. Let us always be ready to comply with the motions and suggestions
   of the blessed Spirit, and sincerely make use of those aids and
   assistances which he is always ready to afford to us; and let us take
   great heed, that we do not by any disobedience of ours to his blessed
   motions, or by any wilful presumptuous sins, resist, and quench, and
   grieve this Holy Spirit of God, whereby we are sealed unto the day of
   redemption.

   If the Spirit of God vouchsafe to dwell in us, and to make his abode in
   our sinful souls and bodies; let us do nothing that is unworthy of so
   Divine and heavenly a guest; let his presence with us fill our hearts
   with a continual awe and reverence of him, and engage us effectually
   "to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit;" let
   nothing be acted by us, or proceed from us, which may defile this
   temple of the Holy Ghost. "Ye are the temple of the living God," says
   St. Paul, (2 Cor. vi. 16.) And in the 1st of the Corinthians, (chap.
   iii. 16, 17.) "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the
   Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him
   shall God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."
   More particularly the apostle useth it as an argument to flee from
   fornication, because our bodies also are "the temples of the Holy
   Ghost:" (1 Cor. vi. 18, 19.) "Flee fornication; for every sin that a
   man doeth," that is, other sins which men commit, "are without the
   body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own
   body;" that is, pollutes and defiles it. And then it follows: "What,
   know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
   you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? for ye are bought
   with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit,
   which are God's."

   IV. Let us earnestly beg of God's Holy Spirit, and continually depend
   upon him for his grace and assistance, in a humble sense of our own
   impotency and weakness, of the frailty and treachery of our own
   spirits, of the fickleness and inconstancy of our best purposes and
   resolutions, always remembering that saying of our Saviour's, (John xv.
   5.) "With out me ye can do nothing." And that of St. Paul, (Ephes, ii.
   8.) "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
   yourselves: it is the gift of God." And that of St. Peter, (1 Pet. i.
   5.) speaking in general of all true Christians, "Who (says he) are kept
   by the power of God through faith unto salvation." This power of God is
   the Spirit, which they that believe receive, and by the blessed
   guidance and influence whereof they are kept unto salvation.

   V. This shews us what an advantage we have by the Christian religion,
   which makes us partakers of the Holy Ghost, whereby is afforded to us
   all necessary direction, and assistance, and comfort in our Christian
   course. Our Saviour tells his disciples, that the presence and
   influence of this Comforter and Advocate, whom "he would send to abide
   with them for ever," would be more to them, than even his own personal
   presence among them, which surely we should look upon as an unspeakable
   privilege and happiness; and yet the inward presence of the Divine
   Spirit is more for our security and comfort, than the best teacher and
   example; because it is inward, and conveys a real strength to us; and
   it is universal, diffusing itself at once into the hearts and minds of
   all good men, and is always present to them, which Christ's personal
   and visible presence was not, nor could be; so that, to all purposes of
   direction and assistance, of security and comfort, we are in a better
   condition under the continual influence and conduct of God's Holy
   Spirit, than they who had the advantage and happiness of conversing
   personally with our Saviour here upon earth. And therefore he tells his
   disciples, that it was really for their benefit and advantage, that he
   should leave the world, to make way for the coming of this Comforter
   and advocate; (John xvi. 7.) "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth; it is
   expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the Comforter
   will not come unto you: but if I depart, I will send him unto you." So
   that they were gainers by their loss, and his departure from them upon
   these terms was really to their advantage.

   VI. This shews the great fault of the contempt and neglect of the
   sacrament of baptism, which was instituted by our Saviour as the solemn
   rite and ceremony of admitting persons into the Christian religion, and
   the means of making us partakers of this gift of the Spirit, and of all
   the blessed fruits and effects of it; so that this sacrament cannot be
   neglected or slighted, without great affront to the Christian religion,
   and contempt of one of the great est blessings promised in the gospel.
   They that were admitted to the solemn profession of Christianity by
   baptism, were "made partakers of the Holy Ghost;" and this not only in
   the apostles times, but in all after ages; for this "promise of the
   Holy Ghost was to them and their children, and to all that were afar
   off, even to as many as the Lord their God should call;" that is, to
   all that should embrace the Christian religion, and make a solemn
   profession of it in baptism, in all succeeding ages to the end of the
   world.

   VII. What hath been discoursed upon this argument, discovers the vanity
   of many men's pretensions to the Spirit. Some pretend to infallibility,
   all pretence whereto is vain, without miracles to justify and make good
   this pretence; and yet upon this presumption of infallibility, without
   any proof of it, but only that it is convenient for them to have it,
   which will as well prove all others to be infallible, because it is
   every whit as convenient for them: I say, upon this presumption and
   pretence, they assume to themselves to dictate to all the world, what
   they shall believe, and to censure and condemn all those who will not
   submit to their dictates, as miserably mistaken, and out of the way of
   salvation; whereas the infallibility of the apostles was a supernatural
   gift, not evident of itself, but evidenced to the world by the miracles
   which were wrought, to confirm the truth of their testimony and
   doctrine; and without this evidence of infallibility, no man's, no
   church's pretences to it ought to be regarded, but ought to be looked
   upon as fanatical enthusiasm: be sides, the prodigious uncharitableness
   of this spirit, is as directly contrary as can be to the first and
   chief fruit of the Spirit mentioned by the apostle, which is love or
   charity.

   Others pretend to be guided by the Spirit in all their actions, and to
   be governed in an extraordinary manner by particular impulses and
   impressions from the Spirit of God; which they likewise pretend they
   can certainly discern from the motions of their own minds and
   imaginations. But as they can give no reason for this, so we have seen
   many times in experience, that men have been led into unlawful and
   wicked practices, and have done weak, and unreasonable, and ridiculous
   things, and then have blasphemously charged them upon the Spirit of
   God; a presumption of a high nature, and which hath some resemblance to
   the sin against the Holy Ghost, and seems to be of near affinity with
   it. For as the un pardonable sin against the Holy Ghost consisted in
   resisting the evidence of our Saviour's miracles, and perversely and
   maliciously imputing the operations of the Spirit of God to the power
   and efficacy of the devil; so, on the other hand, to pretend to the
   Spirit of God, and his motions for the works of the devil, and any
   thing that is wicked; and to ascribe these things, which are most
   likely to proceed from the instigation of that evil spirit, to the
   impulse of the Holy Spirit of God, is a high blasphemy of the Holy
   Ghost.

   Others pretend, that the Spirit doth immediately dictate to them their
   prayers, which many times are very confused and unbeseeming, and too
   plainly the issue of a heated imagination; whereas "God is not the God
   of confusion, but of order." And what is merely the effect of an
   acquired habit, or natural fluency and facility of expression and warm
   affections, they confidently ascribe to the Spirit of God; whereas the
   Spirit of God is more frequently and certainly in the still voice, than
   in the high wind and fire, the boisterous passions, and fiery zeal of
   men. And certainly, he that takes care to put up wise and decent
   petitions to God, and considers carefully what to beg of him, and asks
   it in a be coming manner, with faith and true fervency of affection,
   though in a form, hath much more reason to conclude that he prays in
   and by the Spirit of God, than he that hath the greatest freedom of
   extempore effusions.

   And, after all, there is a much better and clearer demonstration, that
   a man hath the Spirit of God, than any of these pretences; and that is,
   from the undoubted fruits of the Spirit, in the graces and virtues of a
   good life, which are visible and manifest in the temper and
   conversation of a good man; and without these, all pretences to the
   Spirit of God are but fancy and vain delusions; such men "deceive
   themselves, and the truth is not in them."

   VIII. And lastly, From hence it appears, how happy it is for us, that
   we are not left in our own hands, and to our own weakness and
   impotency, and "to work out our own salvation," but that we are under
   the continual conduct, and powerful protection of such a guardian, and
   that the Holy Spirit is always ready to be afforded to us, to all the
   purposes of guidance and assistance, of comfort and support, of
   sanctification and obedience, of patient continuance and perseverance
   in well-doing. "Let us, therefore, (as the apostle exhorts,) work out
   our salvation with fear and trembling, because it is God that worketh
   in us, both to will and to do." We are not left to ourselves to carry
   on this great work, for then it would certainly miscarry; but "God
   works in us," both the will .and inclination to that which is good, and
   gives us the power to do it: he does not force our wills, but incline
   them by the gentle suggestions and motions of his blessed Spirit; with
   which, if we comply, we are happy; if we resist them, and rebel against
   them, "we receive the grace of God in vain," and "our ruin and
   destruction is of ourselves."

   But can we then do nothing? No, not without the preventing and
   assisting grace of God; but that being afforded to us, we may comply
   with the motions of God's blessed Spirit; we may co-operate and concur
   with his assistance. God assists, but we do; he sanctifies and renews
   us by the Holy Ghost, and yet we purify and cleanse ourselves.

   But is not this injurious to the grace of God, if we do any thing at
   all, and the grace of God do not all in us and for us? I answer,

   1. It is a great grace of God, to help our weakness, and to relieve our
   impotency, and to strengthen and enable us to do what we cannot do of
   ourselves. We owe our salvation to the grace of God, to the influence
   and assistance of his Holy Spirit, if so be that without it we should
   still remain "dead in trespasses and sins," and should never be able to
   emerge and recover out of that corrupt and miserable state.

   2. Grace does not destroy nature, nor Divine assistance take away our
   liberty, but frees us from our bondage; and, as David expresseth it,
   "enlargeth our hearts to run the ways of God's commandments;" for if
   God do all, and we nothing, all exhortations and persuasions would be
   in vain.

   But then it seems that we may "receive the grace of God in vain," and
   "resist the Holy Ghost," and our complying with it, or not resisting of
   it, is our own act; which is to make men their own saviour, and to give
   the casting and determining vote to human liberty. I answer,

   1. The Scripture expressly says, that men may "receive the grace of God
   in vain, and reject the counsel of God against themselves;" and that if
   we rebel against, and disobey the motions of God's Spirit, he will
   depart from us, and we forfeit his assistance.

   2. All this is, argo's lo'gos, mere cavil; as will appear to any one by
   this plain instance: A rebel is convicted, and liable to the sentence
   and condemnation of the law; he sues for a pardon, and obtains and
   accepts it: will any man now say, that because he asks and accepts it
   from the king, and the king does not take his hand and open it, and
   violently thrust his pardon into it, that this man saves himself, and
   takes away the glory of the king's grace and mercy, and that he owes
   his life to himself, and not to the king's bounty and goodness? A man
   would be thought very senseless, that should so ascribe this man's
   deliverance from death to any act of his own, as not to think it wholly
   owing to the king's grace and favour. I think the case is the very
   same, concerning men's complying with that grace which God affords them
   for their "repentance unto life." I would fain know of these subtle
   objectors, whether Moses, when he says, (Deut. xxx. 19.) "I have set
   before you life and death, blessing and cursing, therefore choose
   life;" does not, in so saying, plainly suppose, that men may choose
   life or refuse it? And if so, whether he intended to make men their own
   saviour?

   But this objection is pressed yet a little farther; that if this be so,
   then Judas had as much cause to thank God as Peter had. And who ever
   denied, or can deny, that a rebel who refuseth a pardon offered to him
   by his prince, hath the same real obligation of gratitude to his
   prince, with him that accepts it? The prince offers the same favour to
   both, and the obligation is equal; and though he that accepts it doth
   not save himself, yet he that refuseth it destroys himself. And at the
   judgment of the great day, all impenitent sinners under the gospel,
   shall be forced to acknowledge the grace of God to them, in affording
   the opportunity of salvation, and shall only blame and condemn
   themselves for neglecting that happy opportunity. But if an
   irresistible degree of grace be necessary to every man's salvation, it
   is plain, that impenitent sinners never had the opportunity of
   salvation, and consequently cannot condemn themselves for the neglect
   of it.

   I have been the longer upon this, that I might root out of the minds of
   men an inveterate false persuasion, concerning the manner of the
   operation of God's grace in the conversion of sinners. And thus much
   may suffice to have been spoken concerning the operation of God's
   Spirit upon men, in order to their conversion and making of them good:
   but after men are converted, and do sincerely "repent and believe the
   gospel, they have the Spirit of God in another manner; he "dwells and
   resides in believers," as a constant and settled principle of holiness
   and obedience, as I have already shewn.

SERMON CCI.

  THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT, THE SAME WITH MORAL VIRTUES.

   For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and
   truth.--Ephes. v. 9.

   I HAVE formerly, upon occasion of this festival solemnity, [11]
   discoursed on divers sorts of arguments relating to the Holy Spirit of
   God: as, concerning the [12] miraculous powers and gifts of the Holy
   Ghost, conferred upon the apostles in a visible manner, when they were
   assembled together upon this day of Pentecost, to qualify and enable
   them for the more speedy and effectual planting and propagating of the
   Christian religion in the world; which is the argument more peculiarly
   proper to this day.

   I have likewise [13] discoursed to you concerning the sanctifying power
   and virtue of the Holy Spirit of God, which is common to all
   Christians, and to all ages of the Christian church; as also concerning
   the blessed fruit and effect of God's Holy Spirit, conferred upon
   Christians in baptism, and which does continually dwell and reside in
   all those who do sincerely perform, and make good their baptismal vow,
   to assist and enable them to all the purposes of holiness and
   obedience, and to work and increase in us all those graces and virtues
   which are here in the text, said to be the fruit of the Holy Spirit of
   God: "For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and
   righteousness, and truth." The connexion of which words with the
   apostle's foregoing discourse, is briefly this. At the 17th verse of
   the former chapter, the apostle gives a solemn charge to the
   Christians, at Ephesus, who were newly converted from heathenism to
   Christianity, to be careful that their conversation be answerable to
   that holy religion which they now made profession of, and that as they
   had quitted the religion and rites of paganism, so likewise that they
   would abandon the vices and evil practices of it; that the world might
   see that they had made as great a change in their minds and manners, as
   in their religion. "This, I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord,
   that ye hence forth walk not as other gentiles walk, in the vanity of
   their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
   life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the
   blindness of their heart: who, having lost the sense of good and evil,
   have given themselves over to all filthiness and brutish lusts." And
   then, at the 20th verse he tells them, that the Christian religion
   requires another sort of conversation: "But ye have not so learned
   Christ; if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him,
   as the truth is in Jesus: that ye put off, concerning the former
   conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful
   lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind: and that ye put on
   the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
   holiness;" or, the holiness of truth.

   And then he cautions them against several sorts of vices which they had
   formerly lived in, and recommends the contrary virtues to their
   practice; and as an argument thereto, he puts them again in mind of the
   change which they had made at the 8th verse of this chapter; "For ye
   were some times darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord." The
   condition they were in, whilst they were heathens, he calls darkness;
   by which metaphor he represents that dismal state of ignorance and
   wickedness in which they formerly were; "but now are ye light in the
   Lord." Being admitted into the Christian religion by baptism, they were
   enlightened by the Spirit of God. For so the apostle to the Hebrews
   describes baptism by illumination, and being made partakers of the Holy
   Ghost. (Heb. vi. 4.) "They that were once enlightened, and have tasted
   of the heavenly gift;" which he explains in the next words, by being
   "made partakers of the Holy Ghost," because that is conferred in
   baptism.

   "But now are ye light in the Lord, walk there fore as children of the
   light;" that is, do nothing unbecoming that state, into which, by the
   solemn profession of Christianity in baptism, ye are entered; or, as it
   follows a little after the text, "Have no fellowship with the
   unfruitful works of darkness; walk as children of the light, as becomes
   those who are enlightened and sanctified by the Holy Spirit of God,
   whereof ye were made partakers in baptism; for the fruit of the Spirit
   is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth."

   "For the fruit of the Spirit." Some copies have it, o gar karpo`s tou
   photos, "for the fruit of light," that is, of the illumination of the
   Holy Ghost, which Christians are made partakers of in baptism, "is in
   all goodness, and righteousness, and truth," which will make no
   difference in the sense.

   I shall briefly explain the importance of these three words, "goodness,
   and righteousness, and truth;" and then proceed to make some
   observations from the text.

   I. Goodness. And what that is, the apostle takes it for granted that
   every body knows; he does not go about to define or explain it, but
   appeals to every man's mind and conscience, to tell him what it is. It
   is not any thing that is disputed and controverted among men, which
   some call good, and others evil; but that which mankind is agreed in,
   and which is universally approved by the light of nature, by heathens,
   as well as Christians; it is that which is substantially good, and that
   which is unquestionably so. It is not a zeal for indifferent things,
   about the ritual and ceremonial part of religion, the external
   circumstances of it, much nicety and scrupulousness about things of no
   moment and consideration, such as was the pharisees tithing of mint,
   anise, and cummin; disputes about meats and drinks, and the observation
   of days, and the like: but a pursuit of the weightier things of the
   law, a care of the great duties of religion, and those things wherein
   the kingdom of God consists; the practice of the great virtues of
   conversation, which are apt to recommend us to the general approbation
   of men, to gain their good-will, and to take off exasperations, and to
   calm and sweeten the spirits and tempers of men towards us; and they
   must likewise be things unquestionably good, and against which there is
   no exception, such as will justify and bear themselves out in the
   general opinion of mankind.

   I know very well that goodness, in the strict notion of it, does
   signify a ready inclination of mind to benefit and help others all that
   we can, as we have opportunity. And this is the particular virtue of
   alms-giving, or, as we commonly call it, charity; which is so often
   recommended to us under the notion of doing good. (Gal. vi. 10.) "As we
   have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men." And, (1 Tim.
   vi. 17, 18.) "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
   high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who
   giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be
   rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate."

   But there is a larger notion of goodness more frequently used in the
   New Testament, which comprehends and takes in all those virtues of
   conversation, which are universally, and by the light of nature, owned
   to be such, and the practice whereof is apt to recommend us to the love
   and esteem of all men; as, on the contrary, the neglect of them is apt
   to bring religion under a great scandal and censure: such are obedience
   to our superiors and governors, and a conscientious care to discharge
   all those duties which the several relations wherein we stand to others
   do call for from us.

   Obedience to governors is recommended to us under the notion of
   goodness, or well-doing. (1 Pet. ii. 13-15.) "Submit yourselves to
   every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the king
   as supreme, or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him, for
   the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well.
   For so is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence
   the ignorance of foolish men." So, likewise, praying for those that are
   in authority: (1 Tim. ii. 1-3.) "I exhort, therefore, that first of all
   supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made
   for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may
   lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this
   is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour."

   In like manner, a conscientious discharge of the duties which other
   relations require is recommended to us under the notion of goodness,
   and that which is a special grace and ornament to religion: (1 Tim. v.
   4.) "Let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their
   parents, for that is good and acceptable before God." And (Tit. ii. 9,
   10.) the apostle exhorts servants to be obedient to their masters;
   that, by this instance of goodness, as well as others, they may bring
   credit and reputation to religion; "Exhort servants to be obedient unto
   their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering
   again, not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity, that they may
   adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."

   More particularly, the several virtues of conversation are frequently
   instanced in, as branches of goodness, as unity, peaceableness,
   courtesy, compassion, and good-will towards all men. The practice of
   these things the apostle calls the following of that which is good:
   (Rom. xii. 9, 10, &c.) "Let love be without dissimulation; abhor that
   which is evil, cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one
   towards another. Bless them which persecute you: bless and curse not.
   Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of
   the same mind one towards another. Mind not high things, but condescend
   to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. Recompense to
   no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If
   it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
   Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto
   wrath. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good." So,
   likewise, the apostle (1 Thess. v. 15.) instanceth in abstaining from
   revenge, as an eminent piece of goodness: "See that none render evil
   for evil unto any man: but ever follow that which is good, both among
   yourselves and to all men." And, St. Peter also gives much the same
   instances of goodness, that St. Paul hath done: (1 Pet. iii. 8, 9, &c.)
   "Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love
   as brethren: be pitiful, be courteous; not rendering evil for evil, or
   railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing; knowing that ye are
   thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing. For he that will
   love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and
   his lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good;
   let him seek peace, and ensue it. And who is he that will harm you, if
   ye be followers of that which is good?" that is, if ye practise
   goodness in the instances I have mentioned.

   You see, then, what goodness is, by the instances which the Scripture
   gives of it; obedience to our superiors and governors, and a
   conscientious care of the duties of our several relations; sincere love
   and charity, compassion, humility, peace and unity, ab staining from
   wrath and revenge, and rendering good for evil; these are
   unquestionable instances of goodness, and pass for current among all
   mankind, are on all hands agreed to be good, and have an universal
   approbation among all parties and professions, how wide soever their
   differences may be in other matters.

   These are the things which are in Scripture more peculiarly called
   good, because they are so in themselves, and in their own nature, and
   not merely because they are commanded, as the rites and ceremonies of
   the Jewish religion were, which are there fore called by God himself,
   in the prophet, "statutes that were not good;" (Ezek. xx. 25.)
   "Wherefore I gave them statutes that were not good;" that is, I gave
   them laws concerning several things, which had no intrinsical goodness
   in them. But moral duties, because of the essential and eternal
   goodness of them, are eminently called good; as in that known passage
   of the prophet, (Micah vi. 8.) "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is
   good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to
   love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"

   The other two fruits of the Spirit which are added in the text,
   "righteousness and truth," which respect likewise our conversation with
   men, more especially in the way of commerce, are rather parts or
   branches of goodness, than really distinct from it; but they are two
   considerable virtues, and there fore the apostle thought fit to
   instance particularly in them, after he had mentioned goodness; which
   is, indeed, the general name, that comprehends all virtues in it.

   "The fruit of the Spirit is righteousness;" which signifies justice in
   our dealings and actions with others; and truth, which is justice in
   our words; for he that speaks as he thinks, and performs and makes good
   what he promiseth, is said to be just to his word. And all these,
   "goodness, and righteousness, and truth," and whatever particular
   virtues are comprehended under them, though they be truly and properly
   moral virtues, yet are said to be "fruits of the Spirit."

   From the words thus explained, I shall make these four observations,
   which I shall speak as briefly to as I can:

   First, That "the fruits of the Spirit" are plain and sensible effects,
   appearing in the disposition and lives of men.

   Secondly, That these "fruits of the Spirit," here mentioned, are of an
   eternal and immutable nature, and of perpetual and indispensable
   obligation.

   Thirdly, That moral virtues are the graces and "fruits of the Spirit."

   Fourthly, That, therefore, they are by no means to be slighted as low
   and mean attainments in religion, but are to be looked upon and
   esteemed as a main and substantial part of Christianity.

   First, That the "fruits of the Spirit" are real and sensible effects,
   appearing in the dispositions and lives of men. The apostle here speaks
   of what is visible in the lives and conversations of men; for he
   exhorts Christians to "walk as children of the light:" now walking is a
   metaphor which signifies the outward conversation and actions of men.
   "Walk as children of the light. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all
   goodness, and righteousness, and truth;" that is, if a man be endued
   with the Spirit, it will discover itself by these visible fruits and
   effects. What the apostle says of the "works of the flesh," (Gal. v.
   19.) "The works of the flesh are manifest," plainly to be seen in the
   lives and conversations of men, is equally true of the "fruits of the
   Spirit," that they also are visible and manifest; so that by these men
   make a judgment of their condition, whether they be true Christians,
   and the Spirit of God dwell in them, or not; viz. by the temper and
   disposition of our minds, manifestly appearing in our lives and
   actions, by the practice of those real virtues which are the proper and
   genuine fruits of the Holy Spirit of God. For religion is not an
   invisible thing, consisting in mere belief, in height of speculation,
   and niceties of opinion, or in abstruseness of mystery. The Scripture
   does not place it in things remote from the sight and observation of
   men, but in real and visible effects; such as may be plainly discerned,
   and even felt, in the conversation of men; not in abstracted notions,
   but in substantial virtues, and in a sensible power and efficacy upon
   the lives of men, in all the in stances of piety and virtue, of holy
   and excellent actions. This our Saviour requires of his disciples; that
   the virtue and holiness of their lives should be so visible and
   conspicuous, that all men may behold it, and give testimony to it, and
   glorify God upon that account: (Matt. v. 16.) "Let your light so shine
   before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father
   which is in heaven." Not that men should make any ostentation of
   religion, as the pharisees did of their devotion and alms, which our
   Saviour censures very severely; but there is a great difference between
   an affected and vain glorious show of piety and virtue, and the real
   and substantial effects of them in a good life, which as they cannot,
   so they ought not to be hid; nay, on the contrary, men ought, as St.
   James exhorts, (James iii. 13.) to "shew out of a good conversation
   their works with meekness of wisdom;" that is, in a wise manner, not
   with pride and ostentation, but with meekness and humility, the great
   ornament of all Christian graces and virtues. I proceed to the

   Second observation; namely, that these "fruits of the Spirit," here
   mentioned, "goodness, and righteousness, and truth," are of an eternal
   and immutable nature, and of perpetual and indispensable obligation.
   The notions of good and evil, of just and unjust, of truth and
   fidelity, and of falsehood and perfidiousness, in our words and
   actions; I say, these notions are born with us, and imprinted in our
   natures; are so fixed and determined in the very frame of our minds and
   understandings, that as they need not be explained, so they can never
   be changed and altered. The difference of good and evil is naturally
   known, and the notions of righteousness, and goodness, and truth, are
   fixed antecedently to any Divine revelation, which supposeth the nature
   of them to be known, and therefore, doth not go about to define and
   explain them to us; and supposeth, likewise, the obligation of them,
   being branches of the law of nature, and essential parts of that
   religion which is born with us, and "written upon our hearts," and
   makes us "a law to ourselves." And, therefore, the Christian religion
   doth only declare these duties more plainly, and press them more
   earnestly upon us, and enforce the obligation of them by more powerful
   arguments and considerations, grounded upon clearer discoveries of the
   grace and mercy of God to mankind, and of the rewards and punishments
   of another world: but these duties are in their nature still the same;
   and the Christian religion is so far from releasing us from the
   obligation of them, that it hath very much heightened it, and bound
   them the faster upon us. I pass on to the

   Third observation from these words; namely, That moral virtues are the
   graces and "fruits of the Spirit." For the three particulars here
   mentioned by the apostle are no other but the chief heads and instances
   of moral duties, "goodness, and righteousness, and truth." What are
   these but moral virtues? and yet it is certain, that they are also
   Christian graces, because they are here expressly said to be "the
   fruits of the Spirit."

   And they are called moral virtues, because they are such duties as are
   not enjoined by any positive law, (which is not obligatory from the
   nature and reason of the thing commanded, but merely from the command;)
   but are of natural and eternal obligation, and such as we had been
   bound to the observance of them, from the immutable goodness and reason
   of them, though God had never made any external revelation of his will
   concerning them. Though it cannot be denied, but that, by the means of
   external revelation, we have a more clear and certain knowledge of
   them, and more powerful motives to the practice of them. So that grace
   and virtue are but two names that signify the same thing. Virtue
   signifies the absolute nature and goodness of these things; grace
   denotes the cause and principle by which these virtues are wrought and
   produced, and are preserved and increased in us; namely, by the free
   gift of God's Holy Spirit to us; for which reason, these graces and
   virtues of goodness, and righteousness, and truth, which are here
   mentioned in the text, are said to be "the fruits of the Spirit." I
   come now to the

   Fourth and last observation from the text; namely, That since these
   very things which are called moral virtues, are in their nature the
   very same with the graces and "fruits of the Spirit," therefore they
   are by no means to be slighted as low and mean attainments in religion,
   but to be looked upon and esteemed as a main and substantial part of
   Christianity. They are called "the fruits of the Spirit;" that is, the
   natural and genuine effect of that Divine power and influence upon the
   hearts and lives of men, which accompanies the Christian religion; or
   the happy effects of the Christian religion wrought in men, by the
   immediate operation and assistance of the Holy Spirit of God, which is
   conferred upon all Christians in their baptism, and does continually
   dwell and reside in them, if by wilful sins they do not grieve him, and
   drive him away, and provoke him to withdraw himself from them.

   I do not say, that these virtues are all religion, and all that is
   necessary to make a man a complete Christian, and good man. For there
   must be knowledge to direct us in our duty; there must be faith, or a
   hearty assent to the revelation of the gospel (especially concerning
   the forgiveness of our sins, and of our justification and acceptance
   with God, for the sake of the meritorious sufferings of our blessed
   Saviour), to be the root and principle of all religious actions; there
   must be piety and devotion towards God, and the constant practice and
   exercise of religious duties in public and private; such as prayer,
   hearing and reading the word of God, frequent and reverent receiving of
   the holy sacrament, which are the best and most effectual means in the
   world to make men good, because they are appointed by God, and attended
   with his blessing to that end: I say, there must be all these, because
   they are the principles and means of religion, which are always
   supposed as necessary to that which is the end. Now the great end of
   religion, that which Christianity mainly designs to work and perfect in
   us, are those graces and virtues which are called "the fruits of the
   Spirit;" such as those mentioned in the text, "goodness, and
   righteousness, and truth."

   And this will be evident to any one that will attentively consider what
   the Scripture says of them; and more especially, how our Saviour and
   his apostles do every where recommend them to our consideration and
   practice; (Micah vi. 8.) "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and
   what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love
   mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" It is to these qualities and
   dispositions of goodness, and righteousness, and the like virtues, that
   our Saviour promises blessedness. These St. Peter calls a Divine or
   God-like nature; (2 Pet. i. 4, 5.) speaking of the knowledge of the
   gospel, "Whereby (says he) are given to us exceeding great and precious
   promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature;"
   and thereupon he exhorts that Christians should "give all diligence to
   make their calling and election sure," by adding to the faith of the
   gospel, the several graces and virtues of a good life; these being that
   Divine nature which the gospel designs to make us partakers of.

   To speak a little more particularly of the three virtues here
   mentioned, goodness, righteousness, and truth. These are every where
   frequently commended and enjoined in the New Testament. Goodness,
   whether we consider it as it imports charity in general, and our love
   of one another, our Saviour makes it the great badge and mark of a
   Christian. "Hereby (says he) shall all men know that ye are my
   disciples, if ye love one another." St. Paul calls it "the fulfilling
   of the law, and the end of the commandment, te'los tes parangeli'as,
   the great end and design of the gospel, is charity." St. John riseth
   yet higher, and speaks of it as the very nature and essence of God
   himself, and that by which we are, as it were, united to him. "God is
   love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,"
   Or whether we consider goodness, under the notion of compassion and
   beneficence, a readiness to pity and relieve, and benefit others
   according to our ability and opportunities. This the Scripture
   celebrates as a thing highly acceptable to God. (Heb. xiii. 16.) "But
   to do good, and to communicate, forget not: for with such sacrifices
   God is well-pleased." And St. James instanceth in it as one of the most
   signal testimonies of true piety: (James i. 27.) "Pure religion, and
   undefiled, before God and the Father is this; to visit the fatherless
   and widows in their affliction." And (chap. iii. 17.) he makes it a
   mark and character of the Divine and heavenly wisdom; "The wisdom which
   is from above, is full of mercy and good works."

   And then for righteousness, of which truth and fidelity in our
   intercourse with men is a considerable part, St. Paul instanceth in it,
   in the first place, as a principal thing, wherein "the kingdom of God
   doth consist:" (Rom. xiv. 17.) "The kingdom of God doth not consist in
   meats and drinks;" that is, the power and efficacy of the Christian
   religion, or the gospel (which is frequently, in the New Testament,
   called the kingdom of God), doth not consist in zeal about indifferent
   things: but in the substantial virtues of a good life, "in
   righteousness and peace."

   You see by all this, at what a rate the Scripture magnifies these
   virtues, as the great things of religion, the end of the gospel, and
   that wherein our Christianity does mainly consist. The consideration
   whereof would make a man stand amazed, to think how these virtues
   should ever fall into so much contempt among those who call themselves
   Christians, and do every day read the Bible; and come to be accounted
   but low and pitiful things, in comparison of I know not what fancies
   and conceits, wherein some are pleased to place religion. For what can
   the best religion that ever was in the world (which Christianity
   certainly is) be better placed in, than in these and the like virtues?
   all which are so excellent in their nature and use, and have so direct
   a tendency both to the happiness of particular persons singly
   considered, and of human society; and several of them, especially those
   instanced in in the text, goodness, and righteousness, and truth, are
   the very nature and perfection of God himself.

   And what more worthy to be "the fruits of the Holy Spirit of God," and
   the effects of a Divine power and influence working upon the minds of
   men, than such qualities and dispositions as render us so like to God,
   and do so nearly resemble the highest excellencies and perfections of
   the Divine nature? And therefore our Saviour useth this as an argument
   to persuade us to be good, and merciful, and patient; because these
   qualities are so near a resemblance and imitation of the Divine
   perfection, the nearest that creatures are capable of. (Matt. v. 48.)
   "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
   perfect."

   And thus I have dispatched the four observations from the text; that
   "the fruits of the Spirit" are plain and sensible effects, appearing in
   the dispositions and lives of men; that they are of an eternal and
   immutable nature, and of perpetual and in dispensable obligation; and
   though they be moral virtues, yet they are likewise "the fruits of the
   Spirit;" and are by no means to be slighted and undervalued, as low and
   mean attainments in religion.

   All that now remains is, to make some inferences from what has been
   discoursed on this text.

   And if this discourse be true, then the want of these virtues mentioned
   in the text, and the reigning of the contrary vices in us, is a clear
   and undeniable evidence, notwithstanding all our fair professions and
   pretences, that we are not true Christians. For if we do not bring
   forth "the fruits of the Spirit," we have not the Spirit of Christ; and
   then St. Paul hath determined our case, that "if any man have not the
   Spirit of Christ, he is none of his." If these Christian graces and
   virtues mentioned in the text, goodness, and righteousness, and truth,
   do not shine forth in our lives and conversations, it is plain,
   according to the apostle's reasoning in this and other texts, that we
   are not "children of the light," because we do not "walk as children of
   the light," as those that are enlightened by the Spirit of God: for
   "the fruit of the Spirit," or "the fruit of light," as some copies have
   it, "is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth." And if these
   fruits be not found in us, it is a plain evidence that we do not "walk
   in the Spirit," that we are not led and "guided by the Spirit of God;"
   for "the fruits of the Spirit," as well as "the works of the flesh,"
   are manifest, sufficiently plain and visible, in the conversations of
   men; and according as we fulfil the lusts of the one, or bring forth
   the fruits of the other, we may certainly judge whether we have the
   Spirit of Christ or not; that is, whether we be true Christians, or do
   only usurp a name, and take a title to ourselves, which does not of
   right belong to us. We need not to trouble and puzzle ourselves with a
   great many doubtful and obscure marks, to find out by them what our
   state and condition is, and whether we be the children of God or not;
   if we have a mind to know it, we may soon bring the matter to an issue,
   by looking into our own hearts and lives, whether "the fruits of the
   Spirit" be there, "in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth," and
   in all those virtues which are elsewhere mentioned as "fruits of the
   Spirit." These are plain and sensible things, and if these virtues be
   in us, they cannot be hid from ourselves or others, but will shine
   forth in our lives and conversations, in all our words and actions.
   Goodness is soon seen, it hath a native beauty and brightness in it,
   which draws the eyes of men towards it: and it discovers itself by its
   effects, which are perceived and felt in those upon whom it is
   exercised. Righteousness, and truth, are likewise very sensible to
   ourselves and others; and so are the contrary dispositions and
   practices. No man does an unjust thing, but his conscience tells him he
   does so; no man speaks contrary to truth, or breaks his word and
   promise, but he is guilty to himself of so doing. And thus I might
   instance in all other virtues and vices. If we will but look into
   ourselves, and observe our own actions, we may easily discern, whether
   we be malicious and envious, cruel and hard-hearted, censorious and
   uncharitable; or good, and kind, and merciful, and ready to forgive;
   whether we make conscience of our word or not; or whether we do to
   others, as we would have them do to us. Nothing is more easy to be
   known than it is, which of these qualities does possess and rule our
   hearts, and govern and bear sway in our lives. And if we can know this,
   we know whether we have the "fruits of the Spirit" or not; "for the
   fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth."
   And by these fruits of the Spirit, or the want of them (which are both
   very discernible), we may know what our state and condition is, whether
   we have the Spirit of God, and be true and sincere Christians. A great
   many men tire themselves in an endless inquiry, concerning the good
   estate of their souls towards God; whether they be the children of God,
   and whether they have the Spirit of God or not, and are trying
   themselves all their lives, by obscure and uncertain marks, which will
   never bring the matter to any clear issue, but leave them still in the
   dark and in doubt, concerning their own sincerity, and the integrity of
   their hearts towards God; and how can it be otherwise, since they have
   been so often told by unskilful men, that they cannot know their own
   hearts, and consequently can never be assured of their own integrity
   and sincerity? This, I must confess, is but an ill sign of sincerity,
   when we find it so hard a matter to discern it in ourselves. Job found
   it clearly in himself, and was very confidently assured of it: (Job
   xxvii. 5, 6.) "Till I die, (says he) I will not remove my integrity
   from me: my righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go." But if
   a man can not know his own heart, and whether he have integrity or not;
   how shall he know either when he parts with it, or when he holds it
   fast? the apostle, in the text, gives us a sure mark whereby we may
   know when we have the Spirit of God--by the sensible fruits and effects
   of it.

   I will conclude all with the apostle's exhortation: (Phil. iv. 8.)
   "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
   honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
   whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if
   there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these
   things." Think of them and regard them as principal parts of your duty,
   and particular instances of that universal goodness which Christianity
   teacheth and requires, as the proper and genuine effects of that "grace
   of God which hath appeared to all men, and brings salvation;" that is,
   of the gospel. And if the doctrine of the gospel do not produce these
   blessed fruits and effects in the hearts and lives of those who profess
   the Christian religion; then, as the apostle to the Hebrews reasons,
   "how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which was at
   first spoken by the Lord, and after wards confirmed by them that heard
   him; God also bearing them witness, both with wonders, and signs, and
   divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own
   will?"

SERMON CCII.

  THE NECESSITY OF SUPERNATURAL GRACE, IN ORDER TO A CHRISTIAN LIFE.

   For without me ye can do nothing.--John xv. 5.

   IN the beginning of this chapter our Saviour compares his mystical
   body, that is, his church, to a vine, which his Father, whom he
   compares to a husbandman, hath planted. "I am the true vine, and my
   Father is the husbandman." To represent to us the union that is betwixt
   Christ and all true Christians, and the influence of grace and
   spiritual life, which all that are united to him do derive and receive
   from him, he sets it forth to us by the resemblance of a vine and
   branches. As there is a natural vital union between the vine and the
   branches, so there is a spiritual vital union between Christ and true
   Christians; and this union is the cause of our fruitfulness in the
   works of obedience and a good life. There are some, indeed, that seem
   to be grafted into Christ by an outward profession of Christianity, who
   yet derive no influence from him, so as to bring forth fruit, because
   they are not vitally united to him; these the husbandman will lop off,
   and take away, as unprofitable and dead branches; (ver. 2.) "Every
   branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away;" that is, they who
   only make an out ward profession of faith in Christ, but do not bring
   forth the fruits of obedience and a good life, shall finally be
   separated from him; "and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it,
   that it may bring forth more fruit." And because all our fruitfulness
   depends upon our union with Christ, as the fruitfulness of the branches
   depends upon their union with the vine, therefore he bids us be
   careful, that this union be preserved and continued; (ver. 4.) "Abide
   in me, and I in you." We are planted into Christ by faith, and the
   belief of his doctrine; and we abide in him by a firm purpose and
   resolution of obedience. So they are said to abide and continue in
   Christ's word, who obey and practise his doctrine: (John viii. 31.)
   "Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in
   my word, then are ye my disciples indeed." So St. James explains it:
   (James i. 25.) "But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty,"
   that is, the Christian doctrine, "and continueth therein;" how is that?
   "he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man
   shall be blessed in his deed." And (1 John iii. 6.) "Whosoever abideth
   in him, sinneth not."

   "Abide in me, and I in you." Christ is said to abide in us, by the
   continual aids and influences of his grace and Holy Spirit; and if we k
   abide in him," by the resolution of obedience, his grace and assistance
   will be continually derived to us, to bring this good resolution to
   effect, and to enable us to bring forth fruit. "For as the branch
   cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can
   ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that
   abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit. For
   without me, ye can do nothing," kori`s emou, "out of me," being
   separated from me, "ye can do nothing."

   There are two things to be explained in the words, and then I shall
   come to the assertion or proposition contained in them .

   First, What is here meant by being without Christ, or out of him.

   Secondly, In what sense and with what limitations we are to understand
   that expression, we "can do nothing."

   First, What is here meant by being without Christ, or out of him. "Out
   of me ye can do no thing;" that is, unless we be united to him, and by
   virtue of that union derive from him the supernatural aids and
   influences of his grace, we can do no thing. It is true, indeed, that
   without God we can do nothing; we cannot think, or speak, or do any
   natural action, without the common assistance and concurrence of his
   providence; "for in him we live, and move, and have our being." But
   this assistance is natural and ordinary, and commonly afforded to every
   man in the world: but the grace and assistance of Christ, signifies
   something extraordinary and supernatural, that which divines mean by
   supernatural grace, in opposition to the ordinary concurrence of Divine
   providence to all the actions of men.

   Secondly, In what sense, and with what limitations we are to understand
   that expression, we can do nothing: "Without me ye can do nothing." And
   this is necessary to be limited to such effects as our Saviour was
   speaking of; viz. the proper acts of a Christian life, obedience to the
   laws and precepts of the gospel, which our Saviour here, in pursuance
   of the allegory, calls "bearing fruit, and bringing forth much fruit."
   For if it be not thus limited, but extended to all kind of actions,
   natural or civil, it is not true that we cannot do these without
   supernatural assistance, and the grace of Christ. For these we may do
   by the common and natural assistance and concurrence of God, equally
   afforded to men: nay, more than this, we may by this common assistance
   do those actions which tend to make us spiritually good, and are the
   means appointed by God for that purpose. We may go to church, we may
   read and hear God's word, and upon the hearing of it may reflect upon
   the actions of our lives, and may be convinced of our sin and danger,
   and, upon this conviction, may beg God's mercy and grace to reform and
   grow better. But then we cannot effect this without supernatural grace
   and assistance. So that this assertion here in the text, is to be
   limited to the purposes of regeneration, and sanctification, and
   perseverance in holiness; that a man cannot make himself good, he
   cannot convert and change himself, nor by his own strength continue and
   hold out in a good course; we can do nothing of this, without the grace
   and assistance of Christ.

   So that the plain design of this proposition here in the text is, to
   assert the necessity of supernatural grace, to make men good, and to
   make them persevere in a course of holiness and obedience. In speaking
   to this argument, I shall,

   First, Shew what it is we mean by the supernatural grace and assistance
   of Christ.

   Secondly, That to this the Scripture doth constantly attribute our
   regeneration, and sanctification, and perseverance in holiness.

   Thirdly, That there is great reason to assert the necessity of God's
   supernatural grace and assistance to these purposes.

   Fourthly, That this supernatural grace and assistance does not exclude,
   but suppose, the concurrence of our own endeavours.

   Fifthly, That this grace and assistance is derived to us from our union
   with Christ.

   First, What we mean by the supernatural grace and assistance of Christ.
   Whatever natural power we have to do any thing, is from God, an effect
   of his goodness; but God, considering the lapsed and decayed condition
   of mankind, sent his Son into the world, to recover us out of that
   sinful and miserable condition into which we were fallen, to reveal
   eternal life to us, and the way to it, and to purchase happiness for
   us, and to offer it to us upon certain terms and conditions to be
   performed by us: but we being weak and without strength, slaves to sin,
   and under the power of evil habits, and unable to free ourselves from
   this bondage by any natural power left in us, our blessed Saviour, in
   great pity and tenderness to mankind, hath in his gospel offered, and
   is ready to afford us, an extraordinary assistance of his grace and
   Holy Spirit, to supply the defects of our natural power and strength.
   And this supernatural grace of Christ is that alone which can enable us
   to perform what he requires of us. And this, according to the several
   uses and occasions of it, is by divines called by several names. As it
   puts good motions into us, and excites and stirs us up to that which is
   good, it is called preventing grace; because it prevents any motion or
   desire on our parts: as it assists and strengthens us in the doing of
   any thing that is good, it is called assisting grace: as it keeps us
   constant in a good course, it is called persevering grace; and may have
   several other denominations, in several other respects: for it is
   suited to all our occasions and necessities.

   Secondly, To this grace and assistance of God, the Scripture doth
   constantly attribute our regeneration, and sanctification, and
   perseverance in holiness. We are said to be "born again of the Spirit,"
   to be "sanctified by the renewing of the Holy Ghost," to be "led by the
   Spirit of God," and, "through the Spirit to mortify the deeds of the
   flesh--to do all things through Christ strengthening us," and "to be
   kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation." All which, and
   many more texts that I might instance in, do plainly express to us the
   supernatural assistance of Christ, whereby we become good, and are
   enabled to do any thing that is good, and preserved and continued in a
   good course. As the Scripture doth every where attribute sin to our own
   corrupt hearts, and to the temptation and instigation of the devil; so
   does it constantly ascribe all the good that we do to the grace of
   Christ, or, which is all one, to the blessed motions and assistances of
   God's Holy Spirit. For "the Spirit of God" is called "the Spirit of
   Christ," yea, Christ: (Rom. viii. 9, 10.) "But ye are not in the flesh,
   but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if
   any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ
   be in you, the body is dead because of sin." By which it is evident,
   that "the Spirit of God," and "the Spirit of Christ," and "Christ," do
   in this text signify one and the same thing.

   Thirdly, There is great reason to assert the necessity of this grace
   and assistance to these purposes, whether we consider the corruption
   and impotency of human nature, the strange power of evil habits and
   customs, the fickleness and inconstancy of human resolution, or the
   malice and activity of the devil to seduce and tempt us to sin.

   1. If we consider the corruption and impotency of human nature. This
   the light of nature cannot but acknowledge. The philosophers and wise
   men among the heathens, were sensible of a great depravation in our
   souls, and degeneracy from the Divine life; and therefore they
   prescribed several ways and methods for the purifying of our souls, and
   the raising of them to that purity and perfection to which they
   supposed they were designed: but they were wholly ignorant from whence
   this depravation came; and therefore many of them supposed a
   preexistence of souls; that is, that our souls, which now inhabit these
   bodies, had lived in a former state, and for some faults they had
   committed in that state, were, by the justice of God, sentenced to be
   imprisoned in these bodies, as a punishment for their former sins. They
   could not imagine that our souls came impure out of God's hands; and,
   to avoid that inconvenience, they imagined a former state wherein they
   had sinned. And this was the best account they could give of the
   general depravation of mankind.

   But the Scripture hath given us a more certain account of this; that
   "by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin." This is the
   true source and original of the universal degeneracy of mankind, and of
   the weakness and impotency of human nature. The fall of our first
   parents hath derived corruption and weakness upon the whole race and
   posterity of Adam; for "whatsoever is born of the flesh is flesh."

   So that, considering our natural impotency, there is great need of a
   supernatural and extraordinary power and assistance, to recover us from
   this degeneracy, and "to renew us after the image of him who created us
   in righteousness and true holiness." And therefore when the Scripture
   speaks of the redemption of Christ, it represents our condition not
   only as miserable, but helpless: (Rom. v. 6.) "For when we were yet
   without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." When
   mankind was under an utter impotency of recovering itself out of that
   state of sin and misery into which it was plunged, "in the fulness of
   time," that is, when God thought it most convenient, "he sent his Son
   into the world, to die for sinners;" and, "by that Spirit which raised
   him from the dead," to enable us to mortify our lusts, and "to rise to
   newness of life."

   2. The necessity of this grace and assistance will farther appear, if
   we consider the strange power of evil habits and customs. The other is
   a natural, and this is a contracted impotency, whereby men make
   themselves much weaker than they were by nature. The habits of sin
   being added to our natural impotency, are like so many diseases
   superinduced upon a constitution naturally weak, which do all help to
   increase the man's infirmity. Evil habits in Scripture are compared to
   bonds and fetters, which do as effectually hinder a man from motion,
   and putting forth himself to action, as if he were quite lame, hand and
   foot. Habit and custom is a kind of second nature; and so far as any
   thing is natural, so far it is necessary, and we cannot do otherwise.
   By passing from one degree of sin to another, men become fixed and
   hardened in their wickedness, and do insensibly bring themselves into
   that state, out of which they are utterly unable to recover themselves.
   When men have been long accustomed to evil, and are once grown old in
   vice, it is as hard to reform and rectify them, as to recover a body,
   bowed down with age, to its first straightness. When men have continued
   long in a sinful course, they are almost under a fatal necessity of
   being wicked, and under all imaginable disadvantages of contributing
   any thing to their own recovery. The Scripture represents the condition
   of such persons to us, by such things as are naturally impossible. "Can
   the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may ye
   also do good, that are accustomed to do evil." Now this consideration
   added to the former, to the impotency of nature, the strength of evil
   habits is still a farther evidence of the necessity of supernatural
   grace and assistance for our recovery. For the greater our impotency
   is, so much more need is there of an extraordinary power and assistance
   to enable us to do our duty.

   3. This will yet farther appear, if we consider the inconstancy and
   fickleness of human resolution. Suppose that, upon hearing the terrible
   threatenings of God's word against sin, or upon the natural checks and
   convictions of conscience for having done wickedly, a sinner should of
   himself (as there is reason enough for it) entertain a purpose and
   resolution of breaking off his sinful course; yet how unable would this
   resolution be to withstand the powerful assaults of temptation, and the
   violent returns of his own inclinations to his former lusts? This
   almost every man finds by his own frequent and sad experience, how
   inconstant his mind is to his own purposes, and how unfaithful and
   treacherous to his most solemn and severe resolutions; how false we are
   to ourselves, and to the vows and promises we have made to God, and our
   own souls, when the occasions and temptations of sin present themselves
   to us. So that our need of God's grace is in no case more plain and
   evident, than to keep us steadfast to our resolution of forsaking our
   sins, and amending our lives; and without this, we find how uncertain
   and ineffectual all our good purposes are, "like the morning cloud, and
   as the early dew which passeth away." So that we must say with the
   prophet Jeremiah, (chap. x. 23.) "O Lord, I know that the way of man is
   not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps."

   4. Besides all these disadvantages from ourselves, from the impotency
   of our natures, and the strength of our lusts, and the inconstancy of
   our resolutions, we have likewise a powerful enemy with out, the devil,
   who is very malicious and active to promote our ruin, by keeping us in
   this slavery. He is the great enemy of our souls, and his malice will
   not suffer him to neglect any opportunity of doing us mischief. He
   observes and watcheth our tempers and dispositions, and accordingly
   plants his temptations, and plays them upon us where we are weakest,
   and they may do the greatest execution. So that we are not only weak
   within, but strongly assaulted without: "We wrestle not only with flesh
   and blood; but with principalities, and powers, and spiritual
   wickednesses." All the powers of darkness are combined against us, to
   work our destruction; and therefore we have need of an extraordinary
   strength and assistance, to enable us to contend with such powerful
   adversaries, upon so many disadvantages. And our comfort is, that God
   offers his grace to us, and that is sufficient for us. "Greater is he
   that is in us, than he that is in the world." The Spirit that dwells in
   good men, and is ready to assist them to all good purposes, is stronger
   than that evil spirit which is in the world, and "goes about like a
   roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour."

   Fourthly, This supernatural grace and assistance does not exclude, but
   suppose, the concurrence of our endeavours. The grace of God does not
   do all, without any concurrence on our part. It strengthens and assists
   us; but does not produce the whole effect, without any activity or
   endeavour of ours. When our Saviour says, "without me ye can do
   nothing," he does imply, that by the assistance of grace we may perform
   all the duties of the Christian life; we may bear fruit, and bring
   forth much fruit. And to keep to the metaphor in the text, the branches
   of a vine are not merely passive, but contribute their part to the
   production of fruit, though they derive continual supplies of sap and
   virtue from the vine. When the apostle says, "I can do all things
   through Christ strengthening me," he does not think it a disparagement
   to the grace of Christ, to say, he could do all things by the
   assistance of it. He acknowledged! his own impotency and weakness, and
   glories in the strength and assistance of Christ. But an acknowledgment
   of impotency does not exclude endeavour; for impotency does not signify
   an utter want of power, but the weakness and insufficiency of it, that
   it is disproportioned to the work and duty required. So that though we
   are not sufficient of ourselves for any thing that is good; yet, being
   assisted by God, we may co-operate with him to the killing of sin, to
   the cleansing of ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and
   to the perfecting of holiness in the fear of God. As the apostles were
   workers together with God in the salvation of others; (2 Cor. vi. 1.)
   "We then, as workers together with God, beseech yon, that ye receive
   not the grace of God in vain;; I say, as they were workers together
   with God in the salvation of others, so may we be said to be, in
   working out our own salvation, nay, we are commanded to be so; (Phil.
   ii. 12, 13.) "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for
   it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do." So that God's
   preventing and assisting grace, his working in us both to will and to
   do, is so far from excluding our endeavours, that it is used by the
   apostle as a strong reason and argument to the contrary; "Work out your
   own salvation: for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to
   do, of his own good pleasure." And if this were not so, all the
   exhortations of Scripture were to no purpose, our preaching were vain,
   and your hearing vain: for nothing can be vainer, than to persuade men
   to do their duty, if this be true, that God does all, and we do
   nothing.

   Fifthly and lastly, This grace and assistance is derived to us from our
   union with Christ. So soon as we believe in him, and heartily embrace
   his doctrine, we are united to him; and if we continue in this faith,
   "we abide in him, and he in us;" and by virtue of this union, the
   influences of his grace, the aids and assistances of his Spirit are
   derived to us, to all the purposes of holiness and obedience, to enable
   us to do the will of God, and patiently continue in well-doing, and to
   preserve us to his heavenly kingdom.

   There is no other mystery in this union, than that which I have plainly
   told you, that it is effected by your becoming the disciples of Christ,
   and sincerely embracing his doctrine; that it is continued by our
   bringing forth the fruits of holiness and obedience. By this we become
   branches of that true vine; and being so, derive sap and virtue from
   him, the vital influences of his grace and Holy Spirit, to assist us in
   our duty, and to make us to be "fruitful in every good work, and to
   abound in all the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ to
   the praise and the glory of God."

   But when I say this grace and assistance is derived to us from our
   union, I do not intend to exclude the necessity of God's grace and Holy
   Spirit to the conversion of a sinner, and his first planting into
   Christ: but when we say that Christians derive the influences of grace
   and assistance from their union with Christ, this supposeth them to be
   Christians already, and planted into Christ, and that this likewise is
   the work of God's grace. For if we can not bring forth fruit, without
   the aid and assistance of his grace, much less without that could we be
   planted into him, and united with him.

   I shall conclude my discourse upon this subject, with three or four
   inferences from what hath been delivered.

   I. If the grace of God be so necessary to all the ends of holiness and
   obedience, and to our perseverance in a good course, then there is
   great reason why we should continually depend upon God, and every day
   earnestly pray to him for the aids and assistances of his grace, and
   the influence of his Holy Spirit, to guide, and direct, and strengthen
   us in all goodness, and "to keep us up by his mighty power through
   faith unto salvation." For though God hath promised his assistance to
   us, and is al ways ready to afford it; yet we are to remember, that it
   is a free dispensation of his grace and goodness, "he works in us both
   to will and to do, of his own good pleasure." And the promise of this
   grace is not so absolute, but that he expects we should earnestly sue
   and beg to him for it. He hath not promised his Holy Spirit but to them
   that ask him, and that with great earnestness and importunity; we must
   ask, and seek, and knock. Even where he promiseth "to give us a new
   heart and a new spirit;" yet, he says, that "for all these things he
   will be sought to by the house of Israel." And though sometimes he be
   found of them that seek him not, and do frequently prevent us with his
   grace, and the motions of his blessed Spirit; yet we have no reason to
   expect it without our seeking of it.

   II. We should thankfully acknowledge and ascribe all the good that is
   in us, and all that we do, to the grace and assistance of God exciting
   and strengthening us to every good work, without which we can do
   nothing, and say, with David, "Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord, but to
   thy name be the praise." And with St. Paul, "yet not I, but the grace
   of God which was with me." As the children of Israel were brought out
   of Egypt, and conducted to the possession of the good land (which is a
   type of heaven) by the presence and power of God going along with them,
   "not by their own sword and bow, but by a mighty hand, and an out
   stretched arm:" so, if ever we be rescued from the bondage of sin, and
   quickened to newness of life, if ever we be saved, and come to heaven,
   we must be assisted, and conducted, and kept by the mighty power of
   God: for "by grace we are saved, and that not of ourselves," for it is
   the gift of God.

   III. Let us take heed that we resist not the Spirit of God, and receive
   not this grace of God in vain. And this we do, whenever we resist the
   motions of God's blessed Spirit, and do not make use of that grace and
   assistance which God offers to us, by being workers together with God,
   and co-operating with his grace by our own sincere endeavours. God's
   Spirit doth frequently put good motions into us, and is ready to
   further them, if we comply with them, and to enable us to bring them to
   effect: but men may, and many times do, resist the Holy Ghost, and
   quench the motions of that blessed Spirit of grace; and then God justly
   leaves us, and withdraws his assistance, and takes away his Holy Spirit
   from us. But if we comply with them, his grace and help is ready to
   carry us still farther, and to assist us more and more, that we may go
   from strength to strength, until we come to appear before him in Sion.

   IV. The consideration of our own impotency is no excuse to our sloth
   and negligence, if so be the grace of God be ready to assist us. For if
   that be offered to us, and always at hand to help us, where men have
   not provoked God to withdraw it; then it is our own fault if we do not
   do our duty, and if we fall short of eternal happiness. For we are
   really able to do all that which God's grace and assistance is ready to
   enable us to do. St. Paul reckons upon the strength of Christ as in
   some sense his power. "I am able to do all things through Christ
   strengthening me."

   V. And lastly, The consideration of our own impotency is no just ground
   of discouragement to our endeavours, considering the promise of Divine
   grace and assistance. Now that God has entered into a new covenant of
   grace with us, and offers us eternal life upon the conditions of faith,
   and repentance, and sincere obedience, the greater our weakness is, the
   more reason we have to expect his grace and assistance; because we know
   that he deals sincerely with us, and intends to bring us to that
   happiness which he offers to us; and therefore we are assured, that he
   does not command us impossibilities, and seeing we are weak and
   insufficient of ourselves to do what he requires of us, that he is
   ready to afford us his grace to enable us to do it.

SERMON CCIII.

  OF THE FORM AND THE POWER OF GODLINESS.

   Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.-- 2 Tim.
   iii. 5.

   THE apostle in these words distinguishes two things in religion, which
   do not, but ought, always to go together; viz. the show and pretence of
   religion, and the life and power of it. He condemns neither, but blames
   the separating of them. The latter, in deed, cannot be without the
   first; for wherever religion really is, there will be some appearance
   of it: but the former may be, and often is, without the latter. Men may
   make a great show of religion, and yet be very destitute of the power
   of it. And such were those persons the apostle describes here in the
   text; they were guilty of the greatest faults and vices in their lives,
   but thought to cloak ail these by an outward show and appearance of
   godliness. "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof."

   The word mo'rphosis, which is here translated form, signifies the show
   or image of a thing, which is dead and ineffectual: in opposition to
   the reality and life, which is quick and powerful. And, I think, this
   word is but once more used in the New Testament, and much in the same
   sense; viz. for an empty and ineffectual knowledge of religion with out
   the practice of it. (Rom. ii. 17-20, 21.) The apostle there speaks of
   some pharisaical Jews, who gloried in their knowledge of the law, but
   violated it in their practice. "Behold, thou art called a Jew, and
   restest in the law, and hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in
   the law. Thou, therefore, that teaches! another, teachest thou not
   thyself? Thou that preachest, a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"
   So that a form of godliness, signifies an empty show and profession of
   religion, without the real effects of it.

   And they who are destitute of these, are said to deny the power of
   religion. It is usual in several languages to draw metaphors from words
   to actions; and men are said to contradict or deny any thing, when they
   do contrary to what they pretend; and so this phrase is elsewhere used,
   (Tit. i. 16.) "They profess to know God, but in their works they deny
   him." (1 Tim. v. 8.) "If any man provide not for his own, especially
   for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith." The apostle does
   not mean that such an one denies the faith by an express declaration in
   words, but by actions so contradictory to the. Christian faith, as an
   infidel would hardly do. "He hath denied the faith, and is worse than
   an infidel."

   In the handling of these words, I shall do these four things:

   First, Shew wherein a form of godliness consists.

   Secondly, Wherein the power of it lies.

   Thirdly, Give some marks and characters where by we may know when these
   are separated, when the form of godliness is destitute of the power.

   Fourthly, Shew that a mere form of godliness, without the power of it,
   is insignificant to all the great ends and purposes of religion.

   First, To shew wherein a form of godliness doth consist. In general it
   consists in an external show and profession of religion, or of any
   eminent part of it, or of that which is reputed to be so; and a form of
   religion is more or less complete, according to the extent of it. Some
   pitch upon one part of religion, and set themselves chiefly to make a
   show of that; others take in more parts of it, and endeavour to express
   and counterfeit them; so that the forms of religion are various and
   different, and not to be reduced to any fixed and constant standard;
   but they commonly appear in some one or more of these shapes:

   I. An external devotion.

   II. An orthodox profession of the Christian faith.

   III. Enthusiasm and pretence to inspiration.

   IV. A great external show of mortification.

   V. An imperfect repentance and partial reformation.

   VI. The appearance and ostentation of some particular grace and virtue.

   VII. A great zeal for some party, or opinions, or circumstances of
   religion.

   VIII. Silliness and freakishness, and either a pretended or real
   ignorance in the common affairs and concernments of human life.

   IX. Much noise and talk about religion.

   These are the several forms of religion which men are wont to assume.
   Not that these do al ways go singly; but sometimes men put on one,
   sometimes more of them, as may best serve their several turns and
   interests. Nor would I be understood to condemn all these; for several
   of these particulars which I have mentioned are good in themselves, and
   necessary parts of religion; but being destitute of other things
   wherein the life of religion doth consist, they are but a form of
   godliness.

   I. External devotion. This is the most common form of religion, and
   easiest to be assumed, and therefore it is that so many take it up. And
   this is good in itself, and a necessary part of religion: but if there
   be no more than this, it is a mere image and picture of religion,
   abominable to God, and fulsome and odious to discerning men.

   Now this external devotion shews itself more especially these two ways:

   1. In a frequent and diligent use of the means and instruments of
   religion.

   2. In a curious and nice regard to the modes and circumstances of
   performing these.

   1. In a frequent and diligent use of the means and instruments of
   religion; such as prayer, reading, and hearing the word of God, and
   receiving of the blessed sacrament. These are not the life of religion,
   the great end and design of it, but the means and instruments which God
   hath appointed for the begetting and increasing of holiness and virtue
   in us. Many exercise themselves in these with great constancy and
   devotion, pray to God, and read the Bible frequently, go to church
   duly, and hear God's word attentively, and receive the sacrament
   reverently, and behave themselves devoutly in all parts of public
   worship; and yet all this may be but a mere form, and certainly is no
   more, where the great end of all this is neglected, and men do not
   sincerely endeavour to do what God's word directs them to, and what
   they daily pray to God to enable them to do.

   For all these means are in order to some farther effect and design. We
   read and hear the word of God, that we may know his will, and that we
   may do it; that by the precepts and counsels of the Holy Scriptures, we
   may learn and understand our duty; and by the motives and arguments
   which are there offered to us, we may effectually be persuaded to the
   practice of it. We pray to God not only for the forgiveness of our
   sins, but for his grace and assistance, to enable us to mortify and
   subdue them, and to proceed in all virtue and godliness of living. We
   receive the sacrament, to inflame our love to God and our blessed
   Saviour, to excite in us a greater hatred of sin, and to confirm us in
   the purpose and resolution of well-doing. These are the great ends for
   which God hath appointed all these helps and means; and if these ends
   be not obtained, in vain do we worship God; all our religion is but
   mere show and pageantry. We are but like the people God himself
   describes: (Isa. xxix. 13.) "This people draw near me with their mouth,
   and with their lips do they honour me, but have removed their heart far
   from me." And like those (Ezek. xxxiii. 30-32.) who "spake one to
   another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear
   what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord. And they come unto
   thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and
   they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth
   they shew much love, but their heart goeth after covetousness. And lo,
   thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant
   voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but
   they do them not." This is not to worship God, but impudently to
   affront him; and if we take this for religion, we put the grossest
   cheat imaginable upon ourselves. Hear how God challenges the people of
   Israel upon this account: (Jer. vii. 2-4, &c.) "Hear the word of the
   Lord, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the
   Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways
   and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place." This is
   the great end of all religious worship and devotion, the reformation of
   our lives and actions; and if it have not this effect, it is a cheat.
   "Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, the
   temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are these. For if ye
   thoroughly amend your ways, and your doings; if ye thoroughly exe cute
   judgment between a man and his neighbour; if ye oppress not the
   stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in
   this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt: then will I
   cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your
   fathers for ever and ever. Behold, ye trust in lying words that cannot
   profit. Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,
   and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods, whom ye know
   not; and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my
   name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?" What
   greater impudence can there be, than to worship God devoutly, and to
   live wickedly? This is to declare that we mock God under a pretence of
   serving him; or else that we believe that God whom we worship allows
   these abominations, and is pleased with them.

   2. Others make this form of external devotion yet more complete by a
   curious and nice regard to the modes and circumstances of performing
   the duties of religion. They are very punctual and exact in all their
   carriage and gestures, as if they minded nothing else but the outward
   part of religion.

   Not but that great humility and reverence does very well become men in
   their addresses to God; but then we must be sure that this external
   reverence be a signification of the inward and real devotion of our
   minds. For if it be separated from this, it is not devotion, but
   superstition; it is not to "worship God in spirit and in truth," but in
   bodily show and appearance only; not to honour the Divine Majesty, but
   to fawn upon him and flatter him. And where men are very intent upon
   these things, and endeavour to outstrip other people in voluntary
   expressions of outward devotion, it too often happens that such persons
   are destitute of the substance and reality of religion. They are like
   the formal complimenting sort of people in civil conversation, who
   commonly have very little in them, and notwithstanding all their smooth
   outside and appearance, they have neither that solidity nor sincerity
   which is in many a plain ordinary man.

   II. An orthodox profession of the Christian faith. This is another form
   of religion, which the more knowing and inquisitive sort of men are apt
   to take up and rest in. And this is that which in the Jewish religion
   the apostle calls "a form of knowledge, and of the truth in the Lord."

   And this is good as far as it goes. But then it must not rest only in
   the brain, but descend from thence upon the heart and life: otherwise a
   man may have this form of godliness, and yet be a denier of the power
   of it. St. Paul puts this very case, that a man may have the theory and
   knowledge of religion, and yet, if it do not produce the fruits of a
   good life, it is nothing worth: (1 Cor. xii. 2.) "Though I have the
   gift of prophecy, and under stand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and
   though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have no
   charity, I am nothing." And the reason is plain, because the knowledge
   of religion is only in order to the practice of it; and an article or
   proposition of faith is an idle thing, if it do not produce such
   actions as the belief of such a proposition doth require.

   There are many persons in the world very solicitous about an orthodox
   belief, and mightily concerned to know what the Scriptures, but
   especially what the councils and fathers, have declared in such a
   matter; and they are nice and scrupulous in these things, even to the
   utmost punctilios, and will with a most unchristian passion contend for
   the Christian faith: and yet, perhaps, all this while they can allow
   themselves in plain sins, and in the practice of such things as are in
   Scripture as clearly forbidden to be done, as any thing is there
   commanded to be believed. Whereas religion does not consist so much in
   nicety and subtilty of belief, as in integrity and innocency of life;
   and the truest and most orthodox persuasion in matters of religion, is
   but a mere form and image, if it be not accompanied with an answerable
   practice; yea, like the image represented to Nebuchadnezzar in his
   dream, "whose head was of fine gold, but the legs and feet were iron
   and clay."

   Not but that a right belief is of great concernment in religion; but
   then this belief must be prosecuted into the proper and genuine
   consequences of it upon our lives: if it be not, it is unhappy for men
   that they believe so well, when they live so ill. The devils have a
   right faith, St. James tells us; "they believe and tremble." And,
   indeed, none have so much reason to tremble, as those who believe the
   principles of religion, and yet are conscious to themselves that they
   live contrary to them; because of all persons in the world they are the
   most inexcusable.

   III. Another form of religion which many take upon them, is enthusiasm
   and pretence to inspiration. And this is a very glorious form, which is
   apt to dazzle and amuse the ignorant, because they know not what to
   make of it. It seems to be some thing strange and extraordinary, and
   yet it is no thing but what every man that has confidence enough may
   pretend to.

   There is no Christian doubts but that the Spirit of God hath heretofore
   inspired men in an extraordinary manner, and that he may do so again
   when he pleases: but since the great and standing revelation of the
   gospel, we have reason not to be rash in giving heed to such pretences.
   If those who pretend to inspiration declare nothing but what is
   revealed in the gospel already, their inspiration is needless; if they
   declare any thing contrary thereto, we are sufficiently cautioned
   against them; if any thing be sides the revelation of the gospel, but
   not contrary to it, then we are to expect what evidence they bring for
   their inspiration. For God does not inspire men for their own sakes,
   but for the sake of others; and another man's inspiration is nothing to
   me, unless he can satisfy me that he is inspired. For either I must
   believe every one that pretends to inspiration, or those only that can
   make good their pretence. Not every one, for then I yield up myself to
   the mercy of every confident man, to lead me into what delusions he
   pleases. If I believe only those who are able to make good this
   pretence, then am I in no great danger: for nothing less than a miracle
   can give me reasonable assurance of another man's inspiration; and I
   think few or none of our modern enthusiasts have so much as pretended
   to miracles. So that this form of religion is calculated only to impose
   upon the ignorant, but signifies little among the steady and
   considerate sort of people.

   Nay, if this pretence were real, yet it may be no more than a form of
   religion. For the apostle sup poses that men may "have the gift of
   prophecy, and yet want charity, without which they are no thing." And
   our Saviour tells us, that many shall plead at the day of judgment,
   "Have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out devils,
   and in thy name done many wonderful works?" And yet these very persons
   for all this may be workers of iniquity, and such as our Lord will bid
   to depart from him.

   IV. A great external show of mortification.

   This the pharisees of old did much applaud themselves in, they fasted
   twice a week. And this is still a great part of the religion of many in
   the Romish church; they impose strict penalties and corporal severities
   upon themselves; abstain from several sorts of meats and drinks, watch
   and afflict their bodies with several sorts of rigours: whereas one
   severe resolution of a good life well prosecuted, is a thousand times
   better than all this.

   For experience shews us, that men may be very severe to their bodies,
   and yet favourable to their lusts. The pharisees, indeed, fasted often,
   but they were very ravenous in another kind--they devoured widows
   houses. It is possible that men may kill themselves by corporal
   austerities, and yet never mortify one lust; they may submit to a
   thousand penances, and yet never truly repent one sin; they may turn
   pilgrims and go as far as Jerusalem to visit our Saviour's sepulchre,
   and yet never know the power of his death.

   Fasting may be a good instrument of religion, if it be discreetly used;
   and as it may be used, there may be no religion in it. But as for those
   other kinds of severities, they are absurd and superstitious, and taken
   up upon a great mistake of the nature of God; as if he were never
   well-pleased, but when we do something very displeasing to ourselves;
   as if he were extremely delighted in the misery and torment of his
   creatures; and to be cruel and un merciful to ourselves, were the only
   way to move his compassion towards us.

   These are barbarous and heathenish conceits of God; and the absurd
   practices grounded upon them are no where recommended to us in
   Scripture, nor have any example there, but only in Baal's priests, who
   lanced and cut themselves, believing that to be a good way to incline
   their gods to hear them. These are voluntary superstitions, which God
   hath required at no man's hands. And no wise man can doubt, but that he
   that really mortifies his lusts, and subdues his passions, may be a
   good man, though he never whip himself in all his life; and that he
   that lives soberly, and righteously, and godly, may justly be accounted
   religious, without turning vagrant, and rambling idly up and down the
   world. These are such forms of religion as can have no esteem and
   reputation, but in a very superstitious church and age.

   V. An imperfect repentance and partial reformation.

   By an imperfect repentance, I mean a trouble and sorrow for sin,
   without the forsaking of it, and the amendment of our lives; or when,
   if men do reform in some things, they continue in the love and practice
   of other sins. This is not true repentance; for he that hath truly
   repented is heartily troubled for all his offences against God, and
   resolved not to commit the like again; but he that retains any lust,
   and allows himself in the practice of it, is not troubled that he hath
   offended God, but hath left his sins for some other reason. For
   whatever arguments and considerations respecting God will move a man to
   quit any one lust, ought upon the same account to prevail with him to
   abandon all. So that whatever trouble and sorrow a man may pretend for
   his sins, there is no surer sign of an insincere repentance, than if,
   after this, he continue in the habitual practice of any known sin.

   VI. The appearance and ostentation of some particular grace and virtue.

   A man may be moved by the inclination of his nature, or upon some
   interest and design, to the practice of some particular virtue. Some
   are tender and compassionate in their nature, and that excites them to
   charity; others of quiet and easy dispositions, and that makes them
   patient, and meek, and peaceable; others assume one or more virtuous
   qualities out of vain-glory, or to serve some other interest. The
   pharisees were much for giving alms, because this is a piece of
   religion universally applauded and well-spoken of; and therefore,
   though they omitted many other necessary parts of religion, yet they
   were so cunning that they would not be defective in this; not out of
   regard to God, but themselves and their own reputation. For, as our
   Saviour observes, they did their alms with such circumstances of
   vain-glory, as quite blasted the glory of them. "They caused a trumpet
   to be sounded before them in the synagogues, and in the streets, that
   they might be seen of men," and have glory of them.

   Now though the exercise of every grace and virtue be materially a
   substantial part of religion, yet the practice of one virtue with the
   neglect of others, is a shrewd ground of suspicion that it is not
   virtue but design, that it is not religion but interest, which prompts
   men to it. For if it were religion, and done with regard to God, the
   very same reason would oblige them to all other parts of their duty as
   well as that.

   VII. A great zeal for some particular party, or opinions, or
   circumstances of religion.

   This form is frequently assumed, because men find the greatest shelter
   and protection under it. He that declares zealously for a party or
   opinion, and is fierce and eager against those that oppose it, seldom
   fails to gain the reputation f a religious and godly man; because he
   hath the vote of the whole party, and a great number to cry him up. And
   if he be guilty of any miscarriage, unless it be very gross and
   visible, he shall never want those that will apologize for him, and be
   ready to vindicate him at all turns. Either they will not believe what
   is reported of him but impute it to malice, or they will extenuate it,
   and ascribe it to human infirmity; but still they cannot think but that
   he is a religious man, because he is so zealous for that which they
   esteem to be so considerable a part of religion. Nay, such is the
   horrible partiality and injustice of parties, that a very bad man that
   appears zealous for their way, shall easily gain the esteem of a holy
   and religious man, though he have many visible and notorious faults;
   though he be passionate and ill-natured, censorious and uncharitable,
   cruel and oppressive, sordid and covetous; when another who quietly,
   and without any noise and bustle, minds the substantial parts of
   religion, and is truly devout towards God; just, and peaceable, and
   charitable towards men; meek, and humble, and patient, kind and
   friendly even to those that differ from him, shall hardly escape being
   censured for a lukewarm, formal, moral man, destitute of the grace of
   God and of the "power of godliness."

   So, likewise, zeal for or against indifferent circumstances of
   religion, is another "form of godliness," which many appear in. And
   commonly such persons, the more destitute they are of true piety and
   virtue, the greater stir they keep about these things, that they may
   seem to be something in religion; just like those, who, being conscious
   to themselves that they are defective in true and useful learning, that
   they may not seem to be so, are al ways troublesome with the shreds and
   ends of it.

   Now the indifferent circumstances of religion are things which no man
   ought to have the face to trouble himself about, that neglects the
   weighty and substantial duties of it. No man that hath "a beam in his
   own eye," ought to be concerned for "the mote that is in his brother's
   eye." Indeed, he that is careful of the main parts of religion, may and
   ought to be concerned for the other in their due place, so far as the
   order and decency of God's worship, and obedience to authority, and the
   peace of Christians, is concerned in them. But to place all religion in
   a zeal for or against these things, is one of the thinnest and
   slightest forms of religion.

   VIII. Silliness and freakishness, and either a pretended or real
   ignorance in the common affairs and concernments of human life.

   This may seem, at first hearing, to be a very odd form of religion, and
   indeed so it is; yet, in several religions, men have appeared in it
   with great applause and acceptance. Among the Turks, idiots and madmen
   are mightily reverenced, it being always taken for granted that they
   are inspired. And among the papists, the most eminent of their saints,
   if their legends do not belie them, especially St. Francis and St.
   Dominic, are magnified scarcely for any other reason, but for saying
   and doing the most silly and ridiculous things. What can be imagined
   more foolish and fanatical than St. Francis's stripping himself of his
   clothes and running about naked? than his frequent preaching to the
   birds, and beasts, and fishes? Was ever any thing more nauseously
   ridiculous, than his picking up the lice which were beaten off his
   clothes, and putting them in his bosom? which is magnified in him as a
   profound piece of humility; as if nastiness were a Christian grace.
   These, and many more such freaks, which are related in his life as
   instances of his great sanctity, serve to no other purpose, but to
   render religion ridiculous to any man of common sense. As if to be a
   spiritual man and a mere natural were all one; and as if this were a
   good consequence, that a man cannot choose but be very knowing in
   religion, because he is very silly in all other things, and must needs
   have abundance of grace because he hath no wit. It is pity it should be
   so, but I am afraid it is too true, that the greatest mischiefs that
   have been done to the world, have been done by silly well-meaning men.

   Lastly, Great noise and talk about religion.

   This is as empty a form as any of the rest, and yet this does strangely
   please and satisfy a great many. If a man do but mix something of
   religion with all his discourses, and be often speaking of God and
   heavenly things, this passeth for a more than ordinary character of a
   religious man. And many deceive themselves with it; they have talked of
   religion so long, till they believe they have it.

   Not but that this is a good thing, provided it be ordered with
   discretion and humility, and be not forced and affected, impertinent
   and troublesome. But then we must have a great care that other things
   be answerable. Our lives must justify our godly talk, and our actions
   must give weight to our words; for nothing is more odious than a
   religious and good discourse from the mouth of a bad man. This made our
   Saviour so full of indignation against the scribes and pharisees--they
   were not what they appeared to be in their discourse and outward garb.
   They said and did not, therefore he compares them to "whited walls and
   painted sepulchres, that were beautiful indeed without, but within were
   full of all uncleanness and rottenness."

   It is true, indeed, that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
   speaketh:" if religion be with in, it will appear in men's words as
   well as actions; this is a fire that will break out: but the best men
   are very modest, and make little noise, do nothing out of ostentation
   and to be taken notice of, and had rather refrain from good words, than
   to make an unseasonable show of religion.

   Speech is intended to signify the inward sense of men's minds, but it
   does not always do so; men may be full of religious talk, when there is
   nothing of religion in their hearts, nothing answerable in their lives;
   men may speak like angels and yet do like devils.

   Therefore let no man deceive himself, or think to deceive others with
   this appearance of religion: for let men talk never so piously, every
   considerate man knows that there is more of true religion in one good
   action, than in a thousand good words.

   And thus I have done with the first thing: viz. wherein a form of
   religion doth consist.

   Secondly, Wherein the power of godliness doth consist. And, because it
   is very material to be rightly informed in this, I will reduce the
   several particulars to these four general heads:

   I. A due sense of God, and suitable affections towards him.

   II. A sincere and diligent use of the means and instruments of
   religion.

   III. A firm and steady resolution of well-doing.

   IV. As the proper and genuine effect of all these, the practice of a
   good life, in the several parts and instances of it.

   I. A due sense of God, and suitable affections towards him. This is the
   principle and fountain of all religion, from whence all actions of
   piety and goodness do spring.

   Under this I comprehend a lively sense of God's being; which the
   apostle tells us, is fundamentally necessary to all religion: "He that
   cometh to God must believe that he is." This is the great spring of all
   religious motions, and of our dependance upon him, the lively sense
   whereof will make us humble and thankful, and teach us "to acknowledge
   him in all our ways," and to refer all our concernments to him; and of
   our subjection to him, which will make us obedient to his laws, and
   submissive to his pleasure; nothing being more reasonable than that he
   that gave us our lives should have the entire government and disposal
   of them; than that he that made us what we are, should command us what
   we should do. In short, this comprehends faith in God, or a readiness
   to assent to what he reveals, with the fear and the love of God, which
   are the great principles of religion.

   II. A sincere and diligent use of the means and instruments of
   religion, such as prayer, reading, and hearing the word of God, and
   receiving the sacraments. These are the means which God hath appointed
   for the improving of us in holiness and goodness; and we sincerely use
   these means, when we really aim at this end; when we pray, and read,
   and hear, and meditate on God's word, and receive the sacraments, that
   we may truly become better, more holy and virtuous in all manner of
   conversation; and do not rest in the use of these means, as if a man
   were a religious and good man, because he prays often, and every day
   reads the Bible, and goes to all the sermons he can hear of, and takes
   all occasions to receive the sacrament. The life of religion does not
   consist in the bare use of these, but in the real efficacy of them upon
   our lives. It is a very good caution which St. John gives us: "Be not
   deceived, he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is
   righteous," (1 John iii. 7.) Men are apt to impose upon themselves, as
   if they could be righteous, and approve themselves to God, upon some
   other terms, whereas only "they that fear God, and work righteousness,
   are accepted with him."

   I do not speak this to undervalue the exercises of religion, but to
   inform men of the true nature and design of them. Be as diligent as
   thou wilt in the exercises of piety and devotion, but be sincere in the
   use of those means; do not satisfy thyself in the performance of those
   duties, unless thou find the effect of them upon thy heart and life,
   always remembering that "not the hearers of the word, but the doers of
   it are blessed," that the prayer and all "the sacrifices of the wicked
   are an abomination to the Lord."

   III. A firm and steady resolution of well-doing. This is the result of
   a true and sincere repentance, and the great principle of a new life;
   and if it be firm and steadfast, it will derive its influence into all
   our actions; but if it be wavering and inconsistent, it is only the
   occasion of a religious mood and fit, but not the principle of a
   religious state. Therefore it concerns us to strengthen this principle,
   and to be true to it, when we have once taken it up; for whenever we
   quit it, we break loose from God and religion at once, and cast
   ourselves back into a much more dangerous state than we were in before.

   There is no doubt, but that the devil and our own corrupt hearts will
   make many assaults upon such a resolution, and raise all their
   batteries against it, because it is our main fort, and the great
   security of our souls, and so long as we maintain that we are safe; and
   therefore it had need be a mighty resolution that is able to stand out
   against such opposition.

   But what are we that we should take up such a resolution, and what is
   our strength? We are weak and "unsteadfast as water, reeds shaken with
   the wind; we are not sufficient of ourselves, as of ourselves, for any
   thing that is good; the way of man is not in himself, nor is it in man
   that walks to direct his steps:" but we have a greater strength than
   our own to rely upon, and greater than that of any adverse power that
   can set itself against us; we have God on our side, and the assistance
   of his grace to back and fortify these holy resolutions; so that we
   have no reason to despair of success and victory, if we be not wanting
   to ourselves; for "God's grace is sufficient for us; greater is he that
   is in us, than he that is in the world."

   IV. And lastly, Which is the proper and genuine effect of all these,
   the practice of a holy and virtuous life in all the parts and instances
   of it. And unless this effect be produced, we want the surest evidence
   of the former: for it is not credible, that that man hath a due sense
   of God, and pious affections towards him, or does sincerely exercise
   himself in the duties of religion, or is firmly resolved in well-doing,
   who does not shew forth the effects of all this in a good conversation.
   Thus St. James reasons: (chap. iii. 13.) "Who is a wise man, and endued
   with knowledge amongst you?" that is, instructed in the Christian
   knowledge, in the heavenly wisdom; "let him shew forth out of a good
   conversation his works."

   So that herein the power of godliness doth visibly appear, in the
   course of a good life; and it is the very design of the apostle in this
   chapter to declare this to us, as will appear to any one that considers
   the description here given of those persons, who, under a show of
   religion, denied the power of it; they were such as notwithstanding all
   their pretences to godliness, allowed themselves in several vices, and
   lusts, and passions, and were destitute of the virtues of a good life;
   they were selfish, and covetous, and vain-glorious, and proud, evil
   speakers, disobedient to parents, unthankful to their benefactors,
   filthy and impure, treacherous, heady, conceited, sensual, and
   voluptuous; so that, whatever appearance of godliness they made, they
   were almost as bad as could be imagined; there is hardly a fuller
   catalogue of sins to be met with in the Bible: besides, that all these
   vices are such as are plain and evident in the lives of men,

   So that, upon the whole matter, it is very clear wherein the apostle
   mainly places the power of godliness; namely, in the real effects of
   religion, such as are the mortifying our lusts, and subduing of our
   passions, the government of our tongues, and the several virtues of a
   good life.

   1. In the mortifying of our lusts, the lusts of in temperance and
   uncleanness, covetousness, and ambition. He that is a slave to any of
   these, his religion is but a form, how glorious a show soever it may
   make. "Fleshly lusts war against the soul," and will finally ruin it.
   Covetousness and pride are enmity to God. "God resists the proud afar
   off," and "the covetous man the Lord abhors."

   2. In the subduing of our passions, wrath, hatred, malice, envy, and
   revenge. They are the very nature and properties of the devil, and
   dispositions as contrary to God, as light is to darkness; there fore,
   whoever allows himself in these, whatever pretences he makes to
   religion, is really a bad man. This St. John tells us is a plain case:
   (1 John iii. 10.) "Whosoever doeth not righteousness, is not of God,
   neither he that loveth not his brother." (Jam. iii. 14, 15.) "But if ye
   have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not
   against the truth (that is, do not pretend to be religious); this
   wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish."

   3. In the government of our tongues. This is a great effect of
   religion, to "keep our tongues from speaking evil," from backbiting,
   and slandering, and censuring, and reviling, from profane swearing and
   cursing, lewd and filthy talking. When men's tongues run out into these
   disorders, it is a sign that they are not under the government of
   religion, and that the fear of God hath not seized upon their hearts;
   for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." So St.
   James tells us, (chap. i. 26.) "If any man among you seem to be
   religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart,
   this man's religion is vain." And, on the contrary, it is a good sign
   that religion hath some power over men, when it restrains them in this
   kind. So the same apostle tells us, (chap. iii. 2.) "If any man offend
   not in word, the same is a perfect man."

   4. In the several virtues of a good life, in opposition to these and
   all other vices; such as are truth and justice, humility and meekness,
   patience and contentedness with our condition, .peaceableness and
   charity to those that are in want and necessity, a readiness to forgive
   our enemies, and an universal love and kindness to all men. I have not
   time to recommend these particularly to you, the Scripture does it
   frequently and fully, telling us that these are "the will of God," and
   the "Divine nature--the new creature--pure religion and undefiled--the
   wisdom that is from above--the fruits of the Spirit," the proper and
   genuine effects of true piety, the sensible and substantial evidences
   of our love to God, the things wherein "the kingdom of God consists,"
   and that "he that in these things serveth Christ, is accepted of God,
   and approved of men;" but he that neglects these, whatever form of
   godliness he puts on, is a denier of the power of it. "In this the
   children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil, he that
   doth not righteousness is not of God."

   Thus I have done with the second thing I propounded to speak to;
   namely, wherein the power of godliness consists. There are two other
   particulars remaining, which I shall reserve to a farther opportunity.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CCIV.

  OF THE FORM, AND THE POWER OF GODLINESS.

   Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.--2 Tim. iii.
   5.

   THE third thing propounded was, to give some marks, whereby we may know
   when these are separated, when there is a form of religion without the
   power of it.

   I need not insist long upon this, because this will in a good measure
   appear by the account I have given of these two severally, of the form
   of religion, and of the power of it; for he that considers where in
   each of these consists, will easily judge when they are separated. But
   yet, that we may be sure not to mistake in a matter of so great
   concernment, I will instance in two or three gross and palpable
   characters of this, and they are so comprehensive as to contain most of
   the rest.

   I. He hath only "a form of godliness," who minds merely the external
   part of religion, without any in ward sense of it.

   II. He that useth only the means of religion, without regard to the end
   and effect of it.

   III. He that is grossly and knowingly defective in the practice of any
   part of it.

   I. He hath only "a form of godliness," who minds merely the external
   part of religion, without any inward sense of it. He that worships and
   serves God outwardly, but hath no inward reverence and esteem for him,
   who cares not, so the work be done and the duty performed, with what
   heart and affection he does it. This is a mere carcass of religion,
   which is so far from being pleasing to God, that it is intolerably
   offensive to him; for though it be outwardly an honour done to God, yet
   really and in truth it is a contempt of him.

   And yet it is to be feared, that this is a religion which many in the
   world choose and content themselves with. They can serve God an hour
   together, and mention his name a hundred times, without ever thinking
   of him, or being affected with the business they are about: nay, which
   is worse, this is a religion which a great part of the world use and
   cannot help it; I mean all those who serve God in an unknown tongue.
   For how is it possible their minds and hearts can be concerned in a
   service they do not understand? They may possibly have a devout mind in
   general; but they cannot exercise any acts of devotion in the
   particular service they are engaged in. The best of men are apt enough
   to let their thoughts swerve, and go astray from God when they are
   worshipping of him, though they understand the service they are about;
   but when they do not understand, it is impossible their minds and
   thoughts should go along with it and be concerned in what is done. This
   is properly, and in the strict sense of the word mo'rphosis eusebei'as,
   "an image of religion and devotion, without any life or sense." And if
   to have our bodies put in a devout posture, to move our hands, and
   lips, and eyes, without understanding the service we offer to God, may
   be accounted worshipping of him, this is a service that may be
   performed by poppets as well as men. "God is a spirit; and they that
   worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth." "In spirit and
   in truth," in opposition to a mere bodily service, and external show of
   devotion. God, who is a spirit, must be worshipped with our spirits. He
   expects from reasonable creatures a reasonable service; and that
   service only is reasonable, which is dictated by our understandings,
   and accompanied with our hearts and affections: and to worship him
   otherwise, is to offer a sacrifice without a heart; it is to "offer the
   lame and the blind in sacrifice," which would be an affront to our
   governor, much more to "the great King of the world." Whatever we do in
   the service of God, we must "do it heartily as to the Lord," because he
   is "the searcher of hearts, and all things are open and naked to the
   eyes of him with whom we have to do."

   II. He hath only "a form of godliness," that useth only the means of
   religion, without regard to the end and effect of them. A man may
   exercise his understanding in the service of God, and his heart may be
   touched, and his affections moved in prayer, and at the hearing of
   God's word, and the receiving of the sacrament; and yet this may be but
   a form of religion, if it go no farther. If we do not forsake those
   sins we confess to God, and daily beg the pardon of; if we do not truly
   and heartily endeavour that we may live godly, and righteous, and sober
   lives, as well as pray that we may do so; if the counsels and
   directions of God's word have not an influence upon our lives; if we be
   not awed by the threatenings of it to leave our sins, and encouraged by
   the promises of it to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh
   and spirit, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God;" we use the
   means of religion to no purpose, and we discredit the institutions of
   God, because we make no proficiency under them. We are just like the
   disciples of those for mal professors of religion, whom the apostle
   describes after the text, who are "ever learning, but never able to
   come to the knowledge of the truth." It seems they used the means of
   instruction, and continued to use them, they were "ever learning;" but
   all this while they were under the dominion of sin, and the power of
   their lusts; "they were laden with sin, and led away with divers
   lusts," and so they never attained to that which the apostle calls "the
   knowledge of the truth;" that is, such a knowledge of the doctrine of
   Christ, as is accompanied with a suitable practice, according to that
   of our Saviour: (John viii. 31.) "If ye continue in my word," that is,
   if ye practise my doctrine, "then are ye my disciples indeed, and ye
   shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." Then men come
   to the "knowledge of the truth," when it frees them from the slavery of
   sin. If our knowledge have not this effect it signifies nothing, and
   does not deserve the name of knowledge, because we know nothing in
   religion as we ought to know. (1 John ii. 2, 3.) Speaking of the
   knowledge of Christ, "Hereby do we know that we know him, if we keep
   his commandments. He that saith he knows him, and keepeth not his
   commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."

   III. He hath only a form of religion, who is grossly and knowingly
   defective in the practice of any part of it. And this sort of persons
   are those, whom the apostle particularly intended here in the text; for
   such were they whom he describes by this character, that they had "a
   form of godliness, but denied the power of it." Under the garb of
   religion which they had put on, they were grossly faulty in their lives
   and practice, and mainly defective in many of the essential duties of
   Christianity; they were selfish and covetous, vain-glorious, and
   despisers of others, calumniators and slanderers, undutiful to their
   superiors, and unthankful to those that had obliged them, fierce and
   ill-natured, treacherous and false to their word, persecutors of those
   that were good, filthy and sensual; not that every one of them had all
   these vices, they are so many and gross, that no cloak of religion
   could have covered them; but the apostle means, that among those that
   made an empty profession of religion, these vices were visible, some of
   them in one, and some in another. And the living in any one of these,
   or any other of the like nature, is inconsistent with Christianity. The
   power of religion appears chiefly in the subduing of these lusts, and
   in the exercise and practice of those graces and virtues which are
   contrary to these. Here the very heart and life of religion lies, and
   these are the veins in which it runs; and if there be a failure in any
   of these main virtues of a Christian life, it is a plain case, that we
   are destitute of the power of religion, and do only make "a vain and
   empty show of it." St. James instanceth, as one would think, in none of
   the gross est and most considerable of these, the government of our
   tongue; and yet he peremptorily determines, that the want of this
   virtue is enough to destroy all a man's other pretences to religion:
   (chap. i. 26.) "If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth
   not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is
   vain."

   So that, by the practice or neglect of these main virtues of a good
   life, every man may examine and judge himself. This is the rule which
   our Saviour gives to try the religion of men by: (Matt. vii. 16, 17.)
   "Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or
   figs of thistles? even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit;
   but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring
   forth evil fruit; neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
   Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them." The force of which
   reasoning is this: that every tree bringeth forth fruit according to
   its nature, and by the kind and quality of the fruit, you may certainly
   know what the tree is. So by the good or bad action of men's lives, you
   may know by what principle they are governed, whether the fear of God
   or the love of sin bear sway in them: the course of their lives will
   discover the bent and inclination of their minds, whatever show and
   profession they make to the contrary. "By their fruits ye shall know
   them. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, (there is some
   profession of religion) shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he
   that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven;" (there is the
   power of it.)

   I would, by no means, encourage men to be over-censorious toward
   others, there is too much of that spirit already in the world; but it
   is not amiss that men should be strict and severe toward themselves.
   And would to God men would bring themselves to this test, and examine
   the truth and sincerity of their religion, not by the leaves of an
   outward profession, but by the fruits it produceth in their lives.
   Every man that will but take the pains to look into himself, and to
   observe his own actions, may, by comparing the temper of his mind, and
   the general course of his life and practice, with the rules and
   precepts of religion, easily discern what power and efficacy religion
   hath on him. A man may as certainly know himself, and make as sure a
   judgment of his state and condition toward God in this way, "as a tree
   is known by its fruit." Therefore let us not flatter ourselves; for if
   we indulge any lust, or irregular passion in our souls, and do not
   endeavour to mortify and subdue it; if we allow ourselves in any
   vitious practice in our lives, we do but deceive ourselves with an
   opinion of our godliness, and whatever show and appearance we may make
   of religion, we are certainly destitute of the power of it. True
   religion and godliness is an uniform principle, which inclines a man to
   all holiness and goodness, and does bias him against all known sin and
   wickedness. All the motives and arguments of religion, and all
   considerations of piety, are levelled against all sin, and tend to
   engage men to universal holiness of life. Bonum constat ex iutegris
   causis, sed malum ex quolibet defectu: The practice of any one vice is
   enough to render a man a bad man; but there must be the concurrence of
   all the parts of religion and virtue to make a man good.

   I proceed to the fourth thing I propounded, which was to shew, that a
   form of godliness, without the power of it, is insignificant to all the
   great ends and purposes of religion. The great ends that men can
   reasonably propound to themselves in being religious, are these three:

   I. The pleasing of God.

   II. The peace and tranquillity of our own minds.

   III. The saving of our souls. Now a form of godliness, without the
   power of it, is unavailable to all these purposes:

   I. To the pleasing of God. External devotion, and exercising ourselves
   in the means and instruments of religion, and the profession of a right
   belief, or any other form of religion whatsoever, do not recommend any
   man to the Divine favour and acceptance, without the real effects of
   religion in a good life: nay, so far is it from this, that all forms of
   religion, destitute of the life and power of it, are extremely odious
   and offensive to him. Devotion in prayer, without a holy life, is but a
   rude and troublesome noise in the ears of the Almighty. "The prayer of
   the wicked" is so far from being accepted, that it is an "abomination
   to him." He does not love to be invoked by unhallowed mouths, and to be
   praised by the workers of iniquity. Flattery is hateful to a wise man,
   much more to the infinitely wise God. He cannot endure that men should
   lift up eyes to him "that are full of adultery, and hands filled with
   violence and oppression, and tread his courts with feet ready to shed
   blood." It is an affront to God to be worshipped by evil-doers, and to
   see men diligent in reading his word, and attending to his law, who
   break it every day. "Unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to
   declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
   mouth, seeing thou hatest to be reformed, and castest my words behind
   thy back?" What God says of the sacrifices of the Jews, offered to him
   by "a sinful people laden with iniquity," may be applied to the worship
   of Christians, who live wicked and abominable lives: (Isa. i. 11, 12,
   &c.) "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me,
   saith the Lord? I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat
   of fed beasts, and I delight not in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or
   of he-goats. When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this
   at your hands, to tread my courts? Bring no more vain oblations.
   Incense is an abomination unto me: the new-moons and sabbaths, and the
   calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the
   solemn meetings. Your new-moons, and your appointed feasts my soul
   hateth, they are a trouble unto me. I am weary to bear them. And when
   you spread forth your hand, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when
   you make many prayers, I will not hear. Wash you, make you clean, put
   away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil,
   learn to do well." This is that which God expects from us, the
   amendment and reformation of our lives, and without this all our
   religious addresses to him are nauseous and abominable. God does hardly
   any where in Scripture express so great a detestation of the greatest
   sins, as he does of the devotion of wicked men. I will but bring one
   text more to this purpose: (Isa. lxvi. 3.) "He that killeth an ox, is
   as if he slew a man: he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a
   dog's neck: he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's
   blood: he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol." What is the
   reason of all these severe expressions? because they were "the
   sacrifices of the wicked," of those "who had chosen their own ways,"
   and "whose soul delighted in their abominations;" they worshipped God
   according to his will, but lived according to their own; and,
   therefore, they were to him no better than an assembly of murderers,
   and a church of idolatrous worshippers; for this is false worship, to
   offer sacrifices to God, and to devote ourselves to the service of our
   lusts.

   II. Another end of religion is, the peace and tranquillity of our own
   minds. And this is not to be attained upon true and lasting grounds, by
   any form of religion without the power of it. Men may delude themselves
   with some false peace, and make a hard shift to stop the loud and
   vehement clamours of their conscience; but the guilt of any vicious
   course of life will frequently recoil upon them, to disturb and
   interrupt their peace, and to put out their false joy; their
   consciences will ever and anon give them many secret girds and lashes.
   For no man can knowingly live in the practice of any sin, but he must
   be guilty to himself; and whoever is guilty, hath received a secret
   sting into his heart, which is never to be taken out but by repentance,
   and a thorough reformation. God hath said it, and I doubt not but every
   sinner finds it true, "There is no peace to the wicked." Especially
   when such a man is seized upon by sickness, and approaches in his
   thoughts near to eternity, then his drowsy conscience awakes like a
   lion out of sleep, full of rage and fierceness, and all his false peace
   and comfort vanisheth. "For what is the hope of the hypocrite when God
   comes to take away his soul?" It is, as Job elegantly expresses it,
   "like the spider's web," artificially wrought, but miserably weak, it
   can endure no stress, upon the least touch it breaks and vanisheth.

   And this is no small disadvantage which a man that hath only the form
   of religion lies under, that in effect he loseth all the pleasure and
   satisfaction of religion; or if he fancy any hope or comfort to
   himself, it is built upon a false foundation, which, when it is tried,
   will endure no shock. This is the comparison our Saviour useth in this
   very case: (Matt. vii. 26, 27.) "Every one that heareth these sayings
   of mine, and doeth them not (here is a form of godliness without the
   power of it) shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house
   upon the and; and the rain descended, and the floods came f and the
   winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the
   fall of it." But real and substantial religion is like "a house built
   upon a rock." which no tempest can overthrow. "Righteousness," saith
   Solomon, (Prov. x. 25.) "is an everlasting foundation;" it is a
   continual spring of joy and peace. There is a certain unspeakable
   contentment and delight arising from a good conscience, and from the
   sincere discharge of our duty, which a hypocrite is a stranger to, and
   is never admitted to the taste of. Now what an uncomfortable thing is
   this, for a man to take the pains to seem to be religious, and yet to
   lose the real pleasure of religion!

   III. The great end of all, of being religious, is the saving of our
   souls. And this end a mere form of religion will certainly miss of. No
   external garb of religion will gain a man admission into heaven; there
   is no getting in there in masquerade, no prayers will then avail,
   though never so fervent and importunate. "Many shall say in that day,
   Lord, Lord, open un to us;" and yet he will bid them depart from him.
   Though we had heard Christ himself preach, and had received the blessed
   sacrament with him, yet this will not avail. So our Saviour tells us:
   (Luke xiii. 20.) "Then shall they begin to say, We have eaten and
   drunken in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets;" and yet
   he will "say unto them, I know not whence you are." It is not a
   pretence to inspiration, no, though it were justified by miraculous
   gifts, that will then stand us in stead. "Many shall say in that day,
   Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have
   cast out devils, and in thy name have done many wondrous works?" And
   yet these shall be rejected. Why, what should be the reason of all this
   severity? Our Saviour gives us a plain account of it; because they were
   workers of iniquity. Under all these several masks of religion, they
   were wicked in their lives.

   It is not an orthodox faith, and the belief of all the articles of
   Christianity, that will save a man, without the works of a good life:
   (Jam. ii. 14.) "What doth it profit a man, my brethren, though a man
   say that he hath faith, and hath not works? can faith save him? Thou
   believest there is one God; thou doest well;" the devils believe this
   too, but they are not so vain as to hope to be saved by this faith; no,
   they know the contrary, and that makes them fear and tremble. "Know
   then, O vain man, that faith without works is dead." Thou believest "in
   one Lord Jesus Christ, that came down from heaven to save us, that was
   conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, and became man
   that he might bring us to God; that suffered and died for our sins, and
   rose again for our justification, and is ascended into heaven, and
   sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty, and from thence
   he shall come again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the
   dead;" thou doest well to believe this: but if thou do not live
   accordingly, what will become of thee, when the Son of God shall come
   to judge the world? then the great inquiry will be, how we have lived?
   what good we have done? our Saviour represents the proceedings of that
   great day. "I was hungry, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye
   gave me no drink; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison,
   and ye visited me not:" therefore, "depart ye cursed into everlasting
   fire." So that it seems herethe business will stick, upon the good and
   bad actions of men's lives, and accordingly sentence shall be
   pronounced upon them. For "God will render to every man according to
   his works; to them that by patient continuance in well-doing seek for
   glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life: but to those that
   obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,
   tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the
   Jew first, and also of the gentile: but glory, and honour, and peace to
   every man that worketh good; to the Jew first, and also to the
   gentile:" for "not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
   doers of the law shall be justified." Still you see that it is to "the
   patient continuance in well-doing," to "the obeying of the truth," to
   "the working of righteousness," that eternal life is promised: and "the
   wrath of God" is threatened to "them that obey unrighteousness," to
   "every soul of man that doeth evil.--To the Jew first." Why so? Because
   he had great advantage of coming to the knowledge of the truth, which
   is so much the greater aggravation of his wicked life, and makes his
   sentence so much the heavier.

   Indeed, it shall be to men at the day of judgment likewise according to
   their faith, in a certain sense, that is, according to the doctrine of
   the gospel which they profess to believe, according to what our Saviour
   and his apostles have taught, that "the workers of iniquity shall
   depart from him, that without holiness no man shall see the Lord; and
   if we live after the flesh we shall die;" that "no whoremonger, nor
   adulterer, nor covetous, nor unrighteous person, shall have any
   inheritance in the kingdom of God, and of Christ." This we profess to
   believe, and according to these declarations God will proceed with men
   at the great day. And he that believes this, and yet goes on in an
   impiety and wickedness of life, though his faith will not justify him,
   yet God will justify his faith, and make it good, when "he shall judge
   the world in righteousness."

   Thus you see plainly, that "a form of godliness" without the power, is
   insignificant to all the great ends and purposes of religion: nay, he
   that takes up in a form, does not only lose the advantages of religion,
   but he hath two great disadvantages by it.

   I. He hath the trouble of making a show of religion, without the real
   benefit of it.

   II. He incurs a heavier sentence upon this very account.

   But these with the application I shall refer to the next opportunity.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CCV.

  OF THE FORM, AND THE POWER OF GODLINESS.

   Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.--2 Tim. iii.
   5.

   I COME now to shew, that he that takes upon him a form of religion,
   without the power of it, doth not only lose all the considerable
   advantages of religion, but he hath two great disadvantages by it.

   I. He hath the trouble of making a show and appearance of religion,
   without the real benefit of it.

   II. He incurs a heavier sentence upon this account, that he hath a form
   of religion, and yet is destitute of the power of it.

   I. He hath the trouble of making a show and appearance of religion,
   without the real benefits of it. And it is no small trouble to
   personate and act apart well; it requires great art and attention,
   great guard and caution. That which men are prompted to by an inward
   principle, is natural and easy, it is done with pleasure and delight;
   but whatever is artificial and counterfeit, is stiff and forced. Nemo
   fictam personam diu sustinere potest, "No man can dissemble always;"
   one time or other he will be surprised and forget himself, and let his
   mask fall. A form of religion is a dry unpleasant thing, and a
   continual burden to him that assumes it, and the more outwardly strict
   and holy he is, he is the more inwardly guilty; his conscience never
   stings and galls him more, than when he is playing the hypocrite with
   God and men: whereas a truly good man, when he employs himself in acts
   of religion, or justice, or charity, he doth it naturally, and hath a
   mighty satisfaction of mind in the doing of it, and if he were
   permitted to make his own choice, he would not do otherwise; but a
   hypocrite puts a force upon himself all the while, and acts against his
   nature and inclinations, every thing he does in religion goes against
   the grain, and because it is un natural must be uneasy; his outward
   conversation and demeanour is set, and in a frame; he does not move as
   he would, but as he must, and the secret propensions of his nature are
   under a continual restraint.

   He hath indeed one advantage by his artificial garb, that he can more
   securely overreach and defraud others by a show of godliness, while men
   are not aware of his dissimulation. But this commonly does not last
   long, and only serves a man for a few turns: and when it is discovered,
   the man is lost, and nobody will trust him. But suppose he could serve
   himself of religion this way for some consider able time, where is the
   advantage? It amounts to no more than this that the man hath the
   opportunity of being a greater sinner, of making himself more
   miserable, and "treasuring up to himself" more "wrath against the day
   of wrath." So that he pays dear for all this in the end and issue, as
   well as in the way. He spends many a tedious hour in the service of
   God, and the exercise of religion; more it may be than many do, who
   save their souls and get to heaven. For as to the external part of
   religion, a hypocrite must do all that which a truly religious man
   does; he must frequent the church, and make as much show of devotion as
   the best; nay, it may be he pays more, and fasts oftener, and is more
   busy, and keeps a greater stir in the out ward part of religion, than
   the sincere Christian; for being conscious to himself of his own
   hollowness and insincerity in religion, he thinks himself obliged
   outwardly to over-act it in unseasonable and superstitious observances,
   and in all other arts of affected devotion; and when he goes abroad
   into the world, he is forced to lay great restraints upon himself, and
   to be continually gathering his cloak about him, as being afraid lest
   any body should spy what is under it. So much more troublesome it is
   for any man to seem to be religious, than to be so indeed.

   II. A mere form of religion does upon some accounts bring a man under a
   heavier sentence, than if he were utterly profane and irreligious. He
   that makes a show of religion flatters God, but all the while acts and
   designs against him: whereas the profane man deals plainly, and though
   he be a monstrous and unnatural rebel, yet he is a fair and open enemy;
   and the kisses of a false friend are more hateful than the wounds of an
   open enemy. Upon this account it is that our Saviour denounceth so many
   severe woes against the scribes and pharisees, because they were wicked
   under a show of religion. "Woe unto you scribes and pharisees,
   hypocrites:" and when he would set forth the se verity of the lord
   against the evil servant, (Matt. xxiv. 51.) he expresseth it thus: "He
   shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites;
   there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." As if the punishment of
   hypocrites were the rule and standard of the severest punishment. "He
   shall appoint him his portion with the hypocrites."

   I will not deny but that a profane man is a worse example to the world,
   and may do more mischief upon that account: but the hypocrite is more
   mischievous to himself, and of the two more odious to God, and
   sometimes does more prejudice to religion by undermining it, than the
   other does by all his open assaults and batteries. God cannot endure to
   be affronted: but he hates to be mocked. So that, upon this account, it
   is like to go harder with the formal professors of religion, than with
   the open contemners of it.

   And thus I have done with the four things I propounded to speak to from
   these words--wherein a form of godliness does consist; wherein the
   power of it lies; by what marks and characters we may know when these
   are separated; and that a form of religion without the power of it, is
   insignificant to all the great ends and purposes of religion; and not
   only so, but it is greatly to men's disadvantage to assume a form of
   godliness, if they be destitute of the power of it.

   All that now remains is, to draw some inferences from this discourse by
   way of application; and they shall be these three:

   First, To take heed of mistaking the form of religion for the power of
   it.

   Secondly, To take heed of being captivated and seduced by those who
   have only a form of godliness.

   Thirdly, To persuade men to mind the life, and power, and substance of
   religion.

   First, To take heed of mistaking the form of religion for the power of
   it. The papists have almost confined their words religion and religious
   to cloisters and monks; and they make a religious life to consist in
   masses, and Ave-Maries, and Pater-nosters, in the observation of
   canonical hours, and the distinction of meats and habits, in coarse
   clothes, and a dissembled poverty, and several bodily rigours and
   severities. As if, to make a man a religions and good man, it were
   necessary that he should be dressed fantastically, and in a great many
   indifferent things be different from other men. Nay, so far doth this
   superstition prevail, that a great many think that they should hardly
   get to heaven with out it, or that it will be very much for their
   advantage, if they be buried in the habit of a religious man: as if to
   be put in a monk's cowl, would give a man the start of other people at
   the resurrection. But what reason is there that the name and title of
   religion should be appropriated to these usages? Does the Scripture any
   where constitute religion in these things, or confine it to them? Are
   not these voluntary things which God ties no man to? Whence then come
   they to swallow up the name of religion, and to engross it to
   themselves, as if they were the very life and soul of Christianity;
   when the great author of our religion Jesus Christ, and his blessed
   apostles, never spake one word of them? What an abuse of language is
   this, to confine the name of religion to that which is not so much as
   any part of it!

   But the church of Rome is not alone guilty of this; among ourselves it
   is very ordinary to mistake the form of godliness for the power, though
   the mistake is not so gross, as in those particulars I have mentioned.
   How many are there, who talk as if the power of godliness consisted in
   nothing else but a daily task of devotion, in frequent hearing of
   sermons, and a strict observation of the Lord's-day? These are very
   good things; but they are but a form of godliness, and may be, and
   often are, with out the power of it; they are but the means and
   instruments of religion, but not the great end and design of it, that
   consists in the renewing of our natures, and the reformation of our
   lives; in "righteousness and true holiness;" in "mortifying the flesh,
   with the affections and lusts of it," such as are "adultery,
   fornication, hatred, variance, wrath, sedition, envying, murder,
   drunkenness; for they which do such things, cannot inherit the kingdom
   of God;" and in "the fruits of the Spirit," such as are "love, joy,
   peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity, meekness,
   temperance," as the apostle reckons them up, (Gal. v. 22.) These are
   real and sensible effects of religion; and the means of religion, if
   they be sincerely used, do all tend to the begetting and increasing of
   these in us: so that it is a gross mistake to talk of the power of
   religion, without these. Whoever is destitute of these, whatever
   attainments in religion he may pretend to, is got no farther than a
   form of godliness, he is not yet under the power of it. This is the
   first.

   Secondly, Let us be cautioned against being captivated and seduced by
   those, who have only a form of godliness. This is the apostle's
   exhortation here in the text, "From such turn away: for of this sort
   are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women." To the
   same purpose is our Saviour's caution: (Matt. vii. 15, 16.) "Be ware of
   false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly
   they are ravening wolves." And that we may know how to avoid them, our
   Saviour bids us to observe their lives, "Ye shall know them by their
   fruits." He does not bid us examine their opinions, and try their
   pretences to inspiration; that is a thing many times above the capacity
   of the ordinary sort of men; but their lives and actions are open to
   every man's view; and though it is possible men may counterfeit even in
   this, yet they seldom do it so exactly, as not to be tray themselves
   some time or other: however, this of all other is the easiest and
   surest rule: "By their fruit ye shall know them."

   Therefore, if any man pretend to any new discoveries in religion,
   beyond what is plainly revealed in Scripture, though he appear in ever
   so sanctimonious a garb, be not moved with this: for the power of
   religion does not consist in any thing now to be discovered; but in
   those things which are clearly contained in the word of God, in the
   precepts and directions, and in the motives and arguments to a good
   life; and whoever lives according to these, is in the best way to
   heaven that any man can put himself into; and he need not trouble
   himself about those new lights and opinions, which in every age appears
   like comets, and glare a while, and draw people to gaze upon them, and
   then vanish. And none are so much to be suspected of a form of
   religion, as those who make frequent changes in it, and wander from one
   party and opinion to another. An outward form and shape is easily
   changed; it is that which a man shifts and puts off at pleasure.

   Thirdly, To persuade men to mind the power, and life, and substance of
   religion. It was the commendation of Socrates, the best of
   philosophers, that he did philosophiam de cælo deducere, "bring down
   philosophy from heaven to earth;" that is, from contemplation to
   practice, and from being an art of talking and disputing to be an art
   of living. This I desire may be the aim of all my discourses, to
   instruct men in religion in order to the practice of it, to teach men
   to know God, in St. John's sense: (1 John ii. 3.) "Hereby we know that
   we know him, if we keep his commandments." This is the great end and
   scope, to which all discourses of religion ought to be levelled. It was
   a good saying of Pacuvius, Ego odi homines ignava opera et philosophos
   sententia: "I hate men that are inactive in their lives, and
   philosophers in their opinions." Christianity is the best philosophy,
   and the most perfect institution of life that ever the world was
   acquainted withal; and therefore it is much more odious to see men
   Christians in their profession, and faulty and vicious in their lives;
   because the very design of the Christian religion, is to give men a
   perfect and plain law and rule of life, and to enforce this law by the
   most powerful and prevailing arguments. So that as Tully says,
   concerning the philosopher who lived but a bad life, that he was
   utterly inexcusable, Quod in eo cujus magister esse vult labiter, artem
   vitæ professus, delinquit in vita: "Because he failed in that wherein
   he pretended to be a master, and while he professed to have an art of
   living better than other men, he offended and miscarried in his life.;
   All defects in the practice, and in the virtues of a good life, may
   with much more reason and justice be upbraided to Christians, to those
   "who have learned Christ, who have heard him, and been taught by him,
   as the truth is in Jesus;" to those who are blessed with the clearest
   and most perfect revelation which ever God made to the world, the
   holiest and most reasonable religion, which furnisheth us with the best
   counsels and directions, the most prevalent motives and arguments, and
   the greatest helps and advantages to a good life; a religion plain and
   simple, that hath less of outward form and pomp, and more of substance
   and reality, than any religion that ever was known in the world.

   What a sad thing is it, that a religion so wholly fitted and calculated
   to the design and purpose of a good life, armed with such powerful
   considerations to engage men thereto, should yet have so little force
   and power upon the lives of men, as we see it generally to have! As if
   "the grace of God had never appeared to men, to teach them to deny
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, and righteously,
   and godly, in this present world."

   There was hardly ever any age, wherein the form of religion did more
   abound; and it is to be feared, that there was never less of the power
   and efficacy of it.

   I will instance in two great defects in the lives and practice of
   Christians, which are visible to every one, but are sad indications how
   little the power of religion prevails among men; I mean the want of
   common honesty and integrity among men, and the want of peace and love;
   the first of which is, the great virtue of civil conversation; and the
   other, the great bond both of civil and ecclesiastical societies. These
   are two great duties of religion frequently mentioned, and strictly
   charged upon the consciences of men in Scripture: and yet how rare is
   the practice of them in the lives of Christians? These are two main
   defects in religion, and a plain demonstration of a form of religion,
   without the power of it.

   I. The want of common honesty and integrity among men. So, indeed, it
   used to be called common honesty; but it grows so rare now that it is
   like to lose that name. "Righteousness, truth, and faithfulness, are
   almost failed from among; the children of men;" all ranks of men have
   corrupted themselves in this kind; this is grown almost an universal
   depravation, there is hardly any trade or profession which hath not
   something of knavery and falsehood woven into the very mystery of it,
   and is become almost a necessary part of it. Where is the generous
   honesty and uprightness which did heretofore possess the spirits of
   men, and which is an inseparable companion of true courage? But we are
   now passing apace into foreign manners and vices, and any form of
   religion will serve, when justice and integrity are gone.

   II. The want of peace and love. How full of factions and divisions are
   we? And these managed with all imaginable heat and animosity one to
   ward another; as if the badge of Christianity were changed, and our
   Saviour had said, "Hereby shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
   if ye hate one another."

   All the differences among Christians, of what denomination soever, are
   sadly to be lamented; but I almost despair as to the difference between
   us and the church of Rome, because the reconciliation is impossible,
   unless they renounce their principles. They cannot come over to us,
   because they think they are infallible; and we cannot pass over to
   them, because we know they are deceived; so that there is "a great gulf
   between us and them." We must not only renounce the Scriptures, but our
   reason and our senses, to be of their mind. We cannot communicate with
   them in the sacrament, because they have taken away one half of it,
   which is as plainly instituted and commanded as the other part which is
   left. We cannot worship the Virgin Mary, and the saints, much less
   their images, because it is written, "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
   God, and him only shalt thou serve. Thou shalt not make to thyself any
   graven image, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or
   in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth; thou shalt not
   bow down to them, nor worship them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous
   God." In short, several of their articles of faith are such, as no
   credulity can swallow; and several parts of their worship are such, as
   no piety can join with.

   But this we bewail, that those who agree in the same essentials of
   faith and worship, should be so forward to divide and separate from one
   another, merely upon forms of government, and circumstances of worship.
   What can justify the breach of communion and peace upon such terms?
   Either church government is of Divine right, or it is not. If it be,
   why do not men submit to the form which is established by authority? If
   it be not, what kind of government can contend for that right, with any
   equality of advantage, against that which cannot be denied to have
   almost universally obtained in most ages and parts of the Christian
   world?

   As for the circumstances of worship, there is scarce any man hath the
   face to contend, that any of those used in our church are clearly
   condemned by the word of God; and what else can make them unlawful? One
   of the chief causes of separation, is a form of prayer; the lawfulness
   of which our Saviour hath abundantly justified, and I do not think was
   ever questioned by any writer in the Christian church, for near upon
   sixteen hundred years; and is it worth while to break the peace of the
   church, and violate one of the greatest precepts of Christianity, upon
   little and slight pretences of unlawfulness and doubtful reasons of
   convenience and expedience; and about such things as are no more
   reasonable grounds of quarrels among Christians, than the differences
   of men's stature and faces would be a just ground for mankind to make
   war upon one another?

   Where is the power of religion, when the peace and unity of Christians
   is violated upon these terms? It is a sign that the life and substance
   of religion is little regarded by us, when men can afford to employ so
   much zeal about these things.

   And that men may be effectually persuaded to mind the substance of
   religion more, let me desire them to imprint these three considerations
   upon their minds:

   I. That the parts of religion are subordinate to one another, and are
   to be minded each in their due place. The means of religion are less
   worth than the end, and therefore deserves our regard chiefly in order
   to that. The circumstances of religion are less considerable than the
   means and instruments of it, and therefore are to be subordinated to
   them. Faith is in order to the practice of a good life, and signifies
   nothing, unless it produces that. So that the issue and upshot of all
   is a holy and virtuous life: "To deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,
   and to live soberly, and righteously, and godly, in this present world;
   to love God and our neighbour;" to deal justly, and to be kind, and
   peaceable, and charitable towards all men.

   II. Consider that religion consists in an entire and universal
   obedience to the will of God, in a respect to all his commandments, and
   hating every evil way. Here the power of godliness consists in being
   "holy in all manner of conversation."

   III. Consider that religion chiefly respects God and another world. A
   form of religion, if it were artificially contrived, might possibly
   serve to cheat men, and be useful enough to all the interests and
   advantages of this world: but we are to do all things in reference to
   God, who cannot be imposed upon with shows and pretences; and with
   regard to another world, where no form of religion will be current,
   without the power of it. Yea, and in reference to this world, if there
   be any advantage in seeming religious, certainly the best way to seem
   to be so, is to be so indeed.

SERMON CCVI.

  OF THE NECESSITY OF GOOD WORKS.

   This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm
   constantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to
   maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto
   men.--Tit. iii. 8.

   THIS Epistle of St. Paul to Titus, whom he had made bishop of Crete,
   contains directions how he ought to demean himself in that great
   charge.

   1, By appointing in every city bishops or elders, to teach and govern
   those that were already, or should afterwards by their means be
   converted to the faith of Christ; and to be very careful to make choice
   of worthy and fit persons into this high office; men of sound doctrine,
   and unblameable lives, (chap. i. from ver. 5. to the end.)

   2. By his own doctrine and conversation among them. And this is the
   subject of the two following chapters, in which he gives him a strict
   charge, to be very careful both of his doctrine and his life. Of his
   doctrine, that it be according to the soundness and purity of the
   gospel; not such corrupt and adulterate stuff, as the false apostles
   and teachers were wont to vend among them: (chap. ii. 1.) "But speak
   thou the things which become sound doctrine;" which he elsewhere calls
   "the doctrine of truth which is according to godliness," such a
   doctrine as tends to reform the lives of men, to make them better, and
   more like to God. And then he should be careful, likewise, that his
   life and conversation be exemplary in all virtue and goodness; without
   which the best words will be of little weight, and the wisest doctrines
   and counsels of small efficacy and force to persuade others to the
   practice of them, (ver 7.) "In all things shewing thyself a pat tern of
   good works." When sound doctrine is seconded by the good life of he
   teacher, it must have great authority and force of persuasion, (ver.
   15.) "These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority;
   let no man despise thee." If the minister of God do but so preach and
   so live, this will give him authority, and set him above contempt; let
   men despise such an one if they can.

   More particularly, as he would have him instruct men, in general, in
   all the virtues of a good life; so more especially, the several ages
   and conditions of men in the duties and virtues respectively belonging
   to them; to young and old, men and women.

   And because great scandal had been brought upon the Christian religion,
   by the undutiful carriage of servants and subjects towards their
   masters and magistrates, upon a false notion of Christian liberty,
   advanced and propagated by the false apostles and Gnostic libertines,
   he gives Titus, in particular, charge, to put Christians in mind of
   their duty in this particular, and to inculcate it earnestly upon them,
   that the Christian religion might not be slandered upon this account:
   (chap. ii. 9, 10.) "Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters,
   &c. that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things."
   (Chap. iii. 1.) "Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and
   powers, and to be ready to every good work;" that is, in short, to
   endeavour to be good in all relations, and in all sorts and kinds of
   goodness.

   And then (ver. 8.) he lays great stress and weight upon this matter,
   that Christians should constantly and upon all occasions be taught the
   great necessity of the virtues of a good life. "This is a faithful
   saying," &c. By which solemn and vehement kind of expression, the
   apostle seems to insinuate, that the false apostles did exalt the
   virtue of faith, to the prejudice and neglect of a good life; as if, by
   a mere speculative belief and profession of the Christian religion, men
   were discharged and released from the practice of all virtue and
   goodness. And this is very probable, because we find these kinds of
   licentious doctrines very frequently reflected on, and reproved by the
   apostles in their epistles, and especially by St. Paul. The false
   apostles made the Christian religion a matter of mere speculation and
   dispute, but laid no weight upon the virtues of a good life. And
   therefore St. Paul, after he had charged Titus to inculcate upon
   Christians the necessity of good works, immediately adds, "But avoid
   foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings
   about the law: for they are unprofitable and vain;" intimating that the
   false apostles, instead of pressing the necessity of a good life, did
   amuse people with these idle notions and disputes.

   But to return to my text, "This is a faithful saying." This kind of
   preface the apostle useth several times, but always when he is speaking
   of something that is of great weight and concernment to us, and which
   deserves our serious attention and regard; as in 1 Tim. i. 15. "This is
   a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ
   came into the world to save sinners." (1 Tim. iv. 8.) "Godliness is
   profitable unto all things; having the promise of the life that now is,
   and of that which is to come. This is a faithful saying." And (2 Tim.
   ii. 11, 12.) "This is a faithful saying; if we be dead with him, we
   shall also live with him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with him;
   if we deny him, he also will deny us." And so likewise here in the
   text, "This is a faithful saying, that they which have believed in God,
   should be careful to maintain good works." By which you see, that it is
   not a form which the apostle useth of course, and applies to any thing,
   but only to things of more than ordinary consideration and regard, such
   as are of the essence of Christianity, and fundamental to the belief
   and practice of it.

   "This is a faithful saying," pisto's lo'gos, "a credible saying," that
   which every man that truly understands the nature and design of
   religion will readily assent to.

   "And this I will that thou affirm constantly." He chargeth him to
   preach this upon all occasions, lest the doctrine of justification, by
   faith and by grace, without any works of righteousness proceeding,
   should be turned into licentiousness, as it had been by some, and men
   should falsely conclude, that because works of righteousness were not
   necessary before justification, and to bring men into that state, they
   were not necessary neither afterwards to our continuance in that state.

   The apostle, indeed, did teach that "God did justify the ungodly," by
   the grace of the gospel, and faith in Christ; that is, that those who
   did sincerely believe and embrace the gospel, though they had been
   never so great sinners before, were justified upon that faith; that is,
   all their former sins were forgiven, and they were received into the
   favour of God. But though works of righteousness were not necessary
   before their justification, yet they are necessary afterwards, because
   the faith of the gospel, and the embracing of Christianity, doth imply
   a stipulation and engagement on our part, to live according to the laws
   and rules of the gospel, which do strictly enjoin all kinds of virtue
   and goodness. The covenant of baptism, by which we are entered into
   Christianity, doth contain on our part not only a profession of faith
   in Christ, but a solemn promise "to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,
   and to live soberly, and righteously, and godly, in this present
   world." So that it is the greatest mistake in the world to think, that
   because we are justified by faith and the profession of Christianity
   without works of righteousness, therefore we are under no obligation to
   a good life: for faith in Christ, and the sincere profession of the
   Christian religion doth imply a good life, and an engagement to the
   practice of all virtue and goodness, which, if we do not perform and
   make good, we fail in our part of the covenant, and thereby forfeit all
   the blessings and benefits promised therein on God's part.

   Therefore it is observable, that the apostle, after he had spoken of
   our justification by grace without works of righteousness, gives this
   charge to Titus, to press the necessity of good works upon those who
   did believe and embrace the profession of the gospel, as it were on
   purpose to prevent all mistake and abuse of the doctrine of
   justification by faith, and the free grace and mercy of God in Jesus
   Christ: (ver. 5-7.) "Not by works of righteousness which we have done;
   but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration,
   and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly
   through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that is, by our solemn profession of
   Christianity at our baptism; "that, being justified by his grace, we
   should be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life." And then
   he adds, (ver. 8.) "This is a faithful saying, and these things I will
   that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
   be careful to maintain good works;" that is, that they who are thus
   justified by the faith of the gospel, should be so far from thinking
   themselves hereby excused from good works, that they should, upon this
   account, be more careful to maintain and practice them, because, by the
   very profession of the Christian faith and religion, they have solemnly
   engaged themselves so to do.

   That they which believe in God; that is, who have taken upon them the
   profession of Christianity in their baptism. For it is not improbable,
   that the apostle, having spoken of baptism just before, may, by this
   phrase of believing "in God," refer to that profession of faith made in
   baptism, which began with these words: "I believe in God;" and then
   "they which have believed in God," are those who in baptism have made a
   solemn profession of Christianity: as if he had said, "these things I
   will that thou affirm constantly," that all that profess themselves
   Christians "be careful to maintain good works." Or if by the phrase of
   believing "in God," we will understand an assent to all Divine
   revelations, more especially that of the gospel and the Christian
   religion, the most perfect that ever God made of his will to mankind,
   the matter will come much to the same issue.

   "Be careful to maintain good works." This phrase seems, in the latter
   end of this Epistle, to be used in a very restrained sense; for
   labouring in a honest calling: (ver. 14.) "Let ours also learn to
   maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful."
   In the margin of your Bibles you will find it rendered, "to profess
   honest trades." "Let ours also learn to profess honest trades for
   necessary uses;" that is, for the supply of their necessities: but in
   the text it seems more agreeable to the scope of the apostle's
   discourse, to render the phrase of maintaining good works, for the
   practice of all Christian virtues, especially those which are most
   useful and beneficial to human society; among which, diligence and
   industry in a honest calling is none of the least considerable, because
   it follows, "these things are good and profit able unto men." And,
   indeed, these are properly works of goodness, which redound to the
   public benefit and advantage.

   But good works may well be taken in a larger sense for all sorts of
   virtuous actions. And so it is certainly used several times in this
   Epistle: (chap. i. 16.) "Unto every good work reprobate," speaking of
   all profligate persons who were lost to all virtue and goodness. (Chap.
   ii. 7.) "In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works;" that
   is, an example of all kind of virtue. And (chap. iii. 1.) "Put them in
   mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates,
   and to be ready to every good work;" that is, to the practice of all
   goodness, of whatsoever is honest and virtuous in itself, amiable and
   commendable in the sight of others, useful and beneficial to any.

   Having thus explained the words, I come now to consider the two points
   contained in them.

   First, The certain truth and credibility of this saying or proposition,
   that they which have believed in God, ought to be careful to maintain
   good works. "This is a faithful saying;" that is, a most evident and
   credible truth. And,

   Secondly, The great fitness and necessity of inculcating this upon all
   Christians, that the Christian religion doth indispensably require the
   virtues of a good life. "These things I will that thou affirm
   constantly," &c. I begin with the

   First of these points, viz. The certain truth and evident credibility
   of this saying or proposition, that "they which have believed in God,
   should be careful to maintain good works." "This is a faithful saying,
   pisto's lo'gos, a saying worthy of credit, a most certain and credible
   truth/ And it will appear to be so, whether we consider the great end
   and design of religion in general, or of the Christian religion in
   particular.

   I. If we consider the great end and design of religion in general,
   which is to make us happy, by possessing our minds with the belief of a
   God, and those other principles which have a necessary connexion with
   that belief; and by obliging us to the obedience and practice of his
   laws.

   1. By possessing our minds with the belief of God, and of those other
   principles which have a necessary connexion with it. Such are the
   belief of the Divine perfections, of the infinite goodness, and wisdom,
   and power, and truth, and justice, and purity of the Divine nature; a
   firm persuasion of his providence, that he governs and administers the
   affairs of the world, and takes notice of the actions of men, and will
   call them to an account for them; of the immortality of our souls, and
   their endless duration after death, and consequently of the eternal
   rewards and punishments of another life. These are the great principles
   of natural religion, which mankind are in some measure possessed with,
   and persuaded of, without any external revelation from God; and these
   are necessary and fundamental to religion, as the apostle to the
   Hebrews declares: (Heb. xi. 6.) "Without faith it is impossible to
   please God;" that is, there can be ho such thing as the practice of
   religion, without the belief of the principles of it; and what these
   are he tells us in the next words: "He that cometh to God, must believe
   that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek
   him."

   But then we must not rest here, in the belief of a God and the
   principles of religion; for this faith is not required of us for
   itself, but in order to some farther end, which if it be not attained
   by us, the mere belief of the principles of religion is to no purpose,
   neither acceptable to God, nor useful and beneficial to ourselves. God
   would not have imprinted the notion of himself upon our nature, he
   would not have discovered himself to us, nor have required of us the
   belief of his being and providence, merely that we might know there is
   such a being as God in the world, who made us and governs us; but that
   this belief might have its proper influence upon us, to oblige us to
   the obedience of his laws, which are the proper causes and means of our
   happiness. It will not avail us at all, nor is it in the least
   acceptable to God, for men "to profess that they know him," when "in
   works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every
   good work reprobate," as the apostle describes some, (chap. i. 16.) And
   therefore,

   2. The great end and design of religion is, that our minds being
   possessed and prepared by the principles of religion, the belief of
   these should have its proper influence upon us, which is effectually to
   oblige us to the obedience and practice of God's laws. Now the laws
   which God hath given us to live by, as they are the rule and measure of
   our duty, by the performance whereof only we can hope to gain the
   favour of God, so they are the proper directions and means in order to
   our happiness; they teach us both the conditions of our happiness, and
   the proper qualification and disposition for it.

   Obedience to the laws of God is the condition of our happiness, both
   temporal and eternal, both in this world and the other. The promises
   which God hath made of temporal felicity and blessings, are upon
   condition of our obedience to his laws; it is godliness only that hath
   the promise of this life as well as the other. (1 Tim. iv. 8.) A truth
   so certain and evident, that the apostle thought fit to add that solemn
   seal to it which he prefaceth to the saying in the text, "This is a
   faithful saying." And though God be pleased, out of his excessive
   goodness, to bestow many temporal blessings and favours upon very bad
   men, that by this goodness of his he might lead them to repentance; yet
   God never made any promise of temporal blessings to wicked men; but, on
   the contrary, hath threatened them with great temporal evils and
   calamities; but all the promises, even of temporal good things, are
   made to the obeying of God's laws; "to them that keep his covenant, and
   remember his commandments to do them."

   And this is not only the condition upon which the promises of temporal
   blessings are suspended, but generally, and for the most part, the
   natural cause and means of those blessings; for there is no moral duty
   enjoined by God, no virtue, the practice whereof he requires from us,
   which does not naturally tend to our temporal felicity in this world;
   as temperance and chastity to that invaluable blessing of health, and
   to the preservation of our estate, which is wasted by lewd and riotous
   living; humility and meekness to our quiet and safety; justice and
   integrity to our reputation and honour, one of the chief instruments of
   temporal prosperity and success. Kindness and charity, and a readiness
   to do good to all men as we have opportunity, are in their nature apt
   to recommend us exceedingly to the love and esteem of all men, and to
   their favour able regard and assistance, when we stand in need of it.
   And so, I might instance in all other virtues, the sincere practice
   whereof, though it be not in all cases certain and infallible, yet it
   is the best and wisest course that any man can take, to attain the
   greatest happiness which this world can afford, and to avoid the
   greatest miseries and calamities of it: as, on the contrary, there is
   no vice, no wicked practice, but is naturally productive of some great
   temporal mischief and inconvenience.

   And then the practice of virtue and goodness, as it is the absolute and
   indispensable condition of our future happiness in another world, so is
   it the necessary and only proper qualification for it, and the certain
   and infallible means of attaining it.

   It is an absolute and indispensable condition of attaining it; and,
   without this, it is in vain to hope for it. As God will certainly
   punish the transgressors of his laws, so nothing but obedience to them
   can pretend to his rewards. This God hath most expressly declared, that
   without purity and holiness, no man shall see him; that Christ is the
   author of eternal salvation only to them that obey him. And if God had
   not declared this in his word, the consideration of God's essential
   holiness and justice would sufficiently assure us of it.

   But, besides this, in the very nature and reason of the thing, holiness
   and goodness is the necessary and only proper qualification for
   happiness. With out the blessed sight and enjoyment of God we cannot be
   happy, and holiness and goodness can only qualify us for this: for
   happiness is a state which results from a temper and disposition of
   mind suited to it; and where this is wanting, the man is no more
   capable of happiness, than he that is sick is of ease. Virtue and
   goodness are so essential to happiness, that where these are not there
   is no capacity of it. These make us like to God, who is the fountain
   and pattern of all happiness; and if we be not like to God, we can have
   no enjoyment of him; and a wicked man, if he could steal into heaven,
   into the sight and presence of God, would, from the temper and
   disposition of his own mind, so unsuitable to that holy place and
   company, be extremely miserable, even in the mansions of the blessed.
   Such a temper of mind, such a polluted and guilty conscience, as a
   sinner carries with him out of this world, will accompany him, and
   remain with him in the other; and guilt is always restless and full of
   torment; and though God should not punish it with any positive
   infliction of pain, would of its own nature make a man for ever
   miserable. So that it is a vain dream and imagination, that any man,
   without the practice of holiness and virtue in this life, can be happy
   in the other. A sincere and thorough repentance of all our sins will,
   indeed, clear our consciences of guilt, and by the mercy of God, make
   us capable of happiness: but it does this by changing our minds, and,
   reconciling them to holiness and goodness, in firm purpose and
   resolution of a new life; and by changing our lives and actions too, if
   there be opportunity for it; but till this change be wrought, either in
   firm purpose, or in real effect, it is impossible we should be happy;
   and though I will not deny but this may be done by a deep repentance,
   and such as God sees would prove sincere, in the last act of our lives:
   yet it is extreme madness to run such a hazard, because we may be cut
   off from the opportunity of it; or, if God should afford us time and
   grace to that purpose, it is the hardest thing in the world to have any
   comfortable and well-grounded assurance of the sincerity of it: so that
   very little hopes of heaven and happiness can be given upon any other
   terms, than the general and constant course of a holy and virtuous
   life; and least of all to those who have, all their life long, resolved
   to venture their everlasting happiness upon the infinite uncertainties
   of a death-bed repentance at the last. But,

   II. The truth of this proposition, that "they which have believed in
   God, should be careful to maintain good works," or that faith and the
   virtues of a good life ought to go together: I say, the truth of this
   will yet be more evident, if we consider the great end and design of
   the Christian religion in particular, which was to reform the world, to
   purify the hearts and lives of men from corrupt affections and wicked
   practices, to teach men to excel in all kinds of virtue and goodness.

   And this is every where in the New Testament most expressly declared.
   The great promise of blessedness is made to the virtues of meekness,
   and patience, and peaceableness, and purity, and righteousness, as our
   Saviour expressly teacheth in that excellent sermon of his upon the
   mount, which is the summary of the Christian religion. (Eph. iv. 17,
   18, &c.) "This, I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye
   henceforth," that is, now that ye have embraced Christianity, "walk not
   as other gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, having the
   understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through
   the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart;
   who, being past feeling, have given themselves over unto
   lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness. "But ye have
   not so learned Christ; if so be that ye have heard him, and have been
   taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: that ye put off, concerning
   the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt, according to
   the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind: and
   that ye put on that new man, which, after God, is created in
   righteousness and true holiness. Wherefore, putting away lying, speak
   every man truth with his neighbour; for we are members of one another.
   Be ye angry and sin not, let not the sun go down upon your wrath;
   neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole, steal no more; but
   rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good,
   that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let no corrupt
   communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the
   use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers; and
   grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day
   of redemption. Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour,
   and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye
   kind one to another," &c. So that you see, that unless there be an
   universal reformation of heart, and life, we have "not so learned
   Christ as the truth is in Jesus:" we do not rightly understand the
   gospel, and the tendency of the Christian religion: (Gal. v. 22-24.)
   "But the fruits of the Spirit," of that spirit which the Christian
   religion endows men withal, "is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
   gentleness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, temperance;" and "they that
   are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts;"
   that is, they that profess themselves Christians are obliged to
   endeavour after all these virtues, and to put off the contrary lusts
   and vices: (Phil. iv. 8.) "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are
   true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,
   whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
   things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any
   praise, think on these things." St. James likewise declares, to the
   same purpose, the genuine effect of Christianity, which he calls the
   knowledge and "wisdom which is from above:" (James iii. 13-17.) "Who is
   a wise man, and endowed with knowledge amongst you? Let him shew out of
   a good conversation his works with meekness and wisdom. But if ye have
   bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not
   against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is
   earthly, sensual, devilish; and the wisdom that is from above, is first
   pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy
   and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy." To which I
   will add but one text more, which is the sum and comprehension of all
   the rest, and it is (chap. ii. of this Epistle to Titus, ver. 11.) "The
   grace of God (so he calls the doctrine of the gospel) the grace of God
   which brings salvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us, that
   denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and
   righteously, and godly in this present world."

   I might proceed particularly to shew, that the whole dispensation and
   doctrine of the gospel, and all the parts of them, are calculated to
   raise and exalt human nature to the highest pitch and perfection of
   virtue and goodness, and effectually to reform the spirits and lives of
   men.

   The dispensation of the gospel, or the Christian religion, consists in
   God's merciful condescension to send his own and only Son in our
   nature, to live among us, and to die for us. The doctrine of the gospel
   consists in the things to be believed; the duties to be practised by
   us; and the arguments and encouragements to the practice of those
   duties. Now I shall briefly shew, that the design of every part, both
   of the dispensation and doctrine of the gospel, is to reform the minds
   and manners of men, and to engage them to the practice of all virtue
   and goodness. And,

   I. For the dispensation of the gospel: by which I mean the gracious
   method which the wisdom of God hath pitched upon for the salvation and
   recovery of mankind, by sending his only-begotten Son into the world in
   our nature, to live among us, and to die for us. So that the principal
   parts of this dispensation are these three:

   1. His incarnation, or appearing in our nature.

   2. His life.

   3. His death and sufferings for us. And I will shew, that the great
   design of all this was to reform mankind and make them better.

   1. For his incarnation. The great design of his coming into the world,
   and appearing in our nature, was this; and this was the reason of the
   name Jesus, given him at his birth, as the angel tells ns: (Matt. i.
   21.) "His name shall be called Jesus, for he shall save his people from
   their sins." (Matt. ix. 13.) He himself tells us, that he came to call
   "sinners to repentance;" that is, to reclaim them to a better and more
   virtuous course of life; and (chap. xviii. 11.) "The Son of man is come
   to save that which was lost;" that is, to recover mankind from a state
   of sin and misery, to a state of holiness and happiness. And St. Peter,
   exhorting the Jews to repentance, useth this argument, that for this
   very end God sent him among them: (Acts iii. 26.) "Unto you first God
   sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his
   iniquity." (Heb. ix. 20.) "But now once in the end of the world he
   hath, appeared to abolish sin;" that is, to destroy both the guilt and
   power of sin. (1 John iii. 5.) "Ye know that he was manifested to take
   away our sins." And (ver. 8.) "For this purpose the Son of God was
   manifested, to destroy the works of the devil."

   2. This likewise was the great design of his life, of his dwelling and
   conversing with us so long, to teach us by his doctrine in all holiness
   and virtue, and to give us the perfect pattern and example of it in his
   life. For his doctrine, I have spoken of that by itself: but, besides
   that, one principal end of his living amongst us, was, that in the
   course of his life, and all the actions of it, he might give us a
   perfect and familiar example of ail holiness and virtue, and therefore
   we are commanded to take him for our great pattern. "Learn of me,
   (saith he) for I am meek and lowly in spirit." (Matt. xi. 29. John
   xiii. 15.) After that great instance of his humility, in washing his
   disciples feet, he adds, "For I have given you an example, that ye
   should do as I have done to you."

   3. This also was the great design of his death and sufferings. So the
   apostles every where teach: (Gal. i. 4.) speaking of Christ, "who gave
   himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil
   world;" that is, that he might rescue us from the vicious customs and
   practices of the world. (1 Pet. i. 18.) "Forasmuch as ye know that ye
   were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from
   your vain conversation; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a
   lamb without blemish and without spot." The death and sufferings of
   Christ did not only make expiation for our sins, but are proposed to us
   as a pattern of mortification to sin, and resurrection to a new life,
   and a most powerful argument thereto. (Rom. vi. 1-3, &c. and 2 Cor. v.
   14, 15.) Speaking of the love of Christ in laying down his life for us;
   "For the love of Christ (saith he) constraineth us, because we thus
   judge; that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died
   for all, that they which live, should not hence forth live unto
   themselves, but unto him which died for them;" from whence he infers,
   (ver. 17.) "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:
   old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new." And,
   (ver. 21.) "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin,
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him;" that is, he
   hath made him, who was without sin, a sacrifice for our sins; which
   should be a strong motive and argument to us, to endeavour after the
   righteousness of God.

   II. As the whole dispensation of the gospel tends to this end, so more
   particularly does the doctrine of the gospel, and every part of it. Now
   the whole doctrine of the gospel may be referred to these three heads:

   1. The things to be believed by us.

   2. The duties to be practised. And,

   3. The arguments and encouragements to the practice of these duties.
   And all these have a most direct and proper tendency to reform mankind,
   and effectually to engage us to the practice of holiness and virtue.

   1. The matters of faith proposed in the gospel have a direct tendency
   to a good life, and immediate influence upon it. All the articles of
   our creed, and whatever the Christian religion proposeth to our belief
   concerning God the Father, the Creator and Governor of all things; and
   concerning Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour; and concerning the Holy
   Spirit of grace; the catholic church; the communion of saints; the
   resurrection of the dead, and everlasting life after death: all and
   each of these are so many arguments and reasons, motives and
   encouragements, to a good life. In general, our hearts are said to be
   "purified by faith," (Acts xv. 9. 1 Tim. i. 5.) Faith is there reckoned
   among the principal sources and fountains of a good life: "The end of
   the commandment (the word is prangeli'as, the end of the gospel
   declaration) is charity, out of a pure heart, and a good conscience,
   and of faith unfeigned." So that a sincere faith is the great principle
   of charity, which is the fulfilling of the law, and comprehends in it
   the duties of both tables. And here I might particularly shew, what
   influence the several articles of the Christian faith have upon the
   practice of holiness and virtue in our lives: but this would be too
   large a field of discourse; and the thing is very plain and obvious to
   every man's consideration; and therefore I shall content myself with
   what I have said in general concerning the influence of faith upon a
   good life.

   2. The duties enjoined by the Christian religion do likewise tend more
   immediately to the same end and design; I mean the laws and precepts of
   the gospel, which are nothing else but so many rules of good life, and
   in the main substance of them are the laws of nature cleared and
   perfected. For Christ came not to destroy the law, which was in force
   before; but to explain and clear it, where, through the corruption and
   degeneracy of mankind, it was grown obscure and doubtful, and to
   perfect it, by superadding some rules and precepts of greater goodness
   and perfection, than seem to have been enjoined by it: as, to abstain
   from all kind of revenge, to love our enemies, and not only to be ready
   to forgive them the greatest injuries they have done us, but to do them
   the greatest good, and even to be perfectly reconciled to them after
   the highest provocations, whenever they are in a meet capacity and
   disposition for it. So that the precepts of the Christian religion are
   a plain and perfect rule of all virtue and goodness, and the best and
   most absolute system of moral philosophy that ever was in the world,
   containing all the rules of virtue and a good life, which are scattered
   and dispersed in the writings of the philosophers, and the wise men of
   all ages, and delivering them to us with greater clearness and
   certainty, in a more simple and un affected manner, with greater
   authority, force, and efficacy upon our minds, than any philosopher and
   lawgiver ever did; teaching us how to worship God in the best manner,
   and most suitable to his nature and perfections; how to demean
   ourselves towards others with all meekness and humility, justice and
   integrity, kindness and charity; and how to govern ourselves and our
   own unruly appetites and passions, and bring them within the bounds of
   reason, much better than any law or institution that ever was in the
   world; and all these duties and virtues strictly commanded and enjoined
   in the name and authority of God, by one evidently empowered and
   commissioned by him, and sent from heaven on purpose to instruct us in
   the nature and practice of them. So that the doctrine of the gospel, in
   respect of the laws and precepts of it, is a plain and perfect rule of
   a good life. And then,

   3. The Christian religion contains the most powerful arguments and
   encouragements to this purpose; and these are the threatenings and
   promises of the gospel.

   (1.) The terrible threatenings of eternal misery and punishments to all
   the workers of iniquity, and wilful and impenitent transgressors of
   these laws. And this is an argument which taketh the safest and surest
   hold upon human nature, and will many times move and affect, when no
   other considerations will work upon us. Many men that could not be
   wrought upon by the love of God and goodness, nor by the hopes of
   everlasting happiness, have been affrighted and reclaimed from an evil
   course by the fear of hell and damnation, and the awe of a judgment to
   come. To think of lying under the terrible wrath and displeasure of
   Almighty God to eternal ages, of being extremely and for ever
   miserable, without intermission, and without end, must needs be a very
   dismal consideration to any man that can think and consider: "For who
   knows the power of God's anger? who can dwell with everlasting
   burnings?" and yet to this horrible danger, to this intolerable misery,
   do all the workers of iniquity, every one that lives in the wilful
   contempt and disobedience of the laws of the gospel, expose themselves,
   and this is as expressly revealed and declared to us, as it is possible
   for words to declare any thing: (Matt. xiii. 40-42.) "So shall it be in
   the end of the world. The Son of man shall send forth his an gels, and
   they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them
   which do iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there
   shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." (Matt. xxv. 41.) There you
   have the very sentence recorded, which shall be pronounced upon sinners
   at the great day: "Then shall the King say to them on his left hand,
   (that is, to the wicked) Depart, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
   prepared for the devil and his an gels." And, (ver. 46.) "These shall
   go into ever lasting punishment." And this is that which St. Paul tells
   us, renders the doctrine of the gospel so powerful for the conversion
   and salvation of sinners: (Rom. i. 16.) "I am not ashamed of the gospel
   of Christ, because it is the power of God to salvation, to every one
   that believeth." And, (ver. 18.) "For the wrath of God is revealed from
   heaven against all un godliness and unrighteousness of men." And,
   (chap. ii. 8, 9.) "To them that obey not the truth, but obey
   unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon
   every soul of man that doeth evil." (Ephes. v. 6.) "Let no man deceive
   you with vain words, for because of these things (viz. the sins he had
   mentioned before) cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
   disobedience." (2 Thess. i. 7-9.) "When the Lord Jesus (speaking of the
   judgment of the great day), shall be revealed from heaven with his
   mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not
   God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
   be punished with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the
   Lord, and from the glory of his power." So that the gospel gives all
   imaginable discouragement to the transgression and disobedience of
   God's laws, by denunciation of the greatest dread and terror that can
   be presented to human nature, enough to make any sensible and
   considerate man willing to do or forbear any thing, to escape so
   horrible a danger, to cut off a foot or hand, or to pluck out an eye,
   not only to restrain nature in any thing, but even to offer violence to
   it, rather than to be cast into hell fire, "where the worm dies not,
   and the fire is not quenched/ as our Saviour expresseth it, (Mark ix.
   48.) This is the first argument from the threatenings. The

   (2.) Second, is from the promises of the gospel, which are full
   encouragement to obedience; and there are three great promises made in
   the gospel to repentance, and the obedience of God's laws.

   1. The promise of pardon and forgiveness.

   2. Of grace and assistance.

   3. Of eternal life and happiness. And these certainly contain all the
   encouragement we can desire; that God will pardon what is past, assist
   us in well doing for the future, and reward our perseverance in it to
   the end with eternal life: and all this is expressly promised to us in
   the gospel.

   1. The pardon and forgiveness of sins past. (Acts xiii. 38, 39.) "Be it
   known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is
   preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe
   are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by
   the law of Moses." And this is a great encouragement to amendment, to
   be fully indemnified from all past sins and transgressions; and this
   promise is made to believing, which includes in it repentance and a
   better course.

   2. The promise of grace and assistance to enable us to all the purposes
   of holiness and obedience. And this our Saviour has most expressly and
   emphatically promised to all that are sincerely resolved to make use of
   it; and that upon the easiest condition that can be, if we do but
   earnestly pray to God for it, telling us that we may, with the same
   confidence and assurance of success, (nay, with much greater) ask this
   of God, as we can any thing that is good of the kindest father upon
   earth, (Luke xi. 9.) And surely, here is a mighty encouragement to
   well-doing, to be assured that God is most ready to afford his grace
   and assistance to us to this purpose, if we heartily beg it of him. So
   that neither the consideration of our own weakness, nor of the power of
   our spiritual enemies, can be any discouragement or just excuse to us
   from doing our duty, since God offers us so freely all the strength
   that we need, and to endow us with an inward principle of well-doing,
   more powerful and effectual to all the purposes of holiness and virtue,
   than any opposition that can be raised against it. So St. John assures
   us, that we have God on our side, and the powerful assistance of his
   Holy Spirit, and therefore are sure of victory in this conflict: (1
   John iv. 4.) "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome;
   because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. If
   the Spirit of God be more powerful than the devil, we are of the
   stronger side; and we have no just cause to complain of our inability
   and weakness to do the will of God, since that strength and assistance,
   which we may have for asking, is to all effects and purposes in our own
   power. And therefore St. Paul made no scruple to call it so, and to
   say, he was able to do all things: "I am able to do all things through
   Christ, which strengthened me."

   3. The promise of eternal life: and this is the great promise of the
   gospel, and the crown of all the rest: (1 John ii. 25.) "This is the
   promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life." And this is a
   reward so great and glorious, and so infinitely be yond the proportion
   of our service and obedience, that nothing can be more encouraging.
   What should not men do "in hopes of eternal life, which God that cannot
   lie hath promised to us?" The expectation of such a reward, so well
   assured to us, is sufficient to encourage us to do our utmost, and to
   strain all our powers for the securing and attaining of it, which we
   cannot do without holiness and obedience of life; for "without holiness
   no man shall see the Lord." So that all the promises of the gospel are
   to encourage and strengthen us in well-doing, "to make us partakers of
   the Divine nature, that we should cleanse ourselves from all
   filthiness, and perfect holiness in the fear of God."

   Thus you see that the whole dispensation of the gospel, and the
   doctrine of it, and every part of them, are all calculated to reform
   the minds and manners of men. This is the great design of the Christian
   religion, and all the parts and powers of it, to clear, and confirm,
   and perfect the natural law, to reinforce the obligation of moral
   duties by severer threatenings and greater promises, and to offer men
   more powerful grace and assistance to the practice of all goodness and
   virtue; and they do not understand the Christian religion, who imagine
   any other end and design of it. There is nothing that our Saviour and
   his apostles do every where more vehemently declare, than that hearing
   and believing the doctrine of Christ signifies nothing, with out the
   real virtues of a good life. "Know, O vain man, that faith without
   works is dead," saith St. James. For men to think that the mere belief
   of the gospel, without the fruits and effects of a good life, will save
   them, is a very fond and vain imagination. And thus much may suffice to
   have been spoken concerning the first point.
